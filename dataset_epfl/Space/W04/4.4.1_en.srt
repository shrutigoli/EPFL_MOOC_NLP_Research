1
00:00:06,113 --> 00:00:08,313
Today we'll talk about rocket propulsion,

2
00:00:08,313 --> 00:00:13,552
and the fundamental equation
about propulsion

3
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:17,006
is the Tsiolkovsky equation,
which you see here,

4
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,319
or which is called also
the "rocket equation."

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,453
It gives you the change
in the velocity, ŒîVs,

6
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:26,236
that you get with a rocket system

7
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:28,316
moving along a straight line.

8
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:31,605
If you have a <i>v_e</i>
for the exhaust velocity

9
00:00:31,605 --> 00:00:33,879
of the gas in the propulsion system,

10
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:37,560
and you have a certain
initial mass and a final mass

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,733
if you look at these drawings here,

12
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:42,836
this is the rocket
at the beginning of the exercise

13
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:47,539
initial mass for the total rocket
plus propellant,

14
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,973
it has an initial velocity, <i>v_i</i>.

15
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:53,890
Sometime in between,

16
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:57,420
after a few seconds
or a few minutes of propulsion,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,746
you have exhausted
some of the propellant in the tank,

18
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,530
and you end up
with final conditions, here,

19
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,774
where you have <i>v final</i>,

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,783
and you have a total mass of <i>m_f</i>.

21
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:12,054
<i>m_f</i>, again, is the total mass;
it's the mass of the rocket,

22
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,443
the dry mass of the rocket.

23
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:16,678
When we say "dry mass"
it's the mass without a propellant,

24
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:18,735
plus the remaining propellant.

25
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:23,436
So between the initial state
and the final state

26
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:26,680
you have used
a certain amount of propellant,

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,438
which is, in fact,
equal to <i>m_i</i> minus <i>m_f</i>,

28
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,823
the total mass initial,
minus the total mass final.

29
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,691
And we consider that <i>v_e</i>,
the exhaust velocity of the gases,

30
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,649
is constant during the whole exercise.

31
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,265
Now this is the Tsiolkovsky equation,
or rocket equation.

32
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:45,320
Remember it for the rest of your days.

33
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,431
Let's derive the Tsiolkovsky equation
from the basic laws of physics,

34
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:56,008
in fact, basically
the second law of Newton.

35
00:01:56,456 --> 00:02:00,493
Let's consider first
our rocket, our spacecraft,

36
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,946
with a propellant tank
and the thruster system static,

37
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:08,803
and we'll try to derive the value
of the force of the thrust

38
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:13,082
in newtons, or in kilograms
we can express it normally in newtons,

39
00:02:13,082 --> 00:02:16,200
but it can be expressed
in kilograms also

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,092
on the basis of the mass rates
of the propellant and the oxidizer

41
00:02:22,092 --> 00:02:24,323
and the ejection velocity.

42
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:28,446
So we have the thrust force, <i>F</i>,

43
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:32,686
equals <i>dp / dt</i>,

44
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,331
<i>d(mv) / dt</i>.

45
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:41,882
In our case, if we have the static case,

46
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:45,215
we only have the ejection of the hot gases

47
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,522
out of the thruster to the right side,

48
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:53,613
so it's going to be equal to <i>·πÅv_e</i>,

49
00:02:54,804 --> 00:03:00,782
and <i>v_e</i> is the ejection velocity
of the gases out of the thruster,

50
00:03:02,564 --> 00:03:07,478
and the <i>·πÅ</i> is basically
the rate of utilization

51
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,545
of the propellants plus the oxidizer.

52
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,175
I put here plus the oxidizer
because obviously,

53
00:03:17,175 --> 00:03:19,822
unlike an airplane with a jet engine

54
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:23,570
where you get the oxygen
from the ambient atmosphere,

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,727
here you need to carry the oxidizer,

56
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:31,133
so <i>·πÅ</i> is <i>dm/dt</i>,

57
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:34,459
the time derivative of the mass,
propellant plus oxidizer.

58
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:39,644
Let's now take our rocket,
moving in space,

59
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,556
with a velocity, <i>V</i>,

60
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,774
and we consider that the rocket
is moving in free space;

61
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:52,807
it's not subject to any acceleration
due to nearby masses;

62
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,893
it has no braking due to any atmosphere.

63
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,462
It's in free space,
absolutely alone in the universe,

64
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:02,200
and all the values
that we have for velocity

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,832
are with respect to inertial frame.

66
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:11,635
So we have <i>V = dV/dt</i>

67
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:19,259
is equal to <i>F</i> divided
by the mass of the spacecraft

68
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,516
plus the tank and the propellant
remaining, at some point.

69
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:28,222
So <i>dV/dt</i>,

70
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:31,458
the time derivative
of the velocity acceleration,

71
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:35,274
is equal to <i>v_e</i>,
on the basis of what we did before,

72
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:38,658
times <i>·πÅ / m</i>.

73
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:44,844
So <i>V</i> is the velocity
of the spacecraft, of the rocket.

74
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:50,239
And, of course, this is
with respect to inertial space.

75
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,552
So if we integrate this expression,

76
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:55,620
we find the Tsiolkovsky equation,

77
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,185
ŒîV = v_e

78
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,711
and the logarithm base e

79
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:09,840
of the ratio of <i>m_i</i> / <i>m_f</i>.

80
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:15,591
This is called Tsiolkovsky
or rocket equation,

81
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:19,904
and we have, of course,
<i>i</i> for initial conditions,

82
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:22,318
and <i>f</i>, final conditions.

83
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:26,174
And this is it, that's it:
Tsiolkovsky, or rocket equation.

84
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:31,503
We are going to introduce a new parameter,

85
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:33,554
which is I_sp

86
00:05:35,082 --> 00:05:36,868
the specific impulse in seconds,

87
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:39,168
and this is what is normally used

88
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:42,742
as a measure of the efficiency
of a thruster system.

89
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:47,253
It's not totally intuitive
that exhaust velocity of the gases

90
00:05:47,253 --> 00:05:51,251
is a measure of the efficiency
of the propulsion system,

91
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:53,370
but I will introduce that parameter,

92
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,453
and you will understand
why we say <i>I_sp</i> is that measure

93
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,173
of the efficiency
of the propulsion system.

94
00:05:58,173 --> 00:06:02,562
In fact, I_sp is the thrust

95
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,190
of the propulsion system in kilograms,

96
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,366
or the thrust in newtons, divided by <i>g</i>,
<i>g</i> being 9.81 m/s¬≤,

97
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:13,162
divided by the rate of utilization
of the propellant,

98
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:15,801
propellant plus oxidizer.

99
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:18,417
So you can understand that if,

100
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:22,268
for a given rate of utilization
of a propellant, in kg/s,

101
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:26,035
you have a higher value of the thrust,

102
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:27,747
you have an efficient system.

103
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:31,186
Or if, for a given thrust,

104
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:34,836
you have a low rate of utilization
propellant plus oxidizer,

105
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:38,546
you can also understand
that you have a highly efficient system.

106
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:44,496
Now let me derive this concept of <i>I_sp</i>

107
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,785
from the <i>v_e</i> that we used before,

108
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:52,294
because what we had before,
of course were the <i>g ‚Ä¢ I_sp = v_e</i>,

109
00:06:53,036 --> 00:07:00,305
so we have <i>g I_sp = v_e</i>.

110
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:10,495
So from this we have <i>I_sp = v_e/g</i>

111
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:14,188
and, again <i>g</i>
is the Earth's gravity acceleration

112
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:17,730
to the surface of the Earth, 9.81 m/s¬≤.

113
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,847
So from what we saw on the previous slide,

114
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:25,471
this is equal to <i>f</i>,
which is, of course, a newton,

115
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:29,489
divided by <i>g</i>, divided by ·πÅ.

116
00:07:31,515 --> 00:07:37,324
So this is the thrust
of the propulsion system in kilograms,

117
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:40,402
because it's the newton divided by <i>g</i>,
which gives you in kilograms,

118
00:07:40,402 --> 00:07:45,197
and this is the rate of utilization
of the propellant plus oxidizer.

119
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,590
This is kilograms,

120
00:07:48,328 --> 00:07:52,565
and this is kilograms per second.

121
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:58,346
So I_sp is going to be in seconds.

122
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:07,689
The relationship between I_sp
in seconds and v_e

123
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:10,863
is going to be a factor 9.81,
or factor 10.

124
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:13,006
If you have an <i>I_sp</i> of 460

125
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:15,612
we'll see later
that this is a pretty large I_sp

126
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:19,483
you get for liquid oxygen,
liquid hydrogen propulsion system,

127
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:22,494
like the Space Shuttle main engines,

128
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:28,845
it will give you
a 4,500 m/s exhaust velocity,

129
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,425
or 4.5 km/s.

130
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:35,195
So we have to remember
this ratio of about 10

131
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,839
between the value of I_sp in seconds

132
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,274
and the exhaust velocity in m/s.

133
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:45,428
Chemical propulsion,
which is, of course, very common.

134
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:48,493
In all the rockets
that we talked about before

135
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:51,925
we have a chemical propulsion
for all of the stages

136
00:08:51,925 --> 00:08:54,277
all the way to orbit insertion.

137
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:58,893
Now you see, for various chemicals,

138
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,020
the value of the specific impulse
in seconds--

139
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,188
In fact, the highest value we get,
with liquid hydrogen as a propellant

140
00:09:10,188 --> 00:09:15,718
and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer

141
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:18,857
will give us about 450
for the specific impulse,

142
00:09:18,857 --> 00:09:25,313
which means that we have
an exhaust velocity of about 4.5 km/s.

143
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:28,894
You see that if you have
other combinations

144
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:34,139
of oxidizer and propellants

145
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:40,156
you have values of <i>I_sp</i>
of the order of 350.

146
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:46,079
If you use kerosene, or hydrazine,
or monomethyl hydrazine,

147
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:52,631
a pretty common value of <i>I_sp</i> is 350,

148
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:56,069
or 3.5 km/s for the exhaust velocity.

149
00:09:56,069 --> 00:09:58,540
If you use a monopropellant hydrazine,

150
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,885
this is a monopropellant,

151
00:10:02,249 --> 00:10:07,893
it's a liquid that in contact
with a catalyzer will produce a gas,

152
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:13,970
and it has a relatively low value
of I_sp of a little below 250.

153
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,312
Now as far as cold gas propulsion
is concerned,

154
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:21,201
you have a rather low value
of the I_sp

155
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:24,214
which means a low efficiency
and solid motor,

156
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:29,477
which is the case for most
of the launchers we talked about before.

157
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:33,489
It has, for the first stage,
the central core,

158
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:38,810
plus solid motor system,
like Ariane 5 has that.

159
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:44,463
Delta IV has that, too, and obviously
the Space Shuttle had this also,

160
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:47,643
and the solid motors were separated
after two minutes,

161
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,361
fell down in the ocean,
and were recovered.

162
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:50,637
In all the other systems

163
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:53,729
the solid propulsion system
is not recovered.

164
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:57,681
But anyway, solid motor gives you
about 280-300 as <i>I_sp</i>

165
00:10:57,681 --> 00:11:02,416
so quite a bit less efficient
than liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen,

166
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,804
which is the best for chemical propulsion.

167
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,209
Well this is an interesting graph,
taken from a very good book

168
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,133
of Arthur Clarke, <i>Ascent to Orbit</i>,

169
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:17,793
which was written
in the late '40s or early '50s,

170
00:11:17,793 --> 00:11:21,917
so quite an old book,
but really very, very well written,

171
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:27,192
about the concept of the use
of the geostationary orbit.

172
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,804
He's the one, Arthur Clarke,
who invented the idea

173
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,800
of the geostationary satellite
for communication.

174
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,764
And also there are
interesting chapters on propulsion.

175
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:41,044
This is a graph of the final velocity,
or the ŒîV,

176
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,439
because the initial velocity is zero,

177
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,710
versus the mass ratio,

178
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,517
which is <i>m_i</i> / <i>m_f</i>

179
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,676
for different values of v_e
or the exhaust velocity of the gases.

180
00:11:58,015 --> 00:12:00,275
And it's really interesting,
because you see

181
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:05,505
that if you want to get
a final velocity of about 10 km/s,

182
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,051
which is about what you want
in low Earth orbit.

183
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:12,887
Of course we know that we need
only about 7.7 or 8 km/s

184
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:16,832
on low Earth orbits,
but you need, in your rocket system,

185
00:12:16,832 --> 00:12:20,914
more than that, because you have losses--
gravitational losses, on one hand,

186
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:25,177
and also drag losses in the atmosphere
as you go towards orbit.

187
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:29,650
So you want to have a capability
of about 10-11 km/s in your rocket.

188
00:12:30,064 --> 00:12:33,150
Now you see that if you have
oxygen or hydrogen,

189
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:37,019
which is a 4.5 km/s exhaust velocity,

190
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,448
and you want about 10-11 final velocity,

191
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,250
you realize that the mass ratio
is going to be about 10,

192
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,304
which is really a very startling number.

193
00:12:48,538 --> 00:12:52,571
Your initial mass divided
by your final mass is a factor 10,

194
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,684
which means that in a rocket system,

195
00:12:54,684 --> 00:12:59,734
whether it's Space Shuttle, or Ariane,
or Delta IV, or Proton or any rocket,

196
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,418
most of the mass at lift-off
is the mass of the propellants.

197
00:13:03,418 --> 00:13:06,928
About 80-90% of the mass
is mass of propellant.

198
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:08,203
So quite an interesting graph,

199
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:13,134
showing the significant amount
of propellant that you need to take

200
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:17,011
at lift-off from the Earth's surface
if you want to go into orbit.

201
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,069
We'll look at the mass
of propellant needed.

202
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:25,948
What interests us, really,
is the value of the mass of the propellant

203
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,051
in order to accomplish a certain ŒîV,

204
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,767
considering a certain value
of the <i>I_sp</i>,

205
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:34,209
or the specific impulse
of the propellant being used.

206
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,087
So we have the Tsiolkovsky equation here.

207
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:41,177
What interests us here in the bottom
is the mass of propellants,

208
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,386
the difference between
the initial mass and the final mass.

209
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,656
Again, let's look at the drawings.

210
00:13:47,017 --> 00:13:51,256
Here we have the initial conditions
with <i>m_i</i> for the total mass,

211
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,763
the dry mass of the rocket plus the tank,

212
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:58,070
plus the propellant,
with a certain v initial.

213
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,489
This is an intermediate situation here.

214
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:04,144
These are the final condition
where we have the spacecraft

215
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:07,770
with a final velocity,
which has obviously increased.

216
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:13,645
After a time, ŒîT, we got ŒîV,

217
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,471
and we have a final mass, <i> m_f</i>,

218
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:19,615
which is the dry mass
of the rocket plus the tank,

219
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:21,951
plus the remaining of the propellant.

220
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,437
So the difference
between <i>m_i</i> and <i>m_f</i>

221
00:14:25,437 --> 00:14:28,247
is the propellant that has been used.

222
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:32,544
Now, what interests us
is really the value of m_p,

223
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:34,145
and let's go up there.

224
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:41,851
And we see here that m_p
is equal to m_i minus m_f

225
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:44,450
times this exponential, which is m_f,

226
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,437
or we can express it here,

227
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:49,547
if we want to express it
in terms of m_f,

228
00:14:49,547 --> 00:14:53,920
this is equal to m_i minus m_f.

229
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,716
So these are two expressions
of the mass of propellant,

230
00:14:56,716 --> 00:15:00,529
depending on the initial mass
and the ŒîV and the I_sp

231
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,846
or the final mass of the ŒîV and I_sp.
