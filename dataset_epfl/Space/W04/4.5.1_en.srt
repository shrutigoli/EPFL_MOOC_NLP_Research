1
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:08,241
Ok, let's look at orbit insertion

2
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,501
with the specific example
of the Space Shuttle

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:14,816
but a lot of what I will say is applicable
also for other launch vehicles.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,982
Now, orbit insertion consists in bringing
a spacecraft to a desired stable orbit

5
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:23,170
after a launch from the Earth's surface,

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,024
When I say stable orbit,
it's a LEO orbit, low Earth orbit.

7
00:00:30,717 --> 00:00:33,711
We won't consider
the case of a direct insertion

8
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:38,704
into a condition where you can go
into interplanetary flight directly

9
00:00:38,704 --> 00:00:41,147
but we always start
by going to a low Earth orbit.

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,371
Let's look at the left hand side.

11
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:49,782
This is a so-called
<i>direct insertion into orbit</i>.

12
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:52,965
You have initial launch at the vertical,

13
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:56,504
and then you have
a trajectory that takes you,

14
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:00,263
after the powered ascent,
represented in red,

15
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:02,876
during which you have
the propulsion system,

16
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:06,844
either one stage or two stage
or three stage propulsion system,

17
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,736
until orbit insertion.

18
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:13,117
In this case you directly go
to a condition where you have

19
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:20,899
a <i>V_circ</i> at the orbit insertion point.

20
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:27,785
Now, you remember that <i>V_circ</i>
equals the square root of <i>µ</i> over <i>r</i>.

21
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:32,967
So, it varies with <i>r</i>, the distance
to the center of the Earth

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,425
as one over the square root of <i>r</i>.

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,071
Now, the disadvantage
of this type of powered ascent

24
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:42,764
is that you have
a pretty long time going up

25
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,800
and you have pretty significant
so-called <i>gravity losses</i>.

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,966
We'll talk about that later
on the next slide.

27
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:51,337
If we look now on the right hand side,

28
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:55,897
this is the type of orbit insertion
that we had with the Shuttle.

29
00:01:55,897 --> 00:02:00,142
We have the launch
at Kennedy Space Center here in blue.

30
00:02:00,142 --> 00:02:04,136
Then we don't stay too long
going to the vertical,

31
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:07,709
but we bend the trajectory
toward the East or toward the Northeast

32
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:11,039
depending on the desired
orbit inclination.

33
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:17,279
At this point here we have
what we call MECO, <i>main engine cutoff</i>.

34
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:23,218
At this point we are on a velocity
which is less than the circular velocity.

35
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:26,116
I would call it <i>V_perigee</i>.

36
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:31,856
We are at the perigee
of an elliptical orbit

37
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:34,672
that will have its apogee
at this point here.

38
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:39,850
The reason is the following:
we want to be relatively low at MECO

39
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,060
because we separate
from the external tank.

40
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,983
We want the external tank to be
still influenced by the atmosphere

41
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:51,518
and after about half an orbit,
to fall down in the Pacific Ocean.

42
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:58,022
If we were higher than,
say, 130 kilometers

43
00:02:58,022 --> 00:03:00,890
there would be too little drag
for the external tank

44
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,522
and we would not really know
where it would fall down

45
00:03:03,522 --> 00:03:09,196
so for the case of the Shuttle, MECO
was selected at relatively low altitude

46
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:12,128
to allow for the tank
to come down after half an orbit

47
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,169
or 45 minutes of free-fall.

48
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:18,788
Now at the apogee,
altitude of about 300 kilometers,

49
00:03:18,788 --> 00:03:22,518
we had what we called the OMS-2 maneuver.

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,804
It's a <i>∆V</i>, posigrade <i>∆V</i>
that will change our orbit,

51
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:31,569
which is blue here, which is
an elliptical orbit

52
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:34,300
into a circular orbit in green,

53
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,333
so posigrade <i>∆V_OMS-2</i>
using the OMS engines

54
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,510
which are internal engines
in the back of the Space Shuttle orbiter

55
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,379
to circularize the trajectory
at 300 kilometers.

56
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,427
If we cannot perform OMS-2
for one reason or another,

57
00:03:48,427 --> 00:03:54,797
we'll come down again to the MECO point
which is in the high atmosphere.

58
00:03:54,797 --> 00:03:57,638
This is very undesirable
so we have to do everything

59
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:00,226
in order to accomplish OMS-2.

60
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:03,565
Never failed
to be accomplished successfully

61
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:06,547
on the 135 Shuttle flights that we had

62
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,937
between '81 and 2011.

63
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:12,204
Let's consider the losses
during ascent to orbit.

64
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,817
We mentioned before the gravity loss.

65
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:17,406
We have also, of course, a drag loss

66
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,964
but let's look at some numbers here.

67
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:22,844
The <i>∆V</i> that we have on the left here

68
00:04:22,844 --> 00:04:27,731
is the velocity that you want
to reach at low Earth orbit.

69
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,694
Desired velocity at LEO,

70
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:40,041
typically it's of the order
of 7.7 kilometers per second.

71
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,735
OK, this is the expression
according to Tsiolkovsky.

72
00:04:46,558 --> 00:04:52,782
This is your vehicle capability with <i>m_i</i>,
the initial mass, and the final mass,

73
00:04:52,782 --> 00:04:56,000
the difference between the two
being the propellant used

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,632
and the <i>I_sp</i>, the efficiency
of specific impulse

75
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,857
of the propulsion system used.

76
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:06,629
Now, this is your capability
of the spaceship

77
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,880
but you are going to have losses.

78
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,430
Here we have the gravity loss,

79
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,794
and here we have the drag loss

80
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:20,130
because you are crossing the atmosphere,
so you have, of course, a drag

81
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,385
during the whole time
you are within the atmosphere.

82
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,074
Now, the idea is really
to shape the trajectory

83
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,265
so that you minimize these losses.

84
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:29,403
You don't want to spend
too much time going up

85
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,303
because the gravity loss is high,

86
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:33,950
but of course you will reduce
the drag loss in this way.

87
00:05:34,556 --> 00:05:37,266
You also don't want to go too fast

88
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:41,253
towards the Easterly direction
or Northeasterly direction,

89
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:44,759
depending on your desired
orbital inclination.

90
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,717
That would reduce,
of course, the gravity loss

91
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:49,747
but it would increase the drag loss.

92
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:56,451
The shaping of the ascent trajectory
is done so as to minimize total losses.

93
00:05:57,183 --> 00:06:00,325
Of course, as you had these losses,

94
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:03,036
the <i>∆V</i> capability of your vehicle

95
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:07,555
has to be larger
than 7.7 kilometers per second.

96
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:14,657
Typically, it's of the order
of ten kilometers per second.

97
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:19,303
So a vehicle has to have a capability
of about ten kilometers per second

98
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:22,393
to inject it to low Earth orbits

99
00:06:22,393 --> 00:06:24,708
because of the gravity and drag losses.

100
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,838
Let's look at the bottom picture.

101
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,115
You have initially your vertical rise,

102
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:33,688
and you obviously,
initially have to go vertically up,

103
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,571
and then there is a pitch-over maneuver

104
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,807
and then just mention
you have to shape the trajectories

105
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,930
so as to minimize the losses.

106
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,012
At some point, you have the boost cut off,

107
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,460
which, for the Shuttle, is MECO.

108
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:49,599
Then you have a coast period,

109
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,776
and then you have the Onorbit burn.

110
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,639
In the case of the Shuttle,
it was what we called OMS-2.

111
00:06:57,445 --> 00:07:01,582
We sometimes had to do
a so-called OMS-1 here

112
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:04,259
using the orbital maneuvering system

113
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,065
in case MECO was not quite enough
to get to the proper ascending trajectory

114
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:13,211
on this elliptical orbit at the apogee
on which you're going to circularize,

115
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:16,468
you possibly had to do an OMS-1
but normally it was not done

116
00:07:16,468 --> 00:07:20,134
because MECO conditions
were giving you the proper transfer orbit

117
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:26,145
at the apogee
to the desired orbital altitude.

118
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,706
But OMS-2 had to be done
in order to circularize.

119
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:35,738
Now, if we look at the upper picture
we have the Earth launch

120
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:41,959
where we have to loft the ascent trajectory
considerably because of the atmosphere.

121
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,843
If you have a thinner atmosphere
like on Mars,

122
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:48,818
you have much less lofting, and of course,

123
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,159
if you have the Moon case,
you have no atmosphere,

124
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:55,563
so after very short period
of vertical launch

125
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:58,979
in order to reduce the gravity loss
you immediately go toward the East

126
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,129
or toward the desired direction.

127
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:07,392
You have no drag loss,
so you only can suffer the gravity loss

128
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:09,838
in case you loft the trajectory too much.

129
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:13,744
These are the velocities
that are required for Earth orbit.

130
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:16,508
I mentioned about ten kilometers
per second capability,

131
00:08:16,508 --> 00:08:19,299
that you must have,
here it's less than that

132
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,622
For Mars, that's what you need to have.

133
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:24,114
For the Moon,
that's what you need to have.

134
00:08:24,114 --> 00:08:28,053
OK, let's look at a Shuttle
ascent to orbit profile.

135
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:34,654
On the left hand side you have a nice
picture of a launch of STS-41-G in 1984.

136
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:40,739
You see that after the vertical ascent,
shortly after leaving the launch pad,

137
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:42,684
you have quite a lot of lofting

138
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:46,710
because you have to escape
the atmosphere as soon as possible.

139
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,993
Let's look at a drawing
on the right hand side.

140
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,715
You have the first stage here,

141
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:56,534
until so-called SRB SEP,

142
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,319
Separation of the Solid Rocket Booster

143
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:03,265
and here they fall down
in the ocean using parachutes

144
00:09:03,265 --> 00:09:05,394
and they are recovered for later flights.

145
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:09,650
This is a so-called second stage here,

146
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:14,634
until MECO, which we mentioned already,
the term <i>main engine cut off</i>.

147
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,919
At this time you are not
on a circular trajectory

148
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,520
but you are on an ascent trajectory
at the apogee which you will circularize.

149
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,712
We had external tank separation
about 80 seconds after MECO

150
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:30,826
and as mentioned, as you are still
in the very high atmosphere,

151
00:09:30,826 --> 00:09:34,779
the external tank will,
after half an orbit around the Earth

152
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,357
or 45 minutes of free-fall,
fall down in the Pacific Ocean.

153
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:41,342
OMS-1 as mentioned
was not always performed

154
00:09:41,342 --> 00:09:43,342
but there was always this possibility

155
00:09:43,342 --> 00:09:48,377
in case MECO conditions
were not sufficient to get your rise

156
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:53,617
toward the circular orbit altitude
on the other side of the Earth.

157
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:58,211
You could perform an OMS-1
but OMS-2 was a must do.

158
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,653
Posigrade burn at the apogee
of your transfer orbit

159
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:07,995
to circularize your trajectory
and not come back to the MECO altitude

160
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:11,624
where you would have a lot of drag
due to the residual atmosphere

161
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:13,015
at that altitude.

162
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:17,803
This is a profile
of Shuttle ascent to orbit.

163
00:10:19,012 --> 00:10:21,473
Let's talk about
Shuttle re-entry now.

164
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,373
You had the initial
circular orbit in black,

165
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:29,262
and at some point here, you had
to do the so-called <i>deorbit burn</i>

166
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:33,220
just at the opposite point vs. the Earth
where you wanted to land

167
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,743
and of course, the target
was always Kennedy Space Center.

168
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:38,511
In some cases it was Edwards,

169
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:42,516
in case the weather conditions
at KSC were not favorable.

170
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:47,730
Here I go to represent in another drawing

171
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,711
the orientation of the Space Shuttle
for the deorbit burn.

172
00:10:50,711 --> 00:10:53,278
Again, the deorbit burn
is a braking maneuver

173
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,627
We are using the OMS engine,
firing the OMS engine

174
00:10:56,627 --> 00:11:00,547
to reduce the velocity
and to come to the red orbit,

175
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:03,694
which is here, which is
a descending elliptical orbit

176
00:11:03,694 --> 00:11:10,045
which had its perigee above
the landing point at Kennedy Space Center.

177
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:14,342
Typically, a few tens of kilometers
above the Earth's surface.

178
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:19,173
What needed to be done
right after the deorbit burn

179
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:21,878
was a pitch up maneuver.

180
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:26,549
In order to come to an orientation
versus a trajectory

181
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:31,045
which was 40º nose up,

182
00:11:31,634 --> 00:11:34,610
this angle here, 40º nose up.

183
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,621
The reason why we wanted to have
a relatively high alpha angle

184
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:43,547
or angle of attack was to brake already

185
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:45,541
with the high drag that you have

186
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:48,690
with the high angle of attack
in the higher layers of the atmosphere.

187
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:51,996
At this point, this was
over the Pacific Ocean.

188
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:55,644
You got to the so-called
entry interface at 400,000 feet

189
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:58,102
or about 120 kilometers
above the Earth's surface.

190
00:11:58,102 --> 00:12:01,041
You still had an angle of attack
of about 40º

191
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:04,413
and braking in the higher layers
of the atmosphere.

192
00:12:04,413 --> 00:12:06,722
You had a period of constant drag

193
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:09,458
so at some point you had
to reduce the angle of attack

194
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,891
because you had increased value of <i>P</i>,

195
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:15,158
the density in the atmosphere,
and it's represented here.

196
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:17,312
We're reducing angle of attack

197
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:21,740
until you were performing a glide
toward the landing runway

198
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,582
at the Kennedy Space Center.

199
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:27,213
This is the Shuttle
final approach to landing,

200
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:31,979
so we enter the atmosphere
over continental United States

201
00:12:31,979 --> 00:12:34,722
for a landing
at Kennedy Space Center, Florida,

202
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:39,261
and the idea is, as it is a glider,
we don't have any more propulsion system

203
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:44,156
for the final portion of the entry
into the atmosphere,

204
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:47,227
on the approach to the landing
runway at Kennedy Space Center.

205
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,219
Here you see <i>S-turns</i>

206
00:12:53,803 --> 00:12:55,517
where you try to dissipate energy.

207
00:12:55,517 --> 00:12:57,891
You always try to come
with too much energy.

208
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,943
You dissipate it in a way or another,

209
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:05,200
and in this phase,
close to the TAEM interface,

210
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,718
the Terminal Area Energy
Management interface,

211
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,132
we perform the S-turn.

212
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:13,609
The idea was to come overhead the runway

213
00:13:13,609 --> 00:13:17,784
with an altitude of about 50,000 feet

214
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,512
about five minutes before landing.

215
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:28,939
You see here the so-called HAC
which is the Heading Alignment Cylinder

216
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:32,106
and this is a projection
on the surface of the Earth

217
00:13:32,106 --> 00:13:34,023
of the Heading Alignment Cylinder

218
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:37,153
and you come here
and you follow a trajectory

219
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:40,415
on this Heading Alignment Cylinder,

220
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:45,045
coming eventually
into the final direct approach

221
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:47,562
into the selected runway.

222
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:53,929
If I draw on the upper right
the final approach profile,

223
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:57,602
we had the following:
we had an angle of 20º

224
00:13:57,602 --> 00:14:00,997
which is called the <i>Steep Glide Slope</i>

225
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,762
at a velocity of about 300 knots.

226
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,739
It would be very difficult
to perform a final flare

227
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,708
from the 20º steep glide slope
to the touchdown point

228
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,559
which was planned to be here

229
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:21,922
so there was a so-called pre-flare

230
00:14:23,524 --> 00:14:28,008
at an altitude of about
2,000 feet above the ground.

231
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:30,450
This is the aiming point
which is before the runway,

232
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,645
about 7,000 feet before the runway.

233
00:14:32,645 --> 00:14:36,369
At this pre-flare point
we're flooding the approach

234
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:40,746
to a very small angle
of about a degree and a half

235
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:43,713
and this the touchdown point

236
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:46,860
after deploying
the landing here, of course,

237
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:49,416
with an angle of attack of about 16º.

238
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:53,928
It's a delta wing, so a pretty high
angle of attack at touchdown.

239
00:14:53,928 --> 00:14:58,306
This is the profile
of the final approach to the runway

240
00:14:58,306 --> 00:15:01,856
at Kennedy Space Center, Florida,
a five kilometer long runway.

241
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:07,053
Again, if the weather conditions
were not favorable at Kennedy Space Center

242
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:11,118
there was a choice of a landing
at Edwards Air Force base in California.

243
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:15,156
Let's consider the entry
requirement of the constraints

244
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:17,650
and this is very general,
it's not only for the Space Shuttle

245
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,773
but any re-entry vehicle.
It's valid also for the Soyuz

246
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,980
and any vehicle that you want to recover.

247
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,606
If you have a destructive re-entry,
of course, it's not applicable

248
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:35,110
but this is for human spacecraft
like the Shuttle also used.

249
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,984
You have a deceleration.

250
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:40,057
You have to keep the deceleration
within reasonable limits.

251
00:15:40,057 --> 00:15:44,134
12 G is about the maximum
that a human being can withstand,

252
00:15:44,134 --> 00:15:46,320
but only for a short time, obviously.

253
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,492
Heating is a bigger factor.

254
00:15:48,492 --> 00:15:52,709
You want accurate landings,
so you want to come back.

255
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,501
Either the Soyuz capsule has to land
with a parachute braking at the end

256
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,146
at the proper location in Kazakhstan

257
00:16:01,146 --> 00:16:06,062
for lift-off in Baikonur
and return in Kazakhstan

258
00:16:07,026 --> 00:16:13,763
and the size of the entry corridor
is depending on several constraints:

259
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:16,585
deceleration, heating, and accuracy.

260
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:20,701
If I represent here on the right hand side
the re-entry corridor,

261
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:23,490
or you want to avoid
being in that part here

262
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,105
because you have too steep
a re-entry in the atmosphere

263
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,775
and the heating is going to be unbearable.

264
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:32,062
If you are in this part here
above the re-entry corridor,

265
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:35,596
then you may skip over the atmosphere

266
00:16:35,596 --> 00:16:37,776
and not perform a real re-entry

267
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:39,734
or you perform a re-entry much later

268
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:42,840
which is undesirable if you want
to get to a certain target.

269
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,828
So the re-entry corridor
is where you want to be.

270
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:48,211
In the case of the Shuttle,
the re-entry corridor

271
00:16:48,211 --> 00:16:52,075
was defined by the shape
of the elliptical entry trajectory

272
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:56,541
from the deorbit burn until
the perigee of that re-entry trajectory.

273
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,451
It was only a very small angle
of entry into the atmosphere

274
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:04,507
but it was all planned in order
to be the proper corridor,

275
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:08,529
respecting all the constraints
of deceleration, heating, and accuracy

276
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,481
of the final trajectory.
