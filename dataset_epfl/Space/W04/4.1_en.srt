Hello everyone, 
and welcome to Unit 4,

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,163
Interplanetary trajectories 
and propulsion.

3
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:16,656
This week we'll talk about 4.2,
Interplanetary trajectories,

4
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:21,056
4.3, Aerodynamic braking
and slingshot maneuvers,

5
00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:23,312
4.4, Propulsion,

6
00:00:23,312 --> 00:00:27,095
4.5, Ascent into space and re-entry.

7
00:00:27,905 --> 00:00:32,076
By the way, you have a great view
of the Space Shuttle

8
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:34,369
shortly after lift off 
from Kennedy Space Center.

9
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:40,120
This is good illustration of on one hand, 
propulsion and ascent into orbit.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,883
The Space Shuttle was an awesome vehicle
and here it's lifting off under the power

11
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:48,381
of two solid rocket boosters
and three hydrogen engines.

12
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,462
the Space Shuttle's main engines.

13
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:54,489
We have prepared some 
practice quizzes after each video

14
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,908
to make sure that you have understood
the relevant concepts.

15
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:05,292
Each section from 4.2 to 4.5
is concluded with a control quiz.

16
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,431
In addition, there is a test
at the end of this unit.

17
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:13,757
To illustrate the unit we have prepared
a focus on astronaut experience

18
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:18,715
with interviews of two astronauts,
Mike Foale and Naoko Yamazaki.

19
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:23,031
Now, I happen to know 
Mike Foale quite well.

20
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:27,657
He was on several Space Shuttle missions.

21
00:01:27,657 --> 00:01:29,417
He was on Space Station Mir.

22
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:32,477
He was on the International Space Station

23
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:35,836
and I had the huge privilege 
of spacewalking with him

24
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:41,342
on the December 23, 1999,
on the Shuttle mission STS-103.

25
00:01:42,116 --> 00:01:46,572
On the second spacewalk of this mission,
we replaced on Hubble the main computer

26
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:48,361
and one Fine Guidance Sensor.

27
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,629
We spent 8 hours and 10 minutes outside.

28
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,230
Mike Foale is a dear friend, 
and say hello to him when you see him.

29
00:01:55,832 --> 00:02:02,505
Now, Naoko Yamazaki flew 
on Shuttle mission STS-131 in 2010.

30
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:06,679
She spent about 15 days in space
on Space Shuttle Discovery.

31
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:10,197
on an assembly flight
of the International Space Station.

32
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:14,860
Now, looking at these interviews
is not compulsory, it's facultative,

33
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,795
but we encourage you to do it,
in order to deepen your knowledge

34
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,489
about the particular subject 
of this section.
