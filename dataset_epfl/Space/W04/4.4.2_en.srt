00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:06,552
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:08,743
Let's get back to spacecraft propulsion,

3
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:12,639
and we'll look at how
different rocket systems work.

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:19,208
Here on top, we have a simple schematic

5
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,821
of a liquid rocket-propulsion system.

6
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:23,901
You have the fuel and the oxidizers

7
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:26,542
that are being fed
in the combustion chamber.

8
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:28,258
You need an igniter system

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:32,142
if you don't have
hypergolic propellant and oxidizer.

10
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:35,103
Then you're producing a hot gas
under high pressure,

11
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:39,162
expansion in a nozzle,
and the nozzle is optimized in its shape

12
00:00:39,162 --> 00:00:42,480
in order to, on one hand,
increase the velocity of the exhaust.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,951
We know for an efficient
propulsion system

14
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,885
you want to have a high exhaust velocity,

15
00:00:47,885 --> 00:00:52,009
and also to manage the pressure
at the end of the nozzles.

16
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:55,980
The most efficient case
is when you have the gas pressure

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,658
at the end of the nozzle
equal to the ambient pressure.

18
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,631
Obviously, this can work as long
as you are in the atmosphere.

19
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:04,210
If you are in vacuum, you can't get there.

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,658
But normally, for ascent into orbit,

21
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:11,677
the idea is to optimize the rocket engine

22
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:14,055
for it to work in the best possible way

23
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:15,841
in some layers of the atmosphere.

24
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,953
For the Space Shuttle main engines,
for instance, it was optimized

25
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:22,016
to work in the mid atmosphere--
not so much at lift-off,

26
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:25,125
not at the end of the ascent into orbit,

27
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,951
but somewhere in the middle.

28
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:29,284
On the bottom, you have a schematic

29
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:32,335
of a solid-propellant propulsion system.

30
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:36,657
You have the solid propellant
that has to contain, as well,

31
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:40,431
the oxidizer and the fuel in solid form,

32
00:01:40,742 --> 00:01:43,025
and the combustion
takes place in the middle.

33
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:46,883
In the case of the Space Shuttle
solid rocket motors,

34
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:50,016
you had a star-shaped surface inside

35
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:53,678
in order to increase the surface
of the burn product.

36
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,277
Hot gas is produced,
expansion in a nozzle,

37
00:01:56,277 --> 00:01:59,842
and, same as what we said before,
you optimize a nozzle

38
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:04,389
to work at a certain height
during the ascent into orbit.

39
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,178
That's an example of the Viking 5C

40
00:02:08,607 --> 00:02:11,565
liquid-propellant rocket motor

41
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,227
that was used on the Ariane 5.

42
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:17,314
That's an earlier generation
of the Ariane rocket,

43
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,903
operated in Kourou, French Guiana.

44
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:24,898
Now, this was using hypergolic propellant,

45
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:27,556
unsymmetrical monomethylhydrazine,

46
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:30,499
and nitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizer.

47
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,716
And you have the fuel tank on the top,

48
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:35,314
the oxidizer tank here on the bottom,

49
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:38,155
and both are fed
into the combustion chamber,

50
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:40,094
and in between you have the turbo pumps.

51
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,887
The turbo pumps are fed
by some of the fuel of the oxidizers,

52
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:47,759
that are taken here,
fed to the gas generator,

53
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,596
and the product of combustion
of the gas generator is just fed outside,

54
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,804
does not contribute to the propulsion.

55
00:02:54,083 --> 00:03:00,851
Now the specific impulse
of this system was about 350-380,

56
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:04,519
so less than a cryogenic rocket engine

57
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,911
using liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen,

58
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,493
but still a pretty sizable
specific impulse or efficiency.

59
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:15,328
Now, let's get to the Space Shuttle
propulsion system.

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,630
In the back of the orbiter

61
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:21,428
you had three
so-called <i>cryogenic engines</i>

62
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:27,155
with liquid hydrogen as a fuel
and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer--

63
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:29,487
the center, left, and right engines.

64
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:35,147
Of course the oxidizer and fuel
were contained in an external tank

65
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:39,558
that was at the bottom
of the Space Shuttle,

66
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,784
towards the belly of the Space Shuttle.

67
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:45,230
The other engine that we see here,
the so-called <i>OMS engine</i>,

68
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,311
that are using internal propellant
containing these parts,

69
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,881
that was used only for on-orbit maneuvers.

70
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:57,545
This is a view of the plumbing
of the supply of fuel and oxidizer

71
00:03:57,545 --> 00:03:59,738
in the case of the Space Shuttle
main engines.

72
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,824
Here you have the external tank.

73
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,994
That's the top of the external tank;
that's the bottom.

74
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,202
On top you have the liquid-oxygen tank,

75
00:04:07,202 --> 00:04:15,145
containing about 1,400,000 lbs.
of liquid oxygen,

76
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,943
and on the bottom you have
the liquid-hydrogen tank

77
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:25,259
containing about 230,000 lbs.
of liquid hydrogen.

78
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,603
Of course the difference in weight
comes from the fact

79
00:04:27,603 --> 00:04:33,526
that the molecular weight of oxygen is 16,
and it's just 1 for hydrogen.

80
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:36,688
That's why you have this huge discrepancy.

81
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:41,521
Now the liquids are fed
to the three main engines

82
00:04:41,521 --> 00:04:46,287
via 17-inch feeds, for very large pipes

83
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:49,569
feeding the propellant, the fuel,

84
00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:51,870
and the oxidizer to the main engines.

85
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:59,764
Now on the left-hand side you have a view
of the geometry of the plumbing,

86
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:04,340
feeding the fuel, and the oxidizer
to the three main engines,

87
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,582
with fill and drains for liquid hydrogen

88
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:11,123
and for liquid oxygen, here.

89
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:16,449
And this is where the fuel and oxidizer
were fed to fill the external tank

90
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,784
from the bottom of the external tank.

91
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:22,731
This is a schematic
of the Space Shuttle main engine,

92
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,859
the liquid-oxygen, liquid-hydrogen engine
of the Space Shuttle,

93
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:29,467
where you have so-called
<i>staged combustion</i>,

94
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,078
as opposed to the gas generator

95
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:34,119
that you had for the Viking engine
we saw before.

96
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:38,659
Here we have the fuel inlet,
here the oxidizer inlet,

97
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,373
with a low-pressure turbo pump

98
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:46,103
for both the fuel and the oxidizer.

99
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:49,709
And what is interesting
is that the fuel is--

100
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:51,057
and this is quite general--

101
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:55,761
is fed in the bottom,
in order to cool the nozzles.

102
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:57,855
The nozzles tend to get
to a very high temperature,

103
00:05:57,855 --> 00:06:01,578
and of course
the liquid hydrogen is very cold

104
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:06,000
and is used in piping
around the nozzle to cool it.

105
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:09,860
And then both the fuel

106
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:16,344
and the oxidizer, here,

107
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:21,273
are fed to the high-pressure
turbo pump as well,

108
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:23,090
for fuel and for oxidizer.

109
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,349
And the product of the combustion

110
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:29,621
of this mixture of fuel and oxidizer

111
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:35,119
is still fuel-rich--
it's mainly hot hydrogen,

112
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:40,449
and it's fed into the combustion chamber
together with the fuel.

113
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,352
And here you have the mixture
of fuel and oxidizer that is ignited,

114
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:48,883
and is expanded, then, in the nozzle
to produce thrust for it.

115
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:52,134
The three main engines
of the Space Shuttle.

116
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,024
So it is two-stage combustion.

117
00:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,114
The first stage is
in the high-pressure turbo pumps

118
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,537
for fuel and oxidizer.

119
00:06:58,537 --> 00:07:02,428
The second stage is obviously
in the main combustion chamber

120
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,056
to produce the thrust.

121
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:07,844
Well, let's leave now
the subject of the detail

122
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,583
of how the rocket engines work,

123
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,789
whether they are solid or liquid,

124
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:18,110
either with a gas generator
or two-stage combustion,

125
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,746
and let's look at propellant needed
for a mission to Mars.

126
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:26,238
Now on the left-hand side
you have the Earth orbits.

127
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,599
On the right-hand side you have
the Earth orbit again,

128
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,265
after going to Mars,
which is in the middle of the picture.

129
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:36,641
And we'll look at the various stages
of a mission to Mars,

130
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,107
where you go on the surface of Mars,

131
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:41,349
then leave the surface of Mars
to come back to Earth.

132
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:45,624
Now what you have to bring
to low Earth orbit is ABCD,

133
00:07:45,624 --> 00:07:48,618
and you have the list here
of these various components.

134
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,879
You bring, obviously, the ascent vehicle,
the Mars Lander,

135
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,632
the Earth-Mars Transfer vehicle,
and the discarded booster.

136
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:00,584
And then, what you need to do

137
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:05,309
is bring three of these components, BCD,

138
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:06,901
which are Earth-Mars Transfer vehicle,

139
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:10,664
the Mars Lander, ascent vehicle,
to the Mars orbit.

140
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:15,203
Then you bring C and D,
Mars Lander, ascent vehicle,

141
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,981
to the surface of Mars.

142
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:22,162
Then D only, the ascent vehicle,
back to the orbit around Mars

143
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:26,372
to meet with the Earth-Mars
Transfer vehicle,

144
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:31,177
and only the Earth-Mars Transfer vehicle
will be accelerated,

145
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,886
to a certain ΔV
towards the Earth orbit.

146
00:08:35,212 --> 00:08:40,741
So you have to realize that each
of these segments, in a mission to Mars,

147
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,390
with a landing on Mars
and then coming back to Earth,

148
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,350
includes a certain number of maneuvers,

149
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,125
and each maneuver means a certain ΔV

150
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:49,924
and each ΔV means propellant.

151
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:51,939
And you have to remember
that Tsiolkovsky equation.

152
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:54,973
If we lift off the Earth's surface,

153
00:08:55,572 --> 00:08:58,410
about 90% of the mass

154
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,650
of the space ship leaving
the Earths' surface is propellant,

155
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,940
so whenever you increase
the mass of the payload,

156
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,757
including all the fuel that will be needed
for such a mission to Mars,

157
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:13,951
you have to increase considerably
the propellants,

158
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,827
to leave the gravity well of the Earth,

159
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:19,859
and get into your mission
to the solar system.

160
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,710
So it's very important to have,
on one hand,

161
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:28,205
a very efficient propulsion system
with a high specific impulse,

162
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:32,145
on one hand, and, whenever possible,
what you would like to do

163
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:38,040
is for these segments,
the maneuvers 4, 5, 6,

164
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:41,594
you might want to get the propellant
on the surface of Mars.

165
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,126
You can't get that before that,

166
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:46,713
but from the surface of Mars
to low Mars orbits,

167
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,755
low Mars orbit to Earth transfer orbit,

168
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,589
and Earth transfer orbit to LEO,

169
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:56,837
you might use propellant
that you get from Mars itself.

170
00:09:58,292 --> 00:10:01,273
That's one of the big subjects:
on one hand, you want to have

171
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:04,706
the highest possible I_sp
for all of these maneuvers,

172
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:08,077
for the highest possible,
or the most efficient possible

173
00:10:08,077 --> 00:10:10,765
propulsion system
for these various segments,

174
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:13,712
and, if possible, you want to get
the propellant to come back

175
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:16,406
from the surface of Mars
and the atmosphere of Mars.

176
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:21,970
Some general remarks about
the propulsion system in space.

177
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:26,529
A maneuver in space is defined
as a given ΔV

178
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:30,334
and the ejection velocity
in the combustion chamber

179
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:33,392
on the highest speed,
they both have a very direct influence

180
00:10:33,392 --> 00:10:37,832
on the propellant needed to perform
a maneuver with a given ΔV.

181
00:10:38,552 --> 00:10:40,581
Now, a propellant
must be carried into orbit

182
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:42,658
or further away, at a very high cost.

183
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:46,344
This comes from the Tsiolkovsky equation.

184
00:10:46,344 --> 00:10:48,467
The ejection velocity is, consequently,

185
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,559
a very important parameter
in space propulsion systems.

186
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:54,251
Let's look at this picture here.

187
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:56,090
This is the Space Shuttle at launch.

188
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,775
We have five rocket engines,
two solid rocket boosters,

189
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:04,010
providing, in fact, the highest fraction
of the initial thrust,

190
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,195
and we have three cryogenic engines:

191
00:11:08,195 --> 00:11:12,791
liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen
fed from the big external tank.

192
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:17,031
The two solid rocket boosters
were completely used

193
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,809
after about two minutes,
separated from the tank

194
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,374
were falling down in the ocean,

195
00:11:21,374 --> 00:11:26,094
and for the 6 and 1/2 minutes extra,
for 8 and 1/2 minutes total,

196
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:28,664
for the ascent into space,

197
00:11:28,664 --> 00:11:31,430
only the cryogenic engines were used

198
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:35,334
to bring the Space Shuttle
to the desired velocity,

199
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:39,105
the desired altitude,
for the beginning of its mission.
