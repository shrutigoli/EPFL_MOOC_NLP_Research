Hello everyone, and welcome to Unit 4,
Interplanetary trajectories and propulsion.
This week we'll talk about 4.2,
Interplanetary trajectories,
4.3, Aerodynamic braking and slingshot maneuvers,
4.4, Propulsion,
4.5, Ascent into space and re-entry.
By the way, you have a great view of the Space Shuttle shortly after lift off from Kennedy Space Center.
This is good illustration of on one hand, propulsion and ascent into orbit.
The Space Shuttle was an awesome vehicle and here it's lifting off under the power of two solid rocket boosters and three hydrogen engines. the Space Shuttle's main engines.
We have prepared some practice quizzes after each video to make sure that you have understood the relevant concepts.
Each section from 4.2 to 4.5 is concluded with a control quiz.
In addition, there is a test at the end of this unit.
To illustrate the unit we have prepared a focus on astronaut experience with interviews of two astronauts,
Mike Foale and Naoko Yamazaki.
Now, I happen to know 
Mike Foale quite well.
He was on several Space Shuttle missions.
He was on Space Station Mir.
He was on the International Space Station and I had the huge privilege of spacewalking with him on the December 23, 1999, on the Shuttle mission STS-103.
On the second spacewalk of this mission, we replaced on Hubble the main computer and one Fine Guidance Sensor.
We spent 8 hours and 10 minutes outside.
Mike Foale is a dear friend, and say hello to him when you see him.
Now, Naoko Yamazaki flew on Shuttle mission STS-131 in 2010.
She spent about 15 days in space on Space Shuttle Discovery. on an assembly flight of the International Space Station.
Now, looking at these interviews is not compulsory, it's facultative, but we encourage you to do it, in order to deepen your knowledge about the particular subject of this section.
