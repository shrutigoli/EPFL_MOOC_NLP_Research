We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
Thanks for your participation in the course.
I would like you to focus on the concepts presented in this unit.
And again, once these concepts are clearly understood, including their application, you can take the final tests of the unit.
And I'd like to remind you also about the focus on astronaut experience with the interviews of two astronauts,
Mike Foale, from the United States but also a UK citizen, and Naoko Yamazaki from Japan.
Thank you.
