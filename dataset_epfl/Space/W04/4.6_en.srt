00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:07,040
We hope that you enjoyed
this week with us.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,780
Thanks for your participation
in the course.

3
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:14,891
I would like you to focus on
the concepts presented in this unit.

4
00:00:14,891 --> 00:00:18,648
And again, once these concepts
are clearly understood,

5
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:20,008
including their application,

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:22,828
you can take the final tests of the unit.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,090
And I'd like to remind you also

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,750
about the focus on astronaut experience

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,600
with the interviews of two astronauts,

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,780
Mike Foale, from the United States
but also a UK citizen,

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,280
and Naoko Yamazaki from Japan.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,270
Thank you.
