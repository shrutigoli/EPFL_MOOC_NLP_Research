1
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:09,108
We are coming
toward the end of our journey

2
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:14,748
to the destination planet
after a pretty long-duration arc

3
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:18,620
on this elliptical trajectory
around the Sun,

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:25,969
let's take the example of a trajectory
from the Earth to Mars.

5
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:32,043
It's about 8 months of duration orbit
on a Hohmann transfer

6
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:36,494
so elliptical heliocentric trajectory
from the Earth to Mars.

7
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,934
And we come in the vicinity
of the destination planet.

8
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,776
What is important is the time.

9
00:00:43,516 --> 00:00:46,914
We will consider that we are
on this heliocentric trajectory,

10
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:49,514
this elliptical arc around the Sun,

11
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,996
until we come close enough
to the destination planet

12
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,526
that we can forget about the Sun

13
00:00:53,526 --> 00:00:56,459
and then consider only
the motion of our spacecraft

14
00:00:56,459 --> 00:00:59,276
with respect to the destination planet

15
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:02,027
on this, of course, hyperbolic trajectory

16
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:05,687
inside the sphere of influence
of the destination planet.

17
00:01:07,057 --> 00:01:12,577
Now, we arrive at this velocity,
now it's <i>v_a ∞</i>.

18
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,260
It's a hyperbolic excess velocity,
but for arrival.

19
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:21,373
It's a small <i>v</i> because
it's with respect to the planet

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,687
it's a planetocentric velocity,

21
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:27,107
it's equal to large <i>V_S</i>,
<i>S</i> is for spacecraft.

22
00:01:27,107 --> 00:01:29,650
It's large because it's heliocentric.

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,556
It's the difference between
heliocentric velocity of the spacecraft

24
00:01:33,556 --> 00:01:37,656
and the heliocentric velocity
of the planet. P is for planet.

25
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:41,106
So, we are penetrating
the sphere of influence

26
00:01:41,106 --> 00:01:42,626
of the destination planet.

27
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:47,826
Again, it does not matter what the size
of this sphere of influence is.

28
00:01:47,826 --> 00:01:51,530
At some point we do this transition
from a heliocentric trajectory,

29
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,672
where we forget
about the destination planet

30
00:01:53,672 --> 00:01:56,781
in terms of gravitational effect,

31
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,081
and then we come inside
this sphere of influence,

32
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:00,813
we forget about the Sun,

33
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:03,582
and we only consider
the relative motion of our spacecraft

34
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,082
with respect to the destination planet.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,867
Here we are with <i>v_a ∞</i>,
we penetrate the sphere of influence.

36
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,877
Of course, we have
a hyperbolic trajectory

37
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:13,351
inside the sphere of influence.

38
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,409
Now, in order to accomplish the goal
that we want to accomplish,

39
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:19,910
we may want to either come and orbit
around the destination planet,

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,367
we may want to have a direct hit
on the planet,

41
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,077
hopefully doing a soft landing

42
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:28,275
and doing a braking maneuver
close to the surface to the planet,

43
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:30,967
we may want to do just a flyby,

44
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,737
which was the case for New Horizons

45
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:38,447
doing a flyby with Pluto
at the end of 2015.

46
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:41,220
But anyway, whatever we want to do,

47
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,360
we need to select
so-called impact parameter, <i>d_∞</i>,

48
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:49,824
which is the distance to the planet
on a plane, the B-plane,

49
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:53,234
which is perpendicular to <i>v_a ∞</i>,

50
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:56,684
and passing
by the destination planet itself.

51
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,464
That's the destination planet:
the center of this circle.

52
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:06,764
We select a value of <i>d_∞</i>, and we need
to select also the angle <i>θ</i>.

53
00:03:06,764 --> 00:03:10,770
If here we have the equator
of the destination planet,

54
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:13,132
we may want to come on an orbit

55
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:16,842
which is an equatorial orbit
around the destination planet

56
00:03:16,842 --> 00:03:20,992
or we may want to come on a polar orbit,
which will be the case in this drawing.

57
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:24,842
But, anyway, we need to select,
these are flight controllers

58
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:26,082
in the control room

59
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:32,202
controlling the motion of the spacecraft
that select the value of <i>d_∞</i>, on one hand,

60
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:35,607
and <i>θ</i> in order to accomplish
the planned goals.

61
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:40,485
This is our destination planet here,

62
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:45,486
this is our hyperbolic
excess velocity at arrival,

63
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,338
and we have the sphere of influence

64
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:50,978
which is centered
on the destination planet

65
00:03:50,978 --> 00:03:53,323
with the radius that,
again, is irrelevant

66
00:03:53,323 --> 00:04:00,323
in the case of our treatment of this,
I would say, three-segment motion

67
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,453
from the departure planet

68
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:05,399
all the way to the arrival planet.

69
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,829
The first segment being
inside the sphere of influence

70
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:09,013
of the departure planet,

71
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:12,299
and we have the heliocentric trajectory,
Hohmann transfer,

72
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,533
where we forget
about the departure planet,

73
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:17,913
and then we have the arrival
inside the sphere of influence

74
00:04:17,913 --> 00:04:19,393
of the destination planet,

75
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,903
where we forget about the Sun.

76
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:25,403
Here we are, this is the hyperbolic arc

77
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:28,004
of our trajectory
inside the sphere of influence.

78
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:34,104
At this point here we have the perigee,
or periapsis, rather,

79
00:04:34,104 --> 00:04:36,295
because we don't talk
about the Earth anymore,

80
00:04:36,295 --> 00:04:38,415
but about any object in the solar system.

81
00:04:40,284 --> 00:04:44,119
You see some values of the geometry here.

82
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:46,489
We talked about <i>d_∞</i>, the impact parameter,

83
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:51,712
which is here, inside this B-plane,

84
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,284
as I described before, this plane
perpendicular to the arrival infinity

85
00:04:55,284 --> 00:04:57,522
and passing through the center
of the planet.

86
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,908
We have selected the value of <i>θ</i>, also,

87
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:02,857
in order to decide if we have
a polar orbit, equatorial orbit

88
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:04,307
or something in between.

89
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:08,242
Let's write some expressions here.

90
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:10,924
We have to consider
that the situation is very similar

91
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,643
to the situation with the departure.

92
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,412
We have a similar hyperbolic arc,

93
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:19,772
we have a point, the closest
to the, this time, destination planet,

94
00:05:19,772 --> 00:05:22,742
no longer the departure planet

95
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:25,419
which is the Earth,
but we have this relationship

96
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:28,517
between <i>a</i> and <i>v_a ∞</i>.

97
00:05:33,517 --> 00:05:38,992
a equal to <i>&micro;</i> over <i>(v_a ∞)&sup2;</i>

98
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:45,072
Now, <i>v_a ∞</i> is, again,
given by the circumstance of our arrival.

99
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:47,501
We cannot really choose that.

100
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:51,441
That's the difference
between our heliocentric velocity

101
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,663
when we arrive
at the sphere of influence,

102
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:56,729
and the velocity of the planet itself.

103
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,810
However, the value of <i>v_a ∞</i>

104
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,867
will give us the value of <i>a</i>,
the semi-major axis

105
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:06,517
of the hyperbola of arrival
inside the sphere of influence.

106
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:16,028
What we know is <i>v_a ∞</i>,

107
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:22,782
again, this is given by the overall
trajectory characteristics of our journey

108
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,044
in the solar system
to get to the destination,

109
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:30,072
and we choose the impact parameter, <i>d_∞</i>.

110
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:36,892
Now, let's look at this triangle here.

111
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:44,051
And we have <i>r_p + a</i>,

112
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:50,344
which is equal to <i>c</i>, by the way,

113
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:55,084
is equal to square root -
we just resolve this triangle.

114
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:17,018
Now, this is good,
because we know the value of <i>a</i>

115
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,876
because of this expression
that we had here.

116
00:07:19,876 --> 00:07:24,436
We select the value of <i>d_∞</i>, <i>v_a ∞</i> we know,

117
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:30,363
<i>μ</i> is the mass of the destination planet
multiplied by the constant of gravitation.

118
00:07:31,072 --> 00:07:33,760
So we will be able
to determine the value of <i>r_p</i>.

119
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,710
Let's express that because
that's an important parameter.

120
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,087
That's really going to give us

121
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:44,889
important data about the close point
to the planet.

122
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:46,620
If it's a planet with an atmosphere,

123
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,586
we're going to get
inside the upper layers

124
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:51,786
of the atmosphere of the planet
where we have an extra braking on us.

125
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,726
It's a very important parameter.

126
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:55,136
Let's take it out.

127
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,684
So we have the value of <i>r_p</i>,

128
00:08:29,684 --> 00:08:33,064
knowing all the other parameters,
including <i>d_∞</i>,

129
00:08:33,064 --> 00:08:34,901
which we select as a flight controller

130
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:37,458
to accomplish mission objectives.

131
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,145
And as far as the angle <i>β</i> is concerned,

132
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:48,115
giving us the angular aspect
of our deviation

133
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:55,595
between our arrival <i>v_a ∞</i> direction
of the direction of our velocity vector,

134
00:08:55,595 --> 00:08:58,557
when we come
at the closest point to the planet

135
00:08:58,557 --> 00:09:11,487
we have <i>cos β = a / (a + r_p) = a / c</i>.

136
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,558
And again, <i>r_p</i> we know, <i>a</i> we know,

137
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:19,193
so we know what the value of <i>β</i> is.

138
00:09:19,193 --> 00:09:21,533
That's another important parameter

139
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,483
that we can derive
from what we know already.

140
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,288
If we want to do an orbit insertion
around the destination planet,

141
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,812
let's look at this situation.

142
00:09:31,812 --> 00:09:36,386
So we have here
the arrival hyperbolic orbit,

143
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:40,091
and we come here to the periapsis,
the point of our trajectory,

144
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,571
the closest to the destination planet.

145
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:45,647
The planet looks like it's the Earth here,
but it does not matter.

146
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:49,532
Let's say, it's a destination planet
like Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn,

147
00:09:49,532 --> 00:09:53,045
or an inner planet like Mercury or Venus.

148
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:59,574
And this is the elliptical orbit
that we desire to have

149
00:09:59,574 --> 00:10:01,464
around the destination planet.

150
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,424
Let's look at this point here,

151
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:09,574
the periapsis
of our hyperbolic trajectory.

152
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:15,074
Let's use the following terminology here.

153
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,884
when we have <i>H</i> is for hyperbola:

154
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:22,144
this is valid for our trajectory
inside the sphere of influence,

155
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:28,734
we'll use <i>i</i> for insertion, we use <i>p</i>,
like we normally do, for periapsis.

156
00:10:29,757 --> 00:10:35,947
Now, we arrive with this velocity here,

157
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:40,232
which is a velocity on our hyperbolic
trajectory at the periapsis.

158
00:10:41,412 --> 00:10:46,228
Now, what we want is this velocity
for the insertion

159
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:50,321
into the close orbit, elliptical orbit
around the destination planet,

160
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:52,341
so it's around the planet,

161
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:54,965
and <i>i</i> is for insertion.

162
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:58,885
And <i>ΔV_i</i> is the braking maneuver in <i>ΔV</i>

163
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:04,296
that we have to do
in order to be able to insert ourselves

164
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,052
in this trajectory
around the destination planet.

165
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,567
So we have <i>ΔV_i</i>, <i>i</i> for insertion,

166
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:17,282
equal to the absolute value

167
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,032
of our periapsis velocity

168
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:28,496
on our hyperbolic trajectory

169
00:11:28,496 --> 00:11:34,036
minus <i>V_i p</i>.

170
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:40,958
This is a velocity at periapsis
of our desired elliptical orbit

171
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,180
around the destination planet.

172
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,580
And that's equal to--
we could look at the geometry here...

173
00:11:47,580 --> 00:12:05,679
<i>square root of (2&micro;/r_p + (v_a ∞)&sup2;)</i>

174
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,719
And we have a plus here
because this is an arc of a hyperbola.

175
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:24,198
<i> minus the square root of (2&micro;/r_p - &micro;/a_i)</i>

176
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:31,258
<i>a_i</i> is a semi-major axis
of our desired elliptical orbit

177
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:35,239
around the destination planet.

178
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:38,112
So this is <i>a_i</i>.

179
00:12:40,732 --> 00:12:43,927
This is a velocity
on the desired elliptical orbit,

180
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:46,694
at the periapsis of this elliptical orbit,

181
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:53,046
and this is our velocity
on a hyperbolic trajectory

182
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,826
at the periapsis.

183
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,520
So the difference between the two
will give us <i>ΔV_i</i>,

184
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,531
so we know how much
we need to brake in km per second

185
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,483
in order to insert ourselves
in that elliptical orbit

186
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,643
around the destination planet.
