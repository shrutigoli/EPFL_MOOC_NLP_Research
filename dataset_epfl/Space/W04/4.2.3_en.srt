1
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:10,459
Let's look at some more details
for the departure from a planet,

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,886
typically planet Earth,
in order to take our spacecraft

3
00:00:13,886 --> 00:00:19,608
on an elliptical, heliocentric
trajectory around the Sun,

4
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:22,823
with the destination either an outer
planet in the Solar System,

5
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,077
or an inner planet,
like Mercury or Venus.

6
00:00:27,463 --> 00:00:28,905
We have seen this already,

7
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:32,427
we have here the parking orbit

8
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:34,417
around the Earth,

9
00:00:34,417 --> 00:00:39,002
we have the radius of the parking orbit,

10
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:44,658
which we put as equal to <i>r_d</i>,
d for departure.

11
00:00:44,658 --> 00:00:49,640
At this point, we're going to increase
the velocity of our spacecraft

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,600
on a circular orbit around the Earth,

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,758
to get to a velocity
which is designated <i>v_d</i>.

14
00:00:55,758 --> 00:00:59,718
This will take us
on a hyperbolic trajectory

15
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:03,867
such that we will go through
the sphere of influence

16
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:05,615
at a non-zero velocity.

17
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:07,898
We would have practically zero velocity

18
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:11,947
if we had a parabolic trajectory
from the parking orbit,

19
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:14,442
but we will have to have
a hyperbolic trajectory.

20
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:18,136
So, we have a non-zero velocity
through the sphere of influence,

21
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:21,286
with a velocity of <i>v_d ∞</i>.

22
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,398
We've seen already
the fundamental relationship

23
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,111
between the amplitude of <i>v_d</i>,

24
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,517
the departure velocity
from the parking orbit,

25
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:34,480
and <i>v_d ∞</i>, the escape velocity
at the parking orbit.

26
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:36,928
We'll write this down again.

27
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:55,653
<i>v_E</i>, E for escape, for the parking orbit,
so, the radius <i>r_d</i>.

28
00:01:55,653 --> 00:02:00,304
So, that's an important relationship
that we'll be using several times.

29
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,483
Now, this <i>v_d ∞,</i> in fact,
we very often say just "v d infinity."

30
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:09,923
Like "vee dee infinity."

31
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,386
Or, the hyperbolic excess velocity.
I'm going to write it down here.

32
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:19,483
This term seems strange,
but the idea is the following:

33
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:23,183
if we had a parabolic trajectory
from the parking orbit,

34
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:27,104
we would get to the sphere of influence
with basically zero velocity.

35
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:31,261
So, as we are on a hyperbola,
we have a non-zero velocity,

36
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,571
and from the crossing
of the sphere of influence

37
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:39,589
towards further distances, we'll keep
pretty much a constant velocity,

38
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:42,714
<i>v_d ∞</i>, and we call it
hyperbolic excess velocity.

39
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:47,403
It's in excess to what we would have
if we had a parabolic trajectory.

40
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:52,643
Now, basically, the sphere of influence,
from the point of view

41
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:55,369
of the departure planet,
it's like if we were at infinity.

42
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,828
I'm going to write this down,

43
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,657
because I think it's important
that you understand that.

44
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:02,724
The sphere of influence
equals approximately infinity,

45
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:06,525
for the departure planet.

46
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:09,264
Which departure planet, of course,
is normally the Earth,

47
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:14,090
but it could be another planet,
if you go from Mars to another planet,

48
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:15,630
or return to the Earth,

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,139
then the departure planet
would be the planet Mars.

50
00:03:19,397 --> 00:03:23,366
Now, this is not a course
on fundamental geometry,

51
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:28,083
but I would like to remind you
of some of the features of a hyperbola.

52
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,447
And if you want more detail,
you can look at courses in mathematics.

53
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:37,662
This is relatively elementary geometry,
the characteristics of the hyperbola.

54
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:39,965
Of course, we have the two arcs
of the hyperbola,

55
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:41,938
which you see here
with the asymptotes.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,960
You have the equation
of the hyperbola here, with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> here.

57
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:51,064
You have the equations
of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,941
This is the center of the hyperbola.

59
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,004
Of course, normally we'll consider
only one arc of the hyperbola.

60
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:59,216
Let's take the arc which is
on the left-hand side.

61
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:03,302
This is the center of the hyperbola again.

62
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:06,717
This is the periapsis,

63
00:04:06,717 --> 00:04:12,187
the point of the hyperbola
closest to the focus, here.

64
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:16,446
And <i>c</i>, pretty much
like in the case of the ellipse,

65
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:20,111
<i>c</i> is the distance between the focus
and the center of the hyperbola,

66
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:27,651
and <i>a</i> is the distance
between the periapsis of the hyperbola

67
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:29,449
and the center of the hyperbola.

68
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,691
There are here some relationships
between <i>c</i> and <i>a</i> and <i>b.</i>

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,777
And <i>c</i> is equal to <i>a</i>, the semi-major axis,
multiplied by the eccentricity.

70
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,916
And in case of the hyperbola,
we always have <i>e</i>, the eccentricity,

71
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,469
larger than 1.

72
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:49,590
We know that we have 1 exactly
for a parabolic trajectory,

73
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,649
and we have less than 1 for an ellipse.

74
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,313
Here we have fundamental relationships,

75
00:04:57,473 --> 00:05:02,010
between the velocity
on an elliptical trajectory,

76
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,890
which is on the top, here,

77
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,479
and <i>r,</i> the distance to the central object.

78
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,962
For a given value of <i>a</i>,
the semi-major axis of the ellipse,

79
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:14,832
and of course <i>μ</i>,
the mass of the central object.

80
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,157
We have seen this already
before for the ellipse.

81
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:19,662
This is the so-called
"vis-viva equation."

82
00:05:20,682 --> 00:05:23,646
There are good demonstrations
of the vis-viva equation

83
00:05:24,576 --> 00:05:27,119
on Wikipedia, the English version,

84
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,605
or on several books on orbital mechanics.

85
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,566
It's quite a fundamental relationship.

86
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,404
Now, for the hyperbola.

87
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:38,168
And again, I'm not going to demonstrate it
but you'll find the demonstration

88
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,582
in similar references.

89
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,743
It's very similar
to the case of the ellipse,

90
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:46,643
except that you have a <i>plus</i>
in the case of a hyperbola,

91
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:49,583
versus a minus
in the case of the ellipse.

92
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:58,211
There are important implications
of these values of <i>V</i> versus <i>r</i>

93
00:05:58,211 --> 00:05:59,899
for the ellipse and the hyperbola,

94
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:03,504
in terms of the total energy
per unit mass,

95
00:06:03,504 --> 00:06:06,427
and I'm going to write this down
on the right-hand side.

96
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:09,364
Total energy per unit mass.

97
00:06:09,364 --> 00:06:11,612
I'm going to designate this as <i>ε</i>.

98
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,528
That's the symbol
that we used previously

99
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,579
for the ellipse,
which we covered already.

100
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:21,495
So, in the case of the ellipse,
of course it's equal to...

100
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:27,771
V&sup2;/2 - μ/r

101
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,840
And if you replace the value of <i>V</i>
which I have here

102
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,348
by what you have on the left-hand side,
with the vis-viva equation,

103
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:39,861
you'll find that this is equal
to <i>-μ/2a.</i>

104
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,048
This is a very important relationship.

105
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,276
We've seen this already before,
although it wasn't demonstrated,

106
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:50,864
because the vis-viva equation
was never demonstrated in this course.

107
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:55,212
It means that the energy per unit mass
on an elliptical trajectory

108
00:06:55,212 --> 00:07:00,624
is only dependent on, of course,
the mass of the central object, <i>μ,</i>

109
00:07:00,624 --> 00:07:05,058
and on the semi-major axis <i>a,</i>
and <i>not</i> on the eccentricity.

110
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,864
If you do the same for the hyperbola,

111
00:07:07,864 --> 00:07:12,308
you find that <i>ε</i>, energy per unit
mass of the hyperbola,

112
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,758
and it's plus <i>μ/2a</i>.

113
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:23,801
Again, a fundamental relationship.

114
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:26,764
A dependence only on the mass
of the central object,

115
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:30,830
and the semi-major axis <i>a,</i>
but this time, it's always positive.

116
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,240
In the case of the ellipse,
it's always negative.

117
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,068
We have the total energy per unit mass

118
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:39,862
equal to 0 in the case
of a parabolic trajectory.

119
00:07:40,632 --> 00:07:45,080
In the case of a parabolic trajectory,
you have a kinetic energy

120
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,535
of 0 at infinity,

121
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:51,036
and you have potential energy 0
at infinity, also, because <i>-μ/r</i>.

122
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:56,440
Let's come back to the departure
from a planet.

123
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,758
Initially, we are on the parking orbit,

124
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,708
with a radius <i>r_d</i>, d for departure.

125
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:08,090
And at this point
we increase the velocity,

126
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,456
which initially was a circular velocity
in the parking orbit,

127
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,870
to a value corresponding
to so-called <i>v_d</i>,

128
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:20,321
which puts us on a hyperbolic arc

129
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:24,598
towards this point
on the sphere of influence,

130
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:28,029
where we cross the sphere of influence,
with a velocity <i>v_d ∞</i>.

131
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:30,706
We've seen that on the previous slide.

132
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:35,291
Now, the velocity on the hyperbolic arc

133
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:40,861
is equal to <i>√(2μ/r)</i> plus

134
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,385
that's important, plus, not minus
like the case of an ellipse <i>μ/a</i>.

135
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:59,930
Now, at this point,
when we cross the sphere of influence,

136
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:05,042
we use the same equation,
and we can write here <i>v_d ∞</i>.

137
00:09:06,105 --> 00:09:09,992
And this first term,
<i>2μ/r</i>, is very small,

138
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,979
because <i>r</i> is very close to infinity
for the departure planet

139
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:19,424
we've said this before.
So, <i>v_d ∞</i> is about equal to <i>√(μ/a).</i>

140
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,019
And that's an important relationship
between the <i>v_d ∞</i>,

141
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,980
which is going to be
the increase in velocity

142
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,516
versus the circular velocity
of the Earth around the Sun,

143
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:35,086
in order to come on the elliptical arc

144
00:09:35,086 --> 00:09:39,407
towards the destination planet,
or Hohmann transfer.

145
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:45,422
So, we can write this
as <i>a=μ/(v_d ∞)^2.</i>

146
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,431
That's going to be
an important relationship.

147
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:57,894
Once we have <i>v_d ∞</i>,
which is what we need

148
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,638
to get to the Hohmann transfer
to the destination planet,

149
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:03,819
we can find the value of <i>a</i>,
which is a fundamental parameter

150
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,744
for the departure hyperbola
from the Earth.

151
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:10,708
Now, a few expressions which are useful,

152
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:14,121
<i>e</i>, the eccentricity, is equal to <i>c/a</i>.

153
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,319
You can see with this triangle here,

154
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:24,876
it's also equal to <i>(a+r_p)/a</i>.

155
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:29,644
It's always larger than 1,
in the case of a hyperbola,

156
00:10:29,644 --> 00:10:31,462
as we have already said.

157
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:35,098
And the departure angle here, <i>θ_inf</i>,

158
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:40,792
we can find on the basis of the geometry
of this illustration

159
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:46,915
that it's equal to <i>arccos(-1/e)</i>.

160
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:51,260
So, these expressions allow us
to determine the characteristics

161
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,921
of the departure hyperbola
once we know the value of the <i>v_d ∞</i>.
