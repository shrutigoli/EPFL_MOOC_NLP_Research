1
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:11,796
My name is Naoko Yamazaki,

2
00:00:11,796 --> 00:00:15,245
and I was born 
in Chiba Prefecture in Japan,

3
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:17,748
which is a suburb of Tokyo.

4
00:00:17,748 --> 00:00:20,948
And I spent two years in Hokkaido,

5
00:00:20,948 --> 00:00:24,104
which is the northern area of Japan,

6
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:26,804
with a beautiful night sky.

7
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:29,854
So I first started to be interested

8
00:00:29,854 --> 00:00:34,654
in watching stars in the night sky,

9
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:37,047
and I also liked to watch

10
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:40,147
science fiction movies like Star Wars.

11
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:43,846
So those science fiction movies
inspired me a lot,

12
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,498
and I actually believed

13
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:49,338
we would all go to space when we grew up.

14
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:53,751
And then I became an aerospace engineer,

15
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:56,951
and applied for an astronaut program.

16
00:00:56,951 --> 00:01:01,550
But, on the first trial
I didn't make it; I failed,

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,951
and on the second trial, 
I made it,

18
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,811
then I started my training in 1999.

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,401
Well, both of the training standards

20
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:28,501
are very historical and wonderful.

21
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:33,070
I had training at the Yuri Gagarin
Cosmonaut Training Center

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,000
in 2003 through 2004.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,798
And I had training
at the Johnson Space Center

24
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:45,050
from 2004 through 2010,
when I went to space.

25
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,303
And the training
at the Johnson Space Center

26
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:50,102
was very well organized,

27
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:53,172
and very practical and rational.

28
00:01:54,212 --> 00:01:56,645
They used paper exams

29
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:00,795
and simulators for practical training.

30
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:06,247
And also they trained technical skills

31
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,695
using a T-38 jet aircraft,

32
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:14,600
or in extravehicular activities,
swimming pool,

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,753
and some robotic operations
in a simulator.

34
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:21,053
So those trainings were well organized,

35
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:25,003
and I liked the international 
environment as well.

36
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:28,149
Other than 50-60 US astronauts,

37
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:32,746
there are some 20-30
international astronauts as well

38
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,498
from European countries,
Canada, and Japan.

39
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:39,945
And also there are
some visiting cosmonauts

40
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:43,446
for some training, from Russia, as well.

41
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,845
So, in this international environment,

42
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,399
we could work together

43
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,699
and we could sometimes compete together,

44
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,999
which is very good.

45
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:55,649
And, at the Yuri Gagarin
Cosmonaut Training Center,

46
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:58,753
the training were very, very traditional.

47
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:03,749
Of course, they emphasize
practical skills using simulators,

48
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:06,946
but they also emphasize on theory,

49
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:13,153
so they use oral exams
in Russian language sometimes.

50
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:17,254
Of course, we could use
Russian/English interpreter,

51
00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:19,249
but they encouraged us to use

52
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:22,099
Russian language as much as possible.

53
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,051
And we are encouraged
to learn theory as well,

54
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,000
so both training are different,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,790
but both are very wonderful.

56
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,049
Yes, yes.

57
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,254
We had to learn Russian language
for four hours a day

58
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:45,622
in the Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
Training Center.

59
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:59,254
In this picture, 
I was in Cupola.

60
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:03,753
Cupola is a European made
observatory module

61
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:07,749
attached to the ISS,
and it had seven windows,

62
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:11,499
and it is used for the Earth observations,

63
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:16,203
or some experiments,
and for robotics operations.

64
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:20,704
And, in this Cupola,
we can see in a 360Â° view

65
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:24,498
from the windows,
so it is very fantastic.

66
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:28,848
And, when I was in Cupola,
my crewmate, Soichi Noguchi,

67
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:31,250
was on board the Space Shuttle Discovery,

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,821
and he took that picture
with the Space Shuttle's window.

69
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,403
Remote Manipulator System

70
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:53,603
is a mechanical arm with three joints,

71
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:58,954
similar to our shoulder,
 elbow, and wrist.

72
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:03,747
And we have Space Shuttle
Remote Manipulator System,

73
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,754
SRMS or Canadarm,

74
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:09,247
and a Space Station RMS,

75
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,847
SSRMS or Canadarm2.

76
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:16,753
Because both RMSs
are developed in Canada,

77
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:20,800
so that's why we call it
Canadarm and Canadarm2.

78
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,398
SRMS has six degrees of freedom,

79
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:29,598
and SSRMS has seven degrees of freedom.

80
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:33,403
And both RMS are used to retrieve

81
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:38,249
and deploy payloads from payload bay,

82
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:43,500
or to the International Space Station's
constructions.

83
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:52,753
I participated in the mission of STS-131,

84
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:56,996
which is an assembly
and resupply mission of the ISS,

85
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:59,396
International Space Station.

86
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:03,003
And, on the Space Shuttle 
Discovery's cargo bay,

87
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:08,254
we attached Leonardo,
an Italian made logistics module,

88
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,895
and my crewmate, 
Stephanie, and I,

89
00:06:10,895 --> 00:06:14,495
operated Space Shuttle 
robotic's arm to retrieve it,

90
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:18,553
and then hand it over to the SSRMS,

91
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:22,051
then installed it on to the ISS.

92
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:24,414
And, after installation,

93
00:06:24,414 --> 00:06:28,504
we retrieved all the equipment 
inside of Leonardo

94
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:32,500
and installed them inside the ISS.

95
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,097
After that, 
we loaded trash,

96
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:39,097
or used equipment, 
or some samples,

97
00:06:39,097 --> 00:06:42,345
which are needed
to bring back to the Earth.

98
00:06:42,345 --> 00:06:47,403
Then we, again, 
operated SSRMS and SRMS

99
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:51,951
to retrieve Leonardo
back to the Space Shuttle cargo bay,

100
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:54,831
so that we can bring it back to the Earth.

101
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:05,195
Space Shuttle 
robotic arm, SRMS,

102
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:09,245
is 15.3 meters long,

103
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:12,651
and Space Station RMS, 
SSRMS,

104
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,951
is 17.6 meters long,

105
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:21,195
so SSRMS is a little bigger than SRMS.

106
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:26,745
The biggest difference
is while SRMS is fixed

107
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:29,401
to the Space Shuttle cargo bay,

108
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:34,798
SSRMS is on a mobile platform.

109
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:39,148
So SSRMS can slide along rails

110
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:44,050
on the Space Station's
main Truss Structure.

111
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,800
And SSRMS has an end effector 
on each side,

112
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,772
so it can actually walk like an inchworm.

113
00:07:53,152 --> 00:07:57,647
And SSRMS also can be controlled,

114
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,851
not only by a crew member on board,

115
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:04,700
but also remotely from the ground,

116
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,783
so this is the difference
between SRMS and SSRMS.

117
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,046
It was a great moment!

118
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:23,751
Space Shuttle crew members,
Stephanie Wilson,

119
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,700
Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger and myself,

120
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:31,648
and also the Space Station's
long duration expedition crew,

121
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:34,599
Tracy Caldwell Dyson,

122
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,249
all four of us were on board
at the same time.

123
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:42,699
It was a world record,
and it was a great moment.

124
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:45,345
And, right now, about 10%

125
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:49,345
of astronauts, cosmonauts,
taikonauts are female,

126
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:52,402
and I hope the ratio of female astronauts

127
00:08:52,402 --> 00:08:55,327
is increasing in the near future.

128
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,654
Well, with 13 crew members altogether

129
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:09,281
on board the International Space Station,
we had so much fun.

130
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:12,644
As you can see in this picture,

131
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,804
we have lots of backgrounds,

132
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:18,998
and different nationalities,
different cultures,

133
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:22,753
and different languages,
and we learn from each other.

134
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:27,001
So it is like a symbol
of international cooperation.

135
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,246
And, of course, on the ground,

136
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:32,596
much more people are working in the world,

137
00:09:32,596 --> 00:09:35,051
like engineers, 
like controllers,

138
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:37,751
researchers, 
all our training instructors,

139
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,704
and even lawyers or economists.

140
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:44,002
So, it was my great privilege

141
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:47,462
to be a part of this
international space program.

142
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:58,251
Especially, dinner time
was so much fun during the mission.

143
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:02,297
We usually had breakfast
and lunch individually,

144
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:05,101
but, for dinner, we usually have it

145
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:09,001
after everyone finishes 
the work of the day.

146
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:11,999
And we exchange our space food,

147
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:15,604
and, for me, I brought 
some Japanese space food,

148
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:20,602
like fish, and some seaweed,
and some curry,

149
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:23,051
and we exchanged space food,

150
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,751
and we learn our cultures, 
each other's.

151
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,651
It was a fun time.

152
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:30,801
And also, during dinner time,
like in this picture,

153
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,047
we made a water bubble,

154
00:10:33,047 --> 00:10:36,847
and we sometimes put M&amp;M chocolate in it,

155
00:10:36,847 --> 00:10:40,387
and we swallowed it,
so it was very delicious.

156
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:50,250
In Kibo module, the Japanese module,
for the night sleep,

157
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,045
but, for the daytime,
I liked to make an excursion

158
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:57,044
to everywhere in the Space Station.

159
00:10:57,504 --> 00:11:00,747
Before docking to the ISS,

160
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:03,997
or after undocking from the ISS,

161
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,997
we spent a whole day
in the Space Shuttle cockpit,

162
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:10,095
which is a very narrow space.

163
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:13,675
But, during the dock to the ISS,

164
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:19,684
I usually slept in the Japanese
experiment module on the ISS,

165
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:22,195
but some people sleep
on the Space Shuttle,

166
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,906
so it depends on people.

167
00:11:29,746 --> 00:11:32,597
Well, I think you will enjoy

168
00:11:32,597 --> 00:11:36,597
microgravity environment pretty much,

169
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:38,952
and I really enjoyed it too.

170
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:43,502
But I'd say it's about space sickness,

171
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:49,745
about 60 to 70% get space sickness
when go up to space.

172
00:11:49,745 --> 00:11:54,153
The symptoms are very similar
to motion sickness,

173
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:57,896
so we get dizzy, 
and we get some headache,

174
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,517
and sometimes we vomit.

175
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,997
But there is no correlation

176
00:12:02,997 --> 00:12:06,899
between motion sickness
and space sickness.

177
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,902
So it is very hard to predict

178
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:14,152
if you get space sickness in space or not,

179
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:20,750
so it's hard to tell
until you actually go up to space,

180
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,663
so it's an interesting point.

181
00:12:23,663 --> 00:12:27,502
But I would say
the most difficult adaptation

182
00:12:27,502 --> 00:12:31,102
happens after going back to the Earth.

183
00:12:31,102 --> 00:12:33,749
Because you feel very heavy,

184
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:36,999
especially your head gets very heavy,

185
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,245
and you lose a sense of balance

186
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:43,545
after spending a couple of times in space.

187
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:48,004
So it took, for me, about one hour

188
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:51,954
to be able to walk on the ground,

189
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:55,899
but for those who spend
about five, six months

190
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:01,499
on board the Space Station,
it usually takes a day or two

191
00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:04,497
for them to be able to walk on the ground,

192
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:09,051
and the whole rehabilitation
takes 45 days.

193
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:11,050
So I think readaptation

194
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,760
to the ground gravity is more difficult.

195
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:25,053
As an astronaut,
it was very fortunate for me

196
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,651
to be able to work with many people

197
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:31,201
from many countries, 
so I liked it.

198
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,845
And also, 
when I went up to space,

199
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:39,999
I felt very familiar
in a microgravity environment,

200
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:44,299
because I think each of us is made up

201
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:49,149
of the space star stuff originally,

202
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,949
so I think space is our home town.

203
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:54,953
It's not a faraway place;
it's our home town,

204
00:13:54,953 --> 00:13:59,247
so that's why I think
I felt very familiar in space.

205
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:03,354
And, of course,
taking a look at the Earth from space

206
00:14:03,354 --> 00:14:07,053
is just breathtaking; 
it is wonderful!

207
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:11,100
And I realized we are all citizens

208
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,000
of spaceship Earth.

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,004
Well, of course, I understood it

210
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:18,084
even before going up to space.

211
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:21,614
But, in space,
actually,

212
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:25,752
you don't think about it;
you just feel it,

213
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:31,152
so that sense of feeling
was very impressive to me.

214
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:41,849
Currently, I'm a member
of Japan's Space Policy Committee,

215
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:46,747
so I'd like to lead
a good international space project

216
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,504
in the future as well.

217
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:53,853
And also I'm an advisor
to the Young Astronauts Club,

218
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:55,948
and also several museums,

219
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:59,898
like my home town's Matsudo City Hall,

220
00:14:59,898 --> 00:15:01,951
City Hall Planetarium,

221
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:05,301
and the Chiba City Museum of Science,

222
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:08,648
and Sapporo Science Center,
and Salmon.

223
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:13,499
So I'd like to promote
space education more.

224
00:15:13,499 --> 00:15:15,997
As an advisor of a Young Astronauts Club,

225
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:20,497
and also as a part-time teacher
at several universities,

226
00:15:20,497 --> 00:15:23,447
I speak to children about space,

227
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,202
and the current space activities,

228
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:27,750
and how important space programs are.

229
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,750
So I'd like to encourage
younger generations

230
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,698
to participate in science,

231
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,229
and the space field, 
more and more.

232
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:48,946
Since my childhood,
I was interested in space itself.

233
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:51,300
And, at the age of 15,

234
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,697
I watched a Space Shuttle launch on TV,

235
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:58,052
and I was so impressed!

236
00:15:58,052 --> 00:16:02,749
Oh, it was a real world,
not in a science fiction movie,

237
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,500
so I realized there is a real rocket,

238
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,050
and a real spacecraft in the world,

239
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,846
and I wanted to become
a part of a space program.

240
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,249
And I started thinking
about the possibility

241
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:19,199
of becoming an astronaut.

242
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,503
Then I became 
an aerospace engineer, first.

243
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:28,502
Of course, in the space programs,
there are various people,

244
00:16:28,502 --> 00:16:31,702
not only engineers, 
but also researchers,

245
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:34,452
and even economists and lawyers.

246
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:40,099
But I think designing
and developing spacecrafts

247
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,549
are very attractive to me,

248
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:46,388
so I decided to become
an aerospace engineer.

249
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:48,204
And becoming an astronaut

250
00:16:48,204 --> 00:16:51,604
it's my long-term dream 
since my childhood,

251
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:53,647
so I tried and tried.

252
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:55,749
On the first trial, 
I didn't make it,

253
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,749
but, on the second one,
I fortunately made it.
