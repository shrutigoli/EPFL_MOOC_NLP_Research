1
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:08,082
We have seen that many 
identical microelectronic devices

2
00:00:08,277 --> 00:00:10,902
can be realized on 
a single wafer 

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,943
which is a technology that is 
at the basis of many 

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:17,526
high performance applications 
in nearly every domain

5
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:19,650
of our daily life. 


6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,215
The reproducibility 
of microfabrication indeed 

7
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:25,974
is a key factor 
for economic realization

8
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,271
of any consumer product. 

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,599
Therefore, these devices 
are most of the time realized

10
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:35,342
in a clean room environment
where experimental  

11
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:38,481
and manufacturing conditions 
are reproducible 

12
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:40,552
and very strictly controlled.

13
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:44,344
In this lesson, we will introduce 
a few of the basic aspects 

14
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:47,788
of the design of 
and work in a clean room. 

15
00:00:47,962 --> 00:00:51,075
We will start by discussing 
different contamination problems  

16
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,585
that may arise when one 
wants to develop 

17
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:56,045
a microfabrication process.

18
00:00:56,234 --> 00:01:00,122
We will the different sources 
that are at the basis 

19
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,952
of contamination and that can result
in failure of devices. 

20
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:09,177
We will introduce different options
for creating an environment 

21
00:01:09,377 --> 00:01:12,502
with clean air 
and for clean room construction. 

22
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:16,132
Finally, we will give an example
of a clean room

23
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:21,408
by introducing the center of micro 
and nano technology at EPFL.

24
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,122
Different types of contamination 
exist which all can compromise 

25
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:31,371
successful realization
of a microfabricated device. 

26
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,842
The first problem is posed 
by the presence particles in the air

27
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:40,913
which, when they have the size 
of the features 

28
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:45,067
of the microfabricated structure,
can result in failure 

29
00:01:45,282 --> 00:01:47,270
of the device. 

30
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:54,374
This drawing shows as an example
two micron wide metal lines 

31
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,132
which can be realized using 
a thin film deposition technique.

32
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:03,235
When during deposition, 
micro particles are situated 

33
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,727
on the substrate and when 
they have this size, 

34
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:11,330
they can give rise 
to these connected metal structure

35
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:13,303
like shown here.

36
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:18,259
Another contamination problem 
is that of iron impurities. 

37
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,856
If one works with semiconductor
circuits,

38
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:27,352
the operation of device can be 
severely disturbed

39
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:31,758
when unknown metal impurities
are present in the semi conductor. 

40
00:02:32,532 --> 00:02:36,307
Especially so-called Mobile 
Ion Contaminants 

41
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,867
or MICs,  most problems.

42
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:43,342
These contaminants are present 
in most of the chemicals 

43
00:02:43,523 --> 00:02:46,861
that are used for microfabrication
of a device. 

44
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,974
And when incorporated 
in the silicon,

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,066
they can migrate to a sensitive area
where they can cause devise failure

46
00:02:56,262 --> 00:03:00,163
even a long time after fabrication. 

47
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:06,504
This implies that chemicals 
should be as pure as possible.

48
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:11,920
The table here shows 
metal impurities

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,568
that are present in a typical
wet chemical 

50
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,048
that is used in the clean room. 

51
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,934
More generally, the presence 
of trace chemicals, 

52
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:27,577
unwanted chemicals and process water
of insufficient purity, 

53
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:31,955
can result in unwanted 
surface etching effects 

54
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:35,449
or deposition effects 
which are at origin 

55
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:40,044
of non-uniformities 
in microfabrication processes. 

56
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:44,488
If these contamination sources 
are present, 

57
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:47,696
they affect the devices 
in different ways. 

58
00:03:48,606 --> 00:03:53,081
First of all, there is the devise 
processing yield.

59
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,452
Like shown in the drawing 
on the left, 

60
00:03:57,641 --> 00:04:02,165
a change in dimension 
or an interruption of device parts 

61
00:04:02,402 --> 00:04:05,964
results in non-functional device. 

62
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:09,581
Such failure can be measured 
immediately 

63
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:13,121
after microfabrication step
by optical or microscopic inspection

64
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,438
or microscopic inspection.

65
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:20,809
Some defects are not directly 
visible but can be measured 

66
00:04:21,006 --> 00:04:24,706
by evaluation 
of the devise performance

67
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:28,389
after completion of 
the full microfabrication process. 

68
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:34,318
Usually, electrical testing allows 
eliminating devices from the wafers

69
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:38,072
or chips from the wafer 
that are not functional. 

70
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:43,521
Contamination also affects 
device reliability 

71
00:04:43,708 --> 00:04:46,796
and can cause failure of device
 a long time

72
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,294
after it's microfabrication. 

73
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,927
An example of such failure can be 
the diffusion 

74
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:57,772
of a mobile ion contaminant 
in an electronic circuit. 

75
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:01,089
The impurity can migrate 
to a sensitive region

76
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:05,023
on the wafer, a long time
after microfabrication 

77
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,446
leading to disfunctioning 
of a microelectronic circuit. 

78
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,078
An important source 
of possible contamination

79
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,857
in a clean room is the air. 

80
00:05:18,045 --> 00:05:24,719
Small particles can float in the air
and remain there for a long time. 

81
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,417
They're called also aerosols. 

82
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:31,429
The fewer and the smaller particles 
are in the air, 

83
00:05:31,638 --> 00:05:34,075
the better is the quality
of the clean room. 

84
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,138
The quality of a clean room 
is therefore characterized

85
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:40,839
by the clean room 
class number 

86
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:46,603
which is the number of particles 
above a specified diameter

87
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:49,261
in a cubic foot of air.

88
00:05:49,994 --> 00:05:56,106
For example in this graph, 
we see that the class 

89
00:05:56,311 --> 00:06:00,798
thousand clean room 
has not more than

90
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:07,419
thousand particles of half 
a micron in size per cubic foot. 

91
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,732
A class 10 clean room 
has not more than 10 

92
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:19,878
of these particles 
in a cubic foot of air. 

93
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,548
The lower the class number, 
 the better the quality 

94
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:25,288
of the clean room is. 

95
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:29,224
As a rule of thumb, particles 
that are present in the air

96
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:32,163
should not exceed half 
of the feature size

97
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:35,222
of the microstructure 
to be fabricated. 

98
00:06:35,407 --> 00:06:40,444
As examples of air quality, 
a normal house room

99
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:46,469
has a class of 100,000, while 
a very large scale integration area 

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,262
in a cleaning room 
should have class 10 

101
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,856
for particles of 0.3 micrometer. 

102
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:57,698
A person can produce 
in between 100,000

103
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:02,043
 and 1 million particles per minute
which are flakes

104
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,238
 of dead hair and skin,

105
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:07,804
while normal clothing 
adds more millions of particles. 

106
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:14,079
It is clear that the person 
has to be completely covered 

107
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,640
when he is in the clean room.

108
00:07:16,861 --> 00:07:19,398
And he needs to be covered 
with a special clean

109
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:21,676
 and dust free tissue. 

110
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:24,783
The photograph on the left 
shows the person

111
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:29,580
wearing special overshoes 

112
00:07:29,788 --> 00:07:33,150
which are above 
the normal shoes.

113
00:07:34,425 --> 00:07:39,850
The person has gloves, and he wears 
an integral clean room suit,

114
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:44,788
a mask of the mouth 
and the nose

115
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:47,629
and gloves, and glasses 
to protect the eyes.

116
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:51,474
A particular dressing protocol 
has to be followed 

117
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:57,849
when someone enters the clean room
to minimize particle contamination. 

118
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:02,758
Such protocol is shown 
in the following video. 

119
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:09,243
A person who in a clean room, first,
takes care of not entering dust

120
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:12,492
or contamination via shoes. 

121
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,938
There's a particular way 
of entering.

122
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,553
Before the barrier, the environment
is not clean

123
00:08:18,756 --> 00:08:23,068
and going in by this type of motion
during which the shoes are covered 

124
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,496
with a clean protective coating, 

125
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:28,748
ensures that no contamination 
is released from the shoes 

126
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,801
into the clean room. 

127
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:35,093
Next, follows putting on a coat 
where by one,

128
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:40,141
assures that the sleeves
do not touch the ground.

129
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:09,560
Then follows putting on this type 
of overshoes to further 

130
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:16,223
protect the clean room 
from contamination

131
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:19,192
originating from the feet. 

132
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,846
Then follows putting on a mask 
for covering the heads and the hair

133
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:33,730
and a mask that covers 
nose and mouth. 

134
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:52,927
Glasses are put on 
for eye protection and security. 

135
00:09:55,071 --> 00:10:01,459
The last stage is that the operator 
puts on gloves 

136
00:10:01,673 --> 00:10:04,023
for protection of the hands. 

137
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:12,082
Now finally, he's ready to enter
into the clean room. 

138
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:19,503
A second source of contamination
in a clean room is the water used

139
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:21,777
for processing the wafers. 

140
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:24,668
All water that is used 
has to be treated,

141
00:10:24,873 --> 00:10:29,549
as normal city water contains 
dissolved minerals,

142
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:34,213
particles and bacteria, 
which can introduce impurities 

143
00:10:34,442 --> 00:10:37,855
or non-uniformities 
during microfabrication. 

144
00:10:38,606 --> 00:10:43,157
Dissolved ions like sodium 
and chlorine ions 

145
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:47,319
can compromise quality 
of microfabricated circuits

146
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,067
and can originate from salts 
dissolved in the water. 

147
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:56,793
Therefore, the water has 
to be deionized  

148
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:01,403
and the degree of ion concentration
in the water 

149
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,212
can be measured by measuring 
the resistivity of the water.

150
00:11:06,437 --> 00:11:12,675
Indeed, if there are very few
dissolved impurities, 

151
00:11:12,865 --> 00:11:16,453
the resistivity of the water 
is very large. 

152
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,817
Eighty million Ohm centimeters. 

153
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,781
If there are more impurities, 
resistivity is much lower. 

154
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:32,611
For water used in a very large scale
integration area in a clean room, 

155
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,233
the resistivity of minimum 
18 M Ohm cm is required. 

156
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:42,764
Deionisation is a chemical process

157
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,078
that uses ion exchange resins 
that exchange protons 

158
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:54,205
and hydroxyl ions for dissolved ions
in the water. 

159
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,686
After which, protons 
and hydroxyl ions recombine 

160
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,400
to form a water molecule. 

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,012
Besides process water, 
all process chemicals and gases 

162
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,463
that are used in a clean room
should be of high purity. 

163
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:14,434
The most serious impurities 
are the metallic

164
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:18,164
 mobile ion contaminants
in chemicals. 

165
00:12:19,016 --> 00:12:22,154
And in a chemical concentration
smaller than 

166
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:25,294
one part per million
are desired.

167
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:30,317
Also common gases that are used
in a clean room such as oxygen, 

168
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,357
nitrogen and hydrogen, 
and special gases like arsine 

169
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,975
and carbon tetrafluoride, 
should be very pure. 

170
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:44,115
The gas quality can be classified
according to four criteria. 

171
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:47,534
The percentage of purity 
of the gas.

172
00:12:47,738 --> 00:12:50,813
It's water vapor content. 

173
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,292
The number of particulates 
in the gas, 

174
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:57,662
and the number of metallic ions
in the gas. 

175
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,696
The photographs on the left
show the typical infrastructure

176
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:07,047
for water and gas handling 
which is present in proximity 

177
00:13:07,263 --> 00:13:08,950
of the clean room.

178
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:14,068
How does one obtain clean air
with a minimum number of particles?

179
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,869
The first possibility is to do 
the processing of the wafers

180
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,273
in individual work stations 
with filtered air. 

181
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:27,617
These work stations or hoods 
are arranged in rows 

182
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:31,689
and are provided with 
high efficiency

183
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:36,032
particulate arrest
or HEPA filters.

184
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:39,925
which contains small holes 
and a large surface. 

185
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:44,922
Air is blown through such a filter 

186
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:49,895
and a vertical laminar flow
exposes the wafers 

187
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:53,165
that are manipulated here 
in the hood. 

188
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:58,255
So the wafers are only exposed
to highly purified air 

189
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:01,193
with the minimum number
of particles. 

190
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:05,702
If chemicals are operated 
in the hood,

191
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,027
this is not the right construction 
as the toxic fumes of the chemical

192
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:13,370
would go the operator.

193
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:17,117
If one needs to manipulate 
chemicals, 

194
00:14:17,318 --> 00:14:19,693
the hood is of this type. 

195
00:14:21,921 --> 00:14:28,959
Part of laminar flow is evacuated
via this line

196
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:33,694
so that there is no risk
for the operator who is working here

197
00:14:33,904 --> 00:14:37,492
to be in contact with these 
chemical vapors

198
00:14:38,641 --> 00:14:43,178
because basically, he's doing 
his manipulation here

199
00:14:44,288 --> 00:14:45,888
in this area. 

200
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,890
The picture on the left 
shows a hood

201
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,484
for manipulation of chemicals.

202
00:14:52,697 --> 00:14:56,560
A drawback of such laminar flow hood
is that the environmental conditions

203
00:14:56,766 --> 00:15:00,816
can change due to the people 
that are present in the room

204
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,142
and who can be the origin 
of particles underneath the hood. 

205
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:09,982
Therefore, a better but also 
a more costly solution, 

206
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:15,558
is to build this HEPA filters 
in the ceiling of the room

207
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:20,002
and provide everywhere 
in the room clean conditions. 

208
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:23,603
That is when one makes 
really clean room. 

209
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:28,717
This brings us to concept
of the total clean room

210
00:15:28,942 --> 00:15:34,292
where the complete clean room 
has purified air 

211
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:38,727
due to the presence 
of a continuous laminar flow 

212
00:15:38,953 --> 00:15:41,778
from the ceiling to the floor. 

213
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:47,356
Also, through table tops 
with perforations, and so on. 

214
00:15:48,485 --> 00:15:53,672
Purified air will expose the wafers
and the people, 

215
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:57,952
and any generated particles
will be transported away

216
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:04,244
through the floor and be purified
before being re-injected 

217
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:07,110
to HEPA filters in a clean room. 

218
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,494
The clean room not only 
has good purity of the air, 

219
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:15,267
but there is also a tight control
of the temperature 

220
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,097
which is essential for operate
and comfort 

221
00:16:19,317 --> 00:16:23,293
and for reproducibility 
of chemical processes. 

222
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:28,278
Also the humidity 
has to be controlled

223
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,814
as the presence of moisture 
on wafers 

224
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:34,580
can influence many processes

225
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:38,296
like at adherence of a photoresist 
for example. 

226
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,961
Also, smoke needs to be avoided. 

227
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:45,800
As a reactive gas, it's like ozone,

228
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:48,369
it can interfere with many
chemical processes

229
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:51,177
that are running in the clean room.

230
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:57,457
These two photographs show part
of the air-handling infrastructure

231
00:16:57,648 --> 00:17:03,249
of a clean room that is present 
above and below the clean room area.

232
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:09,985
A high quality clean room is 
essential for high quality research

233
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,084
in microfabrication related areas. 

234
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:18,417
At EPFL, we have such a clean room 
which really is a corner stone

235
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:23,290
of many of our research 
and educational activities. 

236
00:17:24,237 --> 00:17:26,763
The following video provides 
a glimpse 

237
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:31,219
of the EPFL center
of micro and nano technology. 

238
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:28,473
In this lesson I explained 
that the clean room

239
00:18:28,685 --> 00:18:32,548
 is  a necessary infrastructure for 
the reproducible microfabrication

240
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,770
of miniaturized devices. 

241
00:18:34,977 --> 00:18:38,190
Air, process chemicals, 
water and gases

242
00:18:38,397 --> 00:18:40,559
should all be of high purity. 

243
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,129
We have discussed two approaches
of creating 

244
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,019
a clean room environment. 

245
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,962
First there was the laminar 
flow hood for creating

246
00:18:48,152 --> 00:18:50,189
 locally clean air conditions

247
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:53,347
and next, there was a total 
clean room strategy 

248
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:55,622
Finally, I introduce to you

249
00:18:55,846 --> 00:19:00,359
the center of micro 
and nano technology at EPFL.
