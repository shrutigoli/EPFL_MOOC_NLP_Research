00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,357
Welcome to this lesson on MEMS
success stories.

2
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:11,281
Before we go into detail of the

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,006
various micro nanofabrication

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,994
methods, let's have a quick look

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:18,656
what MEMS are and how we are
actually using them day by day.

6
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,659
We have invited for this lesson

7
00:00:20,724 --> 00:00:24,049
a guest lecturer who is a real
expert in the field so let 

8
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:26,622
me introduce Dr. Julien Arcamone.

9
00:00:27,536 --> 00:00:29,386
He is responsible for the industrial

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,352
partnerships and business
development in MEMS within

11
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:34,069
the Silicon Components Division

12
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:36,369
of CEA-LETI in Grenoble, France

13
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,814
one of the largest MEMS R&D
centres and foundries.

14
00:00:40,414 --> 00:00:42,677
Julien will show you some selected

15
00:00:42,714 --> 00:00:44,864
MEMS examples, he will in particular

16
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:46,977
highlight how micro fabrication has

17
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,039
enabled such systems to become so

18
00:00:49,077 --> 00:00:51,552
performing and cost efficient
to manufacture.

19
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:53,853
So Julien, the floor is yours.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,390
Thank you Jurgen for the introduction.

21
00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:59,296
Hello, it's my honor and pleasure

22
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:01,721
to give this lesson on successful
MEMS products.

23
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,571
Let's start right away.

24
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:06,545
So maybe not everyone has noticed

25
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:08,657
yet, but MEMS have become ubiquitous

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,670
in our daily life.

27
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,395
One example is a multiplicity of

28
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:14,420
MEMS devices inside smartphones.

29
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,807
This scheme depicts a tear down view

30
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:21,607
of the iPhone 6 and the various MEMS
devices present inside it.

31
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:25,318
In this lesson, I'd like to focus on

32
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:26,681
3 applications.

33
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:31,406
First accelerometers, so
acceleration sensors.

34
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:34,031
Second, microphones

35
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:38,056
Third, BAW resonators and filters

36
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:41,668
BAW stands for Bulk Acoustic 
Wave Resonators.

37
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,868
Let's start with the accelerometers.

38
00:01:45,243 --> 00:01:46,781
Technically speaking, the most

39
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:50,443
classical device is a capacitive
comb-drive accelerometer

40
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,643
with electrostatic actuation 

41
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,143
and capacitive detection by means of

42
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,918
a set of lateral combs.

43
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:01,093
The physical principle

44
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:02,131
is rather simple.

45
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:07,131
This sensor detects a capacitance
variation induced by an acceleration.

46
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,808
Let's illustrate how this
device works.

47
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,450
This scheme depicts a top view of a

48
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:17,363
proof mass, which is sensitive to

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,275
accelerations around the X axis.

50
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:26,234
This proof mass acts as an inertial
mass. It can move laterally and is

51
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,821
anchored in 4 points.

52
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,720
In this picture, the movable 
suspended parts are in grey

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,482
the anchored or fixed 
ones are in black.

54
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,842
Typically a proof mass is between

55
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,942
100 and 200 microns wide and long.

56
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:44,580
This proof mass is equipped with a

57
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,855
set of lateral comb fingers.

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,180
They all have an opposite and

59
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:55,280
mechanically fixed comb finger.

60
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,628
The fact of using combs provides

61
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,641
a larger capacitive area which turns

62
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:04,253
into an enhanced capacitive readout.

63
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:08,163
Let's zoom in on a few fingers

64
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:12,326
In this example, 4 capacitors 
are depicted.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,343
Always a capacitance C, and a gap G.

66
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,260
The 2 ones on the left are polarized
at plus V IN.

67
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:28,010
The 2 others at minus V IN.

68
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,827
Let's suppose for example an

69
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:35,089
acceleration towards the right side.

70
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:40,578
It induces a counter force 
towards the left

71
00:03:41,078 --> 00:03:45,603
which makes the proof mass and it's
combs move towards the left too.

72
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:48,220
So let's show it again.

73
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,235
Consequently as the gap narrows

74
00:03:54,435 --> 00:03:57,135
the capacitance of the 2 left

75
00:03:57,185 --> 00:04:01,397
capacitors becomes C plus Delta C

76
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,067
The capacitance of the 2 right ones

77
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:11,179
becomes C minus Delta C
as the gap widens.

78
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:14,794
Overall this provides a differential

79
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:17,831
readout and the output voltage

80
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:21,031
is approximately equal to
Delta C over C.

81
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,726
The key parameter in terms of

82
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,251
sensitivity and resolution  also

83
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,451
name d limit of detection is a gap G

84
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:33,560
which must be minimized as 
much as possible.

85
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:36,592
It is generally in the
range of 1 micron.

86
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,904
This video is recorded inside a 

87
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,554
scanning electron microscope.

88
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:45,945
So the images here are recorded with

89
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:46,995
an increasing zoom.

90
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:56,524
Here you can see the  polysilicon 
structures, with the moving parts

91
00:04:56,724 --> 00:05:02,311
in particular the combs moving in
front of the reference electrodes.

92
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:07,500
So the motion is the combination

93
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:11,675
of the electrostatic attraction and

94
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:14,338
the restoring force of the springs.

95
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:19,232
Basically here the motion is in the

96
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,907
range of a few microns naturally.

97
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:26,182
This is just an example of layout

98
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:31,182
but of course many designs are
possible to make the same function.

99
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:35,797
Let's take an example of fabrication

100
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,697
process of such capacitive
accelerometers.

101
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:42,721
This scheme depicts a cross
sectional view at the 

102
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,081
end of the process.

103
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,088
The MEMS layer can be either a

104
00:05:47,126 --> 00:05:49,376
monocrystalline silicon layer

105
00:05:49,413 --> 00:05:51,113
if an SOI substrate is used

106
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:53,976
or a polycrystalline silicon layer

107
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:55,801
also named polysilicon.

108
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,298
The routing of the mechanical
structures is made with partially

109
00:06:00,323 --> 00:06:02,885
suspended polysilicon interconnects.

110
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,054
the mechanical structures are
released by removing the underlying

111
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,329
silicon oxide sacrificial layer

112
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:12,816
by wet or vapor HF etching.

113
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:16,199
HF stands for hydrofluoric acid.

114
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:21,004
The MEMS active parts are
encapsulated by a polysilicon

115
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,829
thin-film packaging which provides

116
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:28,379
an hermetic cavity at ambient
pressure protecting the MEMS from

117
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:31,191
moisture, humidity and dust.

118
00:06:31,913 --> 00:06:34,400
The input and output signals

119
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:37,425
are brought and picked up through

120
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,238
metal pads, here for example.

121
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,100
Or here.

122
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,685
Let's also mention that some silicon
structures are on top of 

123
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:50,885
silicon nitride pillars in order to

124
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,660
electrically isolate them
from the substrate.

125
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,382
One of the key steps

126
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:58,394
is the Deep Reactive ION Etching

127
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,418
abbreviated as DRIE

128
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,756
of the silicon MEMS layer.

129
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:08,147
This etching has to provide vertical
and smooth side walls

130
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:10,922
with a high aspect ratio
of at least 20.

131
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:13,597
The thicker a silicon MEMS layer

132
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:18,485
the wider is the gap due to the
maximum affordable aspect ratio,

133
00:07:19,456 --> 00:07:25,031
Typically the silicon MEMS layer is
around 20 microns thick

134
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:28,231
and the gap is around 1 micron wide.

135
00:07:29,856 --> 00:07:32,406
Let's zoom on a particular area.

136
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:35,696
This scanning electron microscope

137
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,683
abbreviated as SEM

138
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:43,071
image depicts a set of movable 
and fixed comb fingers.

139
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,693
They feature all the necessary

140
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,780
characteristics I mention.

141
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,717
They have vertical and smooth 

142
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,755
side walls and small gaps.

143
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:58,222
So let's talk about application now.

144
00:07:58,406 --> 00:08:02,181
First, which MEMS companies sell
these kinds of devices?

145
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:06,094
Let's site Bosch, STMicro Electronics

146
00:08:06,294 --> 00:08:09,581
InvenSense, Analog Devices, etc.

147
00:08:10,913 --> 00:08:13,213
As I mentioned before accelerometers

148
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,151
are present inside smartphones

149
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,776
in particular for screen rotation

150
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,188
and for gaming.

151
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:23,193
I like to mention another use case

152
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:25,618
inertial MEMS are also widely used

153
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:28,318
in automotive for various purposes.

154
00:08:28,752 --> 00:08:32,227
Let's take the example of NXP's 
HARMEMS technology

155
00:08:32,735 --> 00:08:35,535
Such accelerometers are implemented

156
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,072
to detect front or side crash

157
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,335
in order to trigger airbags

158
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,260
In the left picture the car contains

159
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:46,472
5 so called accelerometer satellites
or modules.

160
00:08:47,385 --> 00:08:50,172
At the center of the car an airbag

161
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,422
electronic control unit, ECU

162
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:56,297
also senses crashes and
triggers airbags.

163
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,662
Let's move to example 2

164
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,174
microphones in smartphones.

165
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:04,223
Generally what is called a
MEMS microphone

166
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:05,911
is a dual-die component.

167
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:08,661
The MEMS microphone itself

168
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:12,701
most of them are based on 
capacitive  detection

169
00:09:12,738 --> 00:09:15,313
and its ASIC readout circuit.

170
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,045
ASIC as you may know stands for

171
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,565
Application Specific
Integrated Circuit.

172
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:24,218
They are connected one to another
by wire bonding.

173
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:28,714
MEMS and ASIC dies are both housed

174
00:09:28,764 --> 00:09:30,951
inside a package which has

175
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:33,014
a sound port, either on the top side

176
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:34,826
or at the bottom of the package.

177
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,326
This scheme depicts a bottom port
component.

178
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,784
The package has multiple functions

179
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:45,922
of course as in all MEMS. it
protects the device and provides

180
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,372
a crucial electromagnetic shielding.

181
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:50,559
In addition to that the back chamber

182
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:52,384
plays a very important role on the

183
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:53,672
acoustic performance.

184
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:56,434
The larger it is, the higher the

185
00:09:56,447 --> 00:10:00,184
signal to noise ratio,
abbreviated as SNR.

186
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:03,751
Although piezoelectric microphones

187
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:08,113
are emerging, capacitive ones are by
far the most widely used.

188
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:10,233
How do they work?

189
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:12,723
Basically there are 2 suspended parts

190
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:14,985
a moveable membrane, here in red

191
00:10:16,085 --> 00:10:19,910
and a fixed back plate
here in purple.

192
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,633
Both form a variable capacitor which

193
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:25,258
senses the motion of a moveable

194
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:28,645
membrane caused by any incoming
sound wave.

195
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,539
In this example the sound comes

196
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:35,114
from the bottom and the package is
not depicted.

197
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:38,407
To repeat again, the sound wave

198
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:41,207
generates a pressure differential 

199
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,957
between the front and back chamber

200
00:10:43,398 --> 00:10:45,585
consequently the membrane is deformed

201
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:48,398
and this results in a
capacitance variation.

202
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:54,517
The membrane contains ventilation
holes, not depicted here, to allow

203
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,867
the compressed air of the back
chamber to flow out.

204
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:03,020
The back plate contains perforation
holes basically to transmit the

205
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:04,446
sound to the back chamber.

206
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:09,383
The membrane diameter is typically
in the order of 1 millimeter. 

207
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:12,208
Regarding the microphone bandwidth

208
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:17,920
it has to cover the human ear 
bandwidth, so from 20Hz up to 20KHz.

209
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,925
Let's turn to the fabrication
process of such sensors.

210
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:28,200
This example is quite representative
of all capacitive MEMS microphones.

211
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:31,402
Generally the process is a mix of

212
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:33,627
surface and bulk micromachining,

213
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:36,945
The first critical process module

214
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:41,195
is a deposition of the low-stress
polysilicon membrane on top of

215
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:42,684
a SiO2 layer.

216
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:46,462
The second critical process module

217
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,682
is a successive deposition of a
thick polysilicon layer

218
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:54,619
and of a highly tensile
silicon nitrate layer.

219
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,689
These 2 layers form the back plate

220
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:59,414
which must be rigid enough

221
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,590
to constitute a fixed
reference electrode.

222
00:12:03,618 --> 00:12:06,481
Finally, metal interconnects are

223
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,193
deposited in pattern.

224
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,050
Another important step consists

225
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:15,250
in realizing a deep cavity
from the back side.

226
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:19,007
It's obtained either by wet etch

227
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,662
for instance with KOH

228
00:12:20,724 --> 00:12:22,812
or DRIE.

229
00:12:23,192 --> 00:12:25,142
The first option is cheaper

230
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,973
but side walls are inclined.

231
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:31,783
The second one, with deep reactive
ion etching, represented here

232
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,361
is more expensive, but side walls

233
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,186
are vertical, which provides
a larger cavity.

234
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:40,492
The final critical step

235
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,263
is a membrane release by removal

236
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:46,994
of sacrificial SiO2 layer by
wet or vapor etch.

237
00:12:47,553 --> 00:12:50,778
Anti stiction control is crucial
during this step.

238
00:12:52,555 --> 00:12:54,805
So let's talk about application now.

239
00:12:55,752 --> 00:12:58,714
First, which MEMS companies sell
these kinds of devices?

240
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:04,694
Let's site Knowles, Infineon, OMRON,
STMicro, InvenSense, etc.. 

241
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,842
As I mentioned before microphones

242
00:13:07,911 --> 00:13:09,924
are present inside smartphones.

243
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,282
The image below illustrates the

244
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,072
number of MEMS microphones inside

245
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,882
the iPhone as a function of
its generation.

246
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:23,036
Nowadays, the iPhone 6 contains
4 microphones.

247
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,231
Some are used to pick up the voice

248
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:29,756
others for the cancellation of
surrounding parasitic noise

249
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:33,781
and the least main function
is for the hands free kit.

250
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,772
Let's move to example 3.

251
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:40,431
BAW resonators in smartphones.

252
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:44,760
As I said, BAW stands for Bulk
Acoustic Wave resonators.

253
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,359
The resonance frequency generally

254
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,884
in the range of the gigahertz. 

255
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:52,340
In terms of structure, BAW uses a 

256
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:57,052
piezoelectric layer made of
aluminium nitride most of the time

257
00:13:57,252 --> 00:14:00,352
sandwiched between a bottom and
a top electrode.

258
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:03,175
usually made of molybdenum. 

259
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,387
In terms of resonance mode

260
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:07,898
a thickness mode, either with

261
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,510
longitudinal or shared vibration
is operated.

262
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,676
In the longitudinal mode, the
resonator expands and contracts

263
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:22,363
all the time in the direction
of its thickness.

264
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:27,985
Its resonance frequency is half the
velocity of sound

265
00:14:28,064 --> 00:14:30,339
divided by the resonator thickness.

266
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,341
The velocity of sound is the square 

267
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,041
root of the young modulus
divided by the density.

268
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,069
With a thickness of 1 micron

269
00:14:41,101 --> 00:14:44,101
approximately the resonance is
around 5 gigahertz.

270
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:48,827
BAW resonators are used to implement

271
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,263
band-pass filters, I'll get back to
this in the next slide.

272
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:56,912
In this sense the so called
KT square coupling coefficient

273
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:58,981
is critical in terms of filter

274
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:00,932
bandwidth and insertion loss.

275
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:04,235
The KT square is given by the ratio

276
00:15:04,282 --> 00:15:07,007
between the difference between the

277
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:09,986
resonance frequency and the
antiresonance frequency

278
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,428
divided by the resonance frequency.

279
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,042
In fact, the KT square depends on

280
00:15:16,051 --> 00:15:18,126
piezoelectric material properties

281
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:20,630
therefore the deposition and further

282
00:15:20,692 --> 00:15:23,530
process of the piezoelectric layer
is crucial.

283
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:28,654
How can we build a filter using
BAW resonators?

284
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,974
Basically by implementing a
ladder filter architecture.

285
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:36,729
It's unit cell that can be
replicated n times

286
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,687
contains 2 BAW resonators

287
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:43,704
a series one and a shunt 
connected to ground.

288
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,310
Let's explain how it works by
observing the filter response.

289
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,810
At the center of the slide

290
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:54,233
the frequency response of the shunt

291
00:15:54,276 --> 00:15:56,439
resonator is depicted at the top.

292
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,024
The one of the series resonator

293
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,059
is depicted here

294
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,237
And this is the response
on the whole filter.

295
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:07,799
Please note that the shunt resonator

296
00:16:07,861 --> 00:16:11,349
response is shifting down to lower 

297
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,089
frequencies, such that the shunt

298
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:18,546
antiresonance coincides with
the series resonance.

299
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:24,776
In state A, both resonators are

300
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:27,177
far from the resonance frequency.

301
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:32,062
Therefore, they both behave
as capacitors.

302
00:16:33,677 --> 00:16:36,990
In state B, the series resonator

303
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,532
is still far from resonance.

304
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,296
And it behaves as a capacitor.

305
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:46,496
While the shunt one is at resonance

306
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:49,996
in other words its impedance
is minimum.

307
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:55,044
In fact, in this state, its
impedance is equal to its

308
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:57,145
so called motional resistance

309
00:16:57,746 --> 00:16:59,984
which is less than 1 ohm.

310
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,555
As a consequence the output node

311
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:10,252
is almost grounded and there
is no signal transmission.

312
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:16,358
In state C the series resonator

313
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,871
is at resonance. In other words

314
00:17:18,941 --> 00:17:22,491
its impedance is minimum and
of less than 1 ohm.

315
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:26,659
In the meantime the shunt one is at

316
00:17:26,685 --> 00:17:28,585
its antiresonance.

317
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,311
In other words its at its maximum

318
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:34,351
impedance and it behaves as an
open circuit.

319
00:17:35,351 --> 00:17:39,026
As a consequence the impedance

320
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:41,752
between input and output nodes

321
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:46,333
is minimum and a signal transmission
is maximum.

322
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:51,756
In state D the series resonator

323
00:17:51,828 --> 00:17:53,978
is at its antiresonance, in other 

324
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:56,381
words, at its maximum impedance.

325
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,680
And it behaves as an open circuit.

326
00:18:00,357 --> 00:18:03,357
The shunt one is far from resonance

327
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:05,421
and behaves as a capacitor. 

328
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,264
As a consequence, the impedance

329
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,582
between input and output nodes

330
00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:14,437
is maximum and signal transmission
is minimum.

331
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:20,550
In state E, the situation is very

332
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:21,907
similar to state A.

333
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:25,421
Both resonators behave as capacitors.

334
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:28,745
So this is basically a summary

335
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,370
of how a ladder filter using

336
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:33,856
BAW resonators works.

337
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:38,301
Let's turn to the fabrication
process of BAW.

338
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,548
Let's first mention that there are 2
types of BAW due to the fact that

339
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:45,390
there are 2 main approaches  of

340
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,082
acoustic wave confinement.

341
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:52,479
So called FBAR, thin-Film Back
Acoustic wave Resonators

342
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:56,294
are suspended resonators
over an air gap.

343
00:18:56,908 --> 00:19:02,895
So called SMR, Solidly Mounted
Resonators, consist of unreleased 

344
00:19:02,952 --> 00:19:05,952
resonators, so I mean not suspended

345
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:09,024
located over a Bragg mirror that

346
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:10,521
reflects back the waves.

347
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:12,406
We will focus on this type.

348
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:17,587
This is a cross sectional view
of an SMR, processed on a 

349
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,522
high resistivity silicon substrate

350
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,898
You can see the Bragg mirrors here

351
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,964
which are made of tungsten plates

352
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,921
surrounded by SiO2

353
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:32,055
The first critical process module

354
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:37,268
consists in depositing an aluminium
nitride layer by physical vapor

355
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,958
deposition on top of a properly

356
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:43,879
oriented molybdenum bottom electrode.

357
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,634
This sputtering technique allows

358
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:52,075
obtaining first, a precise and
uniform thickness, have in mind 

359
00:19:52,118 --> 00:19:54,056
that the resonance frequency is

360
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,611
inversely proportional to the

361
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,353
thickness, and second

362
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,437
good piezoelectric properties which

363
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,419
result in high KT square.

364
00:20:03,122 --> 00:20:07,009
The top electrode is also made of
molybdenum.

365
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:13,669
Another important step is the mass
loading of shunt resonators.

366
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:16,777
In fact, shunt and series resonators

367
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,612
are identical by design.

368
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:21,869
Then this mass deposition on top of

369
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:26,157
the shunt resonators allows for

370
00:20:26,203 --> 00:20:27,916
quickly decreasing the resonance

371
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:31,077
frequency so that the antiresonance

372
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,653
coincides with the series resonator
resonance as I explained in the

373
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,702
previous slide.

374
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,471
The second critical process step

375
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,995
is wafer-scale ion beam trimming.

376
00:20:44,464 --> 00:20:47,001
By locally moving some material

377
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:49,227
the ion beam allows precisely

378
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,150
adjusting the resonance frequencies

379
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,979
of each series and shunt resonators

380
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,724
It's very important that each filter

381
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,769
has the same bandwidth and center 
frequency.

382
00:21:01,847 --> 00:21:06,522
The resonators have a silicon
nitride passivation, in green

383
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:10,072
and are capped with a thin-film
packaging, in pink

384
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,038
to provide them with an hermetic and
clean cavity at ambient pressure.

385
00:21:15,348 --> 00:21:18,648
This optical microscope image shows

386
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:20,823
the top view of a filter chip at the

387
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,444
end of the fabrication process.

388
00:21:23,064 --> 00:21:26,101
Basically the white squares
and rectangles

389
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:28,981
are metallic contact pads.

390
00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:32,672
And the coloured squares are BAW

391
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,653
resonators which have a typical

392
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,908
150 by 150 square micron area.

393
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,636
Depending on whether they are mass

394
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:43,503
loaded or not, I mean series or

395
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:47,071
shunt, the resonators colour
is different.

396
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,170
So let's talk about application now.

397
00:21:51,494 --> 00:21:53,694
First, which MEMS companies sell

398
00:21:53,755 --> 00:21:55,030
these kinds of devices?

399
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,709
Let's site Avaga that produces FBARs

400
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:01,677
and Qorvo and TDK-EPCOS that
produce SMR's.

401
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,628
BAW band-pass filters have become

402
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,790
a key element of RF front-end
modules of smartphones.

403
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,903
Such modules are essentially the

404
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:21,579
RF stage located between the antenna
and the analog digital convertor. 

405
00:22:22,277 --> 00:22:25,214
In this context BAW filters are used

406
00:22:25,258 --> 00:22:28,258
to select a given telecom band.

407
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:32,567
In green you can see all the filters

408
00:22:32,606 --> 00:22:35,606
present in this example of
front end module.

409
00:22:36,095 --> 00:22:38,632
And for example the iPhone 6S

410
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:42,971
contains more than 20 BAW filters

411
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:46,918
dies either for 4G or LTE connection

412
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:49,605
or for Wi-Fi connection.

413
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,097
I'd like to wrap up this lesson.

414
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:57,401
We've analysed 3 examples of
commercially successful MEMS devices

415
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:02,156
All these devices have been sold in
the hundreds of millions of units

416
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:05,321
and all of them rely on advanced

417
00:23:05,355 --> 00:23:08,155
micro and nano fabrication techniques

418
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:11,906
that you will see in the upcoming
lessons of this MOOC.

419
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:14,917
Thanks for your attention.
