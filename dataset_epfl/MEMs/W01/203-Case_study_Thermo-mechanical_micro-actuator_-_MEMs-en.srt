1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,949


2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:07,009
Welcome to this lesson in micro
and nano fabrication.

3
00:00:07,447 --> 00:00:09,873
The picture behind me shows
a colorful SEM image

4
00:00:10,073 --> 00:00:11,948
of a bi-morph MEMS activator.

5
00:00:12,148 --> 00:00:14,872
And in the next few minutes,
I will show how it was fabricated

6
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:16,722
in our clean room at EPFL.

7
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:20,188
Although it does not involve all
possible fabrication steps

8
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,276
that are nowadays available 
in advanced MEMS processes.

9
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:27,420
It initiates you the students
to the basics of a process flow.

10
00:00:27,771 --> 00:00:30,196
As you will see, the fabrication
is a well defined sequence 

11
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:34,571
of lithography, thin film deposition,
as well as wet and dry etching.

12
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:35,896
In my left hand,

13
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,609
I'm holding a silicon wafer 
before the fabrication.

14
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:41,866
And in my right hand, you see
a similar wafer containing

15
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:45,491
hundreds, if not thousands, of MEMS
devices like in the background.

16
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:48,323
But before diving into 
microfab aspects,

17
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:52,051
let's briefly recall how a thermal
mechanical device, or bi-morph,

18
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:53,214
actually works.

19
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:57,969
A bi-morph is a device that can take
two or more shapes.

20
00:00:58,169 --> 00:01:01,719
'Bi' means 2 in Latin, and 'morph'
means shape in Greek.

21
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:05,512
On the right side you see a typical
example of a bi-morph

22
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:08,162
made by 2 thin films.
In our case,

23
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,999
<i>SiO2</i> in green,

24
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:14,678
and Chromium in blue.

25
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:17,546
Since both materials 
have very different 

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,934
thermal expansion coefficients α, 

27
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:22,735
they induce a bending when
the temperature changes.

28
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:26,406
When you apply a voltage
to the Chrome layer...

29
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:31,328
you induce a current

30
00:01:31,528 --> 00:01:34,178
that will heat up, this...

31
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:38,721
cantilever, and by the temperature
change will induce bending.

32
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:42,598
The curvature radius of the bending
can be expressed as

33
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:45,061
by a formula shown here.

34
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,636
Where the radius of curvature

35
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:50,286
is described by β

36
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:54,697
times the difference in thermal
expansion coefficients 

37
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,422
of the 2 materials, Chrome and
Silicon dioxide

38
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,073
and the temperature change.

39
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:03,573
β is a constant, as a function of
the thickness of the device

40
00:02:03,786 --> 00:02:05,386
and its Young's modulus.

41
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,597
Other formula

42
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:10,885
to describe the system are
the spring constant

43
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:14,210
of the cantilever, and 
the resonance frequency.

44
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,910
And here's a list of all
important parameters

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,435
that can be used to describe
the system.

46
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:22,935
In the accompanying documents
you can see how this formula

47
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:25,410
can be derived from basic physics.

48
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,687
The process flow is typically shown
schematically by a sequence

49
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:31,474
of cross section figures.

50
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:33,556
In the case of the bi-morph 
cantilevers, 

51
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:36,281
there are 7 major process steps.

52
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:39,489
The representation is 
in principle sufficient

53
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,639
to show the effect of added
thin films,

54
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:44,627
and the effect of wet and dry 
etching on each layer.

55
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,625
Such a document will accompany 
the wafer during the process.

56
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,713
You know always exactly at which 
step of the process the wafer is.

57
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:55,063
And what process parameters
have been applied to each wafer.

58
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:57,950
Now let's have a look at each
of the 7 steps

59
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,358
in detail, 1 by 1.

60
00:03:02,173 --> 00:03:04,886
The first step is to grow
a Silicon dioxide layer,

61
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,473
which will be one of the 2
bi-morph materials.

62
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:09,410
Before the actual oxidation,

63
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,310
the wafer is thoroughly cleaned.

64
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,685
This process is called RCA cleaning,

65
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,635
which is an industry standard 
since the 1960s,

66
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:18,560
and consists of a couple of steps.

67
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,107
Wet oxidation is then carried out
in the furnace 

68
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:24,019
with oxygen rich atmosphere.

69
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,889
Silicon on the surface is thereby
transformed

70
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,914
into a Silicon dioxide layer
that grows with time,

71
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,427
while consuming 
the underlying silicon.

72
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,996
To form a 1.5 micrometre
thick SiO2 layer,

73
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,368
we typically oxidise the silicon 
wafer during 6 hours

74
00:03:39,712 --> 00:03:41,387
at 1100 degrees C.

75
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,905
Here you see a couple of
silicon wafers,

76
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:49,141
100 millimetre in diameter 
or 4 inch.

77
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,808
The centre is a silicon wafer 
without any silicon dioxide,

78
00:03:53,142 --> 00:03:55,567
looks grey, and here is
a couple of

79
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,849
silicon wafers with different
silicon dioxide thicknesses

80
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,661
ranging from 100 nanometre,
up to 10 micrometre.

81
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,283
We can see clearly the difference
in colour,

82
00:04:05,483 --> 00:04:07,221
which is due to the interference

83
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:10,217
of the dielectric thin film on
the silicon wafer.

84
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:12,347
With experience, one can actually

85
00:04:12,547 --> 00:04:15,184
indicate already what thickness
the wafer is.

86
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:19,308
However, to measure precisely, one
will then rely on an ellipsometer.

87
00:04:21,754 --> 00:04:24,142
Step 2 is the physical vapor
deposition

88
00:04:24,342 --> 00:04:25,529
of the chromium layer.

89
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,592
Which is the second material in
the bi-morph cantilever.

90
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,973
This layer serves 2 purposes.

91
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:34,998
First, as a thin conductor, it will
allow driving a current to heat up

92
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,561
the surface that will result in
the bi-morph activation.

93
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,500
Second, chromium is chosen before
other metals

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,112
because it has very different 
thermal expansion coefficient 

95
00:04:44,312 --> 00:04:45,487
than silicon dioxide.

96
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:50,060
This mismatch will induce a very
pronounced bi-morph effect when heated.

97
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,760
In this particular case,
we deposit

98
00:04:51,985 --> 00:04:54,472
a 500 nanometre thick chromium layer

99
00:04:54,672 --> 00:04:57,922
using an electron beam evaporator
equipment.

100
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:00,584
And here on the right side,

101
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,284
you see 2 photos.

102
00:05:02,597 --> 00:05:04,534
The left one shows a silicon wafer

103
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:07,359
with the 1.5 micrometer
silicon dioxide

104
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,292
appearing again, colorful.

105
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,916
And the right photo shows the same
wafer,

106
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:16,678
after having been coated with 
500 nanometer chromium.

107
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,616
Now the wafer looks again like
a reflecting mirror.

108
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,673
This photo shows the PVD thermal
evaporator equipment

109
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:24,860
in our clean room.

110
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:28,945
With the scientist loading evaporating
material at the lower part.

111
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,789
The substrate wafers will be mounted
on the upper part,

112
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,985
which gives a long source substrate
distance for optimal film uniformity.

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,978
Once the substrates are loaded, 

114
00:05:41,178 --> 00:05:43,678
the door will be closed, and the air
will be pumped out

115
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,578
to install the high vacuum.

116
00:05:46,542 --> 00:05:48,905
Step 3 shows the first
photo-lithography step

117
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:51,767
that has to go to pattern the chrome
layer into micro heaters

118
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,567
that are subsequently used
to heat up the cantilever

119
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,167
and to induce its bending.

120
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,004
Photo-lithography is the process
step that creates

121
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:00,742
the pattern in the photoresist

122
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,328
by local elimination through
an exposure mask.

123
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,696
The exposed resist is developed

124
00:06:05,896 --> 00:06:08,371
and remaining resist pattern 
protects the underlying material

125
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,796
from being etched.

126
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:14,363
So on these 2 photos,
you see on the left side,

127
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:17,190
a computer drawing of 
the design layout,

128
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,690
where we see 4 heater loops

129
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,028
in chrome.

130
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:25,921
On the mask, and on the right side,

131
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:27,246
we see the fabricated results.

132
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:30,171
So what you see here in brownish,

133
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:33,933
is the pattern photo-resist
on top of the chrome layer.

134
00:06:34,134 --> 00:06:36,234
This is the step after 
the lithography

135
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:38,234
before actually 
the chrome etching.

136
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,452
In this video sequence,

137
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,314
you see how the photo-resist is
spin coated 

138
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:46,914
on the wafer substrate.

139
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:48,568
To this end,

140
00:06:48,768 --> 00:06:50,268
the wafer is spun at high speed

141
00:06:50,468 --> 00:06:52,943
and the resist is dispensed
in the center. 

142
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:57,399
This forms a uniformed resist layer
over the entire wafer surface.

143
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,722
We will see details, how thick?

144
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:03,522
And how uniformed 
the resist film is?

145
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,147
In the dedicated lesson 
on lithography.

146
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,648
Once the photo-resist is patterned,

147
00:07:08,848 --> 00:07:10,786
we can now proceed 
to etch the chrome.

148
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:13,886
To this end, we use a dedicated
chromate solution as shown

149
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,686
on the upper right corner.

150
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,586
The wafer with the photo-resist
pattern is placed

151
00:07:17,786 --> 00:07:19,186
into the chromate solution

152
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,662
after the chrome has completely
etched through,

153
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,974
a strong color contrast appears
on the wafer.

154
00:07:24,174 --> 00:07:26,174
At this point, the photo-resist
can be removed

155
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:28,312
by a so called stripping process

156
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,624
followed by thorough rinsing
and cleaning.

157
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:33,416
Here you can see 2 photographs.

158
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,822
On the left side you see
the situation,

159
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:38,222
after the lithography, with the
photo-resist 

160
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:39,547
on the chrome.

161
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:41,471
And on the right side, 
you see the situation 

162
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:44,659
after the chrome etching,
and the photo-resist stripping.

163
00:07:44,885 --> 00:07:46,235
(INAUDIBLE) nicely,

164
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:48,147
the well defined chrome pattern

165
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,622
that will define the micro heaters
on top of the <i>SiO2</i> layer.

166
00:07:53,061 --> 00:07:55,548
Now that the chrome is patterned, 
we can structure the underlying 

167
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:58,523
<i>SiO2</i> layer to carve out
the cantilever shape.

168
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:03,013
This step also defines the shape
of the anisotropic silicon etch

169
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:05,301
to release the beam
from the substrate.

170
00:08:05,782 --> 00:08:09,268
Before UV exposure, the photo mask
is aligned to the first one

171
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,406
by means of a so called
mask aligner.

172
00:08:11,802 --> 00:08:14,864
The left image shows the cut
mask lay out,

173
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,427
where as the right image, shows
the optical photo

174
00:08:18,627 --> 00:08:20,314
of the 4 cantilevers.

175
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,295
One can actually see clearly
the 2 layers now.

176
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:26,833
The shape, of the cantilever in
transparent photo-resist

177
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:29,364
defined in the second
lithography.

178
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:33,576
And the chromium, that was defined
in the first lithography step.

179
00:08:34,174 --> 00:08:35,899
This allows checking that
the alignment

180
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,674
of the mask is within 
the tolerant specifications.

181
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,374
The photo-resist that we patterned
in the previous steps

182
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:45,324
serves now to protect the silicon
dioxide during the etching

183
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,224
in buffered hydrochloric acid, 
<i>BHF.</i>

184
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:52,272
This etchant has <i>SiO2</i> etch rate
of about 80 nanometer per minute.

185
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,762
And the etch selectivity to silicon
is almost infinite.

186
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:58,899
Thus for etching the 1.5 micrometer 
thick silicon dioxide,

187
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,225
we typically need about
20 minutes etch time

188
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:03,662
which stops naturally at
the silicon surface.

189
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,937
Be very cautious. 
<i>BHF</i> is dangerous

190
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,350
and strict safety measures
have to be applied.

191
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:10,106
After the <i>SiO2</i> etch,

192
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:13,906
the photo-resist can be stripped,
exposing again the chrome layer.

193
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:17,921
This video sequence shows 
a clean room scientist,

194
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:21,934
who puts a batch of wafers into
the <i>BHF</i> etch pod,

195
00:09:22,289 --> 00:09:24,051
to etch the silicon dioxide.

196
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:27,427
Please notice the serious protection
that is needed.

197
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:31,323
On this right photo,
you can see now the result

198
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,861
after the fabrication, where we can
see in dark grey

199
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:38,223
the contours of the silicon
dioxide cantilevers

200
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:40,196
still on the silicon.

201
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:43,882
And in light grey, the chromium 
heater pattern

202
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,957
that runs on top of the 4
cantilever shapes.

203
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,351
The final step releases 
the cantilever beam 

204
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:53,326
from the underlying silicon by
anisotropic under etching.

205
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:56,244
While there are several options
that can be used to etch silicon,

206
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,482
such as dry plasma silicon
etching.

207
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,144
We use here the anisotropic wet
etching of silicon

208
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:02,894
done in Potassium hydroxide,

209
00:10:03,094 --> 00:10:04,707
also called <i>KOH</i>.

210
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:06,293
This method is very versatile, 

211
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:08,668
and widely used for 
these type of structures.

212
00:10:09,137 --> 00:10:12,637
The silicon 1,0,0 plane has an etch
rate of about 20 micrometers per hour

213
00:10:12,837 --> 00:10:13,912
in <i>KOH</i>.

214
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,325
Whereas the 1,1,1 silicon planes
are hardly etched at all

215
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,300
which allows creating the 
well defined (INAUDIBLE) etch structure

216
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,975
in the shape of a truncated
inverted pyramid.

217
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,957
The <i>SiO2</i> thereby serves as 
an etch mask to define the borders

218
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:28,256
of the etch structure.

219
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:31,404
With the largest cantilever beam
80 micrometers wide,

220
00:10:31,726 --> 00:10:35,076
we need about 2 hours to under etch
for the micrometers from each side.

221
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,979
When the under etching is completed,

222
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,242
and the cantilever released
from the silicon,

223
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:42,279
the intrinsic stress in the <i>SiO2</i>
chromium sandwich layer

224
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:45,354
induces an out of plane bending
of the cantilever.

225
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:47,945
On the right side, 
we see 2 photographs.

226
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:51,145
showing the fabricated bi-morph
cantilevers.

227
00:10:51,922 --> 00:10:55,435
On the left, an optical microscope
image taken from above.

228
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:57,985
Where we see nicely 
the square etch,

229
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,610
that has been etched by the KOH
into the silicon.

230
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:05,928
And the 4 cantilevers in the corner
that have been under etched.

231
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:10,452
Cantilevers themselves are not
easily visible

232
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,652
because they are pre-stressed,

233
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:17,664
and pre-bent largely, so they're
out of focus of the microscope.

234
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:19,496
To see them better,

235
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,475
we're going to the scanning electron
microscope.

236
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:25,607
Where we see now nicely

237
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:27,895
the cantilevers in all details.

238
00:11:28,095 --> 00:11:29,382
We also see nicely,

239
00:11:29,882 --> 00:11:33,994
the square that has been etched
by the <i>KOH</i> into the silicon.

240
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:37,295
The cantilevers are largely bent

241
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:38,845
due to the stress

242
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:41,986
between the <i>SiO2</i>,
and the chromium.

243
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:45,209
Please note that at this point
of time,

244
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,522
there's no heating applied. So this
stress, is the intrinsic stress

245
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:52,321
due to fabrication, and not an
actuated bending.

246
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:56,908
The bi-morph thermo-mechanical 
micro actuators are now ready

247
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,058
for characterization.

248
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,482
For this, we use a probe station

249
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:03,222
that can align micro needles to
the contact pads 

250
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,960
to apply electrical signals

251
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:07,316
to various devices 
on the chip or wafer,

252
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:08,879
and to measure (INAUDIBLE).

253
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:12,321
In our case, we have measured
the resistance

254
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:14,258
of our chrome heaters, and they
are (INAUDIBLE)

255
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,233
in the order of about 50 ohm.

256
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,724
These 4 optical images,

257
00:12:19,924 --> 00:12:23,249
show bi-morph device under various
<i>DC</i> currents.

258
00:12:23,992 --> 00:12:26,192
Please remember, that the initial
bending

259
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:29,863
of the cantilever is due to
the intrinsic stress

260
00:12:30,153 --> 00:12:32,753
and occurs already 
at room temperature.

261
00:12:33,117 --> 00:12:34,967
It is not due to heating.

262
00:12:35,372 --> 00:12:38,322
Heating in fact will bend
the lever downwards.

263
00:12:39,638 --> 00:12:41,025
From left to right,

264
00:12:42,145 --> 00:12:45,445
the voltage is increased from 
0 to about 6 volts,

265
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:50,171
which gives us an increasing current
as shown here.

266
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,850
The current heats up
the chrome layer

267
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,350
by Joule heating.

268
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:57,797
Already in photo 2,

269
00:12:57,997 --> 00:13:00,147
We can see that the bi-morph

270
00:13:00,665 --> 00:13:03,003
has moved downwards
a bit.

271
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:06,182
This actuation effect 
is more pronounced

272
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,611
in this photo,

273
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:10,474
where we also start seeing
a color change.

274
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:13,650
This color change is due to
the heat

275
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,862
generated in the chrome
resistor,

276
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,712
which emits radiation.

277
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:20,894
Increasing the current further,

278
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,645
we can see that the bi-morph
starts to glow.

279
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:29,358
Running this experiment for a very 
long time will damage the device

280
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,046
like a fuse.

281
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:34,884
Here you can see a movie
that shows

282
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:37,471
the actuation of the bi-morph
cantilever

283
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,496
driven by <i>DC</i> voltage.

284
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:43,946
Using the same voltage range 
as shown in the slide before,

285
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:45,959
from 0 to 6 volt.

286
00:13:46,581 --> 00:13:48,193
You can see in real time

287
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:51,068
when ramping up the voltage
and current,

288
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,781
that the cantilever
starts bending down.

289
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:56,606
And at very high current levels,

290
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:59,877
the cantilever starts to glow,

291
00:14:00,077 --> 00:14:02,539
and ultimately might burn 
like a fuse 

292
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,751
if the experiment is run too long.

293
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,984
And here you can see, the actuation
of the bi-morph and the voltages

294
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,309
changed manually.

295
00:14:10,872 --> 00:14:12,598
Details of the frequency response

296
00:14:12,798 --> 00:14:14,960
is provided by 
the accompanying documents.

297
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:18,866
Please have a look, as they provide
useful information on the bandwidth

298
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,341
in which such a device can operate.

299
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:24,116
As you can guess, this is not
only a function

300
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,991
of the mechanical resonance 
frequency of the cantilever, 

301
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:30,054
but also of the heat dissipation
away from the cantilever.

302
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:33,343
This concludes this chapter on 
the fabrication 

303
00:14:33,543 --> 00:14:35,080
of the bi-morph cantilever.

304
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:38,515
 I hope you learned how one can get
from a blank silicon wafer,

305
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:40,615
hundreds and thousandths of micro
devices,

306
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,304
by series of micro fabrication
steps.

307
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:44,942
In the next chapters,

308
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:47,827
my colleague and I will present
technical details

309
00:14:48,115 --> 00:14:50,215
on the different fabrication
steps.
