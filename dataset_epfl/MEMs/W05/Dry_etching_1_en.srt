1
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,448
In this lesson,

2
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:08,002
we will introduce dry etching

3
00:00:08,002 --> 00:00:09,402
in a gas plasma.

4
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:11,553
Plasma is defined

5
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,753
as a collection of excited gas molecules,

6
00:00:14,753 --> 00:00:16,749
ions, and electrons.

7
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:19,202
Excitation is obtained

8
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,552
by applying a high voltage

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,052
inside the reactor,

10
00:00:23,052 --> 00:00:24,652
via electrodes,

11
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:27,945
which leads to ionization
events in the gas.

12
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:31,251
We will then introduce the directionality

13
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,701
of the dry etching,

14
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,852
and the etching anisotropy.

15
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:37,002
That is the ratio of the etching rate

16
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:38,897
in a direction perpendicular

17
00:00:38,897 --> 00:00:41,201
to the substrate, and parallel to it.

18
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,353
Finally, we will give a few simple rules

19
00:00:44,353 --> 00:00:47,053
for choosing dry etching processes

20
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,245
to etch specific materials.

21
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:51,850
In a dry etching process,

22
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,400
etching is done by molecules

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,148
in the gas phase,

24
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,145
which is the so-called <i>dry medium</i>,

25
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,395
and one is typically

26
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:05,703
in the 0.1 to 100 millibar pressure range.

27
00:01:06,598 --> 00:01:08,700
The wafer is positioned

28
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,750
in the reactor,

29
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,953
which is subsequently filled with the gas.

30
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:19,149
An etching mask locally protects

31
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:21,845
the wafer against etching.

32
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,100
A typical gas that is used

33
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:28,448
in many of the processes

34
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,449
is carbon tetrafluoride, or â€ŽCF4.

35
00:01:34,098 --> 00:01:35,302
This gas, normally,

36
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,902
is an inert fluorocarbon gas;

37
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:40,198
nothing happens.

38
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:43,645
However, this gas becomes reactive

39
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,645
when it is brought to the plasma state.

40
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:51,254
The plasma can be created by applying

41
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:57,201
a high voltage radio frequency field

42
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,703
in the reactor.

43
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,046
This high voltage

44
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:05,495
ionizes gas molecules,

45
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:09,247
thereby creating ions and electrons.

46
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,795
The electrons are accelerated then

47
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:15,545
in the electrical field

48
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:17,852
that is created by the electrodes,

49
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:22,047
and ionize other gas molecules,

50
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:26,202
creating additional ions and electrons.

51
00:02:27,052 --> 00:02:31,952
An electron can also dissociate

52
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:37,495
a gas molecule in neutral species,

53
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,599
but this can be reactive too.

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,704
For example, this fluoride atom

55
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:48,548
is, chemically, very reactive.

56
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,949
From the gas, CF4,

57
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,696
fluorine radicals can be created

58
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:03,948
that etch the silicon in an isotropic way.

59
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:07,151
That means that the etching speed

60
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,151
in the vertical direction

61
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:11,301
is the same as the etching speed

62
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:13,297
in the horizontal direction,

63
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:16,550
so mask underetching occurs,

64
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,751
so one broadens

65
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:21,653
the details of the mask in such process.

66
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,745
In this process,

67
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,995
the silicon is recombining

68
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:31,499
with the reactive fluorine radicals

69
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,102
to form this gas, which is evacuated.

70
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,854
A lot of different interactions

71
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:40,549
and processes can occur in a plasma.

72
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:42,554
For example,

73
00:03:43,301 --> 00:03:48,952
CF3 radicals can get adsorbed on the wafer

74
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,902
where they can recombine

75
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,202
with the fluorine radical,

76
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:55,901
after which the resulting

77
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,301
regenerated CF4 molecule

78
00:03:58,301 --> 00:04:01,201
is desorbed and pumped away.

79
00:04:03,198 --> 00:04:05,900
If, instead of the gas CF4,

80
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,247
one uses a gas

81
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:11,748
that is much richer in carbon,

82
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,702
like the gas,

83
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:18,252
octafluorocyclobutane,

84
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,652
or C4F8,

85
00:04:22,098 --> 00:04:25,351
these radical adsorption processes

86
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:28,701
become relatively more important,

87
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,252
and can lead to degeneration

88
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:36,502
of fluorocarbon-type polymer chains

89
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:40,196
that get deposited on the substrate.

90
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,504
The result is a thin fluorocarbon layer,

91
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:51,003
as depicted here by this yellow material,

92
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,200
so, instead of etching,

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,501
when one uses this gas,
one has deposition.

94
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:01,196
If an inert gas, like argon, is used,

95
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:04,347
ions can be created too,

96
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,997
but these are not
chemically reactive species

97
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:11,097
that can react with the silicon,

98
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:15,401
so, in principle, no etching occurs.

99
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:18,148
However, suppose that,

100
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:21,051
on top of the radio frequency voltage

101
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:22,801
that one applies,

102
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,825
one can apply a negative voltage bias

103
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,395
on this electrode.

104
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:32,052
This will provide an attractive force

105
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:35,154
to the positive argon ions.

106
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:39,096
They can then be accelerated

107
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,946
towards the wafer.

108
00:05:40,946 --> 00:05:43,046
If the kinetic energy

109
00:05:43,046 --> 00:05:45,245
of the argon ions is high enough,

110
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,848
it is possible for them to remove

111
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,748
silicon atoms from the wafer

112
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,449
by physical impact.

113
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,854
Such process leads then

114
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,954
to anisotropic etching,

115
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:02,704
only etching in the vertical direction,

116
00:06:02,704 --> 00:06:06,804
because there is the DC voltage bias,

117
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:09,153
and there is no such bias

118
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,147
in the horizontal direction.

119
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:14,197
As a result of this physical impact,

120
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:15,747
also the mask material

121
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,649
will be slowly deteriorated

122
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:22,296
and gradually consumed

123
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:24,200
during the etching process.

124
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:27,950
The mask lifetime,

125
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,650
that is the time during which the mask

126
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,799
resists to the physical impact,

127
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:36,801
evidently will provide a limit

128
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,848
to the etching depth

129
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,550
that one can obtain in such process.

130
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,350
Here, we illustrate the directionality

131
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,400
of the etching process,

132
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,199
as defined by the factor, <i>A</i>.

133
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:56,750
It's also called the anisotropy ratio <i>A</i>.

134
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:59,953
It is defined in function

135
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:03,551
of the vertical etching distance, <i>z</i>,

136
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:07,853
and the mask underetching distance, <i>x</i>.

137
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,345
This is the formula.

138
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:12,748
For isotropic etching,

139
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,448
that means a purely chemical process.

140
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,052
<i>x</i> equals to <i>z</i>,

141
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,249
and <i>A</i> is zero.

142
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,147
For perfectly anisotropic etching,

143
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:28,449
<i>x</i> is zero,

144
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,151
so that <i>A</i> becomes one,

145
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,046
and, in general,

146
00:07:32,046 --> 00:07:35,746
the <i>A</i> value is in between zero and one.

147
00:07:36,946 --> 00:07:39,746
The use of halocarbon-based plasmas,

148
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:43,754
that is plasmas that contain fluorine,

149
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:48,403
chlorine, or bromine etching species,

150
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:52,203
and carbon halogen radicals,

151
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,503
like these ones,

152
00:07:54,653 --> 00:07:56,803
offer interesting possibilities

153
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:58,303
in dry etching.

154
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,303
These gases have a very low

155
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,503
spontaneous etching rate

156
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:05,004
when no negative

157
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,204
voltage substrate bias is used.

158
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,995
This figure illustrates

159
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:14,795
the case for fluorine-based plasmas.

160
00:08:15,549 --> 00:08:16,949
It shows the conditions

161
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,049
under which etching occurs,

162
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,246
and one finds, on the x-axis,

163
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:26,350
the fluorine-to-carbon ratio of the gas.

164
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,799
One can vary this

165
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:31,395
by changing the gas into the reactor.

166
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:33,351
Here, one has CF4,

167
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,501
which is richest in fluorine,

168
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,302
and, here, one has a gas, C2F4,

169
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:41,098
which is richest in carbon.

170
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:44,446
So, when one moves from right to left,

171
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,902
one will move from an etching regime

172
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,502
towards a polymerization,

173
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:49,902
a deposition regime,

174
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:52,747
due to the increased carbon

175
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:53,947
in the reactor.

176
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,500
If one moves along the y-axis,

177
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,003
one goes from zero voltage bias,

178
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,300
where there will be polymerization,

179
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:07,501
to a regime where there will be etching,

180
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,700
as, here, these gases

181
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,250
have sufficient kinetic energy

182
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,997
for etching the silicon

183
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:16,097
by physical impact.

184
00:09:18,657 --> 00:09:22,147
This explains the boundary layer

185
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:25,652
between etching and polymerization

186
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,445
as given by the dashed curve here.

187
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,997
We give here, as an example,

188
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:37,096
the etching in a halocarbon gas,

189
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,952
with the fluorine-to-carbon ratio of 2.5,

190
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,095
and using 200 electron volt ion energy.

191
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,253
Under these conditions,

192
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:54,304
one is clearly in the etching regime,

193
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,503
in this region.

194
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,247
However, in a direction

195
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,847
that is parallel to the substrate,

196
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,048
there is no electrical field,

197
00:10:03,597 --> 00:10:05,598
and, hence, it is equivalent

198
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:07,948
to having here zero voltage,

199
00:10:07,948 --> 00:10:10,552
so, in that case,
there will be polymerization.

200
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,100
So, in the vertical direction,

201
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,400
there is etching.

202
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,298
In the horizontal direction,

203
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:19,401
there is polymerization on the substrate.

204
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,395
The result is the absence

205
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:24,899
of underetching of the mask,

206
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,598
and one obtains

207
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:30,600
a purely anisotropic etching profile.

208
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:34,595
Also, it is possible to add,

209
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:36,798
to the halocarbon gas,

210
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:38,899
oxygen gas.

211
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:41,101
In this case,

212
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,101
the oxygen will react with the carbon,

213
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,502
forming CO2,

214
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,598
leaving relatively more fluorine

215
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,498
so that etching is favored.

216
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:58,353
Also, an option is to add hydrogen gas,

217
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:00,448
and the hydrogen

218
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:03,553
will combine with fluorine radicals,

219
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,902
forming HF, which is pumped away.

220
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,651
So, one is left, in that case,

221
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:11,645
with much more carbon,

222
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,800
and, hence, addition of hydrogen

223
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,101
will lead to polymerization.

224
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:22,598
This slide shows specifically what happens

225
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,402
when one adds hydrogen

226
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:28,946
to the CF4 gas

227
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,298
under a negative substrate

228
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,504
voltage bias of 150 volts.

229
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:39,446
The vertical etching rate is <i>vz</i>,

230
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,800
and, when one adds more hydrogen,

231
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:45,945
the etching rate is reduced,

232
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:49,549
because fluorine radicals

233
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,102
are removed by the hydrogen,

234
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,199
and one is left with more carbon.

235
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:00,004
<i>vx</i> is the horizontal etching rate,

236
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:03,504
so it also the mask underetching rate.

237
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:07,148
There is some etching rate

238
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:09,649
without hydrogen.

239
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:11,551
However, it is lower

240
00:12:11,551 --> 00:12:13,751
than the vertical etching rate,

241
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:18,152
but, if one now adds hydrogen,

242
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:21,201
also this etching rate diminishes

243
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:25,351
until, here, it passes the curve,

244
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:27,047
and, here, one has zero

245
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:29,601
etching rate in <i>x</i> direction,

246
00:12:30,552 --> 00:12:32,852
because the polymerization events,

247
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:36,700
in a way, compensate for the etching

248
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
in that direction.

249
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:42,253
So, the result of this process

250
00:12:42,253 --> 00:12:44,048
is shown in these diagrams.

251
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,600
If one has pure CF4 etching gas,

252
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,597
one has such a profile,

253
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:51,300
where there is, here,

254
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,600
underetching and vertical etching,

255
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,700
and, adding 10% of hydrogen,

256
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,152
one has zero etching

257
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,751
in the horizontal direction,

258
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,904
and only vertical etching.

259
00:13:04,904 --> 00:13:07,551
So, it is possible to obtain

260
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,653
an anisotropic etching profile

261
00:13:10,653 --> 00:13:15,050
by adding 10% of hydrogen to the CF4 gas.

262
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,496
Based on what we have learned,

263
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:21,147
we will give now a few simple rules

264
00:13:21,147 --> 00:13:22,597
that can help in choosing

265
00:13:22,597 --> 00:13:24,199
a dry etching gas.

266
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:27,199
In a halocarbon plasma,

267
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:29,497
the first important parameter

268
00:13:29,497 --> 00:13:32,847
is the fluorine-to-carbon ratio,

269
00:13:32,847 --> 00:13:34,748
and we have seen, just before,

270
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,448
what we can do

271
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,748
to change this ratio.

272
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:42,999
A dry etching process

273
00:13:42,999 --> 00:13:45,049
can also be selective.

274
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:46,999
That means it only etches

275
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:49,549
the material to be etched

276
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:51,549
and not the mask material.

277
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:55,651
Selectivity can be enhanced

278
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:58,749
by tuning the polymerization point

279
00:13:58,749 --> 00:13:59,949
of the gas.

280
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:02,549
More polymerization

281
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,649
will lead to extra masking material

282
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,801
that gets deposited

283
00:14:07,801 --> 00:14:09,103
so the mask

284
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:12,003
can withstand longer the etching.

285
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:14,946
We also learned before

286
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:17,746
that the more negative voltage bias

287
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:20,995
is in favor of etching.

288
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:23,747
It favors physical impact

289
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:26,245
and higher anisotropy.

290
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,649
For etching metals,

291
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,553
one can use chlorocarbon

292
00:14:31,553 --> 00:14:33,850
and fluorocarbon gases.

293
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:36,552
They can reduce

294
00:14:37,046 --> 00:14:39,849
the native metal oxides chemically.

295
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,100
When etching metals,

296
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,950
oxygen gas and water vapor

297
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,651
must be excluded

298
00:14:46,651 --> 00:14:50,551
because they are in favor of oxidation,

299
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:53,003
and metal oxides

300
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:56,000
are normally difficult to remove.

301
00:14:56,652 --> 00:14:58,397
For metal etching,

302
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,899
ion bombardment is also essential

303
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:04,102
for successful etching.

304
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:09,250
Dry etching of organic films,

305
00:15:09,803 --> 00:15:12,046
like photoresist,

306
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,945
is relatively easy.

307
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,601
A CF4 oxygen plasma

308
00:15:17,601 --> 00:15:19,904
severely etches resists.

309
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,652
If one wants to retain

310
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:24,852
an organic masking material,

311
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,602
like photoresist,

312
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:27,802
one can work

313
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,202
close to the polymerization point

314
00:15:31,202 --> 00:15:33,199
to regenerate the mask

315
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,049
during the etching.

316
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:37,399
We have introduced

317
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:39,499
plasma-based dry etching,

318
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:41,799
and exposed the parameters that control

319
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,649
the etching and isotropy

320
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,649
in the halocarbon plasma,

321
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,450
like the fluorine-to-carbon ratio

322
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,646
and the negative substrate bias.

323
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:52,900
We have pointed out the possibility

324
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,300
to vary the conditions of the plasma

325
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,053
to result in etching or in polymerization,

326
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,204
for example, by adding oxygen

327
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,798
or hydrogen gas.

328
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:05,347
Also, we have provided simple rules

329
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:07,947
for designing dry etching processes

330
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:10,003
for silicon, metals,

331
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,197
and polymeric materials.
