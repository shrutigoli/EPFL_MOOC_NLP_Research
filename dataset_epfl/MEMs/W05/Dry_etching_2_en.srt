1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,845
In this lesson we will discuss

2
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:10,066
various so-called <i>deep dry etching</i>
processes for silicon,

3
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,989
which are processes with a high anisotropy

4
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:15,548
so that one can etch deep vertical holes

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:18,476
with little or no mask underetching.

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,867
We will also give an example
of a dry etching equipment.

7
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:25,787
Finally, we will present a few special 
dry etching processes

8
00:00:25,787 --> 00:00:28,319
that use intrinsic reactive gases

9
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:32,900
and that do not require to have 
the gas in the plasma state,

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,450
which leads to a significantly simpler 
etching system.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,469
For deep dry etching of silicon,

12
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:42,551
one can design a plasma-based 
etching process

13
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:49,203
by combining the gases SF6 and C4F8

14
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:51,393
in the etching reactor.

15
00:00:51,393 --> 00:00:56,140
The first gas is an etching gas,
as it contains a lot of fluorine,

16
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,972
while the second is a passivation gas

17
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:04,333
while it contains relatively 
a lot of carbon.

18
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:08,125
The substrate bias has to be chosen

19
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:12,557
such that there is an effective 
vertical etching rate

20
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:16,674
while the horizontal etching rate
should be zero,

21
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:20,814
due to the hole sidewall passivation

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,734
by the deposition of the polymer.

23
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:29,587
The process can be designed 
to have a high selectivity to photoresist.

24
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:35,538
Silicon can be etched 50 times faster
than the photoresist.

25
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:42,475
These pictures illustrate some results 
of this type of etching process.

26
00:01:42,475 --> 00:01:48,458
The first picture shows the etching 
of a polycrystalline silicon film

27
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:52,201
which was deposited 
on a silicon dioxide layer.

28
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,809
The second picture shows profiles
of etched channel structures

29
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:02,830
which were etched in a silicon wafer.

30
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:08,031
On the previous slides, both the etching
and the passivation gas

31
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,752
were simultaneously let into the reactor.

32
00:02:11,752 --> 00:02:16,491
It is also possible to apply the etching
and polymerization gas

33
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:19,781
sequentially in a pulsed process.

34
00:02:20,222 --> 00:02:23,315
The pictures show what happens.

35
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:28,045
In the beginning, during a few seconds,

36
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:33,275
chemical etching is performed
in an SF6 plasma,

37
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:37,332
which gives a little
underetching of the mask.

38
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:42,484
Then the etching gas supply 
is switched off

39
00:02:42,484 --> 00:02:46,628
and C4F8 gas is introduced,

40
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:51,118
which is known to lead to polymerization.

41
00:02:51,118 --> 00:02:56,134
During a few seconds,
a thin polymer layer is deposited,

42
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,109
as indicated by the yellow line here.

43
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,701
The next step in the process 
is again an etching sequence.

44
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,719
Due to the substrate bias,

45
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:12,294
the polymer film that is deposited

46
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:18,192
on the horizontal faces of the structure
is quickly removed in the etching,

47
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:23,524
and hereafter, silicon is etched 
in that direction.

48
00:03:24,062 --> 00:03:28,983
Because there is no electrical field
in the horizontal direction,

49
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:33,593
there is little or no etching,
but polymerization is chosen

50
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:38,635
such that at the end 
of this second etching cycle,

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:41,534
all polymer has disappeared,

52
00:03:41,534 --> 00:03:47,213
and then one stops 
this second SF6 etching cycle.

53
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:51,917
One has effectively etched, now, a hole

54
00:03:51,917 --> 00:03:55,252
with little or no mask underetching.

55
00:03:56,812 --> 00:03:59,925
Next, follows a second 
polymerization step,

56
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:03,347
as illustrated in the lower picture.

57
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:08,308
These pulsed etching 
and polymerization sequences

58
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:11,087
can be repeated many times

59
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:16,426
to realize very deep 
and anisotropic holes in the silicon.

60
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,719
A high etching rate is obtained this way

61
00:04:19,719 --> 00:04:22,836
and a high selectivity 
of the silicon etching

62
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:28,761
to silicon dioxide and photoresist masks
can be obtained.

63
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:36,681
These pictures show some results
of a deep dry etching process for silicon.

64
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:43,561
The pulsed nature of the process
is immediately recognizable

65
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:48,354
by this so-called <i>scalloping effect</i>

66
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:55,234
which originates from the alternating
etching and polymerization cycles.

67
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:59,053
The picture on the lower right

68
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:03,903
shows a residual polymer layer,

69
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:09,405
which was not completely removed
from the sidewalls of the etched hole.

70
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:15,105
The top picture shows 
that one can indeed etch

71
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:18,407
vertical, anisotropic structures.

72
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:25,178
It also shows that if there is 
a wider mask opening,

73
00:05:25,178 --> 00:05:30,158
the etching goes deeper 
than if there is a narrow mask opening,

74
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:35,904
and this is related to the fact that
the gas has easier access

75
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,579
into a larger hole than in a small hole,

76
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:45,430
and etching is more favored in that way.

77
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,530
This pulsed process of etching in silicon
is also called the <i>Bosch process</i>

78
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:58,492
after the origin of the researchers
who first developed this process.

79
00:05:59,662 --> 00:06:03,120
This picture shows, in general,
the features that can be observed

80
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,404
for an etched hole structure.

81
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,685
The selectivity is defined

82
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:12,375
as the ratio of the substrate etching
to the mask etching,

83
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:15,884
and ideally there should be 
little or no mask etching

84
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:18,696
when the mask material is well chosen.

85
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:24,516
For a hole opening <i>a,</i>
one can etch a depth <i>b,</i>

86
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:28,711
and this defines the <i>aspect ratio b/a.</i>

87
00:06:29,314 --> 00:06:32,308
Also illustrated here are some phenomena

88
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:37,257
that are observed when doing 
dry etching of silicon.

89
00:06:37,698 --> 00:06:40,938
There is first the phenomenon of undercut,

90
00:06:40,938 --> 00:06:44,308
so there is some horizontal etching,

91
00:06:44,308 --> 00:06:46,810
which gives you mask underetching.

92
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,199
There is also bowing, 
this kind of rounded shape,

93
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,177
and there is drenching,

94
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:58,633
at the bottom of the hole one sees 
some deeper recesses in the corners.

95
00:06:59,471 --> 00:07:01,988
Another important parameter 
of the etching process

96
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:07,859
is the uniformity of the etching 
over the hole wafer.

97
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,983
Ideally the etched profile 
should not depend

98
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:14,822
on the position of the hole on the wafer.

99
00:07:16,012 --> 00:07:20,608
The origin of the microtrenching effect
is illustrated here.

100
00:07:21,113 --> 00:07:26,538
It is caused by the forward scattering 
of ions to the sidewalls

101
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,522
of the etched structure.

102
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:33,814
And this gives extra etching 
near the lower corners

103
00:07:33,814 --> 00:07:36,245
of the hole structure.

104
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:40,299
This phenomenon can occur during etching
of dielectric materials,

105
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,215
semiconductors and metals.

106
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:47,804
We take back, here, 
one of the pictures shown before,

107
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,617
to illustrate the so-called

108
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:54,778
<i>aspect ratio dependent etching effect,</i>

109
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:56,828
<i>ARDE effect,</i>

110
00:07:56,828 --> 00:08:02,144
by which the etch rate depends
on the hole or trench width,

111
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,919
as shown in this picture.

112
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:09,816
Also, micro-loading effects 
exist in dry etching,

113
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:14,850
which means that two identical trenches
can have a different depth

114
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,480
depending on if they were in
a local environment on the wafer

115
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,971
where there was more material
to be etched away.

116
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:29,582
That means where there was more 
competition for the gas to be consumed.

117
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:33,052
If more silicon 
is to be etched away locally,

118
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:38,862
the depth of a trench or hole
in such micro-environment will be smaller.

119
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:44,390
On this slide, we summarize 
experimental process variables

120
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,435
that can be varied 
in a dry etching process,

121
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:53,591
and we mention, also, the way
how they effect the dry etching.

122
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:57,505
The gas mixture, or gas chemistry,

123
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:02,707
directly effects etch rate
and etch profile,

124
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:07,634
as well as variations 
in the gas flow rate and pressure.

125
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:13,266
The RF power affects the etching rate,

126
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:17,678
as for a higher power, more and more 
gas molecules get dissocciated

127
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:19,951
and the etching rate increases.

128
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:21,854
The wafer temperature,

129
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:26,519
or the temperature of the chuck 
on which the wafer is fixed,

130
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:29,845
as well as the bias voltage on that chuck,

131
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:34,399
directly influence the etching profile
and the anisotropy.

132
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:40,863
On this slide we give a schematic example
of a dry etching reactor.

133
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:48,034
It is a very sophisticated system
which has a load chamber

134
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:52,393
in which one puts the wafer to be etched.

135
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:57,182
This wafer is then translated 
into the reactor

136
00:09:57,182 --> 00:10:01,564
without breaking the vacuum 
present in the reactor.

137
00:10:02,032 --> 00:10:05,603
The wafer in the reactor is clamped 
then to a chuck,

138
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:09,375
it can be by electrostatic forces,

139
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,375
as we will explain later,

140
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:15,140
and the chuck is kept 
at a fixed temperature

141
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,445
and the etching can start.

142
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:22,942
The reactor is equipped
with a radio frequency power supply

143
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:24,877
for generating the plasma,

144
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:29,856
and in case an electrostatic chuck 
is chosen,

145
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:36,316
there is an RF chuck power supply
to generate these electric forces.

146
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:42,268
There is also a scrubber 
that eliminates toxic side products

147
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:49,010
of the etching reaction before leading 
the reactor output gases

148
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,368
away into the environment.

149
00:10:52,888 --> 00:10:55,055
There is also an equipment

150
00:10:55,055 --> 00:11:01,556
for live monitoring 
the optical emission from the gas

151
00:11:01,556 --> 00:11:05,594
to provide information on the materials
that are etched away.

152
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:09,261
And this can be used to determine

153
00:11:09,261 --> 00:11:13,883
when one has reached 
the endpoint of an etching process.

154
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:19,255
The reactor is configured 
with several gas flow lines

155
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,565
and mask flow controllers.

156
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:27,192
For example, one uses nitrogen, 
hydrogen, oxygen,

157
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:31,228
argon gas or any of 
the halocarbon etching gases.

158
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:36,955
The picture on the right 
shows a real reactor

159
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:42,747
with in front of it the chamber 
in which one loads the wafer.

160
00:11:44,027 --> 00:11:49,516
Xenon fluoride gas etching of silicon
without development of a plasma

161
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:52,717
is also used in microfabrication.

162
00:11:52,717 --> 00:11:56,088
This process requires 
much simpler equipment

163
00:11:56,088 --> 00:11:57,787
than a plasma etcher.

164
00:11:57,787 --> 00:12:03,438
The xenon fluoride is placed, 
in the form of solid crystals,

165
00:12:03,438 --> 00:12:05,471
into a closed reactor

166
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:10,831
from which fluorine vapor 
is spontaneously released,

167
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:16,551
which etches the silicon according
to this chemical reaction.

168
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:22,961
The process has an etching rate
of a few micrometers per minute.

169
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:29,036
The figure shows a schematic diagram
of the etching chamber

170
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:34,993
interfaced with simply 
a few valves and pumps.

171
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:40,042
Another example of gas phase etching
without a plasma

172
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:45,081
is the etching of silicon dioxide 
using HF vapor.

173
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,564
For a hydrofluoric acid 
vapor phase etching,

174
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:56,221
one only needs a container 
into which one pours the HF,

175
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:02,603
and a wafer holder to which the wafer
is mechanically clamped.

176
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:08,410
The reaction with the HF vapor
is written here,

177
00:13:09,097 --> 00:13:12,420
and is controlled 
by the wafer temperature.

178
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:18,828
The technique can be used 
to remove an oxide layer

179
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:23,064
underneath an etched 
silicon microstructure

180
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:28,071
to provide a freestanding structure.

181
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:31,543
So here the silicon was etched,

182
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:38,671
then putting it into HF vapor
slowly etches away the oxide,

183
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:45,602
until in the middle, these silicon parts
are now freely moving,

184
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:50,473
and, of course, they are somewhere
anchored to the substrate.

185
00:13:51,303 --> 00:13:56,461
In this way, one can release 
the silicon structure

186
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,733
without applying a liquid.

187
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:01,493
If one applies a liquid here,

188
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:05,323
this can give surface tension forces

189
00:14:05,323 --> 00:14:11,555
which can deform the delicate 
mechanical structures.

190
00:14:13,155 --> 00:14:17,065
This slide gives an impression
of the equipment that is needed

191
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:20,117
for HF vapor phase etching,

192
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:26,437
which indeed is orders of magnitude
less complex and much cheaper

193
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:29,357
than a plasma reactor.

194
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:32,252
There is a container for the HF,

195
00:14:32,252 --> 00:14:37,713
and there is control 
of the temperature, basically.

196
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:44,510
Here we see how silicon dioxide
is partly removed

197
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:48,140
from under a polysilicon layer

198
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,949
so that this becomes 
a freestanding electrode.

199
00:14:53,469 --> 00:14:56,931
In this lesson, we have presented 
several processes

200
00:14:56,931 --> 00:15:01,180
for the deep dry etching of silicon,
like the continuous process

201
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,243
in which the etching gas 
and the polymerization gas

202
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:07,910
are simultaneously introduced 
in the plasma reactor,

203
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,753
as well as the pulsed, or Bosch, process

204
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:16,543
in which the two types 
of gas exposures are alternated.

205
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:21,004
We gave an example of a typical 
dry etching equipment

206
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:24,613
and also introduced dry etching 
without a plasma,

207
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:27,114
which requires much less complex

208
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:30,079
and much less sophisticated 
infrastructure.

209
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:35,076
Subsequently, we introduced 
xenon fluoride etching of silicon,

210
00:15:35,076 --> 00:15:39,377
and HF vapor phase etching 
of silicon dioxide.
