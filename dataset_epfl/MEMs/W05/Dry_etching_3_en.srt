1
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,703
In this lesson, we will introduce
some theoretical concepts

2
00:00:07,703 --> 00:00:10,995
that characterize a plasma
in a dry etching equipment.

3
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:15,051
A plasma is a collection
of excited neutral molecules

4
00:00:15,051 --> 00:00:17,251
of ions and of electrons.

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:20,051
Close to an electrode in the plasma,

6
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,451
electrons are repelled

7
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,697
so that mainly ions and, of course,

8
00:00:23,697 --> 00:00:25,952
neutral molecules remain there.

9
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:30,247
Such a layer close to an electrode
is therefore called an ion sheath.

10
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:34,998
As a plasma is a special
electrically conducted medium,

11
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,497
it has to be interfaced in a proper way
with a radio frequency power source.

12
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:44,498
We then present a design rule
for the RF electrodes

13
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:48,848
that enables magnetization
of ion bombardment to the electrode

14
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:51,654
on which the wafer
to be etched is positioned.

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:54,901
An ion impact on the counter electrode,

16
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,251
which would lead to reactor damage,

17
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:59,451
is reduced or absent.

18
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,900
A plasma is defined as an ionized gas,

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,549
and has about the same densities

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:10,849
of electrons and of ions.

21
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:16,746
A plasma is usually generated
starting from a gas of pressures

22
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:19,853
of 10 minus 3 to 1 millibar.

23
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:26,154
The degree of ionization
in a plasma is rather low,

24
00:01:26,804 --> 00:01:30,795
of the order to 10 minus 6 to 10 minus 4.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,701
That means that one of a million,

26
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:38,796
or one of 10,000 molecules is ionized.

27
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,598
This means, also, that the majority
of molecules in the plasma are neutral.

28
00:01:44,298 --> 00:01:48,398
In the picture, we show
how radio frequency power

29
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:52,099
is applied via two electrodes.

30
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:57,903
Initially, there is a discharge in the gas

31
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,653
when a high electric field is applied

32
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:05,054
due to discrete molecule
ionization events,

33
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:08,048
but, rapidly, the RF power

34
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:12,598
is distributed over all gas molecules

35
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:15,795
due to collisions when energetic electrons

36
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:18,602
that are accelerated
in the electric field.

37
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:22,097
The presence of a plasma is revealed

38
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,947
by a glow of the excited gas,

39
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:27,948
which is due to photon emission events

40
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:33,445
during transition of an electron
between an excited and a ground state.

41
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:37,996
This so-called glow, discharged plasma,

42
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:42,546
is characterized by a lack
of thermal equilibrium

43
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:46,595
between the electron temperature, <i>Te</i>,

44
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:49,101
and the gas temperature, <i>Tg</i>.

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,902
The electron temperature, <i>Te</i>,

46
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:54,803
can be obtained

47
00:02:54,803 --> 00:02:58,453
if one equals the thermal energy

48
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:01,548
to the kinetic energy of the electron

49
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:07,502
with <i>ve</i>, the typical electron velocity

50
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:09,202
in the electrical field.

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,097
While the gas temperature is typically
at room temperature in the plasma,

52
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:16,395
that means a few hundred kelvin,

53
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,395
the calculated electron temperature

54
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:22,604
can reach 10,000 kelvin this way.

55
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:27,097
The ion temperature,
due to the heavier ion mass

56
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:29,247
and lower velocities,

57
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:32,048
is around 1,000 kelvin.

58
00:03:32,954 --> 00:03:35,554
Due to the low gas temperature,

59
00:03:35,554 --> 00:03:40,248
a glow discharge plasma
is therefore called a <i>cold</i> plasma.

60
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,599
A typical frequency that is used
for the generation of a plasma

61
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,502
is 13.5 megahertz.

62
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,346
In the schematic diagram,

63
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:55,050
the upper electrode is connected to earth,

64
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:58,196
while the lower electrode,

65
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,896
on which the substrate will be positioned,

66
00:04:02,046 --> 00:04:05,147
has a so-called blocking capacitor

67
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:09,247
in between the electrode
and the RF power source.

68
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:14,253
This capacitor allows accumulation

69
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:17,902
of charges on the lower electrode,

70
00:04:17,902 --> 00:04:20,153
and, if this happens,

71
00:04:20,153 --> 00:04:23,152
one generates a so-called voltage bias,

72
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:26,352
<i>VDC</i>, on that electrode.

73
00:04:26,948 --> 00:04:31,348
Initially, no such voltage bias
is present on the lower electrode.

74
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,954
When the radio frequency
power is switched on,

75
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:40,802
there is an alternation
of positive and negative voltages

76
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:42,502
on the lower electrode.

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,252
Suppose one is in part of the cycle

78
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:50,551
where the voltage
on the lower electrode is positive.

79
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:55,448
The RF frequency is very high,

80
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:58,448
but electrons are so light

81
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,348
that in one-half cycle

82
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:05,048
they can reach the lower electrode,

83
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:09,899
and they will charge this electrode,
so they stay trapped on the electrode

84
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:12,499
because they are blocked
by this capacitor.

85
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:17,400
Suppose one is in
the next half-part of the cycle

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,151
where the voltage
on the lower electrode is negative.

87
00:05:21,796 --> 00:05:23,997
In this case, the ions,

88
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,147
which are positive, get attracted,

89
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,145
but they are much heavier,

90
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:32,798
and they do not acquire enough momentum

91
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:36,303
to reach, initially, the lower electrode.

92
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:40,451
So, as a result, after one cycle,

93
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:43,451
one has accumulated here

94
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,851
negative charge due to the electrons,

95
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:50,301
and, after a few RF cycles already,

96
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:53,802
a static negative surface bias

97
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,202
is here on the electrode

98
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,902
and on the substrate
that is positioned on it.

99
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,695
The generated DC voltage bias

100
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:06,104
can be minus a few hundredfold.

101
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:09,601
Once this negative voltage is developed,

102
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:14,204
one reaches an equilibrium
electron ion transport regime

103
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:17,151
with strong ion impacts

104
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:20,195
to the lower electrode and on the wafer

105
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,201
as attracted by this negative charge.

106
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,049
Once this negative charge is accumulated,

107
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:30,446
also electrons are more and more

108
00:06:30,446 --> 00:06:33,350
pushed away from this electrode,

109
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,250
and this leaves a zone near the electrode

110
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,698
where there are predominantly ions,

111
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,500
and, of course,
also the neutral gas molecules.

112
00:06:41,998 --> 00:06:45,798
That's why this layer,
where there are little or no electrons,

113
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:48,697
is called the ion sheath.

114
00:06:49,747 --> 00:06:52,001
Also, on the other side,

115
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:54,897
we have the electrode,
which is connected to earth.

116
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:59,098
The electrons will be evacuated to earth,

117
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:03,698
so, very close to that electrode,
there is also a thin ion sheath.

118
00:07:05,304 --> 00:07:09,353
The top electrode is always at zero volts

119
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,453
because it's connected to earth.

120
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,800
The average voltage
within the plasma itself

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,103
is slightly positive,

122
00:07:18,653 --> 00:07:21,249
as some electrons from the plasma

123
00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:24,751
can get lost to the walls of the reactor.

124
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:29,798
So, the time-averaged voltage,

125
00:07:29,798 --> 00:07:33,098
is shown by the red curve here.

126
00:07:33,946 --> 00:07:36,747
We can now calculate the electrical field

127
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:40,446
that is present near the lower electrode.

128
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:44,297
So, the electrical field is determined

129
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,399
by the drop of voltage, that is <i>VDC</i>,

130
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,202
plus <i>Vp</i>, over this distance, <i>tT</i>.

131
00:07:54,501 --> 00:07:55,795
Now we define

132
00:07:56,295 --> 00:08:00,345
the sum of <i>Vp</i> plus <i>VDC</i>

133
00:08:00,345 --> 00:08:03,245
as <i>VT</i> of total.

134
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,098
In a similar way, one can calculate

135
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:11,795
the electrical field
near the top electrode,

136
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:16,846
which is given by the voltage drop, <i>Vp</i>,

137
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:20,696
over this small distance, <i>tp</i>.

138
00:08:21,996 --> 00:08:23,546
One should keep in mind

139
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:27,446
that all these are time-averaged
voltages in the plasma,

140
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,199
as shown in the figure below.

141
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:34,250
In fact, this is the same graph

142
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,750
as we have shown before in the red curve.

143
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:43,850
The time dependence
is presented in the figure above,

144
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,350
so it shows the RF oscillations,

145
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,700
which are centered

146
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,199
around these mean voltages.

147
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:58,395
As the two ion sheaths
near both electrodes

148
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:01,387
contain very few electrons,

149
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,802
but rather the heavier
and less mobile ions,

150
00:09:04,802 --> 00:09:09,297
we can represent them
to good approximation

151
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:14,247
by a series circuit of a capacitor, <i>CT</i>,

152
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,047
and a capacitor, <i>Cp</i>,

153
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,947
and the plasma, with love of electrons,

154
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,750
is then considered to be a conductor.

155
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:29,198
We can now write the ratio
of the total voltage drop, <i>VT</i>,

156
00:09:29,198 --> 00:09:32,399
over the voltage drop, <i>Vp</i>,

157
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,599
as the ratio of the capacitors.

158
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:38,296
Then we rewrite each capacitor

159
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:42,104
in function of the area of the electrode

160
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:45,654
and of the thickness of the ion sheath.

161
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:51,202
It is not necessary, a priori,

162
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:55,795
that the areas are equal
between the two electrons,

163
00:09:56,653 --> 00:10:00,149
and also the thickness
of both ion sheaths

164
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:02,854
doesn't have to be equal.

165
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,599
Of course, an ion sheath
is not a simple dielectric

166
00:10:07,599 --> 00:10:09,803
as in a normal capacitor,

167
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:12,200
but it is a high resistance layer

168
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,501
over which current transport

169
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:17,801
from the plasma to the electrode

170
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,200
is still possible.

171
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,203
We present here the expression

172
00:10:22,203 --> 00:10:24,903
for the current voltage relationship

173
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,902
over such ion sheath

174
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:31,153
as function of the thickness

175
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,003
of the ion sheath.

176
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:35,948
The current is proportional

177
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:39,251
to the power 1.5 over the voltage,

178
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:42,351
and inversely proportioned to the square

179
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,546
of the thickness of the ion sheath.

180
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:47,698
Now we simply assume

181
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,598
that the current,

182
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,548
which is flowing on the lower

183
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:56,052
and on the top electrode are equal,

184
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,048
so we can equalize

185
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:01,249
these two current expressions;

186
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,799
once for the lower electrode

187
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,398
and for the top electrode.

188
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:10,398
We can now combine this expression

189
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:12,998
with this expression

190
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:17,100
to obtain this formula.

191
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,802
What does this learn us now?

192
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:26,003
We should remember now
that what we aim for in etching

193
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:31,252
is that ions are predominantly accelerated

194
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:34,903
by the large total voltage,

195
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,203
which is near the lower electrode.

196
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,504
While we do not aim to create

197
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:45,003
a strong ion bombardment on this side,

198
00:11:45,003 --> 00:11:48,796
you would cause damage
to the reactor electrode.

199
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,903
This formula says that we can achieve this

200
00:11:53,303 --> 00:11:56,703
by choosing the lower electrode,

201
00:11:57,203 --> 00:12:00,597
smaller than the top electrode

202
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:05,004
because there is
a power of four in the formula.

203
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:11,298
An inconvenience of such
so-called asymmetric electrode system

204
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,198
is, however, that the plasma

205
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:17,447
on this electrode is less uniform,

206
00:12:17,447 --> 00:12:21,647
and has more intensity
in the center of the small electrode

207
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:24,052
than at the edges of that electrode.

208
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:30,146
In this lesson, we have explained
the basic properties of a cold plasma,

209
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:33,897
which has a gas temperature
of a few hundred kelvin,

210
00:12:33,897 --> 00:12:36,899
and an electron temperature
of 10,000 kelvin.

211
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:42,154
We then explained the phenomenon
of formation of an ion sheath

212
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:44,395
near an RF electrode,

213
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:47,603
and explained how placement
of a blocking capacitor

214
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:51,249
allowed to generate a DC voltage bias,

215
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:55,153
by which ions are attracted
towards the electrode

216
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:57,952
that carries the wafer
that needs to be etched.

217
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:03,052
Also, we presented the design rule
for the areas of RF electrodes,

218
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:07,353
which resulted in a major bombardment
of ions on the electrode

219
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,053
where the wafer is positioned,
and not on the counter electrode.
