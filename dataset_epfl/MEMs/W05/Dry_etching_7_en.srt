1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,450
While previously we have discovered
some of the processes used in dry etching

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:11,451
of silicon and silicon-based materials,

3
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,750
now we focus on the dry etching

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,045
of organic films, like photoresists,

5
00:00:17,045 --> 00:00:19,195
and the material, polyimide,

6
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,595
and of metals.

7
00:00:21,945 --> 00:00:24,848
One typically uses an oxygen plasma

8
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:28,046
for the etching of organic materials

9
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,849
like photoresist, polyimide, etc.

10
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,603
If one uses ion bombardment,

11
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:37,199
one gets anisotropic structures

12
00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:41,349
when one exploits the redeposition

13
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:44,649
of sputtered material to the sidewalls.

14
00:00:46,403 --> 00:00:48,602
Etch products are water,

15
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:52,395
CO gas, and CO2 gas, typically.

16
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,850
There is a vast choice in mask materials,

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,549
like silicon, silicon dioxide,

18
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,152
photoresist, or metal.

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:06,295
The picture shows a photoresist mask,

20
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:10,095
which was put on a polyimide film

21
00:01:10,095 --> 00:01:13,202
to etch a microstructure
in the polyimide layer.

22
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,749
These pictures show the etching

23
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:20,549
of a 7 micrometers thick polyimide layer

24
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,350
that was deposited
on a silicon dioxide layer,

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,948
and where one has used
silicon dioxide as a mask.

26
00:01:32,497 --> 00:01:35,303
The silicon dioxide was deposited

27
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,588
using a plasma enhanced

28
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,948
chemical vapor deposition system

29
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:41,749
because one can apply then

30
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:44,499
a relatively low temperature

31
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:48,099
to the polyimide during deposition
of the masking layer.

32
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:51,295
The etching selectivity of the polyimide,

33
00:01:51,295 --> 00:01:54,445
with respect to the silicon dioxide,

34
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,145
is over 50.

35
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:02,145
These pictures show
the result of polyimide etching

36
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:06,845
using an erodible mask of photoresist.

37
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,748
Both polyimide and photoresist

38
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:13,249
have similar etching rate,

39
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:15,247
so that the photoresist

40
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:18,847
is gradually consumed during etching,

41
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,951
especially at its edges.

42
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:23,698
That is why the resulting

43
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:27,501
polyimide structure has tapered sidewalls,

44
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:30,251
as the photoresist mask,

45
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,251
at its edges,

46
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,104
became thinner first,

47
00:02:34,104 --> 00:02:36,495
and first disappeared there.

48
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:41,400
A metal mask, like platinum or aluminum,

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,301
is much more resistant to the plasma,

50
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:46,250
and, hence, can be used

51
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,246
to etch structures
with vertical sidewalls.

52
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:54,554
This picture shows effects

53
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:57,796
of aluminum redeposition

54
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,704
in the etched structure.

55
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:02,897
So, this material is removed,

56
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:07,248
and it creates micro-masks in this region,

57
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:09,903
resulting in the generation of <i>grass</i>

58
00:03:09,903 --> 00:03:12,397
as the etching proceeds.

59
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,203
Generally, such redeposition phenomena

60
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:18,101
can be reduced

61
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:22,251
when one uses a plasma
at the lower pressure,

62
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:26,749
in which the mean free part
of molecules is larger.

63
00:03:27,297 --> 00:03:28,448
In this case,

64
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:33,800
sputtered material can then
be more easily evacuated

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,698
from the zone of etching.

66
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,297
Now we will give a few examples

67
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:41,997
of dry etching processes for metals.

68
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,897
We will discuss the etching
of aluminum and aluminum alloys.

69
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:48,498
These materials are used

70
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:53,197
for making interconnecting structures
on integrated circuits.

71
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:57,549
They can also be used as membranes
in switching applications,

72
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,152
or as hard masks in a dry etching process.

73
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:04,300
Next, we discuss
the dry etching of platinum,

74
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,498
which is an important material
for microfabrication of electrodes.

75
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:10,599
Finally, we will discuss

76
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,201
the etching of titanium, tantalum,

77
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,501
tungsten, and molybdenum,

78
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:17,949
which are frequently used
as adhesion materials

79
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,651
for the deposition of the noble metal,

80
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:22,950
platinum, or aluminum.

81
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,251
These materials also serve
as hard masks in etching processes.

82
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,402
Aluminum and aluminum alloys

83
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,902
are used for making interconnection lines

84
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:35,302
in integrated circuit fabrication.

85
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,003
Because dry etching

86
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:41,303
is a consequence
of the use of a reactive gas,

87
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:45,501
etching will be easier
if the formed chemical product

88
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:47,252
is more volatile.

89
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:52,296
This diagram shows the vapor pressure

90
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:54,296
as function of temperature

91
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,995
for three reaction compounds.

92
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:04,398
If one uses fluorine

93
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:05,998
as a reactive gas,

94
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:11,349
the formed aluminum trifluoride product

95
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:16,003
has a relatively low vapor pressure,

96
00:05:16,653 --> 00:05:17,945
so this curve

97
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,750
refers to this temperature axis.

98
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,404
So, vapor pressure is significant

99
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:28,554
only at very high temperature,

100
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:31,354
much higher than used in etching.

101
00:05:33,246 --> 00:05:35,198
These temperatures are clearly

102
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:37,598
too high for microfabrication.

103
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:41,498
That is why fluorine chemistry,

104
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:46,698
which is successful for silicon
and silicon dioxide etching,

105
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:48,697
does not work for aluminum.

106
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:53,095
Instead, one can use chloride chemistry.

107
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:56,504
As the formed reaction product,

108
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:59,303
aluminum trichloride,

109
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:04,403
this curve refers to this temperature.

110
00:06:05,404 --> 00:06:07,146
So, for this material,

111
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:09,746
one has an appreciable vapor pressure

112
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:12,497
at much lower temperature,

113
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:15,047
a temperature which is compatible

114
00:06:15,047 --> 00:06:18,147
with the dry etching temperature.

115
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:21,703
The result is that this reaction product

116
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:26,353
can be easily removed from the substrate

117
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,254
after the chemical reaction.

118
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:32,600
If one would have
a pure aluminum surface

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,201
that is not covered
by an aluminum oxide layer,

120
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:39,702
the reaction with chlorine radicals

121
00:06:39,702 --> 00:06:42,802
and molecules can immediately proceed.

122
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,199
However, as aluminum

123
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,649
is very reactive with oxygen,

124
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:52,248
it always has a native
aluminum oxide layer of about 30 angstrom,

125
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:55,398
which should be etched away first.

126
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:59,553
This thickness is, more or less, variable,

127
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,304
and the oxide is so stable

128
00:07:02,304 --> 00:07:05,204
that there is no reaction
with chloride atoms,

129
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:09,345
<i>except</i> if sputtering
with energetic ions is used.

130
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:13,503
Then, only, the aluminum oxide

131
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:16,103
can be dissociated,

132
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,296
forming the volatile

133
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:21,696
aluminum trichloride reaction product.

134
00:07:22,748 --> 00:07:26,646
Also, one should avoid water vapor
in the reaction chamber

135
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,597
as water can easily react

136
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:32,097
with the chlorine radicals

137
00:07:32,597 --> 00:07:34,898
and with the exposed aluminum

138
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:37,701
to form aluminum oxide.

139
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:44,302
Here, we show the etching
of a 1.5 micrometer thick

140
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,648
aluminum silicon alloy

141
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:52,053
that was deposited on silicon dioxide.

142
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:56,498
One has used photoresist as a mask,

143
00:07:56,498 --> 00:08:01,597
and obtained a selectivity around 1.5.

144
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:06,897
That is, the aluminum etches
almost as fast as the photoresist.

145
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,702
Anisotropic etching profiles

146
00:08:11,553 --> 00:08:13,753
are, more or less, obtained

147
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:17,203
because one has used
a chlorocarbon plasma

148
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,798
that results in polymer deposition

149
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:22,046
on these sidewalls.

150
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:25,247
Also, redeposition of sputter

151
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:28,047
to photoresist
on the sidewalls is possible.

152
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:31,698
If, instead of a photoresist mask,

153
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:35,249
one would have used
a silicon dioxide mask,

154
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,900
and a plasma gas
that did not contain carbon,

155
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,600
or few carbons,

156
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,001
one would have obtained
a purely isotropic etching process.

157
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,602
Sometimes, we observe
corrosion phenomena

158
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:51,102
on the etched aluminum structures.

159
00:08:51,596 --> 00:08:54,248
This is believed to originate

160
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:57,753
from chlorine-containing residues

161
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:01,048
that remain on the etched film sidewalls.

162
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:04,902
If these residues are combined

163
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:07,452
with moisture absorption,

164
00:09:07,452 --> 00:09:11,849
the corrosive acid, ACL, forms,

165
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:15,002
and this leads
to aluminum corrosion products

166
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:18,502
like aluminum trichloride.

167
00:09:19,354 --> 00:09:21,995
The problem is even more severe

168
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:25,195
for aluminum copper alloys.

169
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:29,004
Corrosion can be prevented

170
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:32,499
by rinsing well the wafer
in deionized water

171
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:36,104
after removal from the chlorine plasma.

172
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,695
Also, one can apply

173
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:42,295
a plasma etching step in oxygen

174
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:45,303
to remove residual photoresist

175
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:47,153
and chlorine atoms,

176
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,646
and, at the same time,

177
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,947
restore a thin passivating

178
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:53,948
aluminum oxide layer.

179
00:09:54,697 --> 00:09:58,597
Another possibility is to expose
the etched structure

180
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:00,747
to a fluorine plasma,

181
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:02,746
during which chlorine atoms

182
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:05,546
are replaced by fluorine atoms.

183
00:10:07,448 --> 00:10:11,047
Here, we show the etching
of a platinum film

184
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:13,999
using a photoresist mask.

185
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:19,095
The platinum was deposited
on a thin silicon nitride layer

186
00:10:19,095 --> 00:10:21,195
on a silicon dioxide layer.

187
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,952
The etch rate is very low,

188
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:30,202
and the selectivity
is also relatively low,

189
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:34,149
8, because the platinum
is such chemically inert material.

190
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:39,701
We have used here a low pressure
argon chlorine mixed plasma

191
00:10:40,401 --> 00:10:44,001
with a high negative voltage bias
on the substrate.

192
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:48,495
In the picture,
almost all of the photoresist

193
00:10:48,495 --> 00:10:50,999
has been consumed for etching

194
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,799
through the platinum layer.

195
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,754
The picture here shows the etching

196
00:10:56,754 --> 00:11:00,454
of a 0.5 micron thick tungsten layer

197
00:11:00,454 --> 00:11:03,454
deposited on a silicon dioxide layer,

198
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,802
and one has used here

199
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:10,101
fluorine chemistry and a photoresist mask.

200
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,499
The selectivity is only 1.

201
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:15,251
The etched product formed

202
00:11:15,251 --> 00:11:18,546
is tungsten hexafluoride.

203
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,199
The metal tantalum

204
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,202
can be etched in a very similar way.

205
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:28,947
This picture shows the etching

206
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:32,648
of a 0.2 micrometer thick titanium layer,

207
00:11:32,998 --> 00:11:36,696
which was deposited
on an amorphous carbon film.

208
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,800
One has used chlorine chemistry
and a photoresist mask.

209
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,850
The process has only a low selectivity, 2.

210
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,745
When etching molybdenum
in a fluorine plasma,

211
00:11:50,745 --> 00:11:53,245
similar results can be obtained.

212
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,096
This ends our lesson

213
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:58,496
on the dry etching of organic materials,

214
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:02,696
like photoresist and polyimide and metals.

215
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,503
Etching organic layers

216
00:12:04,503 --> 00:12:08,053
is a relatively easy task using a plasma

217
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,950
as volatile reaction products

218
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,850
can be easily created.

219
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,650
On the other hand,
etching metals is more difficult,

220
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,849
and one needs ion bombardment
for etching to occur.

221
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,999
Whether one uses a chlorine

222
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:22,947
or a fluorine plasma

223
00:12:22,947 --> 00:12:25,000
depends on if a suitable

224
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,250
volatile chemical reaction product
can be formed

225
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,249
at the temperature of the etching process.
