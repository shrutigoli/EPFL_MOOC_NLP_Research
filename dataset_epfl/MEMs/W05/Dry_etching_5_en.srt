1
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:07,850
In this lesson we will introduce
ion beam etchers,

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,981
in which the substrate to be etched
is not located within the plasma,

3
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,773
but subjected to a beam of ions.

4
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:19,345
One can also use ion beams to etch wafers.

5
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:25,629
Ion beams originally were used
for low-thrust space applications.

6
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,595
The main etching mechanism of an ion beam

7
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:34,084
is physical sputtering due to 
the high kinetic energy of the ions.

8
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:38,437
The technique uses 
a low operation pressure

9
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:42,367
leading to large mean free parts

10
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,147
and little or no re-deposition of material

11
00:00:45,147 --> 00:00:47,686
that is etched away from the substrate.

12
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:52,278
Here we see an ion beam etching system.

13
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,058
Inside that system, it is possible 
to vary the angle of incidence

14
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,618
of the ion beam onto the wafer,

15
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,748
which is not possible 
in a plasma-based process.

16
00:01:04,718 --> 00:01:08,340
This picture shows the inside 
of the ion beam etcher.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,200
Ions pass through this grid structure

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,333
and will bombard the wafer, 
which is here placed on this fixture.

19
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:25,932
An analytical, secondary ion mass 
spectroscopy equipment

20
00:01:25,932 --> 00:01:29,564
is incorporated to probe 
the evolution of the etching.

21
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:34,884
Two main techniques are used 
in ion beam etching.

22
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:41,063
One can inject a reactive gas 
into the ion source

23
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:44,613
and then the technique is called
<i>reactive ion beam etching.</i>

24
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:47,848
Examples of such reactive ions

25
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:51,838
are chlorine or fluorine ions.

26
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,726
Use of a single reactive gas

27
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:59,840
allows no independent control of ions,

28
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,966
and neutral radicals flux in the system

29
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,066
because there is only a single gas.

30
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,178
The second option is to use an inert gas,

31
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:11,448
like argon, for the ion beam.

32
00:02:12,658 --> 00:02:18,737
Then it is possible to add a flux 
of neutral reactive gas

33
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:23,929
via another entrance 
close to the substrate.

34
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:31,229
So here is the reactive gas, 
and then the argon ions come

35
00:02:32,509 --> 00:02:34,439
to bombard the wafer.

36
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:39,031
This combination of physical etching

37
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,421
with chemical activity of the second gas

38
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,233
makes that one calls this
<i>chemically-assisted ion beam etching.</i>

39
00:02:47,913 --> 00:02:52,724
Here one can independently control 
ion flux and a neutral flux.

40
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:58,664
However, an inconvenience 
of this latter technique

41
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:03,283
is that the reactive gas 
may diffuse through the system

42
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:08,516
back through the grids 
and contaminate the ion source.

43
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,577
Here we show schematic diagrams
of the inside of the ion beam etchers.

44
00:03:15,607 --> 00:03:20,757
Argon ions are created in an ICP source

45
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:27,710
and then are accelerated 
via three grids towards the substrate.

46
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:35,181
The three grids on which 
different voltages are applied

47
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:37,790
are schematically drawn here.

48
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,242
After having passed 
through this grid structure,

49
00:03:43,002 --> 00:03:47,361
a charge neutralizer emits electrons

50
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:52,012
to balance the charges in the ion beam

51
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:55,544
to avoid excessive 
electrostatic charging in the reactor.

52
00:03:56,594 --> 00:04:00,135
The wafer is mounted 
on a fixture that can be rotated,

53
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:04,534
so one can change 
the angle of impact on the wafer.

54
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,813
The lower schematic diagram

55
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:11,465
details the voltages applied

56
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,915
to the three grid structures 
that are here.

57
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:19,716
The first grid is for capturing electrons.

58
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:23,716
The second one, 
for acceleration of the ions.

59
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:27,328
And a third grid for slowing down the ions

60
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:31,456
before being lead 
into the reaction chamber.

61
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:37,182
What are the limitations 
and opportunities of ion beam etching?

62
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:41,737
A clear limitation is posed 
by the low gas flow

63
00:04:41,737 --> 00:04:47,700
when the operating pressure 
needs to be as low as 0.1 millibar.

64
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,170
To maintain a high etching rate
under such conditions,

65
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,329
one needs a high ion flux

66
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,960
while one does not want to enhance 
too much the ion energy

67
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,222
for applications where this can 
cause damage to the wafer width,

68
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,276
possibly sensitive devices.

69
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:10,133
Another limitation 
is that etching processes

70
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:14,203
that consume or generate 
significant quantities of gas

71
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:15,473
are not possible.

72
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:20,604
An advantage of an ion beam source
over a plasma reactor

73
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:24,074
is found for special applications.

74
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:28,259
For example, the ion beam

75
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,085
has the possibility to expose 
the substrate at an angle.

76
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:38,415
Also, etching in an ion beam system
is more easy to understand

77
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:43,206
as the number of species and possible
chemical reactions are limited,

78
00:05:43,206 --> 00:05:46,248
in contrary to what happens 
in a plasma reactor.

79
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:50,611
It is possible to study 
specific etching processes

80
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:54,126
where one applies, in a controlled way,
ions and neutrals.

81
00:05:55,596 --> 00:06:01,259
Finally, we mention the existence
of focused ion beam systems

82
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:04,288
for the local etching at high resolution.

83
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:09,535
The picture shows 
such focused ion beam system.

84
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:15,181
Such system has a very narrow,
single ion beam,

85
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:20,572
and it has not the wide area 
uniform beam that we showed before

86
00:06:20,572 --> 00:06:22,943
for the etching of a complete wafer.

87
00:06:23,623 --> 00:06:29,043
The narrow ion beam allows 
local etching and sputtering

88
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,474
of certain parts or devices on the wafer,

89
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:34,854
like shown in this picture.

90
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:41,743
So here one has selected 
a specific spot on the wafer

91
00:06:41,743 --> 00:06:47,456
and there, one has locally applied
the focused ion beam

92
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:52,336
to make a cross section through
the interior of the wafer.

93
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:59,198
A focused ion beam is therefore
an important tool for process control

94
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:03,557
as one can have access
to any part of the wafer one wants,

95
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:09,568
and one can analyze technological 
device aspects on a local scale.

96
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:15,407
In this lesson we introduced 
the technique of ion beam etching,

97
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:19,117
which is operated at low pressure
and offers special possibilities

98
00:07:19,117 --> 00:07:21,030
in microfabrication,

99
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,780
and fundamental studies of dry etching.
