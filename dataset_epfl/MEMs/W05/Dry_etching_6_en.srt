1
00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:08,322
In this lesson we will give examples
of a few dry etching processes

2
00:00:08,322 --> 00:00:10,472
of silicon based materials.

3
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:14,964
We will subsequently discuss
dry etching of silicon dioxide,

4
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:18,434
silicon nitrite, and silicon itself.

5
00:00:19,604 --> 00:00:23,518
Etching of silicon dioxide, or silica,

6
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:28,365
requires breaking silicon-oxygen bonds

7
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:33,698
and the removal
of both silicon and oxygen atoms.

8
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:39,987
In practice, one uses frequently
carbon and fluorine chemistry

9
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:43,117
generating volatile reaction compounds

10
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:47,889
like silicon tetrafluoride, carbon oxide,

11
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,799
and carbon dioxide.

12
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:53,839
Due to the stable silicon-oxygen bonds,

13
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,681
one needs energetic ions
to break these bonds.

14
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,373
So one etches at low pressure

15
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:05,481
where it is possible
to have such highly energetic ions.

16
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:10,082
The fluorine to carbon ratio
is chosen in the middle

17
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:13,843
between the etch
and deposition regime

18
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:18,272
so that etching
in the vertical direction occurs,

19
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:21,764
while in the horizontal direction,

20
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:25,765
where there is no electrical field,

21
00:01:26,695 --> 00:01:28,515
there is polymerization

22
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,896
and hence no mask underetching.

23
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:37,336
The substrate is kept 
at room temperature during etching

24
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:41,367
but the wall of the reactor can be heated

25
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,957
at higher temperature

26
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,939
to avoid polymer deposition there.

27
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:52,739
This slide shows a few pictures
of mask materials that are used

28
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,438
for silica etching.

29
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:58,519
The first pictures presents
a photoresist mask

30
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:05,090
and one obtains here a selectivity
towards silica etching of 5:1

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,841
for the conditions of the plasma used.

32
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:12,501
That means the silica etches five times
more rapidly than the photoresist.

33
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,952
Polysilicon is a better masking material

34
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:22,280
and one obtains a selectivity of 20:1.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,824
An aluminium mask is even better

36
00:02:27,824 --> 00:02:30,802
and has a selectivity of 50:1.

37
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:39,024
This picture shows
the result of the silica etching

38
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:42,496
using a photoresist mask.

39
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:47,216
The silicon dioxide layer that was etched

40
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:51,906
has been deposited on a silicon wafer.

41
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:58,618
One sees that the photoresist
is more attacked on the top corners

42
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:01,659
and is slowly eroded
by the etching process.

43
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,460
As gas for this etching,

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,472
one has used C_4 F_8 with CH_4

45
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:15,681
at a pressure of 5 x 10 - 3 millibar.

46
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:20,242
The silica etch rate was
0.25 micrometer per minute.

47
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:25,404
The top picture illustrates
the etching of silica

48
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:28,614
using a polysilicon mask.

49
00:03:30,154 --> 00:03:35,263
The silicon layer that was deposited
on the silicon substrate

50
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:37,764
had the thickness of 9 micron.

51
00:03:39,464 --> 00:03:43,274
One uses the same gases
as in the previous slide

52
00:03:43,274 --> 00:03:46,593
but one can vary,
of course, composition

53
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:51,957
and substrate bias to optimize
the anisotropic etching.

54
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:55,529
The lower picture shows a circular hole

55
00:03:55,529 --> 00:04:00,707
that has been etched
in a bulk silica wafer

56
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,268
using a polysilicon mask.

57
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:08,548
This slide illustrates
a particular process

58
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,177
that uses helium gas

59
00:04:11,177 --> 00:04:14,699
in combination with a halocarbon plasma

60
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,790
with high carbon to fluorine ratio.

61
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,880
That means one uses C_4 F_8

62
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,512
with CH_4 or hydrogen.

63
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:29,973
The top picture
is the result of the etching

64
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,402
without helium gas.

65
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:37,824
And one sees that the sidewalls
are not vertical.

66
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:42,474
This changes when we add helium gas

67
00:04:42,474 --> 00:04:46,256
and one can obtain
much more vertical sidewalls.

68
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,356
The helium gas is inert

69
00:04:51,356 --> 00:04:57,997
but it is believed to increase
the residence time of the active species

70
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,527
at the bottom of the etched structures

71
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:05,277
because of collisions with the helium gas.

72
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:09,269
That is why etching
becomes more efficient there

73
00:05:10,549 --> 00:05:15,860
resulting in more vertical sidewalls
of the etched structures.

74
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,660
In this example, one has used
a strong negative substrate voltage bias

75
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,451
of minus 300 volts.

76
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,721
Pyrex, or borosilicate glass,

77
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:33,501
has as its ingredients mainly silica,

78
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:39,843
but it contains also boron oxide,
aluminium oxide,

79
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:42,843
and sodium oxide.

80
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:45,595
Pyrex is an interesting material

81
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:51,653
because it has
a low thermal expansion coefficient

82
00:05:51,653 --> 00:05:54,955
and a high chemical durability.

83
00:05:56,135 --> 00:06:00,437
In dry etching, one can use silicon
as mask material

84
00:06:00,437 --> 00:06:04,977
and one obtains a selectivity 
towards Pyrex of 1:10

85
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:09,847
for a typical halocarbon gas
etching condition.

86
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:14,078
The pictures show dry etched channels

87
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,558
and a chamber made in a Pyrex wafer.

88
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:23,189
Silicon nitrite is an interesting material
in microfabrication

89
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:26,430
and is often used
for thin membrane fabrication

90
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,629
as barrier layer in high-temperature
oxidation processes,

91
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:34,351
and as mask material silicon wet etching.

92
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:37,641
The silicon-nitrogen bond is a stable one

93
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,321
and needs to be broken
for etching to occur

94
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:44,514
and subsequently the nitrogen
and silicon atoms need to be removed.

95
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:49,772
Pure fluorine chemistry with the gas SF_6

96
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:53,495
or halocarbon chemistry gases can be used.

97
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:56,594
The reaction product
is silicon tetrafluoride.

98
00:06:56,594 --> 00:06:59,815
Also, in this case,
energetic ions are essential

99
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:02,116
to break the silicon-nitrogen bonds

100
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,716
so negative substrate bias is important.

101
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:10,879
Now we will discuss
three silicon etching processes.

102
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,428
First, there is the deep anisotropic
continuous etching

103
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:16,778
of silicon at room temperature;

104
00:07:16,778 --> 00:07:20,160
then there is
the anisotropic pulsed process,

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,089
also known as the Bosch process,
at room temperature;

106
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,440
finally, we present a cryogenic process
for silicon etching.

107
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,071
We have already seen this slide before

108
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:40,223
and it illustrates the continuous
dry etching process for silicon.

109
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:42,692
We already explained before

110
00:07:42,692 --> 00:07:46,693
how one can combine the etching gas SF_6

111
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:50,549
and the polymerization gas C_4 F_8

112
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:54,944
to obtain anisotropic silicone structures

113
00:07:54,944 --> 00:07:58,033
using photoresist as a mask.

114
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,715
We also have already introduced
the dry etching of silicon

115
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:07,775
using the pulsed, or Bosch, process.

116
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:10,734
Here one alternates in time

117
00:08:10,734 --> 00:08:14,737
the etching and the polymerization cycles.

118
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:22,708
The picture on top shows how wider holes

119
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,278
get etched deeper than the narrower holes

120
00:08:26,278 --> 00:08:30,130
because the gas can enter 
more easily a wider hole.

121
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:34,881
The fact that the depth of the etching
is not the same everywhere

122
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:37,751
is also called the <i>loading effect</i>.

123
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,020
The picture at the lower left

124
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,302
shows a detail of the structure
with a scalloping effect

125
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:48,301
characteristic for the Bosch process.

126
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:53,792
One can clearly discriminate
the different cycles

127
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,004
of etching and passivation.

128
00:08:57,904 --> 00:09:00,463
The picture on the lower right

129
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:04,975
shows a whole structure
with still polymer layers

130
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:07,455
that were attached to the side walls.

131
00:09:09,485 --> 00:09:12,305
The surface quality of
etched microstructures

132
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:14,115
in the pulsed process

133
00:09:14,115 --> 00:09:17,967
depends on the used etching conditions.

134
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,957
We already have seen
that the scalloping effect

135
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:23,747
gives rise to non-planar sidewalls.

136
00:09:24,817 --> 00:09:28,658
If this corrugation is too important,

137
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:34,078
one can reduce the etching
and polymerization cycle duration.

138
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:39,468
Sometimes when polymerization
is not sufficient,

139
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:42,511
we can see mask underetching--

140
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,249
so here was the mask

141
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:48,586
and there is a lot of attack
in this direction--

142
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,662
so there was strong mask underetching.

143
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:56,453
By increasing the relative importance
of polymerization

144
00:09:56,453 --> 00:10:01,302
one can avoid such mask undercut
like shown in this picture,

145
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:05,235
which has the correct vertical wall
at the right position.

146
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:12,205
The picture here shows
the bottom of an etched structure

147
00:10:12,205 --> 00:10:15,174
with a very smooth character.

148
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:18,094
This was under good etching conditions.

149
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:24,286
Sometimes one has redeposition
of mask material into the hole

150
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:30,257
which results in local micromasks
that resist to the etching

151
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:34,379
resulting in the formation
of so-called "grass",

152
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,240
as we see in this picture.

153
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,400
The balance between etching
and polymerization in the pulsed process

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,191
is very delicate.

155
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:46,001
If there is too much polymerization,

156
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:50,211
micromasking effects
due to the presence of polymer

157
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:54,672
on the horizontal parts of the structure

158
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,923
can give grass formation.

159
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,244
When there is not enough polymerization

160
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,414
the structure can simply
disappear completely

161
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,494
and one etches away all silicon.

162
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:12,885
Here we see what was left
from a silicon microstructure

163
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,015
that has disappeared almost completely

164
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:22,458
due to important etching
in the horizontal direction,

165
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,187
due to a lack of polymerization.

166
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:30,636
Also the pressure 
of the etching gas is important.

167
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:35,692
When it is too high,
the mean free path in the gas is low

168
00:11:35,692 --> 00:11:40,330
which can give rise to reduced gas access

169
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,891
and removal of reaction products

170
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:47,041
from the bottom of a hole structure.

171
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,967
Therefore at the bottom
of an etched structure

172
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:54,492
we can have less vertical sidewalls
as shown in this picture.

173
00:11:56,012 --> 00:12:02,163
This picture shows a condition
where there was not enough polymerization.

174
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:07,663
So in this case, not everywhere
one has coated with polymer,

175
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:11,829
and then laterally etched holes
in the silicon appear.

176
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,074
These two pictures
illustrate other consequences

177
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:20,496
of having not enough polymerization.

178
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:27,187
This picture shows some bowing effect,
some mask underetching,

179
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,498
while the right picture

180
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:36,048
shows a much higher width
at the top than at the bottom,

181
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:40,468
which is clearly a consequence
of insufficient polymerization.

182
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:45,063
The scalloping effect 
of the pulsed process

183
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:48,063
is again shown on this slide.

184
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:52,980
The picture on the left
shows a corrugation that is obtained

185
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,782
when applying gas application times
of 7 seconds for the etching gas

186
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:03,402
and 2 seconds for the polymerization gas.

187
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:06,433
If this roughness is too important

188
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,514
one can reduce these times.

189
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,563
The structure on the right was obtained

190
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:18,636
by gas application times
of 3 seconds and 1 second respectively.

191
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:24,386
And indeed, this structure benefits
from a much reduced corrugation,

192
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,207
hardly recognizable on this picture.

193
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,888
For some micromechanical applications

194
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,577
it is necessary to realize locally

195
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:39,777
freestanding structures
with vertical sidewalls.

196
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:44,288
By applying a voltage
between a freestanding structure

197
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:46,720
and a fixed structure,

198
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,950
one can, via electrostatic forces,
activate the movable part--

199
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:56,120
for example, if this is a fixed electrode,

200
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,281
and if one applies a voltage here,

201
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:02,402
it will attract the movable part
in a certain direction.

202
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:07,783
An elegant way to realize
such micromechanical devices

203
00:14:07,783 --> 00:14:12,092
is by using silicon on insulator wafers.

204
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:17,284
These special wafers
have a silicon dioxide layer embedded

205
00:14:17,284 --> 00:14:21,534
and beneath this layer
is single crystalline silicon,

206
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:24,665
on top of this layer
is also single crystalline silicon.

207
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:31,446
If one etches through the top silicon
to reach the oxide

208
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:36,636
one can then simply
remove the silicon dioxide

209
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:39,948
so that the top layer becomes suspended.

210
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:45,428
So in this way we can make
freestanding parts.

211
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:49,039
These pictures show finger-like electrodes

212
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,348
made by the pulsed etching process.

213
00:14:52,348 --> 00:14:56,650
And here one has etched 
through 50 micrometer--

214
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,058
that is this dimension--

215
00:15:00,058 --> 00:15:02,332
or through 200 micrometer.

216
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:05,991
This picture shows another result

217
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:10,967
of an optimized silicon
on insulator wafer etching.

218
00:15:10,967 --> 00:15:15,915
The walls are nearly vertical
and the etch rate can be very high--

219
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,813
more than 6 micrometers per minute,
in this case.

220
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,435
The etch depth in this case
was very high--

221
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:24,215
400 micrometers.

222
00:15:26,015 --> 00:15:30,167
However, one can also encounter
unexpected results

223
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:33,463
during the etching of an SOI wafer

224
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:36,546
as shown in the pictures on the right.

225
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:41,525
When going lower in the hole structure,

226
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:45,417
one gets increased etching and roughness

227
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,136
with even a much bigger hole etched

228
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:52,208
just near the silica layer.

229
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,968
This effect is known as
the <i>footing</i> or <i>notching</i> effect

230
00:15:57,968 --> 00:16:00,758
and can be explained as follows:

231
00:16:02,108 --> 00:16:07,309
As long as one etches
through the top silicon layer,

232
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:09,200
as shown in this picture,

233
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
the normal etching
and polymerization cycles

234
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,092
result in vertical sidewalls.

235
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:20,062
However, when reaching
the embedded oxide layer,

236
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,897
due to its insulating properties,

237
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:27,484
it can be charged by the ions
from the plasma

238
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:30,804
so that further incoming ions
get deflected

239
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:35,165
and give enhanced etching
in this direction.

240
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:38,196
That is what we have seen here.

241
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:41,256
And you see the same in this picture

242
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:45,987
where the lower part of a narrow,

243
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:48,737
movable beam has been etched away.

244
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:53,338
This footing effect can be avoided

245
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,173
when one gives sufficient time

246
00:16:56,173 --> 00:17:00,289
to the positive ions
to be evacuated to the plasma.

247
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,999
This is achievable by a pulse process
with short pulse duration

248
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,559
and reduced duty cycle

249
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,121
resulting in a pulsed ion bombardment,

250
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:15,441
and then one waits

251
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:18,931
and there is a compensation
of these charges

252
00:17:18,931 --> 00:17:21,643
by electrons from the plasma.

253
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:25,642
In this way, structures 
with vertical sidewalls

254
00:17:25,642 --> 00:17:28,152
down to the oxide layer

255
00:17:28,152 --> 00:17:30,414
can be obtained as shown here.

256
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:33,534
So this is the lower part
of a silicon structure

257
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:35,684
and this is the oxide layer.

258
00:17:37,384 --> 00:17:40,232
Another technique
for the deep dry etching of silicon

259
00:17:40,232 --> 00:17:42,817
is the so-called <i>cryogenic process</i>.

260
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:47,407
The silicon wafer in this case 
is brought at a temperature

261
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:49,837
of -110° Celsius.

262
00:17:51,727 --> 00:17:55,877
And one uses SF_6 and oxygen chemistry.

263
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:01,218
SF_6 is the etching gas

264
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:04,128
and oxygen is the passivation gas

265
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:08,080
for protecting the sidewall with oxides.

266
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:12,899
This process does not require
a polymerization gas

267
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,510
which eventually avoids
reactor contamination.

268
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,849
High etching rates,
up to 10 micrometer per minute,

269
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,501
can be obtained.

270
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:28,583
And at this low temperature
there is a very high etching selectivity

271
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:34,643
when using silicon dioxide
or photoresist as mask.

272
00:18:34,643 --> 00:18:40,124
So these are the selectivities which
are indeed very high: 3000 and 500.

273
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:47,756
These pictures show the etching
performance of the cryogenic process.

274
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:50,925
Holes with different diameter are etched

275
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:54,097
and show vertical sidewalls indeed.

276
00:18:56,167 --> 00:19:00,077
For a hole with a feature width
of 5 micrometers

277
00:19:00,077 --> 00:19:03,718
some mask underetching can be observed

278
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:09,269
and there is a reduced etching rate
at the bottom of such narrow hole.

279
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:16,069
The hole with the bigger feature width
shows nicely vertical walls

280
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:18,209
on the scale of the microstructure.

281
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:22,467
The etching profile
depends in a sensitive way

282
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:24,830
to the temperature of the substrate

283
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,802
which is also the temperature of the chuck
on which the substrate is fixed.

284
00:19:31,112 --> 00:19:33,513
If one raises the temperature

285
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:39,123
from -110° Celsius,
where everything goes pretty well,

286
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:41,624
to -100° Celsius,

287
00:19:41,624 --> 00:19:45,707
mask underetching
becomes much more important.

288
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,835
Clearly the chemical reactions involved

289
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:54,616
in the etching and sidewall protection
in this process

290
00:19:54,616 --> 00:19:57,116
depend in a very sensitive way

291
00:19:57,116 --> 00:19:58,886
to the temperature.

292
00:19:58,886 --> 00:20:02,027
And the balance
between the two processes

293
00:20:02,027 --> 00:20:03,787
is easily disturbed.

294
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,396
Also, an oxygen flow rate variation

295
00:20:08,396 --> 00:20:11,520
can result in less well-defined
hole structures.

296
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,780
For example, we can see here
grass at the bottom of an etched hole

297
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,490
because there was too much oxygen supply.

298
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,061
If there is too much oxygen,

299
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,343
we will have too much passivation

300
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:32,343
and we can also see deviations
from verticality

301
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:35,539
when etching through the wafer.

302
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,043
While a lot of work has been
focused on generating

303
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:42,963
anisotropic silicon microstructures,

304
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:45,153
it is of course also possible

305
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:48,767
to design an isotropic
dry etching process for silicon.

306
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:53,556
Here one can use the gas SF_6

307
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:57,926
which has a predominantly
chemical action on the silicon.

308
00:20:57,926 --> 00:21:02,147
The picture shows
the result of such etching,

309
00:21:02,147 --> 00:21:07,436
while the diagram here shows 
the structure, how it was realized.

310
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:13,459
It consists of several
silicon dioxide layers

311
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:17,723
and in between two of them
is an amorphous silicon layer

312
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:20,520
and it is this amorphous silicon layer

313
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,890
that has been isotropically etched

314
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,280
which is shown in this picture here.

315
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,953
This brings us to the end
of this short overview

316
00:21:30,953 --> 00:21:34,632
of deep dry etching processes
that are used in the clean room

317
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:38,232
to etch important
microfabrication materials

318
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:43,894
like silicon dioxide, Pyrex glass,
silicon nitrite and silicon.

319
00:21:45,084 --> 00:21:47,434
For anisotropic silicon etching

320
00:21:47,434 --> 00:21:51,215
we have introduced
continuous room temperature etching

321
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:54,263
where there is simultaneous
polymerization and etching,

322
00:21:54,263 --> 00:21:57,445
followed by pulsed
room temperature etching,

323
00:21:57,445 --> 00:22:01,297
where one alternates the etching
and polymerization cycles.

324
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:03,247
And finally, cryogenic etching

325
00:22:03,247 --> 00:22:05,628
where oxygen gas passivation

326
00:22:05,628 --> 00:22:08,567
replaces the vertical sidewall protection

327
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,668
using polymer layers.

328
00:22:10,668 --> 00:22:14,408
Also we mentioned
the isotropic etching of silicon

329
00:22:14,408 --> 00:22:17,318
in a pure chemical etching plasma.
