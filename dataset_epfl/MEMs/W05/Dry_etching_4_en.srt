1
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:09,008
In this lesson, we will present 
main dry etching equipments.

2
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:12,418
Also we will introduce some 
of the plasma sources

3
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:15,654
that are used in modern 
dry etching reactors.

4
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:22,320
This is a schematic diagram 
of a so-called <i>barrel reactor</i>.

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,537
It is one of the first etching reactors 
used in semiconductor microfabrication.

6
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:35,732
It exploits a chemical oxygen plasma 
to remove polymers

7
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:38,422
or photoresist from wafers.

8
00:00:39,482 --> 00:00:43,453
Such a reactor is also used 
for <i>descumming.</i>

9
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:49,224
And descumming is removal
of thin polymer residues

10
00:00:49,224 --> 00:00:52,807
after development 
of a photoresist, for example.

11
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:59,848
The technique is also called 
<i>plasma ashing</i> or <i>plasma stripping</i>

12
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,259
because it removes the organic molecules.

13
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:07,799
There is no ion bombardment 
in this technique,

14
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,601
and chemical action 
from the oxygen atoms

15
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:16,379
and UV radiation is solely responsible
for the etching.

16
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:19,416
The typical working pressure

17
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:23,525
is in between 
0.1 and 10 millibar.

18
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:30,833
Besides the use of oxygen 
for removal of organic layers,

19
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:37,345
one can also use a CF4 plasma 
in this reactor

20
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,102
for silicon etching 
without bombardment.

21
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:46,701
The picture below 
shows the entrance door

22
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:50,808
of such barrel reactor 
and its command panel.

23
00:01:52,624 --> 00:01:57,054
This is a schematic diagram 
of a so-called

24
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,984
<i>chemical downstream reactor.</i>

25
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:08,272
A microwave plasma is generated remotely
from the etching chamber

26
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:13,239
and then transferred 
to the etching chamber.

27
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:20,754
The wafer which is positioned here, 
is hence not influenced

28
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:24,632
by accelerated ions, electrons,

29
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,664
or by ultraviolet irradiation

30
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:31,452
and the etching is purely chemical.

31
00:02:32,192 --> 00:02:36,439
The technique is used 
in critical etching processes.

32
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:40,388
For example, for the etching

33
00:02:40,388 --> 00:02:43,718
of transitor gate oxides

34
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:48,166
which are extremely thin, 
so that even a low voltage

35
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:51,620
can cause dielectric breakdown
of the transistor.

36
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:58,516
The walls of this transfer tube 
are covered with inert materials

37
00:02:58,516 --> 00:03:03,684
like polytetrafluoroethylene, or Teflon,

38
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:07,024
or can even be made of that material.

39
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:14,162
Also, aluminium or aluminium oxide
is used for this transfer tube

40
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:18,888
to reduce chemical interactions 
with the plasma during transfer.

41
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:25,810
This schematic diagram is that 
of a so-called <i>diode reactor</i>

42
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,739
due to the presence of two electrodes,

43
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,234
and we have already introduced 
this reactor before

44
00:03:33,234 --> 00:03:35,160
in our discussion of dry etching.

45
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,894
We explained how 
the substrate electrode

46
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:43,084
can acquire a negative voltage bias

47
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:47,134
by incorporating a blocking capacitor 
in the circuit.

48
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:53,876
Also of importance 
for this high negative voltage bias

49
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:59,867
was the superior electron mobility 
over the ion mobility in the RF plasma.

50
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:07,435
The developed negative voltage bias 
results after a while

51
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:13,006
in strong ion bombardment,
even on insulating surfaces on the wafer.

52
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:18,739
The electrical impedance 
of a capacity of plasma source

53
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,377
is that of a capacitor in series 
with a resister.

54
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:27,077
A match network is required

55
00:04:27,077 --> 00:04:31,717
to couple the impedance of this plasma

56
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:34,023
to the RF power supply.

57
00:04:35,033 --> 00:04:39,966
Such match network has variable
series and shunt capacitors

58
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:44,482
to minimize power reflection 
and recirculating power losses.

59
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,142
The difference between a symmetric

60
00:04:49,142 --> 00:04:54,971
and an asymmetric configuration 
is shown here.

61
00:04:54,971 --> 00:05:00,014
In the asymmetric reactor,
the electrode on which the wafer

62
00:05:00,014 --> 00:05:04,380
is to be positioned is smaller 
than the counter electrode.

63
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,208
It's much bigger.

64
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:13,481
While in the symmetric configuration,
both electrodes are nearly the same.

65
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:19,189
In the asymmetric reactor, 
the electrode on which the wafer

66
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,205
is to be mounted was smaller 
than the counter electrode,

67
00:05:23,205 --> 00:05:28,656
and we have seen before
that this leads to a strong voltage bias

68
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:34,083
on the small electrode, hence, 
heavy ion bombardment.

69
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:38,853
The voltage <i>Vp</i> in that case
was very small

70
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:41,853
so that there is little 
or no impact

71
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:46,818
on the counter electrode, so there
is no degradation of the reactor.

72
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:51,135
In the symmetric diode reactor,

73
00:05:51,925 --> 00:05:55,685
both electrodes have about 
the same surface area

74
00:05:55,685 --> 00:06:00,747
and in this case, all electrode surfaces 
can be bombarded

75
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:05,142
and thus sputter materials 
can eventually diffuse into the plasma

76
00:06:05,142 --> 00:06:07,718
when the gas pressure is too low.

77
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:14,567
To avoid this diffusion into the plasma, 
one chooses typically

78
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:17,169
the gas pressure not too low.

79
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,117
At first sight, a diode reactor

80
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:26,335
with a smaller size working electrode
is advantageous

81
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:31,369
but the RF power will be peaked 
in the center

82
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:37,162
so that there is different etching 
whether one is in the center

83
00:06:37,162 --> 00:06:38,525
or at the edge,

84
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:43,435
and this can be problematic 
for some applications.

85
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:50,958
If that is the case, 
one uses a symmetric diode reactor

86
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:56,251
where the field is uniform
over the wafer.

87
00:06:56,251 --> 00:07:01,860
To reduce the effect of bombardment 
of the counter electrode

88
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,727
one chooses the pressure of the gas
sufficiently high,

89
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,013
so that spluttering from that
counter electrode can be reduced.

90
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:15,993
And as high pressure, we mention here
pressures of the order of 100 millibar.

91
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:21,549
A diode reactor,
like we have now discussed,

92
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:25,592
has as limitation that there is
no independent control

93
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,730
of the ion energy and the ion flux.

94
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,310
Both increase with increasing RF power.

95
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,733
As an example 
where this can be problematic,

96
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:40,099
we mentioned here the etching
of gallium arsenide.

97
00:07:41,385 --> 00:07:46,241
We need here a chlorine plasma 
at a considerable pressure

98
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:51,656
but we want to avoid 
a large voltage bias to the wafer

99
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:56,406
to avoid damage of the material
by the ion bombardment.

100
00:07:57,356 --> 00:08:02,127
However, this obliges 
to have a very low plasma density

101
00:08:02,127 --> 00:08:05,105
that does not give significant etching.

102
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:08,557
Two solutions exists to the problem.

103
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:15,645
One can use a small gap diode reactor
where the electrical fields

104
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:19,608
and voltages are lower, 
or one can exploit

105
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:24,615
a different electrode geometry 
than a diode

106
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:29,236
to decouple plasma generation
from the generation

107
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:32,726
of the negative 
substrate voltage bias.

108
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:38,421
Such decoupling of the plasma generation 
from the generation of the bias

109
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:43,318
was exploited in the newer
etching reactors that were developed

110
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,585
from the early 1990s on.

111
00:08:46,415 --> 00:08:50,978
These reactors are characterized
by a low energy ion bombardment

112
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:55,997
on the wafer, which results 
in a good layer-to-mask selectivity,

113
00:08:56,657 --> 00:09:01,053
less ion induced damage 
of the etched materials,

114
00:09:01,053 --> 00:09:06,089
and no etch-rate reduction 
when the ion energy decreases.

115
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,836
In this new reactors, the iron flux

116
00:09:10,836 --> 00:09:14,076
and ion current density

117
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:20,023
were significantly increased, 
typically by an order of magnitude.

118
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:26,108
As examples of these new plasma sources,
we will explain now briefly,

119
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:31,518
the so called <i>inductively coupled
plasma source</i> or <i>ICP source,</i>

120
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:38,021
the <i>helicon source,</i>
and the <i>electron cyclotron resonance</i>

121
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,107
or <i>ECR source.</i>

122
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,902
In an ICP source, an RF coil

123
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:50,302
operated at 13.5 megahertz

124
00:09:50,302 --> 00:09:55,103
is separated from the plasma
by a dielectric wall

125
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:02,153
which can have cylindrical,
or in this case, a dome shape.

126
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:08,023
An RF current which passes in this coil

127
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:12,662
will induce a counter current 
in the plasma,

128
00:10:13,162 --> 00:10:17,242
within the skin depth of the plasma,
which is a few centimeters.

129
00:10:18,062 --> 00:10:22,718
The plasma acts like a kind
of secondary of a transformer

130
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:26,577
with the ICP coil, the primary.

131
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:31,066
The RF current is primarily carried 
by thermal electrons

132
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:35,807
that rapidly transfer their energy 
to neutral atoms in the plasma.

133
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:44,224
For an ICP reactor, a high voltage 
on the lower electrode

134
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:48,892
is not required, 
so the plasma potential can be low.

135
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:54,107
Still, the plasma density can be high,

136
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:58,100
as it is generated
by the other RF source.

137
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:04,239
The substrate sheet layer is thinner
and there is less ion scattering

138
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:06,453
in the sheet, compared to a diode source.

139
00:11:07,303 --> 00:11:13,207
The plasma operates well at low pressures
of 10 minus 3 to 0.1 millibar.

140
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,594
An ICP source needs to be properly 
interfaced with an RF power generator.

141
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:25,056
The electrical impedance of an ICP source

142
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:29,841
is that of an inductor
in series with a small resistor.

143
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:37,672
The match network, to avoid or reduce 
reflection of power back to the source,

144
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:45,384
can be accomplished with the so-called 
<i>L</i> network which consists of a number

145
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:51,305
of variable series and shunt capacitors
that are adjusted here.

146
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:56,575
This type of plasma has a small 
capacitive coupling compared

147
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:59,510
to the plasma generated in a diode reactor

148
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,361
because the coil is separated 
from the plasma

149
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,752
by a rather thick, dielectric wall.

150
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:12,565
However, the plasma needs to be initiated 
in the beginning via capacitive coupling.

151
00:12:13,415 --> 00:12:19,023
Note that besides the RF power
for generation of the plasma,

152
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:25,862
there is an extra RF power source 
for generating the surface voltage points.

153
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:33,020
We are here in the cleanroom
and show the outside of an ICP reactor.

154
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:37,566
Inside of the plasma source is a coil

155
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:40,986
that surrounds a ceramic cylinder.

156
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:46,721
Here we show such a cylinder 
that has been used and removed

157
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:49,113
after a certain time of operation.

158
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:55,132
At the inside of the cylinder,
we see some degradation effects

159
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:58,559
of the material due to the plasma,

160
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,559
which is the reason why the cylinder

161
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,498
has to be exchanged regularly 
to a new one

162
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:10,451
during maintenance 
of the ICP etching system.

163
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:16,451
Another type of new plasma source 
is the <i>electron cyclotron resonance</i>

164
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,097
or <i>ECR source.</i>

165
00:13:18,747 --> 00:13:22,630
In this design, microwave power

166
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,810
at a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz

167
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,130
is carried by a wave guide 
and coupled to the plasma

168
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,990
through a dielectric window.

169
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,921
The source has built-in 
magnetic field lines

170
00:13:37,921 --> 00:13:40,881
generated by these electromagnets

171
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:45,731
around which electrons can circulate.

172
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:50,117
The plasma absorbs power at a location

173
00:13:50,117 --> 00:13:55,031
where the electron cyclotron resonance
condition is satisfied,

174
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:59,710
that is where the natural cyclotron motion

175
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:03,858
of the electron
around the field line is in phase

176
00:14:03,858 --> 00:14:08,645
with the rotating electrical field
of the ECR wave.

177
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:15,632
Finally, we mentioned as one of the new 
plasma sources, the helicon source,

178
00:14:15,632 --> 00:14:20,503
in which an antenna coil
with a special shape

179
00:14:20,503 --> 00:14:22,859
is wound around the plasma.

180
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:27,766
The helicon wave source works 
at 13.5 megahertz

181
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,138
also in presence of a magnetic field.

182
00:14:30,988 --> 00:14:35,346
Plasma parameters
of the helicon source are comparable

183
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:39,864
to that of ICP and ECR sources.

184
00:14:41,434 --> 00:14:46,181
This slide summarizes the plasma 
densities that are obtained

185
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:51,011
with the various plasma sources 
as indicated here,

186
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:55,785
as well as the gas operation 
pressure regimes.

187
00:14:56,825 --> 00:15:03,257
What we see on this slide is that 
going through more modern equipment,

188
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:09,592
we go to lower working pressures 
and higher plasma densities.

189
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:14,318
Here we show a picture 
and a schematic diagram

190
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:18,371
of an ICP etcher which we have 
already introduced before.

191
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:25,667
We want now to explain the mechanism
of the electrostatic chuck

192
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,119
for clamping of the wafer 
into the reactor.

193
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:35,800
The wafer was introduced 
via a load mechanism to the chuck

194
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,104
and in the chuck, there is a part
which is called <i>gripper</i>,

195
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:45,183
which contains two electrodes 
to which we can apply a voltage.

196
00:15:46,553 --> 00:15:49,786
Here, a positive voltage, 
here a negative voltage

197
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:54,184
and this induces
an opposite voltage in the wafer

198
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:57,598
which is then clamped to the gripper.

199
00:15:58,478 --> 00:16:04,111
For removal of this 
electrostatically bound wafer,

200
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:07,700
one needs to apply opposite voltages
to the electrodes.

201
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,738
In this lesson, we have discussed 
three types of dry etching equipments,

202
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:17,352
like a barrel reactor, 
a chemical downstream reactor

203
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,038
and a diode reactor.

204
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:23,449
We pointed out the limitation 
of a conventional diode reactor

205
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,590
where one cannot vary independently 
in the negative substrate voltage bias,

206
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:31,351
and the flux of the reactive species 
towards the wafer.

207
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:35,130
We then introduced three 
of the newer plasma sources

208
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,837
in which one has decoupled
the generation of substrate bias

209
00:16:38,837 --> 00:16:41,245
from the reactive species flux.

210
00:16:41,245 --> 00:16:44,510
These were the inductively
coupled plasma source,

211
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:48,932
the electron cyclotron resonance source, 
and the helicon source.
