1
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:08,350
After the lessons in UV and electron
beam lithography, this lesson

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,891
will show some alternative
emerging lithography methods.

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,147
They offer new functionalities,
enable micro nano structures that

4
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:20,074
are otherwise not feasible,
allow for rapid prototyping

5
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:21,811
at the nanometer scale.

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:26,338
Some of them are also scalable for
cost efficient nano manufacturing.

7
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:30,594
I will begin with scanning probe
lithography for direct writing.

8
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:33,950
Then I will introduce
nano imprint lithography.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,682
Soft lithography,
and Stencil lithography

10
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:37,989
for replication.

11
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:42,116
Before looking into these
new lithography techniques

12
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:45,118
let's quickly remind that
lithography and microscopy

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,075
have many similarities.

14
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:50,840
In both cases the main goal
is to achieve the best possible

15
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:52,180
spacial resolution.

16
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:54,628
For either imaging or patterning.

17
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:58,271
A lithography tool is also very
similar to the tool used for

18
00:00:58,412 --> 00:01:00,837
microscopy, with some added features

19
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:03,717
to control the dose
of resist exposure

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,920
for example.

21
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:10,227
in microscopy, we inspect the sample
ideally without changing it

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,693
and in lithography, the goal is
to modify the sample

23
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:15,606
so to speak, to write into it.

24
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:21,240
If we take the equivalent of optical
microscopy and lithography

25
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:27,641
we have an optical system with
a lens and then our optical beam

26
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:31,272
is focused through the lens system

27
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:35,278
to the surface and the resolution
is given here by the fraction

28
00:01:35,377 --> 00:01:38,377
limitation, λ/2.

29
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:41,417
In the case of scanning electrons
system for microscopy

30
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:46,717
or lithography, we are using
a system with electro-static lenses

31
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:52,804
or magnetic lenses that can focus
and control the electron beam

32
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:59,571
that comes onto the resist coated
substrate, and then here we have

33
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:06,047
a limitation by electrons scattering
and focusing and charging effects.

34
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,106
The last example is the scanning
probes, where we're using

35
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:18,934
a sharp tip on a cantilever,
and the resolution of this microscope

36
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:23,975
or lithography as you will see
is given by the near field effect

37
00:02:24,084 --> 00:02:27,409
between the tip and the substrate.

38
00:02:27,543 --> 00:02:32,918
These two systems are called
far-field microscopy or

39
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:36,657
lithography, because the energy
source is coming from far away

40
00:02:36,783 --> 00:02:40,571
and is focused on the substrate
and the scanning probe is

41
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:45,010
a near-field system, where we are
approaching our probe very close

42
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,131
to the surface to interact
with it either for imaging

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,601
microscopy, or for patterning
in lithography.

44
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,965
Here you see an overview and
classification of scanning probe

45
00:02:57,132 --> 00:03:00,795
lithography according to the tip
and the action used for patterning.

46
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,574
These interactions can be
electrical, thermal, or mechanical.

47
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,978
They can also be based
on diffusive processes.

48
00:03:09,661 --> 00:03:11,011
We can see that there are

49
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:13,036
interactions that
are rather physical

50
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:17,892
or chemical, and which can be used
to remove material from the surface

51
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,976
or to add material onto the surface.

52
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:25,658
So it is evident that they is quite
a variety of effects between

53
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:29,203
the tip and the surface that
can be used for patterning.

54
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,868
Illustration here shows
the general setup of

55
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:35,423
an AFM based probe
lithography technique.

56
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,436
You can see the AFM cantilever,
the sharp AFM tip, and the laser

57
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:45,635
beam based deflection sensing,
to monitor the probe position.

58
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:50,155
What is also shown here is that
the material underneath the tip

59
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:51,838
is altered.

60
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:56,199
This is done typically by
means of and ultra small

61
00:03:56,328 --> 00:04:01,740
capillary liquid cone that exists
between tip and substrate due

62
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,068
to humidity effects.

63
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:06,172
Due to this capillary liquid,
and eventually, and applied

64
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:09,273
by his voltage one can induce
specific and very locally

65
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:14,051
electro-chemical reactions that
modify the surface material directly

66
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,096
for lithography purposes.

67
00:04:16,528 --> 00:04:19,878
In such a way for instance,
patent graphene-oxide patterns

68
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,436
can be created directly in
the graphene film.

69
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:27,567
The previous examples are still
on an exploratory level.

70
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:31,411
They have potential as future
nano-fabrications as they allow

71
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:35,378
creating patterning directly
in functioning materials.

72
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:39,474
But they are not easily adaptable
for a general purpose lithography

73
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,580
that we know so well
using resist layers.

74
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:46,227
Patterning resist however would
ease the implementation of

75
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,352
these new lithography
methods as one could benefit

76
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,985
from existing know-how, such
as pattern transfer by etching.

77
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,593
This is where thermal scanning
probe lithography comes into play

78
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:03,302
here, a resist is locally removed
which is therefor very close to

79
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,885
what we normally do in
photo lithography.

80
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:08,810
Let me explain in
details how this works.

81
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:12,731
A nanotip at the end of an AFM
can deliver, it's heated to

82
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:17,713
very high temperatures, up to 800°C
or more by an integrated resistive

83
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,850
micro heater and is
brought close to a polymer.

84
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:25,971
A normal polymer reacts
by softening  and can be displaced

85
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,880
or piled up under
the pressure of the tip

86
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:30,454
as shown here.

87
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:35,307
In case one uses special polymers,
that evaporate when brought above

88
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,069
a threshold temperature, then
the local heat of the AFM

89
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:43,552
will not push the polymer away,
but the resist will be completely

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,563
removed, thereby creating
and open pattern in the resist.

91
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:52,142
This resist pattern can be
transferred by etch step

92
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:55,090
into the underlying
substrate material.

93
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,833
And the patterning
step is completed.

94
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:02,137
The resolution that can be
obtained is in the order of 10nm

95
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:07,207
corresponding more or less
to the apex radius of the tip.

96
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:11,386
This is the benefit of
the near field interaction.

97
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,462
It is also a function of the nano
probe thermal time constant

98
00:06:16,218 --> 00:06:19,155
which is in the order of 10ms.

99
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:22,792
A unique feature of thermal
scanning lithography

100
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:26,867
is that writing and reading of
the pattern can be done hand in hand.

101
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:32,026
Indeed, the integrated heat
does enable not only the writing

102
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:34,915
but also the inset to reading and

103
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,927
the metrology of
the written patterns.

104
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:41,683
This allows immediate feedback
control, field stitching without

105
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,474
a use of the alignment markers

106
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,053
and the use of
pre-pattern structures.

107
00:06:46,987 --> 00:06:50,037
Another important difference
compared to other lithography

108
00:06:50,173 --> 00:06:51,935
techniques is the following.

109
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:55,320
Due to the ablative nature of
the patterning process

110
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:57,585
no development step is needed.

111
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,948
Neither are optical proximity
corrections or issues

112
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,089
with electron scattering or
electron damage in electron

113
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:06,297
beam lithography to worry about.

114
00:07:07,683 --> 00:07:10,283
Here you see an animation how
the thermal scanning probe

115
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,901
lithography tool is working.

116
00:07:12,592 --> 00:07:16,342
On the top, you see the side view,
with the counter lever and thermal

117
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:19,008
sensitive resist, and on the bottom,

118
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:22,052
you see a top view of
the scanning surface.

119
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:26,057
With the layout on the left, and
the output AFM image on the right.

120
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:29,098
The tool writes line by line.

121
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:33,273
On the way from left to right,
the hot tip is writing into

122
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:38,410
the resist, and on the way from
right to left, the tip is reading

123
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:39,661
the written pattern.

124
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:45,355
This is repeated line by line, until
the 2D pattern has been completed.

125
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:52,311
Scanning probe methods
are single tip serial techniques.

126
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:55,149
So they are very useful
for direct writing

127
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:59,477
and for rapid prototyping, but they
are very slow for production.

128
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:03,076
Hence, we will now look at,
so called, replication method.

129
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,870
The first one I will show is
the nano imprint lithography.

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:11,629
Nano imprint lithography, or
NIL, is already well advanced

131
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,686
and industrialized and even appeared
on the semiconductor road-map.

132
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:20,880
It was indeed first shown already
in the 1990's, that it is possible

133
00:08:20,988 --> 00:08:25,263
to directly imprint nano structures,
from a stamp into a polymer

134
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:29,586
at the 10nm scale by combination
of heat and pressure.

135
00:08:30,307 --> 00:08:33,757
This outstanding achievement has
triggered a lot of interest from

136
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,707
the scientific and
technical communities.

137
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,070
It is foremost, the simplicity of
imprinting technique that has

138
00:08:41,183 --> 00:08:44,683
some striking arguments, despite
some serious drawbacks.

139
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:48,859
As conventional photo lithography
reaches the feature size limits

140
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:51,972
due to light defraction
and scattering effects

141
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:55,141
nano imprint being
a mechanical technique

142
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,559
instead relies on a one-to-one
master template that is

143
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,147
replicated in an imprinting process.

144
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:08,855
Using a silicon-quartz or nickel
or polymer master

145
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:12,868
the nanostructures can be replicated
in the imprint tool using

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,225
the following procedure.

147
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:18,958
First, the template or
stamp has to be fabricated.

148
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:23,444
This is typically done by electron
beam lithography and etching.

149
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:29,063
Stamp and substrate are
then put in intimate contact

150
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:33,726
with each other, as well as with
the Chuck, in order to

151
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,861
get optimal thermal contact
to the imprinting polymer.

152
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,530
The temperature and pressure
is software controlled during

153
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:41,939
the imprint process.

154
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:46,960
This process step replicates
the inverse pattern of the stamp

155
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:51,582
by viscus flow of the resist  due to
the pressure from the protrusions.

156
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:57,516
Stamp and substrate are separated
at the end of the process

157
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:03,660
and the nano imprint always leaves
behind a so called residual layer

158
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:06,762
of resist underneath
the stamp protrusions.

159
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,540
This layer must be removed by
a so called residual layer

160
00:10:10,713 --> 00:10:14,713
etching, before further processing
can be done on the substrate.

161
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,248
NIL has been shown to deliver

162
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,354
excellent results
for regular features

163
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:25,083
such as periodic lines for gratings.
or areas of dots for filters.

164
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:28,106
It is more difficult or impossible

165
00:10:28,217 --> 00:10:32,979
to replicate very regular geometries
because of the resist rheology.

166
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:39,243
Here on this slide, we zoom into
some details on the molding process

167
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:43,015
and the imprinting process, where we
see in particular how the polymer is

168
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:47,515
displaced from the areas under
pressure into the stamp cavities

169
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:51,993
until they are completely filled,
shown here from left to right.

170
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,600
Different stages of
the imprint process

171
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:58,347
until the cavity of
the mold is completely filled

172
00:10:58,445 --> 00:11:00,270
by the flowing polymer.

173
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:05,033
The viscosity of the NIL resists
depends on the temperature.

174
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:09,668
A typical temperature-viscosity
curve is shown here, with

175
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:13,353
the various transition temperatures
of the polymer.

176
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:18,577
Typical NIL processes follow a well
defined temperature and pressure

177
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:23,174
profile, some realistic numbers
are shown here on the right side.

178
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:28,220
Please note that some imprinting
times can be several hours long.

179
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:31,210
Current R and D is
focusing to speed up

180
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:34,346
this step for high through
put manufacturing.

181
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,621
Since the making of the first master
mold by e-beam lithography is

182
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:42,395
very expensive, one normally
replicates it into working stamps.

183
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:47,149
Here on this slide you can
see some typical examples of NIL.

184
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:54,082
On the top row, they are 100x
magnified optical images taken

185
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:58,197
by a microscope of sub-micrometer
test features.

186
00:11:58,994 --> 00:12:03,131
The scale bar is 10μm.
This shows the master

187
00:12:03,192 --> 00:12:07,680
the working stamp,
and the substrate respectively.

188
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:11,641
The lower row shows
the corresponding

189
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:16,562
AFM images of the master,
stamp, and substrate respectively.

190
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:20,271
It shows the very
accurate application

191
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:26,353
from the initial high-resolution
master here, over the stamp

192
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:29,114
and the final imprinted product.

193
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:33,002
This is a demonstration
of the supremacy of NIL

194
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:37,109
for replication features at a sub
micrometer scale for example

195
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,615
for optical effects.

196
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:42,701
Here on this slide there
are some other unique

197
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,710
NIL samples, such as
defractive optical elements

198
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:50,961
with eight height levels,
as shown here.

199
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,310
At the bottom images we can see
from left to right a gray-scale

200
00:12:57,417 --> 00:13:01,605
grating, with extremely high
resolution, here some molds

201
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:05,882
for microlenses, with
the corresponding replicated lenses

202
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:07,074
in polymer.

203
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:12,055
This image shows
a photograph of a NIL stamp

204
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:14,089
to be used for optical gratings.

205
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:17,891
This is one of the most powerful
and beautiful examples when

206
00:13:17,956 --> 00:13:20,956
NIL out preforms other
lithography techniques

207
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:23,881
in terms of resolution
and through put.

208
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:29,815
One note please. These examples
in fact use the NIL stamp to imprint

209
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,973
the feature into the surface.

210
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,853
There's actually no pattern transfer
into a layer underneath, so strictly

211
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:39,747
speaking this should be
called nano molding

212
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,287
and not nano lithography.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,625
In the next section of this lesson,
I will introduce soft lithography

214
00:13:46,705 --> 00:13:48,655
or micro contact printing.

215
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:52,861
As the name already suggests,
there's a soft, or a gentle contact

216
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:55,559
between a stamp and a substrate.

217
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,110
Soft lithography is a collection
of techniques based on printing

218
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:04,056
molding and embossing using
the elasto-meric stamp mostly

219
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,387
based on the PDMS polymer.

220
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,853
The key element of soft
lithography is and elasto-meric

221
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:16,229
stamp, here in blue with patterns as
release structures on it's surface.

222
00:14:16,724 --> 00:14:22,649
The stamp is fabricated by casting
a liquid polymer precursor onto

223
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,832
the master with
the complementary structures.

224
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:31,653
The mechanical properties of
this stamp are critical to it's

225
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:34,718
ability to transfer
patterns with high fidelity.

226
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:40,604
In principal, any elastomer can be
used to cast the stamp, also most

227
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:45,502
work has focused on the silicon
based rubber, or cross-linked PDMS.

228
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:50,709
The stamp shown here again,
is then inked with an inked

229
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:54,261
with a liquid solution
containing functional molecules.

230
00:14:56,026 --> 00:15:02,101
This can be done by either using
a path shown here left or by wetting

231
00:15:02,221 --> 00:15:05,221
the entire stamp
with the liquid ink.

232
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:09,915
The stamp thereby functions line
a sponge where the ink diffuses into

233
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:13,027
the PDMS, and later out again.

234
00:15:13,297 --> 00:15:16,297
The actual micro-contact
printing step is then when

235
00:15:16,432 --> 00:15:20,770
the ink is transferred from
the PDMS stamp to a surface.

236
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
Depending on the ink
the print transfer can

237
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:26,196
be done on a thin
film of gold or silver

238
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,455
supported on a silicon
wafer, or on a glass slide.

239
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:31,921
Which is shown here.

240
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:35,898
Conform the contact at
the molecular scale between

241
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:40,486
the PDMS stamp and the substrate
surface is the key to successful

242
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,981
transfer ink molecules from
the stamp to the substrate.

243
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:49,077
Micro contact printing is widely
used in printing alkyl thiols on

244
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:52,556
thin films of gold, silver,
palladium, and platinum

245
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:55,644
into a smaller extent
and with more difficulties

246
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,321
alkyl thiols saints on silicon
and silicon-dioxide or glass.

247
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,894
The ink molecules
form self-assembled

248
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:05,526
mono-layers or SAMs,
on the surfaces

249
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:07,515
during the imprinting process.

250
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:12,097
Here the thyol based SAM serves as

251
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,093
the etch mask to
transfer the printed

252
00:16:14,134 --> 00:16:15,734
pattern into gold.

253
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,372
Which then is used as
a mask for further etching.

254
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:24,840
The photos on the right show
some examples of high resolutions

255
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:30,859
of lithography, with on top, here,
the mold, the stamp, and the final

256
00:16:30,988 --> 00:16:33,988
gold pattern from
top to the bottom.

257
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:38,513
So this slide shows another example
of high resolution soft lithography

258
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,855
or micro contract printing, here is
and SAM image of the PDMS stamp

259
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:50,329
showing a regular area of pillars
60nm size, which has been used

260
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:55,361
to transfer a file on a gold surface
which then has been etched in

261
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:58,558
the gold, we can see here
that we lose some resolution

262
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:02,111
due to the diffusion thyol
molecules on the gold surface.

263
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:07,608
And then using a gold pattern to
transfer to the silicon we get here

264
00:17:07,697 --> 00:17:09,822
the final structure
into the silicon.

265
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:14,521
It's a nice example demonstrating
how we can get from a relatively

266
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:19,539
low cost, PDMS stamp, via printing
techniques to the final silicon

267
00:17:19,657 --> 00:17:23,107
structures at the sub
1nm meter length scale.

268
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:27,035
Here in this slide you can see
the schematic illustration of

269
00:17:27,143 --> 00:17:31,368
a PDMS stamp and two possible
problems that may arise due to

270
00:17:31,481 --> 00:17:33,206
the softness of the elastomer.

271
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,175
One is the actual collapse of
the relief structures or commonly

272
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:42,086
known as the paring where
the aspect ratio H over L

273
00:17:42,184 --> 00:17:43,834
is typically bigger than five.

274
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:48,259
The other problem is called sagging
or recessed structures with aspect

275
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,985
ratios where H over D is smaller
than 0.05 during the printing.

276
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:56,550
To avoid these issues one
can rely on a hybrid stamp

277
00:17:56,689 --> 00:18:00,764
that is made of two different types
of polymers with different young's

278
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:04,832
modulus to have an elastic layer
on a more rigid stamp backbone.

279
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,365
This is not show in this slide.

280
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,733
This brings me to the last
example of alternative lithography

281
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:13,928
which is called Stencil lithography.

282
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,386
Vacuum the position through
micro nano stencils

283
00:18:17,516 --> 00:18:22,016
also called lens lithography,
is based on a very thin

284
00:18:22,132 --> 00:18:26,345
membrane with engineered apertures
that is approached to a surface.

285
00:18:26,488 --> 00:18:27,601
Like shown here.

286
00:18:28,071 --> 00:18:32,821
When using physical way to position,
such as thermal evaporation the flux

287
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:36,362
of the incoming atoms will be
partially blocked by the mask

288
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:40,882
and only where the membrane
stencil has apertures atoms can

289
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:42,166
reach the surface.

290
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:45,446
This allows creating metal
patterns without the use

291
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:49,923
of photo resist and associated
process steps such as development

292
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,045
and baking.

293
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:56,988
It is therefore applicable to any
surface and substrate material.

294
00:18:57,717 --> 00:19:01,329
Stencil lithography is a convenient
way to directly fabricate nano

295
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:03,132
wires and their contact pads.

296
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:06,948
For this, a so called, dog bone
geometry is often used as

297
00:19:07,092 --> 00:19:09,479
shown on the left side.

298
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:13,034
PVD of a conducting
thin film material

299
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:17,904
directly creates the nano wire
without any additional process steps

300
00:19:18,027 --> 00:19:21,290
such as developing and baking.

301
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:24,866
Thus we're using the risk of
contamination, which may

302
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,068
effect the electronic transfer
property in the nano structure.

303
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:32,479
It does allow studying new materials
for this type of devices without

304
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,840
a need for electron beam
lithography for the final step.

305
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:41,973
Here on this photo we can see
an SEM of a stencil with

306
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:47,020
the nanowire slit and the two
openings for the contact pad

307
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,883
and the corresponding metallic
nano wire, shown here with

308
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,470
the bigger contact pads that can

309
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:55,118
then be interfaced with
some probe systems.

310
00:19:55,389 --> 00:20:02,976
And here is a typical resistivity
curve of a metallic nanowire

311
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:05,316
as a function of a cross section.

312
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,640
Anti-length.

313
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:10,991
Stencils are fabricated
by UV or e-beam lithography

314
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,658
and aperture etching in very
thin silicon-nitrite membrane.

315
00:20:14,795 --> 00:20:17,333
Shown here, in red-ish.

316
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:22,412
This image shows a 100mm sized
wafer stencil containing hundreds

317
00:20:22,536 --> 00:20:24,848
and thousands of
micro nano apertures.

318
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:27,919
Such stencils can be
reused many times.

319
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,361
Challenges are the stencils
mechanical robustness

320
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:35,034
aperture clogging, and
membrane stress issues.

321
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:37,736
As well as alignment overlay.

322
00:20:37,906 --> 00:20:40,394
Please have a look in
the accompanying references

323
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:41,672
for more details.

324
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:46,167
For creating small structures
with sharp edges, the best

325
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:47,946
deposition method is
the physical vapor

326
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:49,616
deposition technique

327
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,685
which has a long mean free path.

328
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:54,793
Such as thermal,
or e-beam evaporation

329
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,857
which occurs, as we remember,
in high vacuum.

330
00:20:59,136 --> 00:21:02,948
This figure shows the geometry
during the stencil lithography

331
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:06,683
with the dimensions and
locations of the source

332
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:11,844
the stencil aperture, shown
here, and the substrate.

333
00:21:12,633 --> 00:21:17,520
Assuming line of side deposition,
straight lines, one can predict

334
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,275
very precisely the pattern as

335
00:21:20,427 --> 00:21:22,890
a function of
the various parameters.

336
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,567
Another contribution to
the pattern widening is

337
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:32,582
not only geometry, but also
the surface diffusion

338
00:21:32,998 --> 00:21:35,936
of the arriving thermal atoms.

339
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:39,505
From this observation it becomes
obvious that highest resolution

340
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,957
can be achieved by pacing
the stencil very close to

341
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,969
the substrate, and by placing
the emission source

342
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,767
very far as possible away.

343
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,930
Stencil lithography is not meant
to replace the conventional

344
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,820
lithography, but it has some
attractive assets for particular

345
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,260
cases, as summarized here.

346
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,610
In all these cases, normal
lithography is in fact not possible.

347
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,360
The left image shows
how sub micrometer gold

348
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,640
dots can be deposited directly

349
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,390
on organic self
assembled mono-layers

350
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,640
on a SiO2 substrate.

351
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,090
Which is an important layer
for organic electronic devices.

352
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,680
These are the gold dots
directly on the SAM

353
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:27,830
patterned through
the opening of a stencil.

354
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:35,460
The middle example shows
nano structures directly deposited

355
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,930
on Freestanding MEMS
standing counter levers

356
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,570
which is otherwise difficult,
if not impossible to pattern

357
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,030
because resist coating on
a freestanding mechanical

358
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,620
device is hard to realize
or impossible to make .

359
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,380
Here, one can see gold nano dots

360
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,950
deposited on the cantilever
and the AFM tip.

361
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,730
The right example shows stencil
nano structures  that are directly

362
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,150
and locally deposited
onto a CMOS circuit

363
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,170
without the need for resist
chemistry and temperature steps.

364
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,540
This allows for post-processing
highly sophisticated CMOS

365
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,780
circuitry by locally adding metallic
or other material nano structures.

366
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,810
This concludes this chapter on
alternative and emerging lithography

367
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:32,210
we have seen direct writing
using scanning probes and

368
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,770
the replication using soft stamps,
nano imprint stamps

369
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,360
and vacuum stencils.

370
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,840
Please note that all these methods
are so called, top down patterning.

371
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,280
They are approaching the length
scale of resolution in the order of

372
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,420
10nm to overlap with, so called,
bottom up self-assembly

373
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,950
where molecules and nano
particles are using natural

374
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:57,530
force for creating
ordered structures.
