00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,250
After the optical non-contact method for wafer
inspection, this lesson presents tools that

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,400
rely on mechanically probing the surface of
a wafer of a MEMS device.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,660
One example is the mechanical surface profiler
for film thickness measurement.

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,760
We will apply it to the wafer with the bi-morph
cantilever to measure the thickness of the

5
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,240
chrome thin films used to build the device.
Then, I will show you how the atomic force

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,100
microscope is used to characterize the surface
properties in high resolution. We apply it

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:41,620
here to quantify the roughness of the chrome
and sio2 surfaces in the bi-morph device.

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:48,920
The position where we intend to measure the
chrome layer on top of the sio2 layer is here.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,190
To determine the device property, we need
to know precisely the thickness of the chrome

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,429
film as well as the surface quality, because
they influence the device performance.

11
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,170
For the first measurement, we used the mechanical
surface profiler, which is basically a diamond

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,070
needle that scans along a linear path in contact
with the device surface.

13
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:17,760
Here, we apply it to determine the thickness
of the chrome, film thickness, and here, we

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,490
apply it to measure the depth of the etched
silicon part.

15
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,100
Typically, a linear variable differential
transformer or LVDT is used to measure the

16
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,190
z displacement of the tip.
Here, you can see an illustration of an LVDT

17
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,360
device.
This particular case is based on electro magnetical

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,340
inducers.
It is composed of a moving part in green,

19
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,460
and the fero magnetic material in blue,
and the fix part with fixed coils embedded.

20
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,909
Please see in the study documents how such
LVDT is working in detail.

21
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,850
You perform so well measurement down to 1
nm of resolution along the z axis.

22
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:06,640
Typical maximum scan lens are in the order
55 mm. which is a bit more than half a 4 inch

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,390
wafer.
Since a contact force is not well controlled,

24
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,430
it may damage the surface of soft films and
cannot be applied to elastic structures.

25
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,290
The photo on the right side shows a screen
shot from the camera on the tool in our clean

26
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,569
room.
It shows here the tip above and its shadow

27
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,920
below.
We can also see the bi-morph device here.

28
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,920
Here, we see a schematic of the measurement
that will be formed. On the surface, we have

29
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:46,200
the pattern chrome, on the sio2 layer on silicon.
The drawing is not to scale. We do this measurement

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,040
after the KOH etching. As we know, KOH also
etches to sio2 slowly.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,489
So we expect to see this in the profile. The
tip is scanned over a chrome thin film pattern

32
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,230
from left to right.
The scan line is highlighted here in blue

33
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:08,319
on the photo of the device.
The diagram here shows the height profile

34
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,519
on the z axis as a function of the scan location
on the x axis.

35
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,879
The measured step height is 781.4 nm which
is as expected more than the targeted 500

36
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,000
nm chrome thickness.
The additional step comes from the loss of

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,790
sio2 during the KOH aching.
The second curve here shows the scan across

38
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:35,279
the KOH etch shown here on the photo.
Here, the depth is about 67 um which agrees

39
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:39,519
well with the design value and also with the
optical measurement shown in the previous

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,430
lesson.
Please note while the surface profilometer

41
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,340
is very accurate for vertical displacement,
it has a poor lateral resolution due to the

42
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,020
convolution of a relatively blank tip.
To overcome this resolution limit, we now

43
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,680
consider the atomic force microscope or an
AFM.

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,549
AFM is a highly sensitive and high resolution
mechanical surface scanner just like the surface

45
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:10,700
profiler introduced before. The key distinction
of the AFM is that, it operates in force feedback.

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,549
By doing so, it reduces the contact force
between tip and surface.

47
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,840
Due to the high force sensitivity, it does
not harm or scratch the surface and can be

48
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:28,540
applied to very fragile surfaces.
Very sharp tip is a STEM of a flexible cantilever

49
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,020
that bends when a force is applied to its
end.

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,150
The bending is measured by the laser beam
deflection system as shown here.

51
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,350
Here, the tip is a raster scan with an area
of interest and the vertical deflection is

52
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,590
recorded for each x-y position.
Thus providing a 3 d surface image. The said

53
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,500
axis resolution is in the order of 1 Amstrong
or below.

54
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:58,070
Lateral resolutions are below 10 nm. Besides
making 3 d images of its surface at high resolution,

55
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:04,810
it allows us to quantify the surface roughness
which often plays a role for device performance.

56
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,411
The image on the right side here shows a TEM
image of a commercial AFM tip, showing a very

57
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:15,750
sharp epics that provides a higher lateral
resolution.

58
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,280
Let us now apply AFM to measure the surface
roughness of the chrome, and sio2 layer in

59
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,330
the bi-morph device.
On the left side, you see an AFM image of

60
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:33,780
1 of the bi-morph cantilever. The circle here
indicates the area of interest that we want

61
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,500
to inspect in detail with the AFM.
To this end, we mount the sample to an AFM

62
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,050
system, and we align the AFM to scan the area
here on the chrome, and here on the sio2.

63
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:53,240
A photo of the AFM setup in our clean room
is shown here.

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:59,250
This video shows a sequence of screenshots
recorded during a real AFM imaging of the

65
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,830
chrome sample as discussed before.
The video is partially accelerated and edited

66
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,840
to make it shorter. In reality, you should
count for about 3 to 5 min to setup and prepare

67
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,190
the measurement.
And then, about 3 min to record an entire

68
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:26,040
image of about 500 by 500 nm in good resolution.
First we locate the measurement side of interest

69
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,110
with the aid of the integrated optical microscope.
In this case, we aim to inspect a chrome surface

70
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,320
on the bi-morph wafer which is the bright
area on the image.

71
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,550
The AFM cantilever tip is not in contact with
the surface during the navigation.

72
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:46,940
Once we are at the right spot to measure,
we set up and check the measurement parameters

73
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:53,260
such as the scan size, scan rate, and sampling
rate, then we approach the tip to the surface

74
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,130
and start scanning.
The approach between the tip and the surface

75
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,770
is done automatically while monitoring the
cantilever response.

76
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,290
After approaching the surface, the scanning
begins. Here in this sequence, you see the

77
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:12,870
image built up in real time with a real time
topographical profile here at the bottom.

78
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,420
Now we accelerate the video, in reality the
entire image takes 3 min to build up.

79
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,690
Please notice that the x and z axis are not
in scale and the blue and red lines are the

80
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:31,860
result of forward and backward scanning respectively.
The scanning range here, again, is 500 by

81
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,780
500 nm.
Here, are shown the AFM scan data of the chrome

82
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:47,860
film here, and sio2 here.
The left shows the top few in color code with

83
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,710
x y scan area and the z scale here in this
color bar.

84
00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:01,610
The surface topography profile along the blue
line is shown in the center where we see the

85
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,380
chrome has a roughness of about 5.72 nm in
average.

86
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:13,310
We also see that the sio2 is much smoother
and has a roughness of about 0.211 nm in average.

87
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:20,230
To make this difference clear, we show these
2 scanned data with the same z-x value. Here

88
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,680
and here.
Images on the right are a tilted 3d view of

89
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,530
the same scan as shown on the left.
They allow for our eyes to see easier the

90
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,460
surface Nano scale landscape.
This lesson presented 2 mechanical surface

91
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,760
profiler instruments.
Remember that in some cases the physical contact

92
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,640
between the tip and the surface can induce
some damage.

93
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,200
On the other hand, unlike the optical method
seen before, we can also measure the thickness

94
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,160
of opaque film which is not available with
optical methods.

95
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,260
Hence, we can also use AFM to obtain Nano
scale images on both conducting and insulating

96
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,160
materials. This is an advantage compared to
methods using charged beams as you will see

97
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,300
in the next lesson.
