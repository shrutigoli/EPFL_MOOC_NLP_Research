00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,180
Welcome to our mooc in micro and nano fabrication.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,240
My name is Juergen Brugger and I am one of the

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,220
co-authors and teachers of this mooc.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
My name is the Martin Gijs and I am the second

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,400
co-author and teacher of this mooc.

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,220
Together we will show you in the following lectures

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:44,440
the basics of micro and nano fabrication techniques.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,800
We will show you in particular how they are carried out

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,500
in a typical clean room environment.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,220
Today we are constantly using micro devices so called MEMS

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,240
that help us communicating and navigating

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,520
measure our health parameters such as blood pressure and glucose level,

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
monitor and control automotive safety parameters,

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,380
such as airbags and tyre pressure, enable us to enjoy realistic

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,740
augmented reality and video gaming etc

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,300
These devices are ubiquitously available today

18
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,640
becasue they can be fabricated in large volumes and cost efficiently

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,640
The goal of this course is to introduce you to the fundamentals

20
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,840
of the fabrication techniques that are behind these success stories

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,260
which actually have enabled them.

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,400
After this introduction, we would give you chapter by chapter

23
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,780
the theoretical basis to understand the principal mechanisms of

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,740
thin film deposition, lithography, arching and other techniques.

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,800
Each chapter is completed by illustrations and examples

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,960
so that you can clearly see the link between
a particular fabrication step

27
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,180
and the resulting functionality in the micro device.

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:10,060

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,140
During this mooc lectures, I will first show some well known

30
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,500
MEMs devices that we are using in our everyday life

31
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,240
I will be showing particular how micro and nano fabrication has

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,140
enabled their manufacturing in high volumes and at low cost.

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,580
I will then take over to show you how a clean room is designed and operated

34
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,260
to ensure that the fabricated MEMs devices are as clean as possible.

35
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,380
We both we then follow up by describing the

36
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,680
basics of the various fabrication steps

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,940
such as thin film formation, lithography as well as arching.

38
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,280
We hope that you enjoyed our mooc lecture. So let's get started.
