1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,660
Two additional examples of
optical inspection and metrology 

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,020
are a white light interferometer

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,980
and the laser beam surface profiler.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,640
They are particularly useful to determine

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,660
the 3D aspect of MEMS surfaces
as well as film stresses.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,200
We will use again our bi-morph example
and will use both methods

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,280
to determine the bending of substrate

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,200
and the bending
of cantilever devices.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,640
Here you see again our well known bi-morph activated
devices,

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,940
let us now quantify precisely
how much actually

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,260
a cantilever is bend upwards.

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,420
Remember we could estimate this value
by the focus control of an optical microscope

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,000
like shown here.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,220
But, let’s have a much more
precise approach now.

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:55,180
The principle of the white light interferometer
is shown here on the right side

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,960
with a general overview of the setup,

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,620
a zoom into the detail
of interference part,

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,520
and the photography

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,820
of the system in our clean room.

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,280
The white light interferometer system works as
follows.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,000
The light coming into the mirau interferometer,
is focused by the lens,

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,160
and further split into 2 beams
using a semi-transparent mirror.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,240
The reference beam is shown in orange,

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,040
whilst the object beam is shown in blue.

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,200
On a flat sample surface,
the light path of the reference

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,140
and the object beams are totally identical,

27
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,180
which means the light path
difference is 0

28
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,540
and hence constructive interference occurs.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,740
On the other hand,
if the sample surface is not flat,

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,940
the light path difference
between the reference

31
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,700
and the object beam
is no longer 0.

32
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:54,780
Instead, interference intensity as shown in
purple here,

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,400
will change accordingly and is detected

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,720
by a light intensity detector.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,600
This way, the topographic information
of the sample surfaces obtained,

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,260
typical values for field of view resolution

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,660
and "z" scan range are listed here.

38
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,340
On the left side, you see the bi-morph
cantilever device image

39
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,660
with the normal optical microscope.

40
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,160
Inspecting the bi-morph under the white light
interference gives us additional information.

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,140
White light interference image
delivers interference fringes

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,300
that allow quantifying very precisely

43
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,060
the out of claim bending of the cantilever.

44
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:43,920
We can see these fringes here on the bent
part of the cantilever.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,640
By creating a profile along the cantilever,

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,180
you obtain the bending curve with
quantitative values as shown here.

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,920
Please notice that for high bending angles
above 45 degrees,

48
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,920
the system cannot detect
any more interference fringes.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,720
This can be seen in the curve,
by the noisy curve and bumps.

50
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,260
The white light interference allows to create
a 3D colored map on the high profile.

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,720
Here, red means high,
and blue means low.

52
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,400
From a certain point the value and height
cannot be extracted,

53
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,300
because the bending curve
that can be delivered is too high.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,980
In this case, tilting the sample
could be a solution.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,220
The white light interferometer also allows
measuring the width of surface patterns

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,520
and depth of edge grooves as shown here.

57
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,540
In this example, let us assess
the silicon slope

58
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,360
that results from the anisotropic
silicon etch in KOH.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,980
We know it should be about 54.7 degree,

60
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,860
which is the angle between the 100
and 111 crystal planes of the silicon.

61
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,060
But let us measure it now.

62
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:59,720
The data from the white light interferometer
tells us that the silicon cavity is 66 um deep.

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,420
And the silicon slope is 45 um long.

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,740
With these two values, we calculate
the angle to be 55.7 degree,

65
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,820
which agrees very well
with the theoretical value.

66
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:18,600
We can also measure the width
and the thickness of the chrome line here.

67
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,520
But doing so, I also would like to draw
your attention that each measurement

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,260
should be accompanied with
a thorough consideration of the sample condition,

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,700
to be able to correctly interprets
the measurement results.

70
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,520
Here, the measured line width
of the chrome pattern is 7.05 um.

71
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
This is quiet in contrast to
the design width of 10 um.

72
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,000
This difference in values is most likely a
result from a non-optimized lithography

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,920
and chrome white etch process,

74
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,080
and should be improved
for more critical devices.

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,460
The thickness measurement
indicates 2.25um as thickness.

76
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,020
Remember that chrome thickness
was designed to be 500 nm.

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,280
So, how come that we measure 2.25 um now ?

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,560
Let us have a look here at this drawing

79
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,020
which shows the cross section
at the point of interest.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,260
The white light interferometer actually
detects the surface of silicon

81
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,560
and beneath, the transparent silicon dioxide film.

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,180
Here.

83
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,000
Therefore, the optical path difference is
the sum of both:

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,900
the thickness of the chrome

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,900
and the thickness of the silicon dioxide.

86
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,960
In addition, we need to take into account
that the SIO2

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,940
has a reflective index of about 1.5.

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,540
Which also changes the light
propagation inside this medium.

89
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,000
Therefore, since the height difference

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,700
is detected by the light path difference
between the reference and object beams,

91
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,640
we have to consider the silicon dioxide thickness as effective thickness,

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,860
which equals the refraction
index of silicon dioxide

93
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,210
multiplied by the thickness
of silicon dioxide.

94
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,600
Therefore, the measured total height
difference is obviously larger

95
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,400
than the true summation of 500 nm
for the chrome thickness,

96
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,540
and the true silicon dioxide
thickness of about 1.3 um.

97
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,040
If we take into account the thickness
loss due to the KOH etching

98
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,200
and which was already confirmed
by the measurement result

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,240
in the previous lesson.

100
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,020
The situation here reminds us always
not to trust a measurement result

101
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,900
without reasonable evaluation.

102
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,700
Remember in the mooc lesson
on physical wafer deposition,

103
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,060
we mentioned that the stress
from the deposited thin film

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,780
could leads to wafer and device bending.

105
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,380
The origin for this upward
or downward pending

106
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,900
can be either compressive
or tensile stress.

107
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,840
Here, I would like to introduce a methodology

108
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
to determine a thin film stress level by measuring

109
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,500
the wafer bending before

110
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,520
and after thin filmcoating.

111
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,040
To this end, we use a laser beam surface profiler.

112
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,260
It creates a line scan over
the entire wafer surface

113
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,120
and thereby determines the surface profile
and radius of curvature.

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,820
The drawing here on the right side
shows the principle.

115
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,480
A laser beam is aligned to the wafer surface

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,020
and then the reflected beam is detected.

117
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,100
The scanning had incorporated both the laser
source and the detector.

118
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,780
The head is scanning across
the entire wafer at a fixed time,

119
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,000
and any bending of the wafer will induce
changes in the angle of reflection.

120
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,580
Therefore, the curvature profile of the entire
wafer surface can be obtained.

121
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,080
To determine any stress piled up during fabrication,
we measure the wafer curvature before

122
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,880
and after the indoor position.

123
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:56,180
Then we calculate the thin film stress values
according to the Stoney equation shown here.

124
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,320
You already know it from a previous lesson.

125
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,840
Taking the wafer with bi-morph
cantilever device as an example,

126
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,480
let us now see how by adding the chrome film,

127
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,160
the shape of the wafer changes.

128
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,080
The left curve shows the profile of the silicon
wafer recorded on both side with SIO2.

129
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,220
shown here...
before chrome,

130
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,740
the bow is 2.17 um which comes
slightly from the wafer cutting and polishing.

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,080
The right curve shows the same wafer after
500 nm thick chrome layer on one side.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,760
Now the bow is about -17.55 um.

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,100
From these values, we calculate the chrome
film stress to be 440 Mpa(Mega Pascal)

134
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,540
in the tensile direction,
based on this formulae.

135
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,120
Such values are typical in
inducing the resulting bending

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,960
as a common artifact during
thin film processing.

137
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,200
The bow here in the measurement result,
indicates the height difference between the peak

138
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,880
and the valley of the surface profiler.

139
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,200
This concludes this lesson on optical surface
analytical method

140
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,360
for MEMS inspection and metrology.

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,300
I have shown the white light interferometer
and the laser beam surface profilometer.

142
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,040
Both are non-contact and dusts do not
contaminate or damage the sample.

143
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,579
They are simple to use, and they all offer
important and in process characterization

144
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,240
of thin film and stress parameters.
