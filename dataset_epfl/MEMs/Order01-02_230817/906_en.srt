1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,629
MEMs processes like the ones shown in this
mock, involve layer by layer deposition processes 

2
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,960
similar to the fabrication of integrated micro
electronic circuits.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,450
Once the fabrication is finished, it is sometimes
necessary to check and characterize the sub

4
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,510
surface structure,
to perform a quality check, and eventually

5
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,519
analyze when there is a device failure.

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,390
One very useful tool in enabling sub surface
inspection is the focused ion beam or FIB.

7
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,950
It allows removing local material, and is
therefore invasive.

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:45,540
I will show you how a FIB system can be used
to determine the z-axis dimension of the layers

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,440
in the micro fabricated MEMs device.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,580
Here, we show again the bi-morph cantilever
device our case study where we fabricated

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:01,600
the bi-morph with a layer by layer micro fabrication
process shown again here on the right side

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,059
in cross section.

13
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,460
In the previous lessons, the sio2 loss in
the KOH path during the silicon etching in

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,720
step 7 here, was already mentioned.

15
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,869
We have already measured this by the mechanical
and optical profilometer.

16
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,250
Here, we will show you how to use the FIB
to inspect and measure the amount of sio2

17
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,630
loss in more detail
without breaking the entire wafer.

18
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,880
An FIB system is like an electron beam system,
and can also be used for both ion beam imaging

19
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,250
and ion beam milling.

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,270
Instead of using electrons with very small
mass, you will now use positively charged

21
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,270
ions.

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,259
A liquid metal ion source is made of Gallium
which is heavy, has low melting temperature

23
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:51,420
and thus allows for convenient ion generation.

24
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,970
Imaging with gallium plus ions also dimensions
the surface during scanning.

25
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,020
One can now utilize this fact to sputter material
of the sample surface.

26
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,189
The digging or sputtering mode removes material
from the sample surface in a larger area and

27
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,700
in a faster speed using high ion current.

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:14,560
The milling mode removes material from the
surface with slower rate and better spatial

29
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,980
precision.

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,860
It results in smoother cross section, and
performs some polishing, which is essential

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,440
to perform cross sectional inspection and
dimension measurement.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,970
In order to have a well-defined cross section
of the sample, there is a need to locally

33
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,950
protect the surface from unwanted erosion
by the milling.

34
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,129
This function is integrated in DEFIT system
by local platinum deposition.

35
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:43,720
Since ions are damaging the surface when imaging
and modern systems is conflicted into a so

36
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,450
called dual beam system.

37
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,120
That incorporates both an ion beam and an
electron beam column.

38
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,800
As for the SEM, it is better to perform FIB
on a conducting sample.

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,410
In the dual beam system, the in-situ SEM and
FIB columns are arranged at an angle of about

40
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,709
52 degree with respect to each other.

41
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,580
In the FIB chamber, we use a tilted sample
so that it senses the ion beam in the normal

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,319
direction, in order to obtain vertical cross
section with respect to the sample surface.

43
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,830
Therefore, the in-situ SEM image is taken
at the tilting angle of 52 degree with respect

44
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,180
to the surface.

45
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,190
In order to have a better image quality for
us to compare the ion imaging and SEM imaging,

46
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,849
and the volt charging, we coat the bi-morph
device with a 20 nm thick chrome layer.

47
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:43,790
The sample here is at the process stage before
the KOH wet etch ach in the silicon.

48
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:51,610
You can see the image quality is quiet comparative
between ion imaging here, and the SEM electron

49
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,610
imaging.

50
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:58,849
So keep in mind that however, that the surface
is damaged by the ions in the left image.

51
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:05,739
We will now use the FIB for what it is actually
designed for, namely to inspect in detail

52
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:13,480
the cross section in the area where the chrome
pattern forms and etch on the sio2 layer.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,769
Shown Here, This time, we use the bio-morph
wafer after the KOH.

54
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:23,460
Remember we know that KOH has been used to
etch the silicon, also etches the sio2, and

55
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,460
now, we want to verify this etching in detail.

56
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,480
We used the focused ion driller hole at the
edge of the chrome pad.

57
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:41,530
First we add a local layer of platinum protection
shown here by the focused ion beam induced

58
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,740
deposition.

59
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,740
This platinum layer.

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:51,110
Not only reduces the charges during FIB milling,
but it also provides a smoother top surface

61
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:58,200
to reduce ion scattering during digging and
milling, and thus provides a smoother side

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
wall.

63
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:08,720
The photo on the right side shows the structure
after the FIB has been used to mill the hole

64
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,139
at the cross section between the chrome pad
and the sio2.

65
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,970
The platinum protection here, and the hole
created here that goes in deeper into the

66
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,900
silicon.

67
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,340
We now zoom into the area of interest.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,000
With the same after the ion milling, so now
we don’t damage the sample anymore.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,639
And for better measurement, we tilt the sample
to see clearly into the cross section.

70
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,630
We see the silicon substrate here.

71
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:42,050
We see the sio2 which is 1.6um thick here.

72
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,199
And we see the chrome layer 545 nm thick.

73
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,290
We also see the Pt platinum protection layer
here.

74
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:01,539
We see in particular, the under etched sio2
layer that is about 230 nm under etch.

75
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:06,729
Which is exactly the value that we expect
from the KOH etching, from the values already

76
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:13,530
obtained by the optical and mechanical surface
metrology done during the previous lessons.

77
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,509
In the additional study material, you can
find more details on FIB techniques for post

78
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:25,400
process sample inspection and Feeler analysis,
and to what one should pay particular attention.

79
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:33,270
In this lesson, you have seen how to use FI
to inspect the MEMS device with very high

80
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,410
resolution.

81
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:40,040
Remember that this technique is invasive and
damages at least locally the devices.

82
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,139
But it can be applied to a full wafer in mid
process.
