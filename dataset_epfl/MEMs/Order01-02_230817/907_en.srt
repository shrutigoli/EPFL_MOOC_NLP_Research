1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,680
In this module, I will present methods to
characterize the electrical properties of

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,400
micro and nano fabricated devices and systems.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,080
I will first introduce how to measure the
resistivity of thin films, and particular

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,880
provide measured details of the thin chrome
film that we used for the bi-morph actuator.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,990
Then, I will show the functionalities of the
prober station and show how to use it for

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:33,670
electric characterization of the bi-morph
actuator.

7
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,000
Remember our case study of the bi-morph actuator
that we used to run through the typical MEMS

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,320
fabricated processes.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,780
If we now have a closer look in how we can
determine the resistivity of the probe thin

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,909
film
and show how we can calculate and measure

11
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:55,490
the electrical resistance of the chrome heaters,
that are used to induced their bending.

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:02,680
A well-known and widely used method to determine
the resistivity of a thin film is based on

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,420
the so called Van de Pauw 4 point probe measurement.

14
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,579
It is schematically shown here in this drawing.

15
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:19,170
4 needles with about 1 mm spacing in between
are in contact with the thin film in yellow.

16
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,060
A source applying a well-controlled current
through the 2 outer probes induced a current

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,719
flowing through the sample in same frame.

18
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,609
The 2 inner probes are measuring the voltage
difference.

19
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:39,650
The strength of this method is that since
we measure the voltage, and not a current,

20
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:48,860
the contact resistance is not critical, and
allows for more measurement of the resistivity.

21
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:54,610
This method applies to conducting and semi-conducting
thin films as well as to bulk samples not

22
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,679
shown here in this lectures.

23
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:04,709
With the measured value of voltage and current,
we can use the Van der Pauw formulae as shown

24
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,209
here, to calculate sheet resistance.

25
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,050
The pi over log of 2 here, is the geometric
factor aid for using 4-point measurement for

26
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:22,390
thin film with a thickness that is neglect
able with regard to the spacing between the

27
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,390
probes.

28
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,260
We then can calculate resistivity by multiplying
the sheet resistance with the thickness of

29
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,190
the thin film.

30
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,191
The photograph on the right shows the automatic
4-point probe tool in our clean room, which

31
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:39,220
can measure the sheet resistance on multiple
sites on a wafer automatically.

32
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,970
Here is a video showing the operation of the
resistivity meter in our clean room.

33
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:54,540
The wafer to measure is a sio2 coated silicon
wafer, after the 500 nm thick chrome deposition.

34
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,680
Once the wafer is placed on the sample holder,
and the measurement is set up,

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,260
the probing head carrying 4 needles will start
to measure the sheet resistance from 5 sides

36
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,950
on the wafer automatically.

37
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,230
If you ever reach 5 sites sheet resistance,
and calculate the resistivity of the chrome

38
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,730
film on the bi-morph to be 1.076 * 10power-6
ohm meter.

39
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,310
This is a reasonable value for chrome film
deposited on the silicon dioxide by means

40
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,480
of thermo evaporation.

41
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,760
The resistivity of the deposited metal film
may have different values depending on how

42
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,840
the film is deposited.

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,070
It also depends on the underlying material.

44
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,970
Please notice that the resistivity meter can
only measure the un patterned thin film.

45
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:48,270
In the bi-morph device, the chrome resistance
is pattern by lithography to form a conducting

46
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:57,070
path with a certain length L, and the width
W, and a U shape as shown here in this drawing.

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,610
Let us now calculate the resistance of the
chrome heater.

48
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:09,120
Resistance equals resistivity times the resistance
length over the thickness and the width.

49
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,460
The definition of sheet resistance = resistivity
/resistor thickness and the squared number

50
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,840
defined as resistance length / resistor width.

51
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,900
The resistance = sheet resistance * sq.

52
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:27,460
In this case, the sheet resistance of chrome
film is obtained from resistivity meter as

53
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,129
2.152 ohm square.

54
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,199
The effective length of the u shaped chrome
resistance defined as shown here, and the

55
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,639
value is 640 um.

56
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:41,550
The width of the chrome resistance obtained
by averaging the same measurement resulting

57
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,930
in the previous chapter of 7.13 um.

58
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,690
All together we calculate the chrome resistance
to be 193.

59
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,550
2 ohm.

60
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,960
The tool to access to the inner part of the
MEMS and to apply electrical signals is often

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,039
based on a prober,
which is nothing else than fine needles that

62
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:09,449
can be positioned with micrometer precision
on a specific location of a MEMS device.

63
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,840
Tungsten needles can be controlled on an optical
microscope, with micrometer precision and

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,629
controlled electrical signal, that is voltage
and current can be applied.

65
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:26,360
A minimum contact area of 50 by 50 m is needed
to position the needles properly.

66
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,800
Typical curves that one can extract are IV,
CV, C-f and C-t measurements.

67
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,199
To some extent, high frequency measurements
can be done.

68
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:44,360
In our case, they apply a DC voltage to determine
the resistive value of our bi-morph MEMS device.

69
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:53,699
If you see now on the left side SEM image,
one of our chrome bi-morph actuator beams,

70
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:57,870
the blue arrows show where we apply the prober
needles.

71
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,979
Here again, we use a 4 probe principle to
inject the current here, and to measure the

72
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,870
voltage here.

73
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,750
The current then flows through the cantilever
in and out of this new shaped wire.

74
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,830
By doing so, we are not influenced by the
contact positions between the needles and

75
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,830
the contact pads.

76
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,190
Which is not often well defined and could
induce some errors.

77
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:29,240
The right plot here shows the resulting IV
curve of the measurement.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:36,379
The applied current on the x axis and the
resulting voltage on the y-axis.

79
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:42,360
By calculating the slope, we can find that
resistance of the bi-morph actuator is 215

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
ohms.

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,650
It is about 10 % deviated from what we just
calculated in the slides before.

82
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,150
We have seen a few sample, but essential methods
to determine the electrical properties of

83
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,720
fabricated micro devices, which allows ultimately
determining whether the process has been successful,

84
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,639
and allows further to study new material,
and their electrical properties.

85
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,909
This is very important to improve the device
performance of new MEMS and MEMS.

86
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:15,939
This last metrology ends inspection lessons,
closes the MEMS mock lectures.

87
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:20,009
On behalf of the entire mock MEMS team, I
would like to thank you for your interest

88
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,340
and active participation.

89
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,539
As always, we are eager to read your comments
and feedback to further improve these lessons

90
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,280
in upcoming sessions.

91
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,599
Bye for now and enjoy the quizzes.
