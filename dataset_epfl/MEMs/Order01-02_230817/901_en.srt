1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,190
In the past lessons, we have seen the basics
of micro Nano fabrication in a clean room.

2
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:14,350
In the following lessons, I will show you
how you can inspect and measure the fabricated

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,260
structures with various methods.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,540
I will start by introducing how you can use
the optical microscope in different imaging modes

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,820
to visually inspect the device surface.

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,270
I will also show you how you can use the optical
microscope to quantitatively measure

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,490
its "y" actual dimensions and to some extents fill sicknesses and vertical features

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,490
in the "z" direction.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,079
I will briefly mention the important concerns
of calibration.

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,260
So let’s inspect the bi-morph actuator that
we use as a case study in this book.

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,170
Let us see how we can inspect it in order
to validate that the fabrication process was

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,559
successful.

13
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,040
On the left, you see a photograph taken with
a camera mounted on optical microscope.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:08,060
The scale bar, in red, is very important and
serves as a reference to perform dimensional

15
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,520
metrology.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,670
You certainly remember from the earlier lessons
that the cantilever are bent of plane and

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,700
consequently are not in focus.

18
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,860
I will show later how focusing on the optical
microscope can be used to determine the vertical

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,909
extension of the micro fabricated lens device
along the "z" axis.

20
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:34,060
The optical microscope is projecting the magnified
image of the object

21
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,830
via several lenses onto the imaging plane which is either an eye piece or a camera.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,340
Modern microscopes have both modes available.

23
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,680
Using eye allows somewhat to get a quick overview
and identify contrast mechanisms in the image

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,160
quiet fast.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,760
The camera is then better suited to record
images and videos to perform metrology and

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,810
to do image processing.

27
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,159
Magnification of samples can go up to 1000
times, which allows seeing features as small

28
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,630
as half a micrometer for high contrast samples.

29
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,590
Light is either transmitted through transparent
samples or is reflected from opaque surfaces.

30
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,620
This photo shows a typical optical mic which
is installed in a clean room.

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,459
The number from 1 to 11 indicates the key
components of the instrument that allow adjusting

32
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,850
the microscope settings for various imaging
modes and for the x, y, z positioning of the

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:34,060
sample.

34
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:40,670
The right side shows the light path coming
from the right source going through the lenses

35
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,350
into the sample and back to the eyepiece or
camera.

36
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:49,580
In this situation, the specimen is viewed
in the so called bright field imaging mode.

37
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,600
This means that, basically, all the lights
is used to image the surface.

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,140
Here, you will see 3 possibly and often used
variations of optical inspections.

39
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:05,760
Left, the already mentioned bright field imaging,
in the center, the so called dark field imaging,

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,660
and in the right hand side, it is the differential
interference contrast mode.

41
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,319
Let’s first look at the difference between
bright field and dark field.

42
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,670
In dark field, there is a path stop introduced
in the light path that blocks the central

43
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,810
part of the illumination.

44
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,200
Using only the peripheral part of the illumination
greatly reduces the image brightness but enhances

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,580
the detection of scattered light.

46
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,400
This dark field imaging mode is therefore
much darker, but it shows much better

47
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,480
any irregularities on the surface such as edges,
defects and dust.

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,650
In the DIC mode, a Nomarski prism is used
to split the incoming light into two beams

49
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,560
that are shifted by about 2 nanometers.

50
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,980
Any light path difference between these two
beams caused by surface topography will result

51
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,430
in interferences.

52
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,379
Using linearly polarized light ensures that
the two polarizations of the two split incident

53
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:05,800
light beams are orthogonal to each other after
passing through the prism.

54
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,960
This way, no interferences will occur until
the reflected light from the sample is passing

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,769
through the prism again,
But the polarization of the split light beam

56
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,370
is rotated back to the same direction.

57
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,500
Interference between the lights from the 2
adjacent points allow quantifying the height

58
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,009
difference on the sample surface which provides
a 3d appearance of the image in the DIC mode.

59
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:33,889
When we inspect the bi-morph device in these
3 modes, we can then see clearly how the images

60
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,259
are different.

61
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,669
The bright field image shows the true colors
and gives a general overview of the sample

62
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,509
surface and dimensions.

63
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:49,900
The dark field is darker in general and highlights
parts of the sample that scatters the light

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,349
beside the bands cantilever and the carriage
edge slopes in silicon,

65
00:04:55,349 --> 00:05:00,949
you can see in particular the sharp edges
of the metal pattern, you can also small bright

66
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:06,600
spots on the metal contact part which shows
some surface roughness due to processing.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,480
They could also be dust or contamination particles
in case the sample was taken out of the clean room.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:19,800
The DIC image here on the right side reveals
a sort of a 3D surface image as it highlights

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,050
small surface topographic variations by the
interference effects.

70
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,659
All three imaging modes show complementary
information if relevant, one should use them

71
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:36,069
all to complete the inspection of a micro
or a Nano structure surface.

72
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:40,960
This table provides an overview of optical
inspection variables along with the particular

73
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,880
features and main areas of use.

74
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,020
Besides the 3 modes already mentioned,

75
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,160
the bright field, the dark field and the DIC modes,

76
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,080
the table also lists either imaging modes

77
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,820
that are not shown in detail in this course,

78
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,240
but that are used depending on the sample nature.

79
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,640
For instance, an image living biological cells
that are transparent,

80
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:10,649
one often uses a phase contrast mode to create
contrast by interference of the light caused

81
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:13,840
by phase shift inside the sample.

82
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,100
Polarizing the light is another way to create
contrast due to birefringence effects

83
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,720
often used when imaging minerals crystal.

84
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,440
And finally, an often used mode is to work
with fluorescent material that allows labelling

85
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,140
selectively part of the sample to create additional
contrast.

86
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,680
Besides quality control by optical inspection,
it is often necessary to measure dimensions.

87
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,420
This is called metrology and is meant to quantify
the device length width and thickness.

88
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,879
Modern optical microscopes have a scale bar
on the screen as a reference for the lateral

89
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,879
dimensions.

90
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:55,020
To ensure accurate dimensions, one performs
measurements on a well-known calibration sample.

91
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,480
This allows converting the number of micrometer
per image pixel into physical dimensions.

92
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,520
Using the one handed x objective on a chrome
mask calibration sample, one can see that

93
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:12,569
1 pixel corresponds to about 0.1243 micrometer.

94
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:17,369
We now inspect the bi-morph device with a
10x object to determine the lateral dimensions

95
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:23,240
of the silicon dioxide beams and chrome wires
by using the calibrated value of the pixel size.

96
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:30,120
In this case, you measure the width of the
chrome wires to be 99.4 micrometers,

97
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,479
which is slightly less than the 100 micrometers
in the design.

98
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,129
This deviation is most likely a result of
telefography processes and chrome etching.

99
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:47,449
Please also remember that the resolution here,
is limited by the fraction to about 500 nanometers.

100
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,889
To some extent, the optical microscope also
allows measuring vertical dimensions.

101
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:57,479
This practice is simple to implement and allows
for a first order of magnitude estimations.

102
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:04,099
As we know, the depth of the focus in an optical
microscope is shallow, particularly when using

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,840
high numerical aperture objectives.

104
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,780
If there are 3D at surface features on the
surface that touches 10 cantilever or edge holes,

105
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:19,099
we can manually displace a sample up
or down by along the z axis by the knob,

106
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,969
and thereby going in or out of the optical
focus.

107
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:26,300
This knob here, is scaled with 1 micrometer
of resolution.

108
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,929
If we focus on the top surface of the bi-morph,
record the scale number and then shift focus

109
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,740
to the bottom of the silicon cavity,

110
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,420
we can read on this scale the travel of the sample

111
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:40,040
and hence its radical extension.

112
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:45,620
Here, we measure the focus which is placed
in z axis by about 70 micrometer,

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,020
which is roughly the depth of the edge group.

114
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,660
For more precise measurement,
one should use another metrology tool

115
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:59,380
such as an optical or mechanical profilometer,
for instance, as shown later in this mooc class.

116
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:03,620
In this lesson, I have shown you how the optical
microscopy can be used,

117
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,440
as convenient method for inspection,
quality control and dimension measurements

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,800
of micro fabricated systems.

119
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,000
After every step in a micro Nano fabricated
process,

120
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,040
it is recommended to perform

121
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,400
a visual analysis of the sample

122
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,600
to detect any potential defect or mistake,

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,230
before continuing the processing.

124
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,780
The optical microscope is a workhorse instrument

125
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,800
that provides much information on the device quality and dimensions.

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:38,220
There is no need to contact its sample and
it works for both opaque and transparent specimen.

127
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,050
It is regarded as a fundamental and very important
method which is used very frequently in R&D

128
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,300
as well as in industrial production.
