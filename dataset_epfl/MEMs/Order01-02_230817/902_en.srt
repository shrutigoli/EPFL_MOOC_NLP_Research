1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,860
In wafer inspection, metrology and quality
control, 

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,510
it is very important to determine

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,860
the exact thickness of deposited thin films.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,180
Here in this lesson, I will show

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,340
how we can precisely quantify
the thickness of transparent films

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,520
such as silicon dioxide or silicon nitrate
using optical methods.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:29,910
We will use again the bi-morph device as an
example and determine the SIO2 thickness.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:35,600
Remember, we have already seen the silicon
dioxide coated to silicon wafers

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
in an earlier lesson.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,280
Pay again attention to the different colors
appearance

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,480
which is a function
of the sio2 layer thickness.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,740
This effect is due to the interference between the light reflected by the upper

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,320
and lower boundaries
of the transparent thin films.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,399
It allows already getting a first estimation
of the SIO2 thickness.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,020
For more precise value, we need specific tools.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,740
I will now show you how we can determine
the SIO2 layer thickness of the bi-morph device

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,640
shown here again.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,260
The SIO2 layer not only defines the mechanical
properties of the free standing bi-morph cantilever,

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,660
over here,

20
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:25,720
but it also delineates the mask
layer for the KOH action like here, here , here

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,920
and here.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,490
Finally the SIO2 layer also serves as an electrical
isolation between the conducting chrome wires

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,740
and the underlying silicon substrate.

24
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,820
There are 2 ways to perform optical measurements shown here

25
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,380
and that use polychromatic light

26
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,980
that is incident to the surface
either normal or on the angle.

27
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,060
The light is then reflected back to the instrument

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,300
and by measuring intensity wavelength,

29
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,960
or polarization of the reflected light,

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,560
one can compute the thin film properties.

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,100
For instance by knowing the film parameters
of "n" and "k",

32
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,000
where "n" is the refractive index,

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,420
and "k" is the extension coefficient respectively,

34
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,460
one can precisely determine the SIO2 layer thickness.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,660
It is also possible to measure
multiple thin films.

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,700
These techniques are entirely
non-destructive to the sample.

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,020
An equipment to measure the layer thickness
of thin films using the normal incidence mode

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,440
is called reflectometer or transmitometer
as shown here on the right side.

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,660
It is based on illumining the surface with
polychromatic light of wavelength

40
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,700
between 200 and 1100nm.

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,140
The reflectometer detects the change
in intensity of the reflected light

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,400
over the light source spectrum.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,599
Intensity variations are due to thin film
interferences.

44
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,420
The illumination spot is in the order of 1.5 mm
as a consequence,

45
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,920
only large film samples
can be measured.

46
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,240
The range of thickness measurement is between
1 nm and 40 um.

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,650
This is quite a wide range.

48
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,420
This method is often used on photoresist,
SIO2, silicon nitrate class, and polymer samples.

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:26,739
It also allows "n" and "k" values,
in case the thickness is already known.

50
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:32,560
Please consult a company document for more
physics backgrounds of this measurement.

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,300
Let us take again the wafer in process for
the bi-morph device,

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,980
shown here.

53
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,760
you apply this method at the border of the
wafer, here,

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,240
where there is a large enough surface area

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,000
to place the measurement spot.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,080
In this particular case, we measure
the SIO2 layer thickness

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000
after the KOH etching.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,220
Remember that the target value
for the SIO2 layer is 1.5 um.

59
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,780
We also know that the SIO2 serves
as a mask for the KOH etching.

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,460
But that the SIO2 is also ached slowly in
the KOH etch part.

61
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,620
Hence, we expect to see
a reduced thickness of the SIO2.

62
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,560
Let’s now verify this here.

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,240
The curve here, shows the reflectance on the "y" axis

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,340
as a function of the wavelength
on the "x" axis.

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,090
This spectrum shows a wafer curve
as shown here,

66
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,380
which is then fitted mathematically
to determine the SIO2 thickness.

67
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:38,120
In our case, we get 1.278 um which is with
the goodness of fit of nearly 1.

68
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,480
As expected, the thickness of SIO2
has been reduced

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,580
from our initial value of 1.5 um to 1.278 um.

70
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,660
The 200 nm difference obtained is expected
and is due to the loss of SIO2

71
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,920
during the KOH silicon etch.

72
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,660
Another often used tool is
the spectroscopic ellipsometer.

73
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,000
Here, the angle of light incident
is inclined

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,740
which induces a polarization
change after the reflection.

75
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,100
The linear polarization of the incoming light
is changed to elliptical polarization

76
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
for the reflected light.

77
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,210
The spot size of the light is in the order
of 400 um.

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,270
And can be aligned to a microstructure
if needed.

79
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,560
The wavelengths can be varied
between 190 nm and 2000 nm,

80
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,200
which allows measuring film thickness
from a few Amstrong

81
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,860
up to 50 um thickness.

82
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,800
The tool also allows determining to some extent
the composition roughness and "n" and "k" values,

83
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,389
where "n" is a real, and "k" is the imaginary
part of the refractive index.

84
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,980
It can be applied to a variety of dielectric
optically transparent thin films,

85
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,860
and even some metal thin films.

86
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:53,580
Please consult the study material for further
data on the basics behind this method.

87
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,060
As before, I show you now how to use the ellipsometer

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,599
to measure SIO2 layer thickness
in the bi-morph shaped area.

89
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,660
The spot size is small enough to measure
the SIO2 thickness at the border of the device

90
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,729
as shown here.

91
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:14,820
The two curves here, showing the "y" axis, the
"Alpha" and the "Beta" parameter,

92
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,740
for an angle of 45 degree and as a function of wavelengthhere shown in eV unit.

93
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,350
The parameters alpha and beta in y axis of
the spectrum are called ellipse parameters.

94
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,220
They are composed of the incident angle and
some geometric factors that describe the shape

95
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,820
of electrically polarized light
after the reflection.

96
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,140
The measurement here results in 1282 nm,

97
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:45,220
which increases very well the data obtained
from the reflectometer.

98
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,020
In this module, I have introduced 2 optical
techniques to determine the thin film thickness.

99
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,800
The reflectomer allows us a quick
and simple measurement.

100
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,599
For more precise measurement, it is advised
to use the ellipsometer.

101
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,880
Both of them do not touch and damage the sample,
and no sample preparation is required.
