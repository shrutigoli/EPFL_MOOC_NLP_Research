1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:10,570
Now, I will show you how charged electrons
in a scanning microscope can be used to perform 

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,870
inspection, quality control, and metrology.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:20,380
First, I will remind you briefly how an electron
microscope works and how electrons interact

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
with matter.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,770
Then, I will list the various electron signals
that I used to examine the sample.

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:33,440
I will briefly mention the issue of electrons
charging, and show how the same can be used

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,230
to perform dimensional metrology at a nanometer
scale.

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,950
As a quick reminder to what we have already
seen earlier in this mock chapter of electron

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:44,950
beam lithography.

10
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:50,760
We use a focused electron beam primarily to
overcome the diffraction limit of optical

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,850
systems that are typically in the order of
lambda over 2,

12
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,210
or around 300 nm for visible light.

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,010
Remember that electrons can be associated
to wavelength depending on the electron energy,

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,980
the associated wavelength can be as small
as a few um.

15
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,980
Please notice however that the resolution
of a scanning electron tool is not limited

16
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:19,870
by the electron wavelength,
but by the focusing ability of the system

17
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,870
and the electrons scattering, as we have already
seen in the previous lesson.

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:30,080
As a thumb rule, remember that a SEM can resolve
images of conducting samples down to a few

19
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,380
nm, as you can clearly see on this electron
microscope here, showing the bi-morph cantilever

20
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,630
in very high resolution.

21
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,220
In a scanning electron microscope, electrons
are emitted from an electron gun here, and

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,570
accelerated under high voltage to obtain momentum
and travel through the chamber.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,140
Several electromagnetic lenses shape and steer
the electron beam.

24
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,990
In order to avoid unwanted scattering between
electrons and atmospheric molecules,

25
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,090
the entire system is working in a vacuum chamber.

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,009
The electron beam is focused on the specimen
structures down here and interacts with its

27
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,200
atoms.

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,959
Detectors and filters, here, number 7 and
8 collect the back scattered electrons.

29
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,310
The brightness of each pixel is determined
according to the number of collected electrons.

30
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:31,770
The electron beam is deflected to scan the
scanned surface pixel by pixel and line by

31
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,260
line to record an image.

32
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,190
During the electron scanning process, negative
charges accumulate on the surface of the electric

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,790
material which reduces the image quality.

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,060
Therefore, for high quality images, a conductive
sample is required, or a non-conducting material

35
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,340
has to be coated with a thin conducting film.

36
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,630
Typically, in good conditions, a modern SEM
system can reach resolutions down to about

37
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,480
1 nm and below.

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,170
Different electron signals can be detected
in a scanning electron microscope system.

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,520
On the right side, you see possible electron
atoms interaction.

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,160
We call the incident electron as primary electron
(PE).

41
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:24,270
Mostly, when a PE hits an atom, it generates
a secondary electron (SE).

42
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:30,910
Which we can collect to have a secondary electron
image or so called SE image.

43
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,430
This is the most commonly used signaling in
SEM which gives us a good contrast cost by

44
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,800
a sample surface topographic structures.

45
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,390
The SE detector is situated in the electron
beam path as shown here in blue.

46
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,040
And is called in lens SE detector which collects
most of SE efficiently.

47
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,660
Best scattered electrons (BSE) are primary
electrons that are reflected or back scattered

48
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,550
by elastic collisions with atoms.

49
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:09,630
Atoms with higher atomic number generates
higher BSE signals, which allows detecting

50
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,480
material contrast.

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,239
Another special detector is called Everheart
Tonly detector (ET detector).

52
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,240
It is designed to collect both SE’s and
BSE’s.

53
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Unlike the In-lens SE detector, the E-T detector
is placed on the side in the SEM chamber as

54
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,949
shown here in orange.

55
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:38,550
To be able to collect SE and BSE with large
angles with respect to the PE.

56
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,960
This enhances the image contrast for topographic
and etch features.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,800
The signal generated from these detectors
called high efficiency SE imaging (HE-SE2)

58
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,419
for the specific same model that we used during
the demonstrations in this chapter.

59
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:04,680
PE with high enough energy can also knock
out inner shell electrons from the sample

60
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,110
atoms.

61
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,869
This causes an electron from a higher energy
state to fill the empty state whereby a photon

62
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:13,869
is released.

63
00:05:13,869 --> 00:05:16,539
This is the so called characteristic X-ray.

64
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:23,119
By detecting the energy dispersive x ray,
we can therefore, perform spectroscopic compositional

65
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:27,919
analysis of the sample
in other words, we can determine what material

66
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,250
we are looking at, and this at a very high
spatial resolution.

67
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,050
Here, we can see 2 SEM image taken with different
detectors.

68
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:43,490
Both images are taken under same conditions
such as electron energy and working distance.

69
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,759
On the left side, we see the image taken by
in-lens secondary electron detector.

70
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,039
It is very bright because it collects most
of SE.

71
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,849
On the down side, the charging effect of the
sio2 layer on the bi-morph is also obvious.

72
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:09,499
On the other hand HE-SE2 detector shown here
on the right hand side provides better contrast

73
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:13,879
and clearer etched definition in the case
of the bi-morph device.

74
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,860
For our purpose, the choice of this detector
is thus preferred.

75
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:26,919
In order to better demonstrate the material
contrast of BSE image, here, we use a carbon

76
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,360
Nano tube sample as an example.

77
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,270
Such a sample is used to adjust and calibrate
the SEM tool.

78
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,259
Here, are bundles of carbon Nano tubes.

79
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:39,280
The scale bar is 10um.

80
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,960
The In Lens SE image on the left side, here
we cannot distinguish the metal and cobalt

81
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,030
catalytic Nano particles that are used during
the synthesis of carbon nano molecules.

82
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,430
While in the BSE image on the right side,
each catalytic particle are highlighted and

83
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,050
can be easily detected.

84
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:05,389
If there is a downside of charged particle
imaging to mention, it is the problem of charging.

85
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:11,439
If the electrons used to image the sample
cannot be removed to ground, then, they will

86
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,029
accumulate in the sample,
which will deviate the trajectory of the next

87
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,270
electron.

88
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,249
The direct consequence is a blurred image.

89
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:26,860
The 3 SEM images here show photoresist which
is insulating on sio2 which is also insulating.

90
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,379
One can see the charging effect in the left
image that increases over time in the middle.

91
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:39,389
One remedy is to coat the sample with a very
thin conducting layer, either gold or chrome

92
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,389
layer.

93
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:43,110
The result can be seen here on the right.

94
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,870
Notice that, of course, we are now imaging
the gold layer on top of the sample.

95
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,840
But for many investigations in MEMS, this
is not an issue, and allow seeing the surface

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,050
quality of the device.

97
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,199
To conduct the electron charger to ground,
it is important to ensure a proper conduction

98
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:01,199
path.

99
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:07,899
Example by means of a conducting cape as shown
here.

100
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,719
In order to perform a calibrated dimensional
measurement in an SEM,

101
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,139
one needs to first ensure that the instrument
is calibrated.

102
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:21,699
This is done typically using a calibration
with known dimension.

103
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,669
This will translate then, the conversion ratio
between each pixel in the data acquisition

104
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,389
and assembled dimensions in nm or um.

105
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,560
This allows defining a scale bar which then
can be used to measure the size of unknown

106
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,200
samples with high accuracy.

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,320
The calibration sample are typically made
by electrons beam lithography.

108
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,940
It is however then known that, due to over
exposure or under exposure,

109
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,210
or over or under development, the exact pattern
which is not perfectly predictable.

110
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,860
That is why instead of using the pattern line
with its calibration reference, one favors

111
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:07,400
a periodic pattern where the pitch is highly
accurate even if the individual pattern widths

112
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,760
are not very precisely defined.

113
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,530
The SEM image on the right shows the surface
of the bi-morph device where the SEM is now

114
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,690
used to measure the width of the chrome pattern.

115
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,250
The white lines are positioned on the same
tool to accurately measure the chrome pattern.

116
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,370
It really confirms now that the value obtained
before, the chrome pattern is about 7.2 um

117
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,410
wide, which is much less than the design 10
um, and which is due to some lithography effect.

118
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,130
If you see how they inspect a MEM sample in
a scanning electron microscope,

119
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,520
we mount the sample hole of the silicon MEM
sample on the transfer stage.

120
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,710
A load lock maintains the high vacuum inside
the SEM chamber during the sample transfer.

121
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:00,440
After the sample transfer, we setup the right
configuration of the system.

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,140
The first step is to position the sample to
a proper working distance with respect to

123
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,070
the electron column and detector.

124
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,250
Then, we use the controller to tune the electron
beam and the image.

125
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,190
Here on the screen, you see the electron beam
image made on a silicon sample with the proactive

126
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,450
IMH goose.

127
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:22,940
You see how one can navigate around and zoom
in and out.

128
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:29,820
Here, we have seen how electrons, as charged
particles in a SEM can be used to inspect

129
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,860
a MEM device surface.

130
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:38,010
They allow for very high resolution in imaging,
and they allow for dimensional metrology.

131
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,560
Remember that some materials might be damaged
by the electron charged or heat generated.
