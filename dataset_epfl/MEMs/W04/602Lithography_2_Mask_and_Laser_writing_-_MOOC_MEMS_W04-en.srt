1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,395
In this lecture I will describe the
process flow for making a photo mask.

2
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,847
I will in particular focus on the
use of a direct laser writer

3
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:19,327
that allows to convert a CAT file
into a physical mask.

4
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:22,705
I will also show a couple of
cleanroom videos that demonstrate

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,372
the technique
and conclude with some examples.

6
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:30,648
In this lesson we are going to focus
on the direct laser writing

7
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,938
and the fabrication of a photo mask
used in a mask aligner

8
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,959
for UV photolithography.

9
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:39,163
There are 2 main approaches
in light based lithography.

10
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:44,271
One being the serial writing
using a scanning laser beam

11
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:48,956
on the substrate referred to as
direct laser writing.

12
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:52,287
The second approach
consists in exposing

13
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:54,644
the substrate
through a mask.

14
00:00:55,191 --> 00:01:00,404
The exposure duration for direct
laser writing, being a serial process

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,822
will heavily depend on the surface
and doors to deliver to the photoresist.

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,917
In practice, the exposure of a
4 inch wafer or a 5 inch mask

17
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,434


18
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,673
can take from a few minutes
to more than an hour

19
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:16,529
depending additionally
on the required resolution.

20
00:01:16,922 --> 00:01:20,447
Direct laser writing is therefore
mainly used for mask making

21
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:24,505
and eventually for some prototyping
and fabrication of small batches

22
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:30,452
where a mask based exposure will be
preferred in the case of large series.

23
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,191
Additional features of direct laser
writing include

24
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,261
the possibility to obtain
high resolution features

25
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:41,849
in a non-contact manner.
The laser-based light source

26
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:46,667
additionally allows for very high
power densities and narrow line width.

27
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:49,864
For ultimate resolution of mask
features such as needed

28
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,822
for DBV, e-beam lithography
is an alternative.

29
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:56,758


30
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:59,444
In the exposure through a mask
method, here shown

31
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:03,634
we gain a lot in time as now the
entire wafer or part of it

32
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:07,955
is exposed in just a few seconds
so we can get high throughput

33
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,587
and produce many
wafers per hour.

34
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:17,174
Still, for making the mask, we need a
writer; either laser or electron based.

35
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,358
Before going into details
of direct laser writers

36
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:23,714
we will first have a look at the
process flow for the fabrication

37
00:02:23,904 --> 00:02:27,979
of a photomask that will stand as
a motivation throughout this chapter.

38
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:33,893
A photomask consist of a thick
quartz or soda-lime square plate

39
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:38,501
coated with a thin, opaque
chromium layer.

40
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,037
In order to pattern this chromium
layer that will selectively

41
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,868
block or allow light to pass
during the exposure

42
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:48,643
we must perform following
sequence of steps.

43
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,839
After coating the mask with a layer
of photoresist that is typically

44
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:56,011
of positive tone and
sub-micrometer thick,

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,065
a laser writing is used.
By scanning and blanking

46
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,379
the laser beam one can expose
arbitrary patterns

47
00:03:02,554 --> 00:03:04,466
into the resist layer.

48
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,489
Then follows the development
of the resist to reveal

49
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,573
the desired portions
of chromium.

50
00:03:11,753 --> 00:03:15,265
The metal can then be etched in
wet chemistry before removing

51
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:19,774
the resist in solvents to obtain
the final photomask.

52
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:25,843
A direct laser writer consists
of a laser light source

53
00:03:26,095 --> 00:03:30,083
and a variety of optical
components that will shape the beam

54
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,449
and tune its intensity
before impinging the wafer

55
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:37,205
which would be down here. This would
be the place where we place the wafer.

56
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,902
The beam may either be focussed into
a single spot or shaped by

57
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:45,753
a spacial light modulator (SLM)
or digital mirror display (DMD)

58
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:50,786
to project a line or area of pixel at
once in order to improve throughput.

59
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:54,318
Various elements, including
the final write head

60
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,418
enable the control of
demagnification of

61
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,708
the projected pattern
as well as final resolution.

62
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:04,094
Additional important elements
include a high resolution

63
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,539
mechanical stage equipped with an
optical interferometer

64
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:11,574
to displace the wafer under the
static write head

65
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:15,025
as well as an independent camera
and illumination system

66
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,788
in order to image and register
alignment marks

67
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,308
for multiple layer processes.

68
00:04:20,882 --> 00:04:23,582
When compared to parallel exposure
in a mask aligner,

69
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,862
direct laser writing enables
convenient dose modulation

70
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,747
throughout the exposure.
This allows, for example,

71
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:35,251
greyscale lithography where the dose
is modulated to partially expose

72
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:40,510
the resist layer and tune its final
form in 3D. This is additionally 

73
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:44,466
useful to perform dose
tests on sensitive patterns.

74
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,667
The 2 SAM images here
show examples of such

75
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:52,099
3D greyscale lithography.
A micro-lens area here on the left

76
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:55,935
and the planar lens recircular 
fragmented slopes here.

77
00:04:56,924 --> 00:05:02,624
But these patterns are impossible to
make with planer UV lithography

78
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:06,600
and can only be made by a 
direct laser writer where one can

79
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:11,510
control the exposure doors
locally on the photoresist.

80
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:15,646
The ultimate resolution limit
in direct laser writing is based on 

81
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,185
the Rayleigh criterion
and is approximately 

82
00:05:18,377 --> 00:05:22,139
Î»/2 X the objective
numerical aperture.

83
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:26,928
This gives a good idea of how finely
the laser beam may be focussed

84
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:31,209
on the surface of the resist.
In practice this theoretical value

85
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:33,937
must also be compared to
the resolution limit

86
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,844
and processing of the photoresist
resulting in an ultimate resolution

87
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:41,636
which is typically in the order of
600 to 800 nm.

88
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,405
The final write head of the laser
writer may also be exchanged

89
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,571
with a finer lens of different
focal lengths to adapt

90
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,732
to writing surfaces
and required resolution.

91
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:55,833
Longer focal lengths will allow, for
example for the projection of

92
00:05:56,034 --> 00:06:02,234
a space light modulator over a
larger area and thus allowing,

93
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:08,118
and thus allowing for faster writing
but will result in a lower resolution.

94
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:11,165
This is due to 2 effects:
First, the contribution of longer

95
00:06:11,342 --> 00:06:15,817
focal lengths reduces the length's
numerical aperture for a given

96
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:19,754
entrance pupil and second, the fact
that the same number of pixels

97
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,350
being projected over a large area
effectively increases the pixel size

98
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:28,987
and minimal feature size. In this
context, one may also indirectly

99
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,567
relate the number of assignable
elements on the SLM

100
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:35,459
to the final
resolution of a system.

101
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:41,769
Typically the CAT files that define
the design to write consists of

102
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:46,442
a Victorial description of different
layers and repetition of basic cells.

103
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,074
They are of a standard format
called CIF or GDS.

104
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:56,243
It is interesting to point out that
the fully written 4 inch wafer

105
00:06:56,434 --> 00:06:59,909
may contain hundreds of millions of
features that must be handled

106
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,968
when converting the design from its
original form

107
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:06,922
to a laser writable one. Essentially
the final design preparation

108
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:11,180
may include simple steps such as
the mirroring of the design

109
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:14,196
in order to obtain the desired
pattern after projection

110
00:07:14,387 --> 00:07:18,687
through a photo mask. More complex
operations include the fracture

111
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:23,163
of the design into sub-elements
or stripes that the laser writer

112
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:27,588
will write. This will essentially
depend on the desired resolution.

113
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:32,234
Advanced features include shape
corrections that take the entire process

114
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:35,940
into account in order to obtain
final features as close as possible

115
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:42,911
to the original design. One example
is the use of serifs, shown here

116
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,930
to compensate for diffraction
at sharp edges or to add some bias

117
00:07:48,143 --> 00:07:51,156
to the exposure to compensate
for the final beam size

118
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,858
as well as the axle
asymmetry.

119
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:59,825
Now that the resist layer on the
chrome coated mask has been exposed

120
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,305
the positive resist is developed.
Here we are using 600 nm thick

121
00:08:05,514 --> 00:08:10,226
positive photoresist. The development
is performed in an alkaline solution.

122
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:15,426
After thorough rinsing the exposed
areas are cleared and ready

123
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:19,119
for the actioning.
The actioning of chromium is here done

124
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,222
via wet chemistry. The process is
isotropic and may result in

125
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,472
a slight under-edge. It may also
take longer time to clear the chromium

126
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:36,073
in small apertures due to limited
chemical renewal at the surface.

127
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:39,671
These aspects may be compensated
for at the design stage

128
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:44,135
and will have a strong impact when
aiming for ultimate resolution.

129
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:48,037
After the chrome edge, the
photoresist is removed from the mask

130
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:53,127
using solvents before a final
rinsing and drying of the photo mask.

131
00:08:54,511 --> 00:08:58,486
Here you can see a photomask in
chrome and glass that has been written

132
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,812
by the laser writer in our
cleanroom and that will be used

133
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,328
for the UV lithography.

134
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:11,924
As said, the main application field of
direct laser writing is mask writing

135
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:15,908
however, one further interesting
application of direct laser writing

136
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,947
is the fabrication of, for example,
SU-8 structures.

137
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:24,429
This epoxy like negative resist can
be coated up to mm thick

138
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:28,485
and stands as a robust functioning
material used for optical elements

139
00:09:28,678 --> 00:09:31,803
MEMS and master molds for
further processing. 

140
00:09:32,264 --> 00:09:37,139
As the mold may be further replicated
and only one single master is needed

141
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:43,289
direct write laser is ideal for the
production of such elements.

142
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,700
On the top you can see 2 images
with test patterns that demonstrate

143
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,026
the high aspect ratios; up to 10:1
in this case, reached in

144
00:09:53,243 --> 00:09:57,943
direct writing laser and below you
can see 2 examples of

145
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:01,554
structural elements. A radial test
structure with narrow tapers

146
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:06,505
here on the left and the mold for
microfluidic channel here.

147
00:10:07,498 --> 00:10:11,348
Direct laser writing is not limited
to flat 4 inch wafers as seen

148
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:16,281
up to now. In the direct laser writing
setup the laser head is fixed

149
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:20,722
but if the substrate motion can be
controlled freely, lithography on 3D

150
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:24,706
features is possible as shown
here in this video.

151
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:30,078
Another extreme application of direct
laser writing is that it may be

152
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:33,063
scaled up for the writing of
several square meters

153
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:38,648
surfaces for examples, in the case
of large displays which are used

154
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,145
in production in consumer
electronics.

155
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:44,850
Here you can see some specialists
preparing the table and stage

156
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:47,379
of such a
large system.

157
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,157
This concludes this chapter in the
lithography where I introduced

158
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:56,951
to you the mask making process
using a direct laser writer.

159
00:10:57,347 --> 00:11:00,784
I have shown you some details
about the process flow of the

160
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,540
photomask fabrication and showed you
some insights into the

161
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:10,060
direct laser writer equipment and how
we get from the CAT file to the mask.

162
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,048
At the end I showed you some
examples that can be done

163
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:20,237
by playing with the energy and the
dose of the direct laser writer.
