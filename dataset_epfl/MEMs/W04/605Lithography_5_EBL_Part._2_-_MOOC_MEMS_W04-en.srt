00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:06,744
In this second lesson on
Electron Beam Lithography

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,697
We will now focus on
the different processing issues

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,663
for EBL, that are
the design optimization

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,912
and the writing parameters.

5
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:17,492
Remember that in
the previous lesson

6
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,479
we have seen the main elements
that are required to form a focused

7
00:00:20,574 --> 00:00:23,812
electron beam, and how these
different elements operate

8
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:27,040
and interact to guarantee efficient
scanning of the electron beam

9
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,227
on the sample.

10
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,360
In the second chapter of the EBL,
we will now focus on the actual

11
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:35,546
process of writing with the EBL tool
and data a user typically follows

12
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:36,577
in the clean room.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,130
Starting with the design preparation
we will study electron-matter

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,278
interaction, followed by practical
examples of positive and negative

15
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:45,497
resist exposure.

16
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:49,001
We will continue by seeing how
proximity effect and alignment

17
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,123
procedures are performed in EBL.

18
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:53,810
I will conclude the chapter by
showing a few examples

19
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,907
that are typical and unique for
Electron Beam Lithography.

20
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,653
The electron beam is typically of
corrosion profile, and it's scanned

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,463
across fields and sub-fields
to expose the resist with

22
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,114
the desired patterns.

23
00:01:05,218 --> 00:01:09,031
Here, we will take a closer look at
what truly happens within one of

24
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:10,417
the sub-fields.

25
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:15,685
The cat design files are typically
in .cif or .gts format.

26
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:18,795
The patterns in these files
are either fully vectorial

27
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:22,475
or built from n-gons, with
a finite number of edges.

28
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:25,901
They must be discretized
in a number of basic trapezoids

29
00:01:26,014 --> 00:01:28,914
that are filled with shots
that will be exposed.

30
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:32,380
This process is referred
to as Fracturing.

31
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,593
Besides the fracturing of design
into shapes and shots

32
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:40,037
additional steps may be included
at this preparation stage

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,028
for the EBL writing, in order to
specify local design modifications

34
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:45,786
of those assignments.

35
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,600
These details will be
presented towards

36
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,596
the end of this lesson.

37
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:53,370
The essential principle related to
fracturing is the assignment of 

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,632
physical beam step size

39
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,716
BSS, to split the design

40
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
in individual shapes
and exposer shots.

41
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,367
Essentially, one must choose
a grid size where the e-beam tool

42
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,577
will lay down individual shots.

43
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:12,063
The choice of the BSS is related
to two important considerations

44
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:16,607
one, the resolution target,
and two, the beam diameter.

45
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:20,992
As for the first criteria concerning
the design and resolution target

46
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,867
the BSS must be a multiple
integer of minimal features

47
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,287
for appropriate discretization.

48
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:31,804
The choice of BSS is basically
the down-sampling

49
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,818
of the vectorial design.

50
00:02:34,162 --> 00:02:37,312
For features that do not lie
strictly on the fracture grid

51
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,996
this down-sampling may induce
aliasing and artifacts

52
00:02:41,124 --> 00:02:43,912
requiring a grid size
significantly smaller 

53
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:46,641
than for simple horizontal
vertical lines.

54
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,582
The second criteria
is the beam diameter.

55
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:53,335
In order to expose the patterns
with the homogeneous dose

56
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,874
the BSS should be equal,
or ideally smaller than

57
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:58,196
the beam diameter.

58
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:01,114
If this is not the case,
wavy line edges

59
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:05,725
or disconnected dots will be written
instead of smooth filled patterns.

60
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:12,753
The left figures here show the black
structure that is to be written with

61
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,104
electron beam.

62
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:18,959
Each of the squares represent
the sub-fields in which the beam

63
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,779
can be scanned quickly.

64
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:26,406
In the sub-fields, there are shapes
which are themselves cut into

65
00:03:26,537 --> 00:03:30,100
trapezoids, which are shown here,
which are here simply squares

66
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:34,500
but can be any trapezoid-shapes,
each trapezoid is written line

67
00:03:34,618 --> 00:03:37,768
by line, shown here,
by the scanning e-beam.

68
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:41,843
The same concept is shown on
the right for a more complex shape

69
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:46,624
here the beam jumps from one
trapezoid, here, to the next one

70
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:50,108
and then raster-scans in each
of them, jumps to the next one

71
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,283
to write the next pattern.

72
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,205
Let's start by only considering
the effect of BSS alone

73
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,242
without taking into account
the trapezoid fracture.

74
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:05,734
The goal here on this slide is
to expose three round disks

75
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,573
with the electron beam.

76
00:04:07,683 --> 00:04:12,183
We choose a beam diameter 5nm,
but vary the grid size from

77
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,069
5nm here on the left

78
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:16,069
to 2nm here on the center.

79
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:20,132
We can see step-like artifacts
on the edge of the disk

80
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:25,234
at 5nm grid, but less on
the 2nm grid, which is obvious.

81
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,030
We see that with reducing the grid
of 2nm minimizes this effect

82
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,856
even though the beam
diameter is still the same.

83
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:37,020
The advanced method, shown here on
the right, allow for the positioning

84
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:40,131
of the shots beyond
the orthogonal grid.

85
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,910
This method offers good shape
approximation associated with

86
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:48,057
the limited number of shots,
but it implies specific

87
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:49,951
design preparations.

88
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,623
In practice, depending of
the position of the features

89
00:04:54,704 --> 00:04:57,766
on the orthogonal BSS grid,
large deformation may be

90
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,103
unintentionally induced by
the fracturing of the design

91
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:04,224
into the trapezoids
that the tool can write.

92
00:05:04,352 --> 00:05:07,027
This may effect the structure
symmetry , pitch

93
00:05:07,146 --> 00:05:10,608
or overall dimensions that may
be critical for the final device.

94
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:16,458
Here on the left, we see a result
of a large rectangle fine trapezoid

95
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:21,677
LRFT fracture on a 5nm BSS.

96
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,541
In the center, the design was
fractured to optimize

97
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:28,850
the structure symmetry in
curve-edge approximation.

98
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:33,273
The trapezoids are not symmetric
on both axis on the disk.

99
00:05:34,346 --> 00:05:40,296
Following the same example as before
reducing the BSS further to 2nm

100
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:43,162
improves the disk approximation.

101
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,575
Still considering a 5nm beam,
this 2nm grid size also benefits

102
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:52,387
from a a smoother line edge
due to the beam overlap.

103
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:57,631
The black lines shown here,
and here, indicate the writing

104
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,732
order of the electron
beam across the trapezoids.

105
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:04,649
Let's now have a look how
the fracture method influences

106
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,280
the EBL write time.

107
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:10,911
A total writing area is a major
component in the design write time

108
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,395
but is not affected by fracture.

109
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,004
On the other hand, the direct link
between beam step size

110
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:21,044
beam diameter, and therefore
the current, has a large influence

111
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:22,310
on write time.

112
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,117
Typically, beam current may
be varied over three orders

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,950
of magnitude, from 100 pA,
to over 100 nA.

114
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,651
Thereby, effectively decreasing
write time by the same order.

115
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,520
With the beam step size
equal to the beam diameter

116
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:44,643
moving from 5nm
to 50 nm step size

117
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:50,575
will decrease write time by
a factor of 100, as we can see

118
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:53,184
from the diameter
versus current relation

119
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,096
shown here in this graph.

120
00:06:58,286 --> 00:07:02,923
When choosing a beam step size
for fracture, one usually scales

121
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,562
the choice of beam an
the associated diameter accordingly

122
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,447
in practice, large beam step size
and associated beam, therefore

123
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,172
allow for faster writing.

124
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,322
Another important consideration
for the choice of beam current

125
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,587
and beam step size is
the EBL tool speed.

126
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,947
Also called bandwidth limit.

127
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:27,881
It determinates the minimal
exposure time per shot

128
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,713
that the equipment is
capable of controlling. 

129
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,933
This value is in the range
of several tens of MHz.

130
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:39,236
For grid sizes where
large overlap is desired

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,397
and where the beam step size is
smaller than the beam diameter

132
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:47,663
the dwell time per shot is
too short for the tool capability.

133
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:52,284
Imagine that we want to
write the pattern shown here.

134
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:58,480
Consisting of one hundred
squares of 50x50nm each.

135
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:03,346
We start by choosing
the parameters for the experiment.

136
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:09,329
A grid size of 5nm is a good
first approach to this design

137
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:13,123
as the minimum feature size is 50nm.

138
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:17,458
Smaller grids would be possible,
but would require reducing current

139
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,907
and consequently would
take longer writing time.

140
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:26,070
The next step is to choose
the current and beam diameter.

141
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,672
As each fraction of the grid is 5nm

142
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,768
the beam diameter should be
similar in size to have smooth

143
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,681
contours in our shapes.

144
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:42,275
Form our tool specification a 5.6nm
beam is generated by choosing

145
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,379
a 3nA current.

146
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:49,929
We know that our particular tool
has a bandwidth limit of 50MHz

147
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:54,474
this depends of the equipment,
and we are now trying to determine

148
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:57,641
the parameters as close
as possible to this limit

149
00:08:57,835 --> 00:09:01,172
to be able to write as
fast as machine can do.

150
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,519
This is not only because of the time

151
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,136
but also because of
the processing cost.

152
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,841
The dose speed depends of
the resist we are using.

153
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:14,397
For this, typically some dose tests
are done to confirm the proper value.

154
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,775
With these parameters we've
now calculate the time.

155
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,102
According to this formula.

156
00:09:20,304 --> 00:09:25,192
It takes 1.33x(10^(-4))s
for the electron beam

157
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,520
writing alone.

158
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:30,159
To this time we must add
about 30 minutes of pumping

159
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:34,046
loading, and unloading of the wafer,
and the time commuting from

160
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,397
one square to the other
without the writing.

161
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,901
Also, this may seem extremely fast

162
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:43,287
scale to the area of practical
designs and full wafer sizes

163
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,067
writing may easily reach hours.

164
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:50,602
If we now calculate the frequency
with the previous parameters

165
00:09:50,635 --> 00:09:54,773
we see that this writing experiment
is over the tool capability

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,463
as it is over 50MHz that
we have defined before.

167
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,195
The tool cannot write as fast
as we are asking to

168
00:10:03,289 --> 00:10:06,264
and it cannot control and
blank the beam fast enough

169
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:09,347
and we have to adjust
the writing parameters.

170
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:13,131
The best alternative 
we'll have is to adjust

171
00:10:13,225 --> 00:10:16,987
the beam current, and choose
a smaller beam.

172
00:10:18,123 --> 00:10:24,210
As you see, it now takes more time
than before, but now the frequency

173
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,197
is at the maximum speed of the tool.

174
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:30,956
Thus we can write with these
parameters our pattern.

175
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:36,997
If you now extrapolate these
writing patterns to bigger areas

176
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:39,622
which are more meaningful
for applications

177
00:10:40,403 --> 00:10:45,740
we can see again, our small square,
hundred squares of 50x50nm

178
00:10:45,869 --> 00:10:50,269
square each, takes about
2x(10^(-4))s

179
00:10:50,414 --> 00:10:54,864
so extremely fast, if you want to
write the same density pattern

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,700
over one centimeter square,
of the same density and pitch

181
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,189
we already have to account
for more than six hours 

182
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:08,367
EBM writing time, and if you
want to write a full wafer

183
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:12,983
of 100mm diameter with
the same pattern density

184
00:11:13,063 --> 00:11:15,351
we already have to take into account

185
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:18,487
writing time of more
than twelve days.

186
00:11:19,084 --> 00:11:21,509
When preparing the design
for writing and before

187
00:11:21,586 --> 00:11:25,374
considering local dose or design
changes, a few other options

188
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,356
are important to consider.

189
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:31,148
The first one concerns the field
placement, although one might

190
00:11:31,265 --> 00:11:34,665
intuitively position the fields
adjacent to each other on

191
00:11:34,753 --> 00:11:38,103
an orthogonal grid, this might
result in field boundaries 

192
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,314
within the pattern that will
induce field stitching errors

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,240
as seen in this image.

194
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:46,391
So, here two fields are stitched
together, but there are

195
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:51,257
not perfectly aligned, which is due
to error in the tool drifts

196
00:11:51,387 --> 00:11:53,274
and other effects.

197
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,870
If the features are smaller
than the field size

198
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:59,571
one may allow, so called,
floating fields in order

199
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:02,753
to encompass all the features
smaller than the field size

200
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:04,397
within single fields.

201
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,540
If the designs are
larger than the fields

202
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,713
writing the structure in multiple
passes may reduce the sharpness

203
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:15,372
of the field boundary, due to
the random nature of field stitching.

204
00:12:15,871 --> 00:12:19,071
As we mentioned, large patterns,
when considering advance design

205
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:22,331
preparation it is important to
mention that patterns

206
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:24,845
may be fractured using varying BSS.

207
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:28,919
This may, for one allow the writing
of large and small features with

208
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,155
different beams to
speed up the writing.

209
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:33,324
Alternatively, a large beam may

210
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,519
be used for the inner
part of the pattern

211
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:38,599
that will be written fast,
and a finer beam for

212
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,691
the outer part in the order to
guarantee low edge roughness

213
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,266
and overall critical
dimensions accuracy. 

214
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:47,433
This method is called "Bulk Sleeve".

215
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:48,671
Shown here.

216
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:54,446
To use different  beam diameter
for the center part and to the edge

217
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:55,857
of the structure.

218
00:12:56,506 --> 00:13:00,069
Without going into further details,
writing order of the trapezoid

219
00:13:00,187 --> 00:13:03,475
within fields and sub-fields may
play a large role on short-range

220
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,842
accuracy and periodicity. and
consequently will have

221
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,118
an impact on the writing time.

222
00:13:10,296 --> 00:13:13,734
So this concludes this introduction
part for the design preparation

223
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:17,040
and fraction of electron beam
lithography, and now we have

224
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:20,309
a closer look at how the electrons
interact with the resist

225
00:13:20,422 --> 00:13:23,722
to write nano features
on substrates.
