00:00:00,423 --> 00:00:04,523
Now that we have seen the principles
of UV exposure through masks,

2
00:00:04,753 --> 00:00:08,991
lets go to our clean room and
follow this process in practice.

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:13,425
First, the surface of the silicone
wafers must be cleaned

4
00:00:13,626 --> 00:00:18,326
and treated with HNDS.
This step removes residual water

5
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:22,432
from the surface and promotes the
adhesion of the photoresist.

6
00:00:22,652 --> 00:00:27,015
This is especially important for
small or high aspect ratio features.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,843
The wafer on the left side is
untreated with HNDS

8
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:34,040
and is rather hydrophilic.
The wafer on the right side

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,990
was treated with HNDS and
as expected, the water drips off

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,122
immediately without wetting.

11
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:46,135
After surface preparation, an
automatic coater tool is used to spin

12
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:51,075
the resist layer on the wafer.
The robotic arm first dispenses

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,847
the resist at
low spinning speed.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,835
Once the arm moves out the speed is
increased and we can see

15
00:00:58,017 --> 00:01:01,167
a periodic evolution of colors
on the wafer surface.

16
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:05,475
As the resist is thinned down,
a modulation of reflection

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,168
is obtained due to the
interferences formed

18
00:01:08,386 --> 00:01:11,611
between the resist
and the wafer surface.

19
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:16,427
The resist thickness is not
uniform across the wafer

20
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,895
and becomes thicker
towards the edges.

21
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,648
In order to avoid contamination
during contact mask exposure,

22
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:27,644
solvent is sprayed on the wafer edge
to remove the resist in this region.

23
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,674
This is called
edge bead removal.

24
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:36,772
Now that the wafers are ready
we can start the actual exposure

25
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:40,357
on the mask aligner.
Here you see that our mask is

26
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,096
already in place and we load
the wafer into the tool

27
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:47,124
by means of a 
vacuum chuck.

28
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,539
The wafer is now slowly brought
into contact with the mask.

29
00:01:56,204 --> 00:01:59,292
Once the programmed set
point pressure is reached,

30
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:04,489
the illumination block with
a UV lamp and optics moves forward.

31
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:10,252
Notice the short blue flash
of about 3 seconds.

32
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,697
This is how long it takes to
expose the resist layer.

33
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,560
We now develop the exposed resist
in a process similar

34
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:20,761
to what was shown
in the mask making process.

35
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,031
Although here it is
performed manually

36
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:29,064
you can also see how the patterned
photolitho text appears.

37
00:02:30,544 --> 00:02:32,832
After rinsing the
wafer in DI water

38
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:35,863
it is dried
and ready for inspection.

39
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:41,519
By optical microscopy we check the
quality of the process

40
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:44,142
across the entire
wafer surface.

41
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:47,345
To check high resolution features
of the exposed resist

42
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:52,022
such as sidewall profiles we use
a scanning electron microscope.
