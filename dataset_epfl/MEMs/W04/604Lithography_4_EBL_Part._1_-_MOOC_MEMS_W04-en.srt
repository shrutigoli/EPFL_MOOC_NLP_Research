1
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:09,383
After the introduction to the
general concepts of lithography,

2
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:13,376
and details on mask writing
and UV Lithography technics,

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,723
I'll now focus this lesson
on Electron Beem Lithography

4
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,433
EB Litho or short EBL.

5
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,329
It allows for better resolution
down to 5  nanometer level.

6
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,975
This is important for many
devices in nano-science

7
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:28,206
and nano-technology.

8
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:30,945
In his lecture we first
describe the equipment

9
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:34,191
and then detailed EB Litho
specific process steps.

10
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:38,250
This chapter shows details
on the EB Litho tool,

11
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,038
like the one you saw on
the cover slide of this lesson.

12
00:00:41,463 --> 00:00:44,838
I will first introduce the main
components that I require

13
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,058
for an EBL system,

14
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:48,655
starting from the different
vacuum levels

15
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,469
show how electrons are emitted
by the electron gun,

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,420
how then the electron
are then focused into the probe,

17
00:00:55,683 --> 00:00:59,296
by lenses and to mention
the imperfections called aberration.

18
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:02,875
Then I will describe how the electrons
are deflected and controlled

19
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,228
over the sample to write
into the resist,

20
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:08,048
and I will wrap this lesson up
with some example tools.

21
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:13,249
EB Lithography is motivated by
the possibility to overcome

22
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,910
the optical diffraction limit.

23
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:18,140
As we have seen, resolution
in optical projections systems

24
00:01:18,356 --> 00:01:20,581
it's limited to about
lambda over 2.

25
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:28,764
Of course industrial DUV Lithography
has developed many process tricks

26
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:31,853
to push the resolution
of optical lithography

27
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:34,178
down to deep sub hundred
nano-meter scale.

28
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:37,919
But these methods can be
extremely costly and complex

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,510
while they still require
an original high resolution mask.

30
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:45,449
Instead of photons, we are now
considering electrons

31
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:47,952
which are charged elementary
particles.

32
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,556
Electrons can also be described
as a wave

33
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:55,304
with a corresponding wavelength,
even by the De Broglie equation

34
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,107
that depends on their velocity.

35
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:02,943
We'll do an equivalent wavelength
of an electron,

36
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:07,736
is given by the blanks constant
over the momentum of the electron.

37
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,203
We'll have a look at some numbers.

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,878
At 1 KV, acceleration voltage,
the wavelength

39
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:20,549
of the electron is in the order
of 0.038 nano-meter.

40
00:02:20,838 --> 00:02:22,463
Much smaller than an angstrom.

41
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,261
At 10 KV, it gets even smaller
below point 1 angstrom,

42
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:33,558
and for 1 KV we have already 0.0038
nano-meter wavelengths.

43
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:37,675
Typical EB is performed
between 30 and 100 KV

44
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,366
The effective wavelength
of the electron is accelerated

45
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:46,169
and a EB Lithography tool
is in the order of a few picometers.

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,882
But unfortunately,

47
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,497
the resolution limit using electrons
in an EBL Lithography tool

48
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,982
is not given by it's waves properties,

49
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:57,459
but rather by other effects such as
beam focusing,

50
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:59,610
electron scattering, and charging.

51
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:03,286
It can reach down to sub 10
nanometer scale in good cases.

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,397
The main disadvantage of
EBL Lithography are the low throughput

53
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:10,251
because it is using a single
electron beam to write,

54
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,989
and therefore high fabrication costs.

55
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:18,970
Here on the right side you see
2 nice examples images.

56
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:23,633
Here's an SEM image
of 2 layers of HSQ,

57
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,808
which is a negative resist.

58
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:29,873
The scale bar here is 1 micro meter,
and these lines in the order of

59
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,719
a couple of hundred nanometer wide,

60
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,799
with the very in pitch
to check their resolution

61
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:37,781
and alignment capability.

62
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:41,968
This SEM image shows
a high resolution

63
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,826
and high aspect ratio.

64
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:48,642
HSQ resist pillars, which is 15nm
in diameter,

65
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:52,155
and 150nm in height

66
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,350
These white spots here are
the pillars seen from the top.

67
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:03,836
Whereas these are pillars that have
collapsed during the last process.

68
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,068
It shows their width,
a high aspect ratio of the pillar.

69
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:13,120
The key ability of an
EB Lithography system

70
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,453
is to focus a beam of electron
into a few nanometer range,

71
00:04:16,684 --> 00:04:18,896
and then to directly write
with the electrons

72
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,453
in the resist of a relative placement
of beam and substrate.

73
00:04:23,073 --> 00:04:25,948
EBL is therefore a direct write
serial technic

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,633
similar to laser writing that we
discussed earlier for the mask

75
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,729
making a UV Lithography.

76
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:35,081
The electrons are first extracted
from the gun,

77
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,939
and the accelerated towards
a series of electron lenses

78
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,592
that will focus and correct ratios
in order to obtain

79
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,709
the smallest and brightest
possible electron beam.

80
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,937
Additional features include
beam blankers,

81
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:50,557
and beam deflectors.

82
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:54,235
The resist coded wave
is placed on a stage,

83
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:57,890
who's position can be controlled
by optical interferometers.

84
00:04:58,543 --> 00:05:02,731
The user interacts with a column
indirectly via exposure software

85
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:06,182
that controls the hardware
so called pedal generator.

86
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:11,001
Samples are loaded and unloaded
unto a system via a vacuum lock

87
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,966
not shown on this slide.

88
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:16,940
EB Lithography requires
a high vacuum chamber

89
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:20,391
so that electrons can freely
travel from the gun to the wafer.

90
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,206
The EB column is built inside
the vacuum system,

91
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,487
like shown here.

92
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,746
Different vacuum levels are required

93
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,937
for the different parts
of the electron column.

94
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:32,668
High vacuum is required
at the electron gun

95
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:37,352
reaching to void source, contamination
by residual gas molecules.

96
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,826
Further down in the column,
the vacuum requirements

97
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,578
becomes less stringent.

98
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,451
Ionic pumps are required
for the guns and the optics.

99
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:50,253
At the sample levels turbo pumps
are typically sufficient.

100
00:05:51,698 --> 00:05:54,548
How can we have different
vacuum levels in one chamber?

101
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:58,099
The electro-optic section
of the EBL tool

102
00:05:58,346 --> 00:06:01,396
is almost entirely separated
from the sample stage.

103
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:05,696
Except for a small aperture
called Differential Pumping Aperture.

104
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:09,049
Which is large enough to let
the electrons down the column,

105
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,641
but small enough to maintain
differential presure.

106
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:18,434
Note that the high vacuum air
does not get sucked through holes

107
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:20,897
like the domestic vacuum cleaner,

108
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,896
because the path of air atoms
at low pressure

109
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,092
can be many meters, so that
they never bump into each other.

110
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,532
They just bounce around
the chamber

111
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:33,177
and rarely pass through
the small aperture.

112
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:36,636
This way it's possible to have
a pool vacuum

113
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:41,504
in the sample stage region,
say 5.10-7 mbar

114
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:44,661
but high vacuum 10-8 mbar.

115
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:49,100
Or better, in the gun
electron optics part of the column.

116
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:54,335
So lets now have a look at the
electron source, also called gun.

117
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,494
Different option exist when we meet

118
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,780
electron from the metal source
into vacuum.

119
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,544
One variation is to use
thermionic sources,

120
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,961
where the source is heated
to overcome the work function

121
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:07,762
to bring electrons into the vacuum.

122
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,908
Another way to use the so called
Field Emitters,

123
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:15,533
where high electric potential
is applied to the sharp tip.

124
00:07:16,332 --> 00:07:18,807
In EB Lithography, the electron source
must combine

125
00:07:19,015 --> 00:07:20,565
the two following properties:

126
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,145
First, ideally it is monochromatic
to reduce chromatic aberrations.

127
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:29,423
Second, it has a high brightness
and crown stability.

128
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:32,495
Field Emitter will fill these
requirements

129
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:34,521
much better than thermionic
sources.

130
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:38,408
So, lets see how a field emitter
electron gun looks like.

131
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,109
With the cutter, the tip is at the tip
of it's potential

132
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:46,400
with respect to the first anode,
which is the extractor.

133
00:07:47,094 --> 00:07:50,582
In order to create a high field
to extract the electrons from the tip.

134
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:54,310
Between the extractor and
the second anode,

135
00:07:54,698 --> 00:07:57,123
the electrons are further accelerated.

136
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:00,046
The main function of the
suppressor up here,

137
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:03,300
is to limit electron emission
to the end of the tip.

138
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:08,513
This helps to reduce the effect in
source size and improves resolution.

139
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:13,376
the potential of the suppressor
is negative relative to the tip.

140
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:19,128
Typically Schottky field emitter guns
are used which are thermal

141
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:20,835
field emitting sources.

142
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:25,777
In such CFEG, a single crystal tonsil
tip is coated with zirconium oxide

143
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,149
which has the unusual property of
increasing

144
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,744
the electrical connectivity
at high temperature.

145
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,769
Zirconium oxide allows lowering
the work function

146
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,688
compared to tonsil alone.

147
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,154
compared to cold field
emitting guns,

148
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:42,047
these guns are less bright
but deliver stable high currents

149
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,067
and a less demanding aberrations.

150
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:47,571
(INAUDIBLE) field emitter systems
is typically

151
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:50,589
a single crystal sharpened
tonsil bar.

152
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:53,073
This allows for (INAUDIBLE) meters

153
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:56,024
of a few tens on nanometer
for short (INAUDIBLE)

154
00:08:56,243 --> 00:08:59,981
all the way down to 5 nanometer
for cold field emitting guns.

155
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,071
Schottky field emitters are ideal
for UV Lithography

156
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:08,192
do to the excellent count stability
which is below 1% probe noise

157
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:11,458
versus up to 10% for cold
field emitting guns.

158
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,206
They have low current drift,

159
00:09:13,413 --> 00:09:16,838
below 1% versus over 5%
for cold field emitting guns.

160
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:21,263
Thermionic field emitters are
typically not used in UV Lithography

161
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:23,799
do to their large source diameter,

162
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,251
and actually spread unlimited
lifetime.

163
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:29,210
The electric field on the tip
of a Schottky Field Emitter

164
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:32,156
is applied to decrease the
material working function.

165
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:36,338
For this reason, such field emitters
are coated with low working function

166
00:09:36,552 --> 00:09:38,402
such as zirconium dioxide.

167
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:42,092
Even if Schottky Field Emitter
is a Thermionic emitter,

168
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:44,802
the brightness and the
current density are compared

169
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:48,115
to that of a cold field emitter.

170
00:09:49,116 --> 00:09:52,703
Here we can see 2 images
of a Schottky field emitting gun.

171
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:58,716
On the left, the zirconium oxide
reservoir is nicely seen below the tip.

172
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:05,258
In the central image, one can identify
the crystal planes

173
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,548
of the tonsil tip on the
Schottky emitter

174
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:11,517
And for cold field emitting guns,
her on the right side,

175
00:10:11,893 --> 00:10:14,055
the tip is sharpened to about 100nm.

176
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:17,144
The high electric fields the
electrons are thus extracted

177
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,517
directly from the tip.

178
00:10:20,404 --> 00:10:24,054
The electron gun choice has
a large impact on the beam diameter.

179
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,910
that is also called probe diameter

180
00:10:27,973 --> 00:10:30,048
as can be seen on the graphs
here on the right,

181
00:10:31,427 --> 00:10:34,865
different gun types are compared
where the probe current

182
00:10:35,614 --> 00:10:38,914
is displayed as a function
of the probe diameter

183
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:41,562
for two acceleration voltages,

184
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:45,277
30Kv here, and 1Kv down here.

185
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:51,820
In EBL, one typically employs currents
from a few 100 picloram range,

186
00:10:52,335 --> 00:10:55,485
to several 10's of 100's
of nano-amps.

187
00:10:56,598 --> 00:10:59,598
As seen in the graphs, these
current values

188
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,939
their electron beam diameter
undergoes large changes.

189
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:07,760
From a few nanometer to
several 10's of nanometers.

190
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,093
you can also see that these
current diameter relations

191
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,388
are not linear,

192
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:16,236
and they vary largely
from one gun type to the other.

193
00:11:17,853 --> 00:11:22,016
Therefore, a good metric
to compare gun types,

194
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:28,241
is therefore needed and introducing
the concept of brightness or better.

195
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,908
It is defined as how much
current is emitted

196
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,363
per unit solid angle,
per unit area of limiting surface.

197
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:39,732
Described in this drawing here.

198
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:44,222
This should be compared at
equivalent acceleration voltage

199
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:46,911
and takes into account
beam current diameter

200
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:49,527
and incident angle on the sample.

201
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:54,391
For example, thermionic emitter
may have very high beam current,

202
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:56,327
shown here.

203
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,600
But very low brightness
do to the large spot size.

204
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:05,366
It is additionally important
to be able to tune the electron beam

205
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:09,150
so that one can write large features
with the large beam

206
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,810
and then use low currents
to write finer features.

207
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:18,993
So now let's have a look
how we can control

208
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,726
and focus the electrons.

209
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:24,931
Typically like in optical systems,
it's focused by electric lenses.

210
00:12:25,654 --> 00:12:26,829
Like shown here.

211
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,076
We have here the lens,

212
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,651
and if you come with the light...

213
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:36,535
focus on the focus point here,
further down.

214
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,976
Electron trajectory, on the other hand
is controlled by electrostatic

215
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:46,947
or electromagnetic lenses
according to the force.

216
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,075
Shown here.

217
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,307
You can see that we can exert
force on a charge particle

218
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:54,328
either by an electric field
or by a magnetic field

219
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:56,585
and velocity of the particle.

220
00:12:57,534 --> 00:13:00,384
Electrostatic lenses are typically
used for beam blanker

221
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:01,614
or the gun region.

222
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:06,012
They have high operation speed,
but they have other large operations.

223
00:13:06,471 --> 00:13:09,371
Therefore, electromagnetic lenses
are used for beam shaping.

224
00:13:10,229 --> 00:13:13,766
A magnetic lenses forms from two
circle symmetric iron

225
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,905
or some other high premier
ability material pieces.

226
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,052
with a coper winding in between.

227
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:23,090
A divergence of the magnetic flux
along the set access

228
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:27,791
applies a force on the electrons
back towards the set access

229
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:29,952
resulting in focusing action.

230
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:35,414
The magnetic field causes a rotation
of the electrons and the image.

231
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,205
About the set access in a
crux fashion.

232
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,884
(INAUDIBLE) not affect performance}
of the lens,

233
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:46,289
it does impact the design alignment
operation of the system.

234
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:50,308
For instance, the deflection system
must be rotated physically

235
00:13:50,512 --> 00:13:52,824
with respect to the stage coordinates.

236
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,560
Also when aligning a column,
a wide placement

237
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:59,663
in the upper region of the column
will not correspond

238
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,834
to the same wide displacement
at the target.

239
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:07,070
And finally, changes in focus
or changes in the hide of the sample

240
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,692
can cause a slight rotation
in the deflection coordinates.

241
00:14:11,175 --> 00:14:13,213
This must be properly corrected

242
00:14:13,564 --> 00:14:15,989
or stitching and overly errors
will result.

243
00:14:18,288 --> 00:14:21,101
Like in optical microscopy,
a number of operations limit

244
00:14:21,314 --> 00:14:23,814
the ultimate resolution
of the electron probe.

245
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:27,456
There are 4 types of aberrations
listed here from A to D.

246
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,729
Spherical Aberrations are the result
of a homogeneous focusing property,

247
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:36,390
for electrons travelling
on or off the axis.

248
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:41,189
Chromatic Aberrations is the result
of varying  focus

249
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,460
for electrons of different energy.

250
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,074
Both of these aberrations
can be minimized

251
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,627
by reducing the conversions angle
of the system

252
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:52,575
so that electrons are confined
to the center of the lenses

253
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:55,919
at the cost of greatly reduced
beam current.

254
00:14:56,692 --> 00:14:59,442
Astigmatism occurs  when
the electrons sense

255
00:14:59,717 --> 00:15:04,617
a non consistent magnetic field
as they spill around the optical lens

256
00:15:04,936 --> 00:15:07,224
which arises from construction errors.

257
00:15:07,443 --> 00:15:10,493
The result is a non symmetrical
beam cross-section.

258
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:13,535
At low energies and with
convergence angles

259
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,346
altered diffraction may play
a significant role.

260
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:17,972
Shown here.

261
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,714
the understanding of aberrations
is essential to reach mininal

262
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:27,158
effective beam diameters that
enable high patterning resolutions.

263
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:30,571
You can see here on the graph
on the right side,

264
00:15:32,297 --> 00:15:34,547
all the aberrations mentioned
previously

265
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,125
must be taken to account at once,

266
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,512
Also in relation with the beam
convergence angle.

267
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:45,162
In practice, the effective
beam diameter

268
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:48,010
is indeed expressed by
the square root

269
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:51,441
of each contribution squared
and summed.

270
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,983
Whereas the virtual source size
limit does not depend on

271
00:15:56,229 --> 00:15:59,379
the beam convergence angle,
this line right here.

272
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:05,423
Chromatic and spherical aberrations
obviously increase

273
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:07,958
with greater convergence angle.

274
00:16:08,563 --> 00:16:12,138
This relation is inverted for
diffraction.

275
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,551
Reaching an optimal
work configuration requires

276
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,178
the optimization of all
contributions

277
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,391
rather than seeking the individual
minimization.

278
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,221
Notably end in relation
to the previous lights

279
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:30,314
each aberration in contribution
to the final beam diameter

280
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:32,626
are subject to additional
parameters

281
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:35,499
other than the beam
convergence angle

282
00:16:35,746 --> 00:16:38,796
and maybe optimized in part
independently by the instrument

283
00:16:39,034 --> 00:16:42,047
design or choice of
acceleration voltage.

284
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:46,205
The electron beam may be deflected
over a range

285
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:50,308
of typically from a few
10's of micrometers to millimeter.

286
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:53,720
Writing in large areas requires
that the stage is physically moved

287
00:16:53,941 --> 00:16:56,204
to reach a neighboring region
and ultimately

288
00:16:56,438 --> 00:16:58,525
to write the entire surface.

289
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,677
This writing region is called
a field,

290
00:17:02,319 --> 00:17:04,994
that is  itself divided
into subfields.

291
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,507
The main fields correspond to
the maximum beam deflection range.

292
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:12,665
If you choose a certain beam step size
the tool can only handle

293
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:14,982
a finite number of pixels.

294
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:18,390
If the steps size is too small
then the field size is limited

295
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,988
to the beam step size times
the maximum number of pixels.

296
00:17:23,974 --> 00:17:26,687
Deflecting an electron beam
across main fields

297
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:30,008
at a hundred of microns in size
is associated with very large

298
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:34,827
electric or magnetic coils in
correspondingly with settling times

299
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,668
do to the larger fields
that need to be applied,

300
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:40,923
which at the end will slow down
the writing process.

301
00:17:41,396 --> 00:17:45,396
In order to increase writing speed,
an additional subdivision of the

302
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,682
patterning (INAUDIBLE) subfields

303
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:50,018
is implemented into the system.

304
00:17:50,391 --> 00:17:53,016
These fields are approximately
two orders of magnitude smaller

305
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:57,453
and inside them the electron beam
is raster scan at very high speed

306
00:17:57,682 --> 00:17:59,132
by another set of coils.

307
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,932
These coils are much smaller
do to the small deflection

308
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,569
they need to exert and thus,

309
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:08,190
their settling time si much smaller
compared to the main field ones.

310
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,768
Beyond fields the sample
is mechanically moved

311
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:18,060
so high resolution stage is typically
allowed for resolutions below the NM.

312
00:18:18,404 --> 00:18:22,154
However, mechanical stage
drifts result in possible

313
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:25,832
mismatch at the field boundaries
known as field stitching.

314
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:29,817
As you will see, different methods
exist to manage field stitching

315
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:33,418
and within a single field different
writing strategies are possible.

316
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:35,720
Either raster scanning,
like shown here,

317
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,535
or vector scanning,
like shown here.

318
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:43,855
The raster scanning, one wants
to expose the green parts

319
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:48,325
when raster scans the electron beam
and blanks it on and off

320
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,058
when it passes over
the design area.

321
00:18:51,278 --> 00:18:54,141
The vector scan is that
the electron beam is

322
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:59,173
already steered to only expose
the area that has to be written.

323
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:06,702
Here we can see an animation
of a field stitching approach,

324
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:11,038
where the stage is mechanically moved
between two writing fields

325
00:19:11,302 --> 00:19:13,889
and where the alignment
is very critical.

326
00:19:22,764 --> 00:19:25,727
Another strategy involves
a fixed electron beam

327
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:28,197
and a continues stage movement.

328
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:31,092
This way, no field stitching
involved

329
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:35,958
resulting in continues patterns
but this method is much slower.

330
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:44,844
Electron beam lithography
tools for research

331
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,707
can be configured in 2 ways:

332
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,929
One is to convert a scanning
electron microscope SEM

333
00:19:50,136 --> 00:19:51,011
on the left side.

334
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,885
As a scanning electron microscope
already includes the main elements

335
00:19:57,126 --> 00:19:58,751
required to perform lithography,

336
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:02,859
the only component that needs to be
added is the pattern generator.

337
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:06,313
It consists of a beam blank cut
to switch on and off the beam,

338
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:09,473
as it scans the sample, as well
as a computer control.

339
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:14,186
That's low cost EBL systems
are typically using

340
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,073
acceleration voltages of 30Kv

341
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:21,809
and they do not benefit from
the advantages of a dedicated

342
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:25,334
EBL column in terms of speed
and stability.

343
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:32,344
So, dedicated EBL tools will operate
at a higher voltage up to 100Kv

344
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,806
and allow for high proof
and stability.

345
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,518
They have higher costs
of several millions of euros,

346
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:41,969
but they are essential and needed
for mask writing in UV masks

347
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,340
and nano science research.
