1
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:05,201
This lesson will now focus 

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,618
on the details of UV lithography

3
00:00:07,784 --> 00:00:08,934
which is the most spread

4
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:10,125
lithography technique

5
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:11,682
in microfabrication.

6
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,803
It uses UV light as exposure

7
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:15,601
which allows patterning devices

8
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:16,951
at the micrometer scale

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,332
and on large wafers

10
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:19,533
in a few seconds.

11
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,352
I will talk about the tool

12
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:22,678
that allows us to align

13
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:23,836
wafers to masks

14
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:25,839
and to control the exposure dose

15
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:26,924
of UV light.

16
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:27,865
Then I will show

17
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,188
the three different masks

18
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:31,141
based illumination systems

19
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:33,001
which are the contact, proximity

20
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:34,153
and projection.

21
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:35,318
Then I will recall

22
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:36,732
the limit of resolution

23
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:37,749
and what can be done

24
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,388
to enhance it.

25
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,383
I show some typical UV resists

26
00:00:41,566 --> 00:00:42,479
along with their

27
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,210
post processing capabilities

28
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:45,131
and will conclude

29
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,756
with some examples.

30
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,373
In the previous lesson

31
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,559
we have seen how to write

32
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:50,442
the Chrome mask

33
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,973
by directly use a writer.

34
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:53,446
We are now using such a mask

35
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,252
for the UV lithography.

36
00:00:55,424 --> 00:00:56,173
For this purpose

37
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,286
we rely on a so called mask aligner

38
00:00:58,439 --> 00:00:59,389
shown here,

39
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,468
which is a mechatronic equipment

40
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:02,425
that allows

41
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:03,791
the positioning of the wafer

42
00:01:03,971 --> 00:01:05,421
with respect to the mask.

43
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:07,765
By means of alignment marks

44
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:09,547
on both the mask and the wafer

45
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,068
one can use the microscope

46
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,916
and X, Y, Theta stages

47
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:13,810
to align

48
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:16,307
from multiple layer fabrication.

49
00:01:16,486 --> 00:01:18,323
This can be done in UV system

50
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:19,878
at a resolution of about

51
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:21,419
one micrometer.

52
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:25,803
Some tools also allow

53
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:27,116
for (INAUDIBLE) side alignment

54
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:27,973
which is important

55
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:29,804
for MEMS processing

56
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,137
when micromachining

57
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,534
of both side of the wafer

58
00:01:32,705 --> 00:01:35,293
is needed. The tool allows

59
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:36,467
furthermore controlling

60
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:37,828
the distance between the mask

61
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:39,425
and the wafer for either contact

62
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,329
or proximity printing.

63
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,176
It then allows for controlling

64
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:44,446
the exposure dose

65
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:46,018
and lamp intensity

66
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,143
which will ultimately

67
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,058
define the dose on the resist.

68
00:01:50,029 --> 00:01:51,128
It is needless to say

69
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:52,161
that such a quick one

70
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:53,677
is one of the most used

71
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:55,619
in any clean room around the world.

72
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:56,622
The picture here

73
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,012
shows the UV mask aligner

74
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,859
in our clean room in the yellow light

75
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,598
for the lithography section.

76
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,281
Two modes of exposure exist

77
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,538
for the one to one mask

78
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,109
UV lithography,

79
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:09,296
contact and proximity.

80
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,635
The only difference

81
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,135
between the two modes

82
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:12,952
in fact is that

83
00:02:13,132 --> 00:02:14,220
there's either no gap

84
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:15,455
between the mask

85
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:16,625
and the resist

86
00:02:16,807 --> 00:02:18,808
or a well-controlled gap

87
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:20,828
drawn here

88
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,055
between the mask

89
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,528
and the resist.

90
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,065
This gap is in the order

91
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:27,167
of a couple of micrometers.

92
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:29,699
Contact exposure

93
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,762
yields the best resolution

94
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,633
but it may suffer from issues

95
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,557
such as mask contamination

96
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,292
mask sticking and substrate damage.

97
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,726
The minimum feature size

98
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,044
called MFS

99
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:43,550
that one can estimate

100
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,228
for contact exposure

101
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,865
can be express roughly

102
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,266
by the expression shown here

103
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,525
which is the

104
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:50,846
which is thickness

105
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,916
d, the wavelength of the light

106
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,877
being used in the square root

107
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,449
of the product of the two.

108
00:02:57,903 --> 00:02:59,565
To avoid these problems

109
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:02,431
mentioned here in contact mode

110
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:05,793
one can lift the mask a little bit

111
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,188
from the wafer

112
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:08,910
and then perform the exposure

113
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:11,034
in this so-called proximity mode.

114
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,912
In this case

115
00:03:12,085 --> 00:03:13,472
we lose resolution

116
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:15,769
and the minimum feature size

117
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:17,264
can be express now

118
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:20,535
by this equation as before

119
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,006
wherever you have to add the gap

120
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,306
that has been introduced

121
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,977
between the resist and the mask.

122
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:28,366
Again, d is the thickness

123
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:29,292
of the resist

124
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,498
the gap and the wavelength

125
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:31,643
of the light source.

126
00:03:32,616 --> 00:03:34,353
If one requires high resolution

127
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:35,785
in the order of one micrometer

128
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,585
then one choose is the contact mode.

129
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,585
If one is happy with the

130
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:41,784
5 or 10 micrometer resolution

131
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:43,440
one can relax the conditions

132
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,214
and work in the proximity mode

133
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:47,035
which preserves the masks

134
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,224
and resist the better.

135
00:03:50,894 --> 00:03:51,869
One important part

136
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,036
in the UV exposure tool

137
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,247
is the light source.

138
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:55,804
In fact it is the source

139
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,199
that amidst the energy

140
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,580
of the radiation

141
00:03:58,749 --> 00:04:00,223
to expose the resists.

142
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,360
We can see here a table

143
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,801
that is an overview

144
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,167
of different light sources

145
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:07,268
and what physically

146
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,119
is actually behind the light emission

147
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:10,835
starting from the macro lamp

148
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,064
with the different lines

149
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:14,186
and wavelengths.

150
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,630
You'll also see the sources

151
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:19,671
for the deep UV, Extreme UV

152
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,140
and X-ray lithography.

153
00:04:22,309 --> 00:04:23,396
Deep UVs are within

154
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,645
industries standard for CIMUS

155
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,806
whereas EUV and X-ray

156
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,294
are future options.

157
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:31,291
Here you can see the light

158
00:04:31,469 --> 00:04:33,107
coming out from Mercury Arc lamp

159
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,790
and then separating the radiation

160
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,589
into its spectral distribution,

161
00:04:36,763 --> 00:04:38,851
we can see the different colors

162
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:40,596
with the, I, H

163
00:04:40,771 --> 00:04:42,396
and G line respectively.

164
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,317
For most microfabrication

165
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,672
one uses the well-known

166
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,824
I line at 365 nanometer.

167
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,068
Another important class

168
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:52,358
of UV lithography

169
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,363
is using projection of a mask

170
00:04:54,532 --> 00:04:56,870
via an optical magnification system,

171
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,172
4 or 5x times on to the resist.

172
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:01,647
This is the main technique

173
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:02,817
for deep UV

174
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,861
and high end semi-conductor systems

175
00:05:05,027 --> 00:05:06,052
and reaching clearly

176
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:08,166
at sub 20-nanometer resolution.

177
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,946
So here, the picture of the mask

178
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:14,053
is projected by an optical system

179
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:15,607
onto the resist.

180
00:05:15,776 --> 00:05:17,563
There's no contact at all

181
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:18,833
when there's no risk

182
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,432
of mask iteration.

183
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,245
They are very expensive in fact.

184
00:05:22,436 --> 00:05:23,349
The reduction effect

185
00:05:23,521 --> 00:05:24,272
not only allows

186
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:25,673
for excellent resolution

187
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,556
but also reduces any error

188
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,621
in the mask by the same factor.

189
00:05:31,218 --> 00:05:32,456
On the down side

190
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,802
one cannot expose the entire wafer

191
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:37,964
one to one as shown before

192
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,165
but has two step

193
00:05:39,336 --> 00:05:40,636
and repeat the procedure

194
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,547
a couple of times per wafer.

195
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,575
The resolution estimate

196
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,989
for the minimal feature size

197
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,181
is shown here.

198
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,007
At this point of state of the art

199
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,009
the resolution is not anymore given

200
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:54,301
by the pure optical defection limit

201
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:55,753
as there are additional

202
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,815
technological parameters

203
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:01,635
named K1 or later we see also K2

204
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:04,001
that help enhancing the resolution.

205
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,038
These key factors are linked

206
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:09,607
to the non-linear resist chemistry

207
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:11,340
from design optimization

208
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,816
phase shift mask

209
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:15,328
double exposure, etc., etc.

210
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:17,924
An optical lithography

211
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,554
it is not only the resolution

212
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:20,586
that is important

213
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,020
but also the depth of focus, DOF,

214
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:26,530
shown here. Why is that?

215
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,899
It is because the resist

216
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:29,793
has a non-zero thickness

217
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:31,704
and to expose a sharp image

218
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:32,959
at high resolution

219
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,948
for the entire resist thickness

220
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,203
we need to have a large DOF.

221
00:06:38,185 --> 00:06:40,147
Resolution and DOF

222
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,378
are closely linked together

223
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:43,732
by the wavelength

224
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:45,111
numerical aperture,

225
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,165
and then the technological parameters

226
00:06:47,346 --> 00:06:48,959
K1 and K2.

227
00:06:49,125 --> 00:06:50,199
So we see for example

228
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,855
that if we aim to decrease R

229
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,749
to get higher resolution

230
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,457
we need to decrease

231
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:58,034
the wavelength, lambda

232
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:00,849
and increase numerical aperture

233
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,747
in our optical stepper system

234
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,990
but then DOF decreases too

235
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,337
which is not good.

236
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,554
The only way to optimize R

237
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:13,780
and DOF simultaneously

238
00:07:13,944 --> 00:07:15,557
is to work on this parameters

239
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:17,465
K1 and K2.

240
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,464
I will show a couple of examples.

241
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:21,720
Normal masks

242
00:07:21,893 --> 00:07:24,006
are binary Glass and Chrome

243
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,310
to create transparent

244
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,983
and opaque portions.

245
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:27,883
We have seen

246
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:30,221
the mutilation transfer function

247
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:32,214
of such assistance just before.

248
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,774
Phase shift masks are shown here,

249
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,722
there are mask that transmit light

250
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:37,985
with the phase shift

251
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,143
at some strategic positions

252
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,107
in the mask.

253
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,392
To this end,

254
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:45,176
we either remove like shown here

255
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:47,574
or at some dielectric materials

256
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,818
such as quartz, SiO2 or similar.

257
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:53,260
By creating 180 degree phase shift

258
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,718
between two adjacent

259
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,342
transparent parts,

260
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,266
we create a destructive interference

261
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,050
in the E-field of the radiation

262
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,541
and thus improve the intensity curve

263
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:06,715
shown here.

264
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,380
This allows for creating

265
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,416
a sharper image in the resist

266
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,444
and ultimately

267
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,408
to reach higher resolution.

268
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:18,731
This image shows the end length

269
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:21,136
between exposure optics

270
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:23,004
and the wafer with the photoresist.

271
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,008
It shows the numerical aperture, NA

272
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:28,688
and how it is defined

273
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:30,485
as the sign alpha

274
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,094
times the index of refraction

275
00:08:33,258 --> 00:08:34,533
of the medium

276
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,370
and the related resolution

277
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:37,911
and DOF values.

278
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:40,363
Immersion lithography

279
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:41,825
is a photo lithography resolution

280
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,399
enhancement technique

281
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,416
for manufacturing integrated circuit

282
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,702
ICs, that replaces the usual air gap

283
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,340
between the final length

284
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,420
and the wafer surface

285
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,703
with the liquid medium

286
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:54,247
that has a refractive index

287
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,505
greater than one.

288
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,616
The resolution is increased

289
00:08:57,795 --> 00:08:58,457
by a factor

290
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:00,240
equal to the refractive index

291
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,889
of the liquid.

292
00:09:02,478 --> 00:09:04,190
Current immersion lithography tools

293
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,226
used highly purified water

294
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:08,483
or oil for this liquid,

295
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:09,808
achieving feature sizes

296
00:09:09,987 --> 00:09:10,911
needed in current

297
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:12,748
semiconductor manufacturing.

298
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:13,861
In fact, we can see

299
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:16,842
by changing the refractive index

300
00:09:17,017 --> 00:09:18,992
one gets another

301
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,097
equivalent factor here

302
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,535
in the resolution and DOF equation

303
00:09:24,717 --> 00:09:25,792
which is an equivalent

304
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,351
to shift in the wavelength

305
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:28,333
as a function

306
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:30,499
of the index of refraction.
