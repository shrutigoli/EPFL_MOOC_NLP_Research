1
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:07,393
As there are several possibilities
to perform lithography,

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:10,068
I will start by providing
some definitions

3
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:13,918
and by explaining some general
concepts that are recurring for all 

4
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:16,243
the lithography variations.

5
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:20,493
Then I will dive into details how
one fabricates the lithography masks

6
00:00:20,932 --> 00:00:23,020
using a direct write laser tool.

7
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,253
This will be followed by
a closer look

8
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:28,453
into <i>UV</i> lithography and
electron beam lithography

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,903
which are to date the 2 main
categories of lithography.

10
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,295
I will then conclude by presenting

11
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:37,020
new emerging and alternative
lithographies

12
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,444
which are not yet part of
the main stream applications,

13
00:00:40,644 --> 00:00:43,981
but that offer interesting
opportunities for niche applications.

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,858
Lithography is the fundamental process
of transferring geometric shape

15
00:00:49,058 --> 00:00:52,620
from a design to a thin layer of
radiation sensitive material

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,994
called resist.

17
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,707
Which is covering the surface
of a wafer substrate.

18
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,970
These shapes or patterns define
the various regions

19
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,183
in an integrated circuit, such as
the implantation regions,

20
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:06,383
the contact windows, the metallic
wiring etc.

21
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:10,268
The resist patterns made
by lithography are not permanent

22
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:13,955
but only temporary replicas of
circuit or MEMs features.

23
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,616
To produce the final features
in the material of interest,

24
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:20,548
these resist patterns must be
transferred once more

25
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,123
into the underlying layers.

26
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,850
For instance by an etching process
which selectively removes

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,262
unmasked portions of a layer.

28
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:31,718
The pattern transfer techniques
are described in all details

29
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:33,506
in the lesson on wet
and dry etching.

30
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,499
The lithography exposure step itself
can be done by various sources

31
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:42,436
of electromagnetic radiation, either
by using photons or electrons.

32
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:45,020
All lithography processes
must be performed

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,658
in an ultra thin environment

34
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:49,709
to avoid that any dust particle
in the air

35
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,384
can settle on the wafers
or lithography masks

36
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,784
and can cause defects in the device.

37
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,739
Lithography is also carried out
in yellow light.

38
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,626
Indeed, the photo resist is sensitive
to light with shorter wavelength.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,360
UV light is therefore filtered out
from lithography areas in a clean room.

40
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,110
More on clean room specific features
are given in the corresponding lesson.

41
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:16,391
This slide provides an overview
of possible parts from a design file

42
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:20,328
or a CAD file, on a computer to
define  a micro or nano structure

43
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,416
or circuit on a wafer.

44
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:27,772
Here is the start of the data on
the CAD file, on a computer.

45
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,872
And at the end, we want to have
the micro or nano structures

46
00:02:31,072 --> 00:02:32,772
on a substrate.

47
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:34,938
From the CAD file,

48
00:02:35,138 --> 00:02:38,825
we can steer by computer control,
the write head of a beam writer

49
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:43,064
that uses either focus laser
or electrons.

50
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:47,563
This is the first conversion from
a virtual computer design feature

51
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:49,401
into a physical reality.

52
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:52,679
In the majority of the cases

53
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,366
the beam writer is used to fabricate
masks for lithography.

54
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:59,566
This is because the writing
can take a lot of time.

55
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:03,763
Only in cases of R&D only few
devices are needed.

56
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:07,413
One considers the direct writing
of the final structure.

57
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:11,558
Depending on the radiation source,
one speaks about

58
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:15,249
UV, Deep UV, Extreme UV,

59
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,049
X-ray, electron beam projection,
or ion beam projection masks.

60
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:22,412
All with their own specifics.

61
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,428
In each case, the radiation
impinges locally

62
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:29,003
onto a resist coated substrate

63
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:32,090
and modifies the resist which
can then be developed.

64
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:35,635
The resist subsequently
serves as mask

65
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:38,148
for pattern transfer by etching

66
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:41,348
to complete the micro or nano
fabrication step.

67
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:44,118
So once again to summarize,

68
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,905
the processes involved in
lithography firstly include

69
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:48,868
the generation of a radiation

70
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,968
that needs to be tuned
and precisely shaped

71
00:03:52,168 --> 00:03:55,168
to impinge on the sensitive
resist where needed.

72
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,368
Second, it involves a chemical
reaction between

73
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:02,105
the resist radiation, and then
the resist and the developer.

74
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:06,713
Last but not least, it requires a
very precise mechanical tool

75
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,451
for the positioning of the mask
or the beam

76
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:11,538
on the resist coated substrate.

77
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,426
In particular for the patterning of
alignment and multi layer features.

78
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:20,180
Each lithography follows a well
defined series of process steps,

79
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,455
called process flow.

80
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:24,356
It may vary according
to the lithography used

81
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,206
and the materials involved.

82
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,106
But a typical generic example
is shown here

83
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:31,493
where we go step by step
through it.

84
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:35,090
First the substrate, it can be
a silicon wafer or glass plate,

85
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,136
is cleaned and prepared.

86
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:40,974
And eventually coated with a thin film
of material that needs to be patterned.

87
00:04:42,303 --> 00:04:43,678
Second,

88
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:47,279
the photo resist is being coated
on the substrate

89
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:50,791
to form a layer of it with
very controlled thickness

90
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:53,966
in the order of a micrometer,
but this can vary a lot.

91
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,145
And most importantly, with a very
uniformed thickness

92
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:59,395
over the entire substrate surface.

93
00:04:59,975 --> 00:05:02,925
Some pre-baking is done to remove
excess solvent

94
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,737
and to dry the resist.

95
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:09,019
Then comes the essential step, which
is the resist exposure.

96
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:12,804
This step can be done either
by photons or electrons.

97
00:05:13,004 --> 00:05:14,479
In this example shown here,

98
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:19,417
I show the use of a UV light source
and expose the resist to a photomask

99
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:22,874
that contains transparent here,

100
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:24,749
and opaque regions.

101
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,130
Only under the transparent portions
of the mask,

102
00:05:29,656 --> 00:05:31,593
will we expose the resist.

103
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:36,119
The other method would be using
electrons that can be scanned

104
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,469
over the surface, and thereby
writing the pattern,

105
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:40,607
and will be shown in details later.

106
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,873
In both cases, the goal is to
chemically

107
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:47,485
modify the resist under
the radiation

108
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:52,285
so that it becomes either polymerized
by creating new chemical bonds,

109
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:55,286
or by breaking existing chemical
bonds.

110
00:05:56,096 --> 00:05:59,271
The choice to use either optical
UV lithography or electron beam

111
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,246
is driven by the quest for
resolution and throughput.

112
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:06,009
The step after the exposure is
resist development,

113
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:08,347
shown here, which is a
chemical bath

114
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:11,884
that dissolves the part of the resist
that has not been polymerized

115
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:15,084
or whose bonds have been weakened
by the exposure.

116
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,395
Then the resist pattern is transferred
into the layer of interest

117
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:21,357
by etching or by lift-off.

118
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:24,631
These steps will be explained
elsewhere in this course.

119
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:28,706
At the end, the resist is
not used anymore

120
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:31,676
and can be removed by a
so-called stripping process

121
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,839
in solvent and cleaning acids.

122
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,039
And the target device pattern
is now completed.

123
00:06:39,552 --> 00:06:42,664
Here explains a few details on
the resist coating steps.

124
00:06:42,864 --> 00:06:46,027
First, one needs to ensure that
the surface is clean

125
00:06:46,227 --> 00:06:49,227
and free of any contamination
particles such as dust

126
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,635
to allow a uniformed
film formation.

127
00:06:52,218 --> 00:06:55,756
Besides that, it is very important
to tune the surface properties

128
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:58,831
of the substrate for a good
resist adhesion.

129
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:02,093
This is typically done using
HMDS coating

130
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:04,368
either in the liquid or gas phase.

131
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,943
This ensures that the photo resist

132
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,805
also in very thin layers,
adheres well

133
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,793
and uniformly on the surface.

134
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:16,040
For the resist coating, the wafer is
held on a vacuum spindle

135
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,865
and a well defined amount
of liquid resist

136
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:22,178
is applied to the wafer center
like shown here.

137
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:27,917
The wafer is then accelerated up to
a constant rotational speed

138
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:31,254
which is then maintained
for around 30 seconds.

139
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:35,482
The thickness of the resulting resist
film is given by this formula

140
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:37,263
shown here

141
00:07:37,463 --> 00:07:40,463
which depends on the polymer
concentration and viscosity

142
00:07:40,663 --> 00:07:42,438
as well as on the spin speed.

143
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,730
Spin speed is quite fast.

144
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,604
Generally between 1,000 and
up to 10,000 RPM

145
00:07:48,905 --> 00:07:52,380
to give uniform films from as thin
as sub 100 nanometer

146
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:56,118
to several micrometer, depending
on the lithography application.

147
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:01,270
The curve here shows the film
thickness as a function of spin speed

148
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,207
for a typical electron beam resist
called ZEP.

149
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:07,145
Such curves are done for
each resist product

150
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,157
and are available on the product
information speed.

151
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:14,382
Besides spin coating, there are also
other resist coating techniques.

152
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:18,507
For instance, <i>spray coating</i>
allows using non planar substrates.

153
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,903
Another technique is <i>Casting</i>,

154
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:24,278
that uses a mechanical doctor
blade to uniformly spread

155
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,178
a very viscous resist.

156
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,280
Finally, a technique called
<i>Lamination</i>

157
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,480
transfers an already formed
dry resist film

158
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,355
directly onto the substrate.

159
00:08:34,738 --> 00:08:38,150
The 2 latter examples are of great
interest for very think

160
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,875
photo resist layers.

161
00:08:41,134 --> 00:08:43,521
There are several ways
to expose resist.

162
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:47,045
In every case, it is a sort
of energetic radiation

163
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,445
that alters the resist chemistry
as explained before.

164
00:08:51,273 --> 00:08:54,810
The first and mostly applied way
is to use photons.

165
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:59,115
Indeed, the majority of exposure tool
for integrated circuit components

166
00:08:59,302 --> 00:09:03,090
and MEMs, are optical systems
using ultraviolet light.

167
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:05,717
Optical lithography uses masks

168
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:09,142
to create the pattern, either
in contact for 1 micrometer scale

169
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:12,917
typically for MEMs, or by projecting
systems for Deep UV,

170
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,617
typically for CMOS.

171
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:17,817
Optical exposure is limited
by diffraction.

172
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:21,392
However, state of the art Deep UV
exposure tools

173
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:25,704
are capable of high resolution down
to 10 nanometer scale

174
00:09:25,904 --> 00:09:27,617
thanks to the Deep UV wavelengths,

175
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,817
new resist chemistry, and
resolution enhancement.

176
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:34,898
The advantage of optical lithography
is that the entire wafer or

177
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:37,810
part of it can be exposed at once

178
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,060
which allows for
high throughput.

179
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:44,085
Electron lithography is primarily
used to produce the photo masks

180
00:09:44,285 --> 00:09:47,022
that are then used in UV and
Deep UV later.

181
00:09:47,222 --> 00:09:50,310
But more and more direct writing
using modern EBL systems

182
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,972
is now possible with
reasonable throughput.

183
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:56,297
Here the electron beam is focused
on the resist

184
00:09:56,497 --> 00:09:59,610
and then raster or vector
scanned to write the pattern.

185
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:03,085
The resolution limit of EBL is given
by the back scattering

186
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:07,871
of electrons that expose photo resist
area near the writing zone.

187
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,590
More details on this will be provided
in the dedicated lesson.

188
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:17,867
X-ray lithography uses a highly
energetic beam to expose the resist.

189
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,067
It has in principle, extremely high
resolution

190
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:25,580
as diffraction is much smaller than
for Deep UV and UV photons.

191
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,255
But this technique requires a very
special and complicated mask

192
00:10:31,455 --> 00:10:33,555
that is opaque to the x-rays.

193
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:38,058
Therefore it is not used foe integrated
circuit or MEMs fabrication

194
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,020
but is used for specific niche
applications.

195
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:45,109
One of them is the exposure of
very think PMMA resist

196
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:47,259
in the so called NIKA process.

197
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:50,935
A further possibility is to use Ions

198
00:10:51,135 --> 00:10:53,735
which are like electrons,
charged particles

199
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:59,146
but they are also much heavier and
have therefore less back scattering

200
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:03,360
in the resist and the substrate
which increases the resolution.

201
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:07,129
Ion beam lithography systems
are constantly developed further

202
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,029
but it is not clear whether they will
be used for mainstream lithography.

203
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:13,754
So they should be considered
as niche technique.

204
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:18,979
Now let's talk about resist, which
is besides the exposure tool,

205
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,166
the other very important ingredient
of a successful lithography

206
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:23,804
at micro or nano scale.

207
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,442
The photo resist is a radiation
sensitive compound.

208
00:11:27,984 --> 00:11:31,434
Photo resist can be classified
as positive and negative

209
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:34,756
depending on how they respond
to radiation.

210
00:11:34,956 --> 00:11:38,993
For positive resist, the exposed
regions become more soluble,

211
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:42,193
and thus more easily removed
in the development step.

212
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:46,703
The net result is that the patterns
formed in the positive resist

213
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,353
are the same as those
on the mask.

214
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,779
For negative resist,

215
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,022
the exposed regions become
less soluble

216
00:11:56,467 --> 00:12:00,229
and the patterns formed in the
negative resist are the reverse

217
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:01,941
of the mask pattern.

218
00:12:02,963 --> 00:12:06,813
The similar classification can be
done for electron beam sensitive resist.

219
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,764
Thereby the exposure is not done
via a masks,

220
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,526
but by direct writing.

221
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,501
Depending on the writing area,

222
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:17,426
it is beneficial to choose either
positive or negative EBL resist.

223
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:22,514
Positive photo resist consist
of 3 components.

224
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,690
A base resin,

225
00:12:26,523 --> 00:12:30,235
a photo sensitive compound,
and then organic solvent.

226
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:34,041
Before the exposure, the photo
sensitive compound is insoluble

227
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,691
in the developer solution.

228
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:40,591
After exposure, the photo sensitive
compound absorbs radiation

229
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,566
in the exposed pattern areas,

230
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:45,116
changes its chemical structure and
become soluble

231
00:12:45,316 --> 00:12:46,966
in the developer solution.

232
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,166
Upon development, the exposed
areas are removed.

233
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,630
Negative tone photo
resist are polymers

234
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,542
combined with a photo
sensitive compound.

235
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,526
After exposure, the photo sensitive
compound absorbs the optical

236
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,901
or electron energy and converts
it into chemical energy

237
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:06,063
to initiate a chain reaction.

238
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:09,812
This reaction causes cross
linking of the polymer molecules.

239
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,478
The cross link polymer has a higher
molecular weight

240
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:16,440
and becomes insoluble in
the developer solution.

241
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,235
Upon development, the unexposed
areas are removed.

242
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:24,873
One major drawback of negative
tone resist is that

243
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:28,823
in the development process, the
entire resist mass swells

244
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:31,235
by absorbing developed solvent

245
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:35,482
which may limit the attainable resolution
of negative resist.

246
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:39,790
The resolution of a lithography
process depends on one hand,

247
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,540
the exposure tool, and on the other
hand, several key parameters

248
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,215
of the photo resist.

249
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:47,403
One of them is the resist sensitivity

250
00:13:47,603 --> 00:13:49,915
and corresponding required dose.

251
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,813
Because the radiation is also
absorbed in the resist medium,

252
00:13:56,104 --> 00:13:58,004
there's a minimum amount
of radiation,

253
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:01,941
those required to expose the resist
from the top to the bottom

254
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,704
so that it can be cleared in the
development step.

255
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:08,430
The required dose is called
<i>Dose To Clear</i>.

256
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,269
Or <i>Dose to fully cross link</i>
in the case of negative resist.

257
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:16,741
The dose can be calculated by
knowing the lands intensity distribution

258
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,953
in watt per centimeter square

259
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:20,978
and exposure time in seconds.

260
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,485
So the dose is equal to the intensity
times the time.

261
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:29,661
The lithography resolution is the
function of several parameters.

262
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:31,923
Besides the exposure tool
performance,

263
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:35,123
it largely depends on the photo
resist properties.

264
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:38,607
2 important features are the
intrinsic sensitivity,

265
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,807
and the resist contrast.
We will briefly discuss both.

266
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,494
The intrinsic sensitivity <i>phi</i>

267
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:47,119
of a photo resist, is the incident
energy

268
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,494
necessary to produce the photo
chemical reactions required

269
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:52,131
for defining patterns.

270
00:14:52,396 --> 00:14:53,946
For single component resist,

271
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:56,158
It is given by the quantum yield,

272
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:58,933
which is the number of photon
induced events

273
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,546
over the number of photons
absorbed.

274
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:06,071
The intrinsic sensitivity of 2
typical photo resist PMMA

275
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:08,383
and DQN are shown here.

276
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,403
We can see that PMMA is ten fold

277
00:15:12,603 --> 00:15:15,103
less sensitive than DQN
for instance.

278
00:15:16,553 --> 00:15:19,328
The intrinsic sensitivity can be
determined experimentally by

279
00:15:19,528 --> 00:15:22,191
a systematic series of
exposure tests

280
00:15:22,391 --> 00:15:25,953
with subsequent structural, and
microscopic analysis of the resist.

281
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,530
Details on how this is done

282
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,730
can be found in the text books
or resist data sheet.

283
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:36,789
The resist that one plans to use
must be insensitive to the ambient

284
00:15:37,038 --> 00:15:39,514
radiation, that means the yellow light
in a clean room

285
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:43,114
and must be sufficiently sensitive
to the range of radiation energy

286
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,701
provided by the exposure tool.

287
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,953
In order to absorb the maximum of
energy in a minimum of time.

288
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,713
The resist should not be
too sensitive either

289
00:15:52,913 --> 00:15:57,301
to avoid too short exposure times for
a more comfortable process window.

290
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:02,758
The performance of any photo resist
can be characterized by it's contrast curve.

291
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,679
It is an intrinsic resist parameter

292
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:09,388
that defines the minimum dose limit
that is required

293
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:12,188
to start a reaction, and the upper
dose limit

294
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,438
at which the reaction is completed.

295
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:20,184
Photo resist contrast is important
for both resolution and profiling.

296
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:23,883
The example here is for positive
photo resist

297
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,570
but the same holds for negative resist.

298
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:30,493
The contrast curve
of a photo resist,

299
00:16:30,693 --> 00:16:34,943
plots the remaining resist thickness
after developing

300
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:37,930
in relation to the thickness
before the development.

301
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,768
D prime over D zero.

302
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:43,405
As a function of the logarithmically
plotted exposure dose.

303
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,222
The transfer of information from
a given contrast curve

304
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,759
to an individual lithographic
process requires

305
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:52,109
information of all process parameters

306
00:16:52,484 --> 00:16:54,271
which impact on the developing rate

307
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,896
such as the resist thickness,
soft Bake, rehydration,

308
00:16:58,096 --> 00:17:00,571
their temperature,
and humidity, etc.

309
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,902
The contrast curve of an ideal
positive resist,

310
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:07,340
is a step function where the
contrast is infinite.

311
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:10,915
Realistic contrast curves show a
D-prime of a D-zero

312
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,927
already smaller than 1 for
an exposure dos of 0,

313
00:17:14,521 --> 00:17:16,046
which is the dark erosion,

314
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:20,096
and the non infinitesimal
logarithmic detail

315
00:17:20,296 --> 00:17:23,558
in the D-prime over D-zero, bigger
than zero

316
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,308
over a non zero range of the dose
to what D-c

317
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,383
which is the dose to clear.

318
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:33,697
The slope of this decay
defines the contrast.

319
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,716
High contrast is beneficial for
the resist profile.

320
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:41,166
On the one hand, it is easy
to achieve radical worlds

321
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:44,591
while on the other hand it can be
tricky to find the correct dose

322
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:48,703
for high contrast resist as they are
easily over exposed or saturated.

323
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:53,302
Low contrast may be good for
example grey scale lithography.

324
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,858
So this shows the slope for
a low contrast

325
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:00,058
photo resist versus the one
for high...

326
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:02,186
contrast photo resist.

327
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:06,044
The optical transfer function(OTF)

328
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,207
also called modulation transfer
function(MTF),

329
00:18:09,407 --> 00:18:13,319
is the transfer function of an optical
exposure system onto a resist.

330
00:18:14,407 --> 00:18:16,295
The function specifies
the translation

331
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:19,732
and contrast reduction of a
periodic sign wave pattern

332
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,945
after passing through
the lense system

333
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:25,145
as a function of its periodicity
and orientation.

334
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:28,863
Formally, the optical transfer
function is defined as

335
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:31,901
the fourier transform of the
point spread function

336
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:34,276
or impulse response of the optics.

337
00:18:34,476 --> 00:18:36,413
That means that image
of a point source.

338
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:40,825
While figures of merit such as
contrast, sensitivity, and resolution

339
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:43,600
give an intuitive indication of
performance,

340
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,900
the optical transfer function
provides a comprehensive

341
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,912
and well defined characterization
of optical systems.

342
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,875
When using a lithography mask, with
line with P and the pitch P

343
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:57,175
the light being passing the mask,

344
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:58,839
and reaching

345
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:03,179
the wafer at a certain modulation
due to diffraction.

346
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:07,027
This modulation can be described by
the MT.effect expression which is

347
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,614
Maximum intensity minus
the minimum intensity

348
00:19:10,814 --> 00:19:13,414
over the maximum intensity plus the
minimum intensity

349
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:15,314
that passes the mask.

350
00:19:15,514 --> 00:19:17,014
This transfer function

351
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:19,989
combined with the resist
characteristic, the contrast,

352
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,141
are now defining of the condition
for the optical image.

353
00:19:23,593 --> 00:19:25,993
For high contrast resist,
it is easier

354
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:27,343
to get a high resolution

355
00:19:27,531 --> 00:19:30,656
than for a low contrast resist
with the same MTF.

356
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:33,052
On the other hand, the MTF

357
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:35,476
depends heavily on the motif
and the mask.

358
00:19:36,326 --> 00:19:39,938
The more <i>b</i>  is reduced,
the more the difference between

359
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,338
the minimal and the maximal
irradiation intensity reduces

360
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,920
and it becomes difficult or
impossible to selectively irradiate

361
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,095
the different resist parts
under the mask.

362
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:52,930
For low contrast resist,

363
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,918
it becomes difficult to resolve
the image of the mask

364
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:58,318
and to clear the resist
under exposure.

365
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:01,849
While keeping the full thickness
of the opaque regions

366
00:20:02,574 --> 00:20:04,361
in the case of a positive resist.

367
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:09,001
The modulation transfer function
can also be expressed in a curve

368
00:20:09,201 --> 00:20:13,576
shown here, that relates the spacial
frequency line pairs per millimeter

369
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,676
versus the modulation
in percentage.

370
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:19,638
For increasing spacial frequency of
closely spaced

371
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:21,663
opaque patterns in a chrome mask,

372
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:24,701
as expected, the modulation drops.

373
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:27,763
This all depends of course
on the wavelength used,

374
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,101
the optical transfer function
as well as the resist contrast.

375
00:20:33,052 --> 00:20:35,715
Once the lithography step
is done in the resist,

376
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,790
we can now see what pattern
transfer steps can be done

377
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,115
using the resist as a local mask.

378
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:43,940
Here an overview of possible
process steps.

379
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:46,771
The first example, <i>a</i>

380
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,971
is using the photo resist as a mask

381
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,980
with Ions to do a local doping

382
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,630
of the substrate with
incoming ions

383
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,880
that are masked by the photo resist.

384
00:20:58,643 --> 00:20:59,881
Or...

385
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,535
Example b is to use it for
an isotropic etching,

386
00:21:03,948 --> 00:21:06,635
the mask is protecting
the substrate.

387
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,160
And when the etching reaches
the substrate

388
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:11,073
has isotropic, that means

389
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:14,430
etching in all direction with
the same speed

390
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,315
which gives this circular shape.

391
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,925
Or example c would be

392
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:25,900
to etch a thin film that has been
previously coated on the substrate

393
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,987
so the example of gold, or another
metal layer can be etched

394
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,187
locally through the opening
and the photo resist.

395
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,572
Example d would be to use the photo
resist structure on the surface

396
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:39,972
as a mold,

397
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:43,180
for creating a replica

398
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,592
by pouring for example,
another polymer

399
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,455
over and cross linking,
and creating the negative

400
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,980
of the opening
of the photo resist pattern.

401
00:21:52,924 --> 00:21:54,487
Example e would be

402
00:21:54,725 --> 00:21:57,813
to use the mask for
anisotropic etching,

403
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:02,200
in this case, be in contrast with
the isotropic etching

404
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,075
we create vertical walls

405
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:08,225
the well defined geometrical feature
in the substrate.

406
00:22:09,634 --> 00:22:12,134
Or example f would be

407
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:15,822
to do electroplating, that means filling
the opening and the photo resist

408
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:18,034
by growing a layer locally

409
00:22:19,002 --> 00:22:20,665
in that aperture.

410
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:24,390
And the last example g,
would be to use

411
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,627
the photo resist as a mask

412
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:30,215
for list off processes in
a Physical Vapor Deposition step.

413
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:35,786
So this concludes this introduction
lesson on the lithography.

414
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:38,373
I have shown you
the process flow

415
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,886
of a typical photo lithography
process,

416
00:22:41,086 --> 00:22:44,011
and showed you some exposure
methods that exist

417
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:46,273
to irradiate the photo resist.

418
00:22:46,642 --> 00:22:49,304
Gave you some first information
about

419
00:22:49,504 --> 00:22:51,317
intrinsic resist properties,

420
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:53,267
and also showed at the end,

421
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:56,217
how the photo resist pattern
can then be transferred

422
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,092
into a layer of interest.
