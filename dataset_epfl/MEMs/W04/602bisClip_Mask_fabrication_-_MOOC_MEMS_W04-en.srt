1
00:00:00,405 --> 00:00:03,580
Now that we have seen the
theory on mask fabrication,

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:06,930
let's go to our clean room to see
how this is done in practice.

3
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:10,511
We will start with a commercial
pseudo-line plate that is coated

4
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:14,589
with chromium and photoresist
and we will see the different steps

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,256
required to make a mask that we will
then use for the UV lithography.

6
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:23,213
Here you see the engineer
taking out a mask plank

7
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:26,523
from the black storage box
where it was kept during the

8
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:29,741
transport outside
the yellow light zones.

9
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:35,312
The user then loads the mask into
the cassette of the laser writer.

10
00:00:37,225 --> 00:00:40,550
Now that the mask is inside
the tool, we perform

11
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,000
a final design check and
upload the data with the

12
00:00:44,202 --> 00:00:47,502
appropriate settings
to the laser writer.

13
00:00:50,048 --> 00:00:53,935
The mask plank is now loaded from
the cassette into the stage.

14
00:00:54,585 --> 00:00:58,360
The laser then begins to raster scan
across the mask in order to write

15
00:00:58,581 --> 00:01:01,981
the pattern that was previously
created on the CAT system.

16
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:06,341
As the writing progresses you can
see the mask coming forward

17
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,972
towards the camera.
A typical writing time

18
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:13,735
for a 5 inch mask can vary from
5 minutes to a couple of hours

19
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:17,844
depending on the pattern
density and complexity.

20
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,429
After exposing the resist with
the laser, the mask plank is

21
00:01:25,598 --> 00:01:29,035
processed by a developer
to reveal the resist pattern.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,675
Here the user loads the mask into
an automatic development tool

23
00:01:32,848 --> 00:01:36,198
that applies several programmed
cycles of development,

24
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:38,984
rinsing and drying.

25
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,216
Once the development
sequence is initiated,

26
00:01:42,424 --> 00:01:45,612
2 nozzles successively
come into action.

27
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:49,453
The first one that you see coming
from the left is applying deionized

28
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:54,360
water and is used to first clean the
mask from possible dust particles.

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:59,870
Then a second nozzle coming from
the right dispenses the developer.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,952
By alternating such cycles
and managing the wafer rotation,

31
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:10,592
efficient renewal of the developer
at the resist surface is ensured

32
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,649
in order to remove uniformly
the exposed resist.

33
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:22,348
You can now see the wafer rotating
at very high speeds;

34
00:02:22,668 --> 00:02:27,243
up to 5000 rpm
in order to remove all liquid.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,408
Observe the concentric rings
that appear and fade out

36
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:34,459
as the DI water
is dried off.

37
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:38,219
Before actioning the chrome,
we perform a check using

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,387
an optical microscope to verify that
the resist is correctly developed.

39
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,705
Notice that the mask design was
mirrored to take into account

40
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:50,411
that we will use it upside down
when exposing the wafer

41
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:53,085
in the UV lithography step.

42
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:58,863
Having confirmed that the
development was done properly,

43
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:01,926
the user, who wears
appropriate protection gear,

44
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:07,273
dips the developed mask plank into
a chromium etch bath for 90 seconds.

45
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,859
Here this is
sped up.

46
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,899
After rinsing you can already
see that the selected portions

47
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:18,483
of the mask where the chromium
has been etched away

48
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,815
become transparent. 

49
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:26,029
In one of the last steps where
stripped resisted was not exposed

50
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:29,973
you can in fact see the dark,
resist loaded drops of solvent

51
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:33,226
dripping off the mask
into the beaker.

52
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,973
After final rinsing and drying,
the mask is now ready

53
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:42,227
for UV photolithography.
