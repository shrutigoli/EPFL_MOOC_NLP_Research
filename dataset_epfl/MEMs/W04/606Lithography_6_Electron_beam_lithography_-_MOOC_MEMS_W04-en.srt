1
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:07,067
In the previous lessons
we have seen how the designs

2
00:00:07,193 --> 00:00:10,556
prepared for electron beam
lithography. and in particular about

3
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:14,533
the fracturing of the pattern into
convenient units to ensure best

4
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:18,225
beam writing quality such as
resolution, but also keeping in mind

5
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,611
the writing speed.

6
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:22,803
Here we will now see further details
on the e-beam lithography

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,218
in particular how the electrons
interact with the resist-coated

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:30,341
sample, and what parameters are
to be understood and optimized.

9
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:35,104
These are the resist contrast,
the various types of e-beam resist

10
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,330
proximity effects. as well
as alignment processes.

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,961
The electrons are accelerated
to high energy and are focused

12
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,578
onto the surface. 

13
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:46,817
As the electrons
penetrate the resist

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,165
they experience the so
called "scattering".

15
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:53,241
Forward scattering at small angles
occurs to the incoming electrons

16
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:56,349
which tend to broaden
the initial beam diameter.

17
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:59,507
When the electrons reach
the substrate, they undergo

18
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:03,340
large angle scattering, which
also leads to back scattering.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,850
The increase in effective beam
diameter in nano meters

20
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:09,895
due to forward scattering,
can be given apparently by

21
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,124
the following formula.

22
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:17,744
The forward scattering can be
expressed by 0.9

23
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:24,408
times the resist thickness Rt,
over the acceleration voltage

24
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,523
the power of 1.5.

25
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:31,845
Using the thinnest possible resist
and the highest available

26
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:34,958
accelerating voltage can
minimize forward scattering.

27
00:01:35,787 --> 00:01:40,287
Back scattered electrons may return
back to the resist at a significant

28
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:44,807
distance from the incident beam,
causing additional resist exposure.

29
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:47,695
This is called the electron
beam proximity effect.

30
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,502
The range of the electrons is
defined here as the distance

31
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,112
a typical electron travels
in the bulk material before

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,827
loosing all it's energy.

33
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,916
The range depends on both
the energy of the primary

34
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,165
electrons and the type of substrate.

35
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,140
So here, on the upper right side,
you can see two examples

36
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:12,635
of simulated results showing
the distribution of the electrons

37
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:17,469
from incoming beam, from the top
here that hits the surface, the PMMA

38
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:23,293
photo-resist and then the scattering
into the resist and the silicon

39
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:27,332
substrate for voltage of 10 kV

40
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,373
and the same is done
here for a voltage of 20kV.

41
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:34,556
We can already see that, for
an example the forward scattering

42
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:38,443
which is the widening
of the incoming beam

43
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:42,571
during the impact is much
more narrow for higher voltages

44
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:44,791
compared to the lower voltages.

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,742
So, if one aims for a higher
resolution patterning

46
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:52,293
one obviously goes to higher
voltages to minimize this

47
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,930
scatter effects, forward scatter
effect during the impact.

48
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:57,608
On the other hand, please note

49
00:02:57,687 --> 00:03:01,025
also that all these back scattered
electrons that come out through

50
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,122
the photo-resist at some further
distance location also cross-link

51
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,964
or alter the photo-resist, which
then will also be exposed

52
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,060
which is then called
the proximity effect.

53
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:18,428
If we now focus on how the atomic
mass Z, of the substrate material

54
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:22,747
influences the electron range,
for a given acceleration voltage

55
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,122
we obtain the following dependents
for gallium arsenide (GaAr)

56
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:32,191
the lower curve, silicone in
the middle, and the PMMA on top.

57
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,053
So as expected, high atomic
mass materials show reduced

58
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,764
electronic range.

59
00:03:38,327 --> 00:03:41,227
And here on the right side,
we see a typical radial energy

60
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:44,018
profile away from
the beam in pin point.

61
00:03:44,078 --> 00:03:47,591
The forward and back scattering are
approximated by two gaussians.

62
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,550
Please, note that this scale is
done in logarithmic scale.

63
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,067
Now let's have a more detailed
look how the path of the incoming

64
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:02,236
primary electrons and
generated secondary electrons

65
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,050
influence the resist exposure,
shown here.

66
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:09,290
Photo-resist with the substrate
and the primary electrons.

67
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:13,542
Forward scattering at small angles
of the primary electrons is

68
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,228
the first source of beam broadening.

69
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:20,648
As these primary electrons slow down
much of the energy is dissipated in

70
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:24,627
the form of secondary electrons,
with energies that are per definition

71
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:26,611
between 2meV and 50meV

72
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:30,331
so about three orders of magnitude
lower than the primary electrons

73
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,706
which are at kilo electron-volts
(kmeV).

74
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:35,699
The secondary electrons
are responsible for the majority

75
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,223
of the actual resist
exposure process.

76
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:43,240
The travel range is only a few
nanometers, which results in a slight

77
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,717
broadening of the exposed area.

78
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,507
These two affect largely
account for the minimum

79
00:04:48,624 --> 00:04:51,749
practical resolution obtainable
in the highest resolution

80
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:55,036
electron beam systems,
and contribute to the bias

81
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:58,993
that is seen in positive resist
where the exposed features

82
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:02,660
develop larger than the size
they were nominally written.

83
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,458
Primary electrons may
also back scatter

84
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:10,671
at high angles, so in back
scattering an electron collides

85
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,717
with a much heavier nucleus which
results in an elastic scattering

86
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:18,454
event and the electron thereby
retains most of it's energy

87
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:20,171
but changes direction.

88
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:23,943
These back-scattered primary
electrons can travel a long distance 

89
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:29,085
away from the beam impact point
and thereby create secondary

90
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,698
electrons that will
expose the resist

91
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:34,701
quite far away from
the intended impact location.

92
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:37,802
This results in the well known
white background exposure

93
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:39,933
known as proximity effect.

94
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:43,733
Due to the scattering effect,
the interaction volume or

95
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,404
the exposed zone depends on
the beam energy.

96
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,063
Indeed, a similar exposure dose

97
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,151
which is the total
charge per surface

98
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,565
delivered at different
acceleration voltages

99
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:56,378
results in different
lithography results.

100
00:05:56,678 --> 00:06:00,778
For instance, at high acceleration
voltage the electrons mostly

101
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,269
penetrate through the resist
with little interaction

102
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:06,176
and require a higher dose to clear.

103
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,732
As seen in the cross section images,
forward scattering is well visible

104
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,533
in the tapered resist profiles.

105
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:16,342
As expected, forward scattering
is more pronounced for low

106
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,051
acceleration voltages.

107
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:24,265
On the top-right, we can see that
higher acceleration voltages

108
00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:29,369
a greater dose is needed to obtain
full opening of the PMMA

109
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,000
after development.

110
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:34,081
High energy electrons penetrate
through the resist and scatter

111
00:06:34,175 --> 00:06:37,238
in a large volume and thus
interact less with the resist than for

112
00:06:37,335 --> 00:06:39,235
lower acceleration voltages .

113
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:41,951
At low voltages the interaction
volume is limited more

114
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:43,895
within the thin resist layer.

115
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:48,103
In the two figures here bellow,
we can see further illustration of

116
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,364
this concept.

117
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,619
Additionally from the schematic
on the lower-right

118
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:53,408
you can see the evolution of dose

119
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,904
to clear, as well as
the resist profile

120
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,609
due to forward scattering.

121
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,992
This is shown experimentally
from the images on the left.

122
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:04,042
At 640μC/cm^2

123
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,519
we can see the characteristic
tapered angle induced

124
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:09,181
by the forward scattering.

125
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:13,033


126
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,357
For now, let's have a look at
the actual resist exposure details

127
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:15,555
which are contrast and sensitivity.

128
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:18,885


129
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:20,247
Sensitivity is the dose
needed to fully clear positive

130
00:07:20,378 --> 00:07:22,666
or cross-link negative resist.

131
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,503
The higher sensitivity resist
allows for fast writing.

132
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:30,433
On the other hand, most high
resolution resists are of moderate

133
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,517
sensitivity for following reasons.

134
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:36,670
When targeting ultimate resolution
and electron beam of of a few

135
00:07:36,792 --> 00:07:40,742
nanometer width is used to expose
the correspondingly small area.

136
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,682
The highly sensitive resist requires
only a very limited number of

137
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:46,480
electrons to be exposed.

138
00:07:47,103 --> 00:07:50,615
The process is consequently very
sensitive to beam shot noise.

139
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,777
In order not to be affected by
shot noise one typically chooses

140
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:58,495
a lower resist sensitivity so that
the relatively large number of

141
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:02,357
electrons are needed for
the exposure of very fine patterns.

142
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,880
Another important feature of
the resist is the contrast

143
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:10,217
which is defined as the slope
of the dose to thickness variation.

144
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:14,324
Which is shown here, so D100
is the dose to clear

145
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:18,205
meaning the lowest dose when
the resist is fully opened after

146
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:23,734
development, and D0 is the largest
dose where the resist is still

147
00:08:23,842 --> 00:08:27,042
not exposed enough to
induce a thickness difference

148
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,896
after development.

149
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,680
In typical processing conditions,
high contrast resists are preferred

150
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,161
as it is often correlated
with resolution.

151
00:08:35,494 --> 00:08:39,931
Essentially the high resolution
resist will result in a binary system.

152
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:44,199
The lower dose threshold resist
is unaffected, above the dose

153
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:47,077
threshold it is fully removed,
in case of positive

154
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,544
or cross-linked in case of negative.

155
00:08:49,853 --> 00:08:53,691
Although proximity effects may still
distort the pattern, higher contrast

156
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:56,807
results allow induce blurring
of the written pattern.

157
00:08:56,908 --> 00:09:00,396
Low contrast resist, on the other
hand find interesting applications

158
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,240
in the gray-scale lithography.

159
00:09:02,358 --> 00:09:06,045
As seen here, the low contrast
allows for fine modulation of

160
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:09,777
the final resist thickness in order
to create out of plain features.

161
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:13,771


162
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,291
One important point to consider is
the resist contrast characterizes

163
00:09:15,383 --> 00:09:18,995
the full processing of the resist,
which when developing, playing

164
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:21,929
an equally important
role than exposure.

165
00:09:23,246 --> 00:09:27,009
So here in the bottom you see
two SEM images that show

166
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:31,198
the result of and exposure
and developing of a gray-scare

167
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,705
3d e-beam lithography,
and we can see here

168
00:09:35,821 --> 00:09:40,284
the entire thickness of the resist,
which is roughly 1μm and then

169
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:48,508
goes down step by step 785,
550, 345, and 146nm.

170
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:53,916
With the low contrast resist one
is able to perform such gray-scale

171
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:57,874
lithography which is not possible
with the high contrast resist.

172
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:02,298
Let's now have a look at
some typical EBL resists.

173
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:07,382
We start with PMMA, that is
a positive resist widely used

174
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:11,724
in electron beam lithography due to
it's high resolution and low cost.

175
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:16,715
PMMA usually provides a relatively
low etch resistance but it is

176
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,739
an excellent choice for
a lift off process.

177
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:25,346
When an electron is hitting
the molecule of PMMA

178
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:31,833
it breaks the bonds and associates
the large molecule into smaller

179
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,530
by products and mono mass

180
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:37,372
which are then removed
by the developing step.

181
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,709
By tuning the molecular weight
of the PMMA, the resist sensitivity

182
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,185
can be tuned to a large extent.

183
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:49,127
Therefore, by coating the two layers
of PMMA starting with one of higher

184
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,299
and the second one of lower
sensitivity, T-shaped undercuts

185
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:54,766
are produced.

186
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:59,442
Indeed, via single exposure
the chain scission reaction PMMA

187
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:03,489
after e-beam exposure will
produce a wide opening in

188
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:05,232
the first resist layer.

189
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:09,940
This bi-layer process is a standard
for EBL-based lift off that

190
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:13,998
guarantees limited side,
where coverage of the operated

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,070
material to ensure successful
lift off, like shown here

192
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,738
in this SEM picture.

193
00:11:19,483 --> 00:11:22,895
In the context of positive resists
other alternatives such as

194
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:27,654
CSAR and ZEP provide higher sensitivity
and a better etch resistance

195
00:11:27,762 --> 00:11:30,549
but to the expense of
a slightly lower resolution

196
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:32,349
and much greater cost.

197
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:38,294
HSQ is one of the highest
resolution EBL negative photo-resist.

198
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:42,398
It's inorganic, cage-like network
resembles that of low-density

199
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,986
silicone-dioxide.

200
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:48,114
Upon exposure HSQ is cross-linked
and very resistant to further

201
00:11:48,243 --> 00:11:52,330
post-processing making it an ideal
candidate as mask for dry etching.

202
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,367
It is interesting to know
the unexposed regions

203
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:59,558
are developed by chemical
reaction with NaOH, producing H2

204
00:11:59,711 --> 00:12:01,974
and not by simple dissolution.

205
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:05,553
Ultimate contrast and resolution
is reached in, so-called

206
00:12:05,663 --> 00:12:06,850
salty developers.

207
00:12:07,239 --> 00:12:11,739
HSQ is efficiently removed
or stripped by diluted HF.

208
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:15,783
We will now have a more detailed
look at the proximity effect that

209
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,519
are at the hear of the electron
beam lithography.

210
00:12:18,786 --> 00:12:22,561
As exposure occurs beyond the beam
diameter and beam impact point

211
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,978
the dose outside of
the intended area

212
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:27,714
may be sufficient
to expose the resist.

213
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,384
If the patterns are
significantly smaller than

214
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:33,865
the back-scattering range,
and uniformed in density.

215
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:37,025
This will result in a uniformed
background dose.

216
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:40,845
Therefore a simple dose scaling
is applied to correct for

217
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,821
the unwanted proximity effect.

218
00:12:43,336 --> 00:12:46,073
For large patterns,
or complex geometries

219
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,728
this is more complicated.

220
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,468
As seen in the image on the right

221
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:53,730
for a large pad in
the order of 500μm size

222
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:58,816
and an associated connection
wire with 100μm width

223
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:03,802
the dose is locally adjusted by
proximity effect corrections.

224
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:07,475
One can see for example that
the dose in the edges must

225
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:11,424
be increased compared to the dose
at the center of the square.

226
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:14,254
Red is more dose, blue is less dose.

227
00:13:14,446 --> 00:13:18,571
The base of these corrections relies
on the modeling of the energy

228
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:20,989
distribution away from
the beam impact point

229
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,192
which is commonly referred to as

230
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,742
the point spread
function or the PSF.

231
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,573
As seen previously,
two main effects

232
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:32,683
are responsible for energy
distribution in the substrate.

233
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:34,417
Forward and backward scattering. 

234
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:37,686
The simplest, yet efficient model
to approximate the point spread

235
00:13:37,819 --> 00:13:39,994
function is therefor
Double Gaussian.

236
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,472
One Gaussian accounts for
forward scattering

237
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:46,039
and depends on the α (Alpha)
parameter mostly affected by

238
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:48,668
acceleration voltage,
and resist thickness.

239
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,824
The second Gaussian is
defined by β (beta)

240
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:55,622
that accounts for the back-scattering
that heavily depends on the atomic

241
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:59,013
mass Z of the substrate
and acceleration voltage.

242
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:02,827
The last parameter ι (Iota)
modulates the ratio

243
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:07,360
between forward and backward
scattering, if ι=0 means there is

244
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,300
back scattering, whereas
if ι=1 it allows for equal

245
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:14,968
weight of both Gaussians
in the point spread function (PSF).

246
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:18,131
ι is here, and here.

247
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:22,471
The 3D graph of a Double Gaussian
system shows well, the sharp

248
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:27,098
center peak here and the broad
background distribution

249
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:30,402
of the back scattered electron.

250
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,188
If one can determine experimentally
the α, β, and ι parameters

251
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:39,242
one can compute the effective dose
delivered at the each shot location

252
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:40,877
 taking to account
the background

253
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:43,329
exposure from
the neighboring pixels.

254
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:47,520
Once this computation is done,
the proximity effect correction 

255
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:51,365
consists in scaling the dose per
pixel to provide a uniformed

256
00:14:51,477 --> 00:14:55,027
effective energy delivered
on the substrate

257
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,786
regardless of pattern density.

258
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:02,045
In practice we choose that
the 50% density pattern has

259
00:15:02,154 --> 00:15:05,804
the nominal base dose and
are not scaled, whereas isolated

260
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:09,854
features are corrected to receive
the higher dose, while the patterns

261
00:15:10,003 --> 00:15:13,003
denser that 50%
receive a lower dose.

262
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:17,162
In order to obtain the proper
point spread function for

263
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:21,024
double Gaussian approximation,
that will allow for the proximity

264
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:24,881
corrections, nested structures
of different density are written

265
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,391
to isolate the various parameters.

266
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,913
While α is typically effecting
the short range and is difficult

267
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:35,649
to measure, it's in the range
of 10nm to 20nm at most

268
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:40,730
β and ι are more easily
determined experimentally.

269
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:44,331
Using standard substrates
such as silicon or silicon-dioxide

270
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:47,786
on silicon, large amounts
of experimental values

271
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,689
for β are available.

272
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:54,013
Different methods allow
determining β experimentally.

273
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,125
Here we will focus on ι, because
it largely depends on the resist

274
00:15:58,227 --> 00:16:00,740
type and then therefor vary widely.

275
00:16:01,638 --> 00:16:08,613
The test patterns used checkerboards
like show here, the 250nm squares

276
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:13,806
and 50nm squares that provide
a good basis for the measurement

277
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:15,921
of the critical dimensions.

278
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:19,358
They are surrounded by periodic
patterns of varying density

279
00:16:19,471 --> 00:16:22,184
with an extent greater than
the back scattering range

280
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:25,303
in order to reproduce
the different background conditions.

281
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,560
So this checkerboard is surrounded
by zero patterns around

282
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:34,938
this one is completely filled
100% with writing area

283
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:38,568
and this is a 50% writing
area coverage around

284
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,129
the checkerboard test pattern.

285
00:16:41,847 --> 00:16:45,110
Knowing α and β from literature,
the user will run software

286
00:16:45,206 --> 00:16:48,794
proximity effect corrections on
these patters for a wide range

287
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:52,865
of ι, and will write the patterns
for different doses to perform

288
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,542
metrology and identify optical

289
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:58,080
proximity effect
correction conditions.

290
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:03,337
At 50% density, the effective dose
in the central pattern region

291
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:05,802
is not affected by
the choice of either.

292
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:08,858
In fact, when performing
the proximity effect correction

293
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,751
the dose is augmented or
reduced for lower or

294
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,448
higher densities only.

295
00:17:13,598 --> 00:17:16,823
The 50% pattern shown
on the previous slide

296
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,998
will therefor be used to
determinate our base dose.

297
00:17:20,455 --> 00:17:22,618
Three levels of features
allow for the assessment

298
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,119
of the base dose.

299
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,604
The dimensions of the loading line,
as well as the checkerboards

300
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:31,342
with square edge length
of 250nm and 50nm.

301
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,021
Like shown here.

302
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,983
Let's now look at
some real examples

303
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,789
using HSQ resist.

304
00:17:37,953 --> 00:17:40,678
First looking at the image
at the top right

305
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:44,216
here the base dose is
determined by measuring

306
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:48,857
the line width of the fifty
density, 50% density pattern.

307
00:17:48,843 --> 00:17:51,843


308
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:58,515
When underexposed, 1000μC/cm^2,
the lines are narrow, whereas when

309
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:02,318
overexposed we see use of
line broadening is observed.

310
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:06,411
If looking at the central
checkerboard one can see that

311
00:18:06,497 --> 00:18:10,272
when underexposed, the small
checkerboard is absent

312
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:15,964
and gradually appears and widens
with increasing dose.

313
00:18:16,743 --> 00:18:19,368
It's important to know that
the Double Gaussian model

314
00:18:19,504 --> 00:18:22,904
is an approximation for the electron
distribution during exposure.

315
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:26,657
Additionally development may
be affected by feature size

316
00:18:26,781 --> 00:18:30,806
and aspect ratio, and that due to
the finite contrast and process

317
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:34,938
latitude of the resist, the perfect
critical dimension at all scales

318
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,521
may be hard to reach.

319
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,631
This is already apparent to
the checkerboard pattern

320
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,740
between dose 120 and 150.

321
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:48,159
At the lower dose, the apertures
in the fine checkerboard are

322
00:18:48,307 --> 00:18:52,382
well defined, whereas the blanks
in the large checkerboard

323
00:18:52,502 --> 00:18:53,752
are too large.

324
00:18:55,487 --> 00:19:01,162
For the higher dose, the apertures
in the large checkerboard

325
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:05,997
are reduced, also still too large,
but the fine checkerboard

326
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,130
is already showing
signs of overexposure.

327
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:13,089
Additionally, we only tune
the dose of the written areas

328
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:16,442
but cannot physically apply
a negative dose in the non written

329
00:19:16,526 --> 00:19:19,401
areas that suffer from
background exposure.

330
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:22,118
In a way, we are here limited
to a dose leveling rather

331
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,858
than a true correction.

332
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:28,400
Once the base dose is extracted
from the 50% density pattern

333
00:19:28,491 --> 00:19:31,091
the ι parameter may be investigated.

334
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:35,314
Let's now have a look at this
CSAR, a positive resist

335
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:39,246
with the base dose of 200μC/cm^2.

336
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:44,709
Inspecting the 0% loading
one can see that Eta 0

337
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:47,943
the feature is still full of
undeveloped resists.

338
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,712
Like shown here.

339
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:55,960
At Eta 0, hence there's no
compensation to boost

340
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,950
the dose for the low density pattern

341
00:19:58,074 --> 00:20:00,274
and the resist is therefor
underexposed.

342
00:20:00,394 --> 00:20:04,744
As Eta is increased, a back
scattering contribution

343
00:20:04,849 --> 00:20:08,874
is assumed and a dose in low
density area slowly rises.

344
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:14,440
At Eta 0.3, the fine checkerboard
is very well defined. 

345
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:15,819
You can see here.

346
00:20:16,545 --> 00:20:21,257
By increasing Eta further to 0.9,
we can see the collapse of the fine

347
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:25,241
checkerboard and the separation
of the large 50nm squares.

348
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,733
Largely overexposed.

349
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:31,394
On the right you can see how
the dose correction is applied for

350
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,723
the different patterns
and associated density.

351
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,557
It is interesting to know that
if you look at the 100%

352
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:44,388
loading pattern, the Eta 0.3
at 220 base dose

353
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:47,005
provides good results on
the checkerboard. 

354
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,990
But the large area written around
shows a lot of remaining resist scum.

355
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:54,514
Increasing the dose further
clears the large areas

356
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,941
but the fine patterns are distorted.

357
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,848
This is again another illustration
of process windows limitations.

358
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,848
Proximity effect correction
should preferably be

359
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,463
performed taking to account

360
00:21:05,554 --> 00:21:07,842
the actual density
of the target patterns

361
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:11,672
and shape corrections, or bias
maybe used to further correct

362
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,191
the exposure.

363
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:18,359
All the structures here are
exposed and developed HSQ

364
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,200
negative resist patterns
imaged under a tilted angle

365
00:21:22,329 --> 00:21:24,529
in a scanning electron microscope.

366
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:31,730
From clockwise, top left you see
first groups of four HSQ fins

367
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,800
due to the 20kV
acceleration voltage 

368
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:39,252
one can actually see
through the HSQ structure.

369
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:45,337
The top right image shows
arrays of HSQ posts exposed

370
00:21:45,435 --> 00:21:48,435
with single electron beam
lithography shots.

371
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:53,453
The bottom right image shows
triangular arrays of HSQ

372
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,797
imaged at 2kV acceleration voltage.

373
00:21:57,694 --> 00:22:03,244
And the bottom left image shows HSQ
squares of two different thicknesses

374
00:22:03,389 --> 00:22:07,402
done by exposing successfully
two different layers.

375
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:13,237
Very few lithography processes
rely on a single layer alone.

376
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:16,730
Often we need to add a second
layer of structured material

377
00:22:16,854 --> 00:22:19,491
with high precision to
previous structure

378
00:22:19,612 --> 00:22:21,500
for example to make
contact electrode 

379
00:22:21,605 --> 00:22:23,167
to some nano wires.

380
00:22:23,614 --> 00:22:27,802
To this end, reference markers
are patent on the surface.

381
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:31,995
They allow aligning the electron
beam in subsequent exposure steps.

382
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,908
In optical lithography,
as you may remember

383
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:37,543
these markers are imaged
by optical methods.

384
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:40,943
The one-to-one transparent mask
with the chrome pattern

385
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:44,362
is then aligned mechanically
by means of a high precision

386
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,876
stage controlling X, Y and θ to
correct for rotation and translation.

387
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:53,958
In electron beam lithography,
the markers cannot be imaged

388
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,812
optically, but as we know
the e-beam tool is also functioning

389
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,811
as a scanning electron microscope
allowing to see the surface.

390
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,231
Due to large acceleration voltages,
and associated penetration depths

391
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,141
the markers, which are 10-20μm wide

392
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:15,305
are either etched in the substrate,
like shown here

393
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,448
with the depth of several microns

394
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:21,553
or made of a higher material

395
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:23,714
to provide sufficient contrast.

396
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:27,953
In both cases, the tool finds
the marker etch by monitoring

397
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:29,535
signal variation.

398
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,880
But not looking at the marker itself

399
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,546
but at the edge of the marker

400
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,650
which gives a strong signal
in the back scattered electron.

401
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,515
Also, markers maybe large,
the typical marker edge

402
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:45,060
detection accuracy is in the order
of a few tens of nanometer.

403
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:48,562
Due to back scattering and
the search range of the marker

404
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,295
these shouldn't be positioned closer
than a few hundreds of microns

405
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,828
from the region of interest
of being patterned.

406
00:23:55,729 --> 00:24:00,379
Besides the SEM imaging approach,
electron beam lithography also 

407
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:03,193
has another unique advantage
when compared to the mask

408
00:24:03,324 --> 00:24:04,449
alignment schemes.

409
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:08,432
Indeed, a large number of markers
per pattern may be used

410
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:12,854
for redundancy and the patterns
may be corrected beyond rotation

411
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:14,325
and translation.

412
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,855
The dynamic nature of
the electron beam lithography

413
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:20,364
allows, for an example, for
deformation of the design

414
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:24,150
in order to project it on
the base defined by the marker.

415
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:28,400
Well, this wraps up the lesson on
the electron beam lithography.

416
00:24:28,523 --> 00:24:31,461
We have seen the varied stages
of the process starting from

417
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:35,688
the design preparation, electron
resist interaction, various resist

418
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,400
properties as well as limitations,
such as proximity effect, and

419
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,243
how alignment is done.

420
00:24:41,502 --> 00:24:44,502
In the accompanying exercises,
you will have a chance train your

421
00:24:44,634 --> 00:24:48,321
knowledge and apply to
some real application cases.
