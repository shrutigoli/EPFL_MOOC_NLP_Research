1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,130
In this lesson, we will discuss
two other CVD type deposition processes.

2
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,914
The first one is atomic layer CVD,

3
00:00:12,914 --> 00:00:15,615
a technique in which
a thin film is deposited,

4
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:18,355
atomic layer by atomic layer.

5
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,951
This technique enables
the deposition of extremely thin

6
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:25,095
but continuous films without pinholes.

7
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:28,278
The second technique is thermal oxidation.

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,026
Here one leads oxygen gas
into the reactor,

9
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:36,426
which, at high temperature,
oxidizes a surface of a silicon wafer.

10
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:38,943
It is not truly a CVD process

11
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:44,247
in the sense that the silicon top layer
is transformed to silicon dioxide,

12
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:48,375
rather than there is a deposition
of the oxide material from the gas

13
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:50,544
on top of the substrate.

14
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:55,914
In atomic layer CVD,
we still have a heated wafer

15
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:01,524
on which a chemical reaction
starting from a gas is performed.

16
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:05,755
The thin film is deposited
by sequential deposition

17
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:12,244
of atomically thin layers
of two types of materials A and B.

18
00:01:12,244 --> 00:01:14,365
The characteristic of this process

19
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:19,284
is that each of the two
reaction steps is self-limiting.

20
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:22,806
This means that once
a monolayer is deposited,

21
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:28,615
the reaction stops, like you see here,
schematically for the gas A.

22
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:34,704
When all the surface is covered
with the molecules of type A,

23
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:39,445
the residual gas within the reactor
is purged by an external pump.

24
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:46,054
Next follows exposure
of the substrate to a flow of gas B.

25
00:01:46,054 --> 00:01:51,428
Gas B is chosen so that
it chemically reacts with gas A.

26
00:01:51,428 --> 00:01:56,486
A monolayer of the gas B
reaction product is deposited.

27
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,967
Due to the high temperature of the wafer,

28
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:04,908
a chemical reaction
between A and B occurs,

29
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:10,954
and the gaseous reaction byproducts
are pumped away from the reactor.

30
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:14,778
One has now deposited
a continuous monolayer

31
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:18,198
of the AB reaction product.

32
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:24,708
This process is repeated
as many times as required

33
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:28,618
for depositing an aimed film thickness.

34
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,479
The technique is very interesting

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,369
for production of very thin
conformal films

36
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:38,660
with an atomically well-defined precision.

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,282
Each biolayer reaction is self-limiting.

38
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,307
This means that the reaction stops

39
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:48,987
once all reactive sites on the surface
of the wafer are occupied.

40
00:02:49,857 --> 00:02:52,757
An example of atomic layer CVD

41
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:59,157
is the use of three metal aluminum
and water vapor exposure sequences

42
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:04,647
to generate very thin
aluminum oxide dielectric films.

43
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:09,467
Silicon dioxide, or silica,

44
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:14,467
is an extremely important material
in microfabrication technology.

45
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:19,152
Thin oxides are used
as dielectric in transistors,

46
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:21,327
while thick oxides are widely used

47
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,777
as protective coatings
and for electrical isolation.

48
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:30,617
Two types of thermal oxidation exist.

49
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:34,455
In the first type, called <i>wet oxidation</i>,

50
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:39,315
silicon is exposed to water vapor
at high temperature,

51
00:03:39,315 --> 00:03:43,647
so that it oxidizes to silicon dioxide

52
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,957
under generation of hydrogen.

53
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:54,367
In so-called <i>dry oxidation</i>,
the silicon reacts with oxygen

54
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,656
to give directly the oxide.

55
00:03:57,516 --> 00:04:01,877
The water vapor that is used
in the chemical reaction

56
00:04:01,877 --> 00:04:07,837
results from a combustion process
of hydrogen and oxygen gas in a torch,

57
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:09,707
as we will see later.

58
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:16,327
This slide shows schematically
the thermal oxidation mechanism.

59
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:22,927
In the beginning, the silicon atoms
at the surface are easily oxidized.

60
00:04:23,557 --> 00:04:26,756
Later, when one continues in time,

61
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:29,766
the oxide layer
becomes thicker and thicker,

62
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:34,247
and it becomes more difficult
for the oxygen to diffuse

63
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:39,615
through the thicker oxide layer,
to reach the silicon surface.

64
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:43,376
That is why, initially,
the oxide thickness

65
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,376
is proportional
to the time of the process,

66
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:51,609
but later oxidation is slower,
and goes with the square root of <i>time</i>.

67
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,519
Overall, it is a slow process.

68
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,261
For wet oxidation, at 900 ÂºC,

69
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:04,231
we have an oxidation rate
of 130 nanometers in one hour,

70
00:05:04,231 --> 00:05:09,581
while for dry oxidation,
it is only 30 nanometers for one hour.

71
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,891
One should also note

72
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:17,791
that because oxygen
is incorporated in the silicon lattice,

73
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,281
the volume of the material increases

74
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:26,801
so that if one has
an oxide thickness called <i>t-ox</i>,

75
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,941
this corresponds
to an initial silicon thickness

76
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,171
of only 0.45 <i>t-ox</i>.

77
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,934
So really the volume of the silicon

78
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:43,344
is increased into a bigger volume
of silicon dioxide.

79
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:49,475
Here we show one slide
that was discussed in our case study

80
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:53,175
of the thermal mechanical micro-actuator.

81
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:57,985
Thermal oxidation was used
in this microfabrication process

82
00:05:57,985 --> 00:06:02,771
to generate the oxide material
from the silicon wafer

83
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:07,152
to form the beam on which later

84
00:06:07,152 --> 00:06:10,742
the chromium heating
element was patterned.

85
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:17,465
This slide is a reminder
of the concern micro-fabrication step.

86
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:23,722
In the picture, we see
different oxide thicknesses.

87
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:27,376
In the middle,
the silicon wafer has no oxide.

88
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:33,295
Different thicknesses can be
well discriminated by the different colors

89
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:38,154
which originate from optical
interference effects in the oxide layer.

90
00:06:39,214 --> 00:06:45,197
Thermal oxidation is also used
in silicon integrated circuit technology.

91
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:49,278
It can be used to define
very thick oxide layers,

92
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:54,698
the aim of which is to isolate
the substrate from conducting layers.

93
00:06:54,698 --> 00:07:00,097
These conducting layers are deposited
on the thick silicon dioxide

94
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:04,038
and have then a low parasitic
capacitance with the substrate

95
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:06,298
due to the high thickness.

96
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:09,699
To only locally deposit this thick oxide,

97
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,899
one uses a silicon nitride mask.

98
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:19,496
So here the silicon nitride mask
is deposited on a very thin oxide layer.

99
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:25,846
This mask is nontransparent
to diffusing oxygen atoms;

100
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,006
it is very inert.

101
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:32,278
Because a thermal diffusion
process is omnidirectional,

102
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:37,439
one obtains an oxidation profile
like shown in this scheme.

103
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,359
This particular shape is called
the <i>bird's beak</i> in silicon technology.

104
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:49,448
Due to the bigger diffusion distance,
it becomes more and more difficult

105
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:54,718
for the oxygen to penetrate
underneath the silicon nitride mask,

106
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:58,718
and this gives this oxide
this particular shape.

107
00:07:59,808 --> 00:08:03,159
Because the oxidation
is only at specific places,

108
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,099
namely, those where there is no nitrite,

109
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,027
this process is called
<i>local oxidation of silicon</i>,

110
00:08:10,027 --> 00:08:13,450
or also the <i>LOCOS</i> process.

111
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,294
In this lesson, we have seen
two CVD type techniques.

112
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:22,259
The first one is atomic layer CVD

113
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:25,469
for formation of very thin
continuous layers.

114
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,609
And the second one is thermal oxidation,

115
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,459
which is not a true CVD process,

116
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:37,260
but is performed in the same type
of equipment as a CVD process.
