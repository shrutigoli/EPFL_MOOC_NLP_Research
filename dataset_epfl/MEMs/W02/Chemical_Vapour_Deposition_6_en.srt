1
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:08,774
In this lesson we will give 
a few examples of CVD processes

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,237
for depositing specific materials.

3
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:15,755
We will start by discussing 
the low-pressure chemical vapor deposition

4
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:18,707
of polycrystalline and amorphous silicon.

5
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:22,325
Then, we will discuss 
the LPCVD of silicon nitride

6
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:25,176
and hydrogenated silicon nitride.

7
00:00:25,176 --> 00:00:26,855
The latter material has interest

8
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:29,825
because of its lower intrinsic 
mechanical stress

9
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:32,737
with respect to the pure silicon nitride.

10
00:00:32,737 --> 00:00:35,437
Next, we will discuss the LPCVD

11
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:39,327
of so-called 
low-temperature oxide, or LTO.

12
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,587
Finally, we will discuss

13
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:43,507
the plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition

14
00:00:43,507 --> 00:00:44,797
of diamond films.

15
00:00:47,126 --> 00:00:50,728
Polycrystalline silicon, or polysilicon,

16
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:55,096
is a very important material 
that is used in microelectronics

17
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:58,907
for fabrication 
of the gate of transistors,

18
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:00,686
the so-called MOSFETs,

19
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:05,659
or metal-oxide semiconductor 
field-effect transistors.

20
00:01:06,769 --> 00:01:10,638
When the polysilicon 
is doped with impurities,

21
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,978
it is a conducting material
that can be used

22
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,900
for realization 
of electrical interconnects.

23
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:21,174
For microsystems applications

24
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:24,164
it is used as a structural material,

25
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:29,164
for example, for realization 
of mechanical inertial sensors.

26
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:36,376
In the picture we see 
an etched silicon microstructure

27
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,117
that was later covered

28
00:01:40,117 --> 00:01:46,360
by a polysilicon layer using LPCVD.

29
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:51,649
We can recognize 
the crystalloid structure

30
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:54,150
of the individual grains.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,051
Crystalloid formation is in use

32
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:02,670
by underlying single-crystalline silicon.

33
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:09,363
After the deposition 
of a silicon nitride layer,

34
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,593
also by LPCVD,

35
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:18,922
one has deposited, again,
silicon by LPCVD--

36
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:20,212
there's this layer.

37
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,767
This is now amorphous

38
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:29,487
as the nitride does not provide
nucleation sites

39
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:33,102
for crystalloid generation.

40
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:38,000
Amorphous silicon is used
in solar cell applications.

41
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:45,152
Here we show chemical reactions
involved in the deposition of polysilicon.

42
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:49,633
One uses either silane gas

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,217
or disilane gas

44
00:02:53,217 --> 00:02:58,780
in the pressure range
of 150 to 350 millibar

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,299
and in the temperature window 
around 590 to 650 degrees Celsius.

46
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:10,727
Amorphous silicon is deposited
at lower temperatures

47
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:15,168
at which the mobility of deposited atoms 
on a substrate is lower.

48
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,878
In the LPCVD reactor,

49
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,949
one deposits the polysilicon
on either silicon

50
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,480
or fused silica substrates.

51
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:29,806
Pyrex or float glass wafers 
are not allowed

52
00:03:29,806 --> 00:03:32,745
due to their low melting temperature.

53
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:37,496
And also, the presence of metals 
or organic materials in the reactor

54
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:39,115
is not tolerated.

55
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,929
During a typical deposition run,

56
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:46,717
a few micrometers of polysilicon 
can be deposited.

57
00:03:48,676 --> 00:03:53,168
This slide shows an LPCVD reactor,
as we have seen before.

58
00:03:53,886 --> 00:03:57,197
Also, a schematic diagram is presented

59
00:03:57,197 --> 00:04:01,959
showing a fused silica boat 
filled with wafers.

60
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,727
A boat can contain up to 25 wafers

61
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:08,498
so that high throughput 
deposition is possible.

62
00:04:09,197 --> 00:04:13,728
The reactor is configured 
with a pressure sensor,

63
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:18,360
with a pressure regulation valve,

64
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,600
and with a pumping unit,

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,488
so that one can well-control the pressure.

66
00:04:25,278 --> 00:04:32,019
A gas scrubber avoids that toxic 
byproducts of the chemical reaction

67
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,018
are released into the environment.

68
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:41,378
Another important material 
that is widely used in microfabrication

69
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,649
is silicon nitride.

70
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:48,783
It is used in microelectronic processes
as passivation layer

71
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:52,959
as it is a very inert 
and chemically-resistant material.

72
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,852
It has also interesting 
mechanical properties

73
00:04:56,852 --> 00:05:02,660
and it can be used for realization
of thin membranes, for example,

74
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,169
or as an electrical insulating 
coating material.

75
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,332
It is a material that is used 
in etching processes

76
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:12,662
to resist to aggressive chemicals,

77
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:18,162
for example, processes 
that use HF or KOH

78
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:21,291
to locally protect 
the material underneath.

79
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:27,632
In this picture we see again 
our etched silicon structure

80
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:32,563
which has been covered 
with a polysilicon layer by LPCVD,

81
00:05:33,493 --> 00:05:39,453
followed by deposition 
of a silicon nitride layer by LPCVD.

82
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:45,347
We see here the chemical reaction
by which silicon nitride

83
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:49,358
is deposited in an LPCVD process.

84
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:53,059
One uses two gases--

85
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:57,009
dichlorosilane and ammonia--

86
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:01,819
to deposit the silicon nitride layer,

87
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,119
and the release of hydrogen chloride 
and hydrogen.

88
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,099
Somewhat less than one micrometer 
is typically deposited per run.

89
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,290
This stoichiometric silicon nitride--

90
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:23,041
which is deposited at temperatures
in between of 700 to 840 degrees Celsius

91
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,268
upon cooling down on a silicon wafer--

92
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:30,409
is characterized by 
a relatively large residual stress.

93
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:35,620
This may be unwanted 
for certain applications

94
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,872
as it can lead 
to mechanical failure of devices.

95
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,082
Therefore, it's also possible to deposit
non-stoichiometric silicon nitride

96
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:52,575
by adjusting the ratio 
of the two precursor gases,

97
00:06:52,575 --> 00:06:55,031
so one varies <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.

98
00:06:55,962 --> 00:07:01,452
In this way we get 
hydrogenated silicon nitride

99
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:06,663
which is characterized 
by a much smaller residual stress.

100
00:07:07,402 --> 00:07:12,003
Therefore, it is possible 
to deposit thicker layers.

101
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:15,704
As a substrate that can be used 
in this type of process,

102
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:21,274
we have to use either silicon 
or fused silica, like before.

103
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:27,127
Here we show the reactor
and schematic diagram

104
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:31,635
that is used in an LPCVD process
for silicon nitride.

105
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:35,486
It is very similar 
to the reactor that is used

106
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:39,926
for the deposition of polycrystalline 
and amorphous silicon,

107
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:44,177
except that there are now two entrances

108
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:50,380
for two simultaneously-used 
precursor gases.

109
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:55,898
Another widely-used material 
in microfabrication

110
00:07:55,898 --> 00:07:58,607
is silicon dioxide or silica.

111
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:06,220
We have already seen that silicon dioxide 
can be realized by thermal oxidation

112
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,810
of the surface of a silicon wafer

113
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:13,031
at high temperatures 
of about a thousand degrees Celsius.

114
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:20,741
LPCVD enables to deposit silicon dioxide 
at much lower temperature

115
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:26,012
that is at 400 to 450 degrees Celsius.

116
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:32,552
That is why this oxide is known 
as Low-Temperature Oxide, or LTO.

117
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:37,702
It is used as isolation layer 
in between metal layers

118
00:08:37,702 --> 00:08:42,553
or in between conducting 
polysilicon layers in microelectronics.

119
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,464
It can be used as a protective mask

120
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:50,575
and as a final passivation layer 
on silicon chips, too.

121
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:56,635
In microsystems applications,
it can be used as a sacrificial layer,

122
00:08:56,635 --> 00:09:02,186
that is, a layer on which a functional 
material like polysilicon is deposited,

123
00:09:02,186 --> 00:09:07,176
after which the silicon dioxide 
is chemically etched away

124
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:12,396
so that one gets a freestanding 
polysilicon mechanical microstructure.

125
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:17,477
The picture shows an LTO layer

126
00:09:17,477 --> 00:09:20,966
which is deposited on a silicon wafer

127
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:27,038
that was microstructured 
using a silicon nitride mask.

128
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:33,487
It is also possible to dope 
the silicon dioxide with phosphorus atoms.

129
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:37,438
Strongly phosphorous-doped LTO

130
00:09:37,438 --> 00:09:42,828
is known as phosphosilicate glass, 
or PSG.

131
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,749
This material can be used 
as a diffusion source,

132
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:52,079
that is, it is deposited 
on a silicon wafer

133
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:57,319
after which, during heating,
it releases its phosphorus

134
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,508
by diffusion into the silicon.

135
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:03,510
It can also be used as a smoothing layer--

136
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,730
as during heating, 
it shows creeping behavior--

137
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,500
or it can be used as a passivation layer.

138
00:10:12,081 --> 00:10:15,082
It is also possible to dope the LTO

139
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:19,245
with both boron and phosphorus.

140
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,904
And in this case, 
this material is known as

141
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:29,104
Borophosphosilicate glass, or BPSG.

142
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:34,924
It has similar properties as the PSG.

143
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:41,255
This is the chemical reaction 
for the deposition of the silicon dioxide.

144
00:10:42,156 --> 00:10:47,156
One uses silane and oxygen gas

145
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:53,608
as precursor gases
at pressures of about 90 to 250 millibar

146
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:58,287
in a temperature window 
of 400 to 450 degrees Celsius.

147
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:04,843
Up to a few microns of LTO 
can be deposited per run.

148
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:10,923
For realization of the PSG or BPSG,

149
00:11:11,733 --> 00:11:16,785
additional precursor gases are needed,

150
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:22,693
namely, trimethylborate and phosphene.

151
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:28,206
This leads to incorporation 
of these oxides

152
00:11:29,196 --> 00:11:30,966
in the silica film.

153
00:11:32,976 --> 00:11:35,546
Here we see a schematic diagram

154
00:11:35,546 --> 00:11:40,166
of an LPCVD deposition system
for silicon dioxide,

155
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,205
which has also the option to realize

156
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:50,243
Phosphosilicate glass
and borophosphosilicate glass

157
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:57,025
by switching on the supply
of the appropriate precursor gases.

158
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:01,706
The last application we want to show

159
00:12:01,706 --> 00:12:06,356
is the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor 
deposition process of diamonds.

160
00:12:07,316 --> 00:12:10,706
Diamond has a very high 
thermal connectivity

161
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:12,506
and can be used as heat sink

162
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:17,236
in high-powered diode 
and transistor applications, for example.

163
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:20,227
It is also chemically inert

164
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:25,577
and can be used as electrode material 
in electrochemical applications.

165
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,451
When doped with boron,

166
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:31,763
the thus-obtained conducting material

167
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:35,732
can be used in harsh chemical environments

168
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:41,022
to probe the properties 
of the chemical liquid of interest

169
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:45,732
without having substantial 
and unwanted chemical interaction

170
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,493
with the electrode itself.

171
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:54,922
The picture shows 
such boron-doped diamond electrode.

172
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,983
In particular we see here,
the crystalloid structure

173
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:04,644
which is sketched here again,
in cross-section,

174
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:10,044
and which originates 
by the preferred growth of the diamond

175
00:13:10,044 --> 00:13:13,113
along certain crystal facets.

176
00:13:15,264 --> 00:13:19,755
This diagram illustrates the growth
of the diamond layer,

177
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:22,624
starting from the gaseous reactants,

178
00:13:22,624 --> 00:13:24,705
hydrogen and methane.

179
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:32,176
The deposition temperature 
is in between 700 and 900 degrees Celsius.

180
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:37,577
In the plasma, 
the hydrogen gas is dissociated

181
00:13:37,577 --> 00:13:43,656
in individual hydrogen atoms
which react with hydrocarbons

182
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:49,563
to create a complex mixture 
of hydrocarbon species.

183
00:13:50,657 --> 00:13:53,486
The individual hydrogen atoms

184
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:57,727
can remove hydrogen from the surface

185
00:13:57,727 --> 00:14:01,526
by recombination into molecular hydrogen.

186
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:05,210
Thereby, they create radical sites

187
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,010
that can react now 
with hydrocarbon species

188
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,199
to form the diamond lattice.

189
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:19,207
This process is repeated continuously.

190
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,470
And finally, one gets here
the diamond structure.

191
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:26,738
Here we show a schematic illustration

192
00:14:26,738 --> 00:14:30,947
of a diamond plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition reactor.

193
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:36,010
A microwave generator creates the energy

194
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,289
for generation of the plasma 
in the reactor.

195
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,959
A typical microwave plasma 
CVD growth rate for diamond

196
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,832
is in between 0.1 
and 10 micrometer per hour.

197
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:57,222
In this lesson we have given 
several experimental examples

198
00:14:57,222 --> 00:14:59,651
of CVD processes.

199
00:14:59,651 --> 00:15:02,452
We discussed the low-pressure
chemical vapor deposition

200
00:15:02,452 --> 00:15:07,872
of some of the most important materials 
in microelectronics and microfabrication,

201
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:11,032
like polycrystalline 
and amorphous silicon,

202
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:14,734
silicon nitride, 
hydrogenated silicon nitride,

203
00:15:14,734 --> 00:15:16,983
and silicon dioxide.

204
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,721
Finally, we have discussed

205
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:22,254
a plasma-enhanced 
chemical vapor deposition process

206
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,962
for deposition of diamond films.
