00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:10,077
Welcome in the introductory lesson
on chemical vapor deposition or CVD.

2
00:00:10,077 --> 00:00:14,328
Here we will discuss
the basic principles of CVD

3
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:18,725
and will show you a glimpse
of the clean room infrastructure

4
00:00:18,725 --> 00:00:22,929
that is needed to run a CVD process.

5
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:26,621
Different types of CVD techniques
will be introduced

6
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:31,480
and finally, a few common
CVD reactor types will be presented.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,250
As the name of the technique says,

8
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,910
a chemical reaction is involved

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,671
in depositing a thin film material
using CVD.

10
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,732
We give, as an example here,
the deposition of tungsten

11
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:45,753
at a high temperature
of 600 degrees Celsius.

12
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:50,923
To realize this deposition
one introduces into a reactor two gasses,

13
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:53,534
tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen,

14
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:56,825
which, upon chemical reaction,
result in the deposition

15
00:00:56,825 --> 00:01:01,645
of the metal tungsten
and the release of the gas HF.

16
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:05,522
The word <i>vapor</i> used in this CVD technique

17
00:01:05,522 --> 00:01:10,358
indicates that the starting compounds
to start a CVD deposition are gasses.

18
00:01:10,358 --> 00:01:13,519
As gas fills easily all parts of the reactor,

19
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,859
every surface in the reactor is exposed
in the same way by the gas.

20
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:22,630
As a result, the solid tungsten is
deposited everywhere in the same way,

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,260
conformal to the substrate.

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,860
The conformal deposition of the tungsten

23
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,473
is schematically indicated
in this drawing.

24
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:38,794
More interestingly,
from the drawing on the top,

25
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:43,443
it is clear that the gas
can also enter into narrow holes

26
00:01:43,443 --> 00:01:46,513
or restricted spaces in the substrate.

27
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:53,265
This opens possibilities for the technique
to do a metalization inside cavities

28
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:59,345
and provide electrical contacts between
different levels on the wafer, for example.

29
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:05,397
Here we show a typical CVD equipment,
how it looks like.

30
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:10,078
The picture on the left
shows 4 circular entrances

31
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:13,688
behind which a fused silica reactor
is positioned,

32
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,590
invisible in this picture.

33
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:21,280
Use of fused silica allows operation
until very high temperatures,

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,421
typically up to 1000
or 1100 degrees Celsius.

35
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:30,641
The picture also shows that boats
made with fused silica

36
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:34,823
have been charged
with a number of silicon wafers.

37
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:39,293
A boat can enter a tube
via an entrance hole

38
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:46,255
after which the door is closed
and the CVD process can start.

39
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,955
The picture on the right shows an operator

40
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:52,825
who is charging the boat
with silicon wafers.

41
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:57,696
This slide shows the CVD equipment
in more detail.

42
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:01,327
The top picture shows
a batch of silicon wafers

43
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:06,169
that is ready to be inserted
into the fused silica tube.

44
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:11,800
The lower picture shows the silicon wafers
that have been moved further in the tube.

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,391
The yellow color results from the fact that
one has switched on the heating elements

46
00:03:17,391 --> 00:03:20,331
that surround the fused silica tube.

47
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:22,982
After closing of the entrance port,

48
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,662
the carrier gas
enters the deposition chamber

49
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:31,114
and one can very accurately control
flow and temperature conditions.

50
00:03:31,114 --> 00:03:38,614
Evidently, CVD thin films are grown
on all exposed surfaces within the tube.

51
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,765
We will now discuss
in a very schematic way

52
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,625
what happens in a CVD process.

53
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:48,886
To this purpose we have drawn here

54
00:03:48,886 --> 00:03:53,227
a wafer positioned on a heating element.

55
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:56,857
The goal is to deposit by CVD
a thin film on the wafer.

56
00:03:56,892 --> 00:04:01,132
The wafer and heater are positioned
in a reactor chamber

57
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:06,817
from which we can evacuate
all residual gasses by pumping.

58
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:10,259
We show here the reactor chamber
that has been filled

59
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,129
with a controlled gas atmosphere.

60
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,979
There is a gas flowing into the reactor

61
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,820
which undergoes a chemical reaction
at the heated wafer's surface,

62
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,201
which leads to
the deposition of a thin film.

63
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,041
As side products of this chemical reaction

64
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:33,501
gaseous products are produced
that are evacuated from the chamber.

65
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,382
Different physical principles
or aspects are involved

66
00:04:36,382 --> 00:04:39,253
for understanding a CVD process.

67
00:04:39,253 --> 00:04:43,343
First, one should understand
the thermodynamics

68
00:04:43,343 --> 00:04:45,784
of the chemical reaction itself.

69
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,965
It should be energetically favorable

70
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:53,506
to produce a solid thin film
reaction product on the wafer from the gas.

71
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:58,596
Next, the CVD process should show
favorable growth kinetics.

72
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:03,037
This means that the reaction
should proceed sufficiently fast

73
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:08,097
so that the waiting time for depositing
a thin film is not too long.

74
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:14,699
A third important aspect of a CVD process
is how the gas flow occurs.

75
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,450
When the gas is flowing over
the wafer's surface,

76
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,402
it will be gradually depleted.

77
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:24,852
However, it is required
that a thin deposited film

78
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:27,288
has everywhere the same thickness.

79
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:33,603
Gas flow conditions should be such
that this is enabled.

80
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:37,944
If <i>x</i> is the coordinate
in the horizontal plane

81
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:39,704
in the direction of the flow,

82
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:43,754
the thin film thickness,
as a function of <i>x</i>,

83
00:05:43,754 --> 00:05:48,685
is influenced by the just-mentioned
fundamental aspects of CVD.

84
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:52,568
Thermodynamics
provides an exponential factor

85
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,858
which contains the activation energy

86
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:58,878
needed to go
from the gaseous to the solid phase

87
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:02,048
as well as the thermal energy.

88
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:03,838
The hotter the wafer becomes,

89
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,918
the higher the growth rate will be,
in principle.

90
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:12,391
The next aspect in the CVD process
is the growth kinetics.

91
00:06:12,391 --> 00:06:15,671
If a thermodynamically stable
reaction product

92
00:06:15,671 --> 00:06:17,331
can be formed in the process

93
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:21,572
this does not say a lot
on the rapidity of the deposition.

94
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:25,563
Nucleation of solid material
and further growth can be slow

95
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:29,374
and need to be evaluated experimentally.

96
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:35,345
This adds the probability factor <i>Pgrowth</i>
to the formula

97
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:37,996
for the thickness of the thin film.

98
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:43,267
Finally, the thin film thickness
at the position <i>x</i>

99
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:47,298
is a function of the gas concentration
at that point.

100
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:51,518
Mostly one wants that the film thickness
is everywhere the same

101
00:06:51,518 --> 00:06:54,358
so the gas flow conditions
and the gas concentration

102
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:57,649
ideally should not depend on <i>x</i>.

103
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,970
We have written here again
the formula for the film thickness.

104
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,961
It was already clear
that for the reaction to occur,

105
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:08,421
a high temperature of the wafer is needed.

106
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,611
In practice,

107
00:07:09,611 --> 00:07:13,122
temperatures ranging from
a few hundred degrees Celsius

108
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:16,222
to almost a thousand degrees Celsius
can be used.

109
00:07:16,222 --> 00:07:18,483
If one is at very high temperatures,

110
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:22,193
there is a lot of thermal energy, <i>kT</i>,

111
00:07:22,193 --> 00:07:27,294
and the reaction proceeds very fast
due to the exponential factor.

112
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:33,075
In this case, the control of the gas flow
is very important

113
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:36,346
as the local thin film thickness

114
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:40,607
will be proportional
to the local gas concentration.

115
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:43,918
The gas concentration, hence,
has to be uniform

116
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:46,908
everywhere in the vicinity
of the substrate.

117
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:49,989
If one is at a moderately high temperature,

118
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:54,739
the film growth and the chemical reaction
will not proceed that fast.

119
00:07:54,739 --> 00:07:58,861
The exponential factor in this case
is limiting the growth rate

120
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:05,331
while the gas usually has
a uniform concentration within the reactor.

121
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:11,023
In these conditions, the local temperature
should be very well controlled

122
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,492
as a small temperature variation

123
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:17,984
evidently will give a variation
in grown film thickness.

124
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:21,557
Finally, one can say that,
at low gas pressure,

125
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:26,544
good film uniformity
can be better obtained.

126
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:28,596
Indeed, at low gas pressure,

127
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:32,396
the mean free part
of the gas molecules is long

128
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:38,877
so that a short distance local variation
of the gas concentration is less important.

129
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,558
This schematic figure shows
the thin film thickness

130
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:47,729
on a logarithmic scale
against the inverse of the temperature.

131
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:49,409
When plotted this way,

132
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,079
one sees from the exponential factor

133
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:55,640
that a linear slope will correspond
to the activation energy

134
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,700
of the chemical reaction.

135
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,553
If one increases the temperature
the film growth rate will go up,

136
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:07,952
but ultimately the gas flow cannot provide
sufficient concentration of molecules

137
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:12,213
and the curve will adapt
to a much flatter slope.

138
00:09:12,213 --> 00:09:14,773
So one can easily discriminate
from such a plot

139
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:18,325
the mass transfer controlled
and the reaction controlled

140
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,956
deposition regimes.

141
00:09:20,956 --> 00:09:24,925
Suppose the red curve was obtained
at higher gas pressure.

142
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,666
If one decreases the gas pressure,

143
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,587
the deposition will stay longer
in the reaction controlled regime.

144
00:09:32,587 --> 00:09:36,479
Despite the fact that there are
fewer molecules at a lower pressure,

145
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,868
the mean free path in the gas is higher

146
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:43,268
so that gas molecules that come from
further away from the substrate

147
00:09:43,268 --> 00:09:46,640
can be used in the reaction.

148
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,650
Because pressure
plays such an important role,

149
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,950
CVD processes are typically classified

150
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,459
according to the pressure
at which the deposition takes place.

151
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:01,871
The first technique is called
<i>atmospheric pressure CVD</i> or <i>APCVD</i>

152
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:07,403
which, as the name says, uses a gas
at atmospheric pressure.

153
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:14,484
The next technique is called
<i>sub-atmospheric pressure CVD</i> or <i>SACVD</i>

154
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:20,616
and the pressure of the gas is typically
in between 1000 millibar and 10 millibar.

155
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,865
The advantage of having a lower pressure

156
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:26,816
is that interaction between different
gas molecules is less probable,

157
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,887
so that there is less probability

158
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:33,147
for unwanted particle synthesis
in the gas itself.

159
00:10:33,147 --> 00:10:36,869
Also, because of the increased
mean free path of the gas molecules,

160
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,279
local variation in gas concentration
is reduced

161
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,079
so that the film thickness across the wafer
is more uniform.

162
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:49,891
The next technique is <i>low-pressure CVD</i>
or <i>LPCVD</i>

163
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:56,392
which typically operates in between
0.1 millibar and 1 millibar.

164
00:10:56,392 --> 00:11:02,304
Finally, we have <i>ultrahigh vacuum CVD</i>
or <i>UHV/CVD</i>,

165
00:11:02,304 --> 00:11:07,544
a technique in which the reactor first
is pumped down to a very low pressure,

166
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:10,704
after which the growth
of the thin film takes place

167
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:14,835
at a pressure of 10^-3 millibar,
typically.

168
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:18,546
In this case there is very little 
interaction between the gas molecules

169
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:22,587
so that the gas behaves
less like a viscous liquid

170
00:11:22,587 --> 00:11:27,887
but more like an ensemble
of individual molecules.

171
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:31,268
CVD processes are often categorized

172
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:34,519
according to the reactor type
in which they are performed.

173
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,741
The first reactor type is called
the <i>hot wall tube reactor</i>

174
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:43,100
as we have already seen
in the pictures before.

175
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,011
In such a reactor, the wafers are placed
in a fused silica boat

176
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:52,503
that is to be inserted
in the fused silica tube.

177
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:57,934
After that, the complete system is heated
so every part is at the same temperature

178
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:03,114
and deposition will be uniform
if the gas concentration is sufficient.

179
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:09,976
Note that in this case, deposition also
will occur on the walls of the system.

180
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:15,726
Another type of CVD system is called
the <i>cold wall tube reactor</i>.

181
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:20,807
In this case, there is no external heater
that heats up the complete system,

182
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:27,490
but the wafers are positioned
on a conducting graphite susceptor

183
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,920
which is heated using
an external RF coil.

184
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,810
In this case, there is only locally
a high temperature

185
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,631
and there is
a strong temperature gradient.

186
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:41,592
There will be no deposition
on the walls of the system

187
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:44,413
and the graphite susceptor is tilted

188
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:48,153
with respect to
the direction of the flow typically,

189
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:52,794
to take into account
eventual gas depletion effects

190
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:58,185
that would give a thinner film if
one goes further downstream of the flow.

191
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:01,996
In such a configuration,
the wafers will be exposed always

192
00:13:01,996 --> 00:13:05,957
to a fresh stream of gas.

193
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:11,177
This picture shows a principle
of a so-called <i>showerhead reactor</i>.

194
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:16,498
The gas enters a dedicated space
within the reactor

195
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:21,148
and exposes the wafer via
a multitude of small holes,

196
00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:23,379
like a shower of gas.

197
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:29,040
The same principle is used for
this so-called <i>conveyor belt reactor</i>

198
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,141
in which the wafers are positioned
on a transport belt

199
00:13:34,141 --> 00:13:36,751
and led over a heater.

200
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:40,033
The wafer through-put of such a system
evidently will be higher,

201
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:46,523
so this is a system that is more suitable
for industrial production.

202
00:13:46,523 --> 00:13:50,034
This ends our introduction on CVD.

203
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:54,125
We explained the basic parameters
of CVD reaction and process

204
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,365
and pointed out the various factors

205
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,966
by which the film thickness
can be controlled

206
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:01,936
such as the temperature
and the local gas pressure.

207
00:14:01,936 --> 00:14:04,947
We introduced different types
of CVD processes

208
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:08,577
according to the pressure
at which the deposition takes place.

209
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:13,368
Also, we have introduced some of
the common CVD reactor types.
