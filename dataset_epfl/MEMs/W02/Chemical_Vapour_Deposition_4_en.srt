1
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,278
In this lesson, we will introduce some
important theoretical concepts

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,524
that play a role in CVD.

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,503
These are related to the flow of the gas
over the heated substrate.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:22,030
Due to friction forces at the substrate,
the velocity is essentially zero,

5
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:27,077
and only when going sufficient distance
away from the substrate,

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,828
when we will reach the velocity of the gas
in the free-flow regime.

7
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:37,467
Also, as one consumes gas molecules 
in the process, the gas concentration

8
00:00:37,498 --> 00:00:40,848
at the substrate will be reduced 
so that there is not only

9
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,998
a velocity boundary layer 
near the substrate,

10
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,538
but also
a gas concentration boundary layer.

11
00:00:48,285 --> 00:00:52,378
Finally, you will introduce 
how the concept of the Reynolds number

12
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:56,189
plays a role in gas transport 
over the substrate.

13
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:03,499
This slide schematically shows 
the velocity distribution <i>u</i>

14
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,530
as a function of the coordinate <i>y</i>
perpendicular to the surface.

15
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:18,072
At the surface, the velocity is zero,
and when going up in the <i>y</i> direction,

16
00:01:18,602 --> 00:01:25,281
one finds back the free-flow velocity,
noted here as u-infinite.

17
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:32,781
This velocity gradient develops
in a region close to the substrate,

18
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,452
and this region is known as

19
00:01:36,492 --> 00:01:40,883
the hydrodynamic 
or velocity boundary layer.

20
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:47,642
As the wafer is heated, the temperature
of the gas close to the wafer

21
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,524
will be higher than far away.

22
00:01:50,723 --> 00:01:53,155
So there's also 
a gradient of temperature

23
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:55,243
near the substrate,

24
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,594
and this can be associated

25
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:01,197
with the temperature 
or thermal boundary layer.

26
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:08,707
The boundary layer grows 
as one advances in the <i>x</i> direction

27
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:16,134
along the flow, as if one goes further,
the gas is more and more influenced

28
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,798
by layers of gas underneath 
that have already been perturbed

29
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,028
by the viscous flow forces.

30
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:35,753
Here we show the shear stresses,
<i>tau</i>, that act on the gas layer.

31
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:43,726
Shear stresses develop as the velocity
of the gas layer underneath

32
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:46,694
is lower than this layer

33
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,815
and as the velocity 
of the gas layer above is higher.

34
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:58,095
The dashed line in this diagram
is a theoretical curve

35
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:01,507
which corresponds
to the coordinates in space

36
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,768
where the velocity of the gas 
is nearly at equilibrium,

37
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,408
that is nearly u-infinite.

38
00:03:10,383 --> 00:03:14,768
One defines this dashed line
as the ensemble of all points

39
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:20,858
where the velocity is 99% 
of the velocity <i>u</i> at infinity.

40
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,360
As one goes from the substrate,
where there is zero velocity,

41
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:30,292
to this line, where there is 99%

42
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:34,474
of u-infinite,
it is clear that shear stresses

43
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:40,287
are much higher in this region
for small <i>x</i> than in this region

44
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:45,204
for high <i>x</i> where the same difference
in velocity is developed

45
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,114
over a much larger distance.

46
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:54,443
This slide shows 
the concentration boundary layer.

47
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:59,475
During the deposition, 
due to the consumption of the gas,

48
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:04,048
there is a lower concentration 
of gas near the wafer.

49
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:10,557
This depletion effect of the gas
is counterbalanced

50
00:04:11,286 --> 00:04:17,417
by gas flowing from further away
by diffusion towards the substrate.

51
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:21,380
In the same way 
as for the velocity distribution,

52
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,570
one can define 
the concentration boundary layer.

53
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,001
In general, two types of flow behavior
can be distinguished

54
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:31,861
in the boundary layer.

55
00:04:33,782 --> 00:04:40,632
For small <i>x</i>, the velocity is mainly 
parallel to the <i>x</i> direction

56
00:04:41,653 --> 00:04:45,195
due to the high shear forces 
in the <i>y</i> direction,

57
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:51,457
because we see much bigger shear here
where the boundary layer is smaller.

58
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:57,475
For higher <i>x</i>, the thickness
of the boundary layer is higher

59
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,595
so that the shear forces 
are less important.

60
00:05:01,314 --> 00:05:04,035
In this case, turbulent behavior is seen.

61
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:09,246
Somewhere in between 
is a critical coordinate x-c

62
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:13,596
where the transition 
from laminar to turbulent behavior

63
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,047
takes place.

64
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:17,826
CVD is normally operated

65
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:19,978
in the laminar flow boundary layer regime

66
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:23,367
where flow is more ordered and regular.

67
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:29,766
An important number in hydrodynamics
is the Reynolds number

68
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:35,477
which is defined as function 
of the density of the fluid

69
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:42,446
of the gas in this case 
or the velocity denoted by u-infinite

70
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,249
and the coordinate 
along the <i>x</i> direction, x-c.

71
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,460
<i>Mu</i> is the dynamic viscosity of the gas.

72
00:05:54,044 --> 00:06:00,972
Associated with the coordinate x-c,
one defines a critical Reynolds number

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,839
at x-c, and it appears that for all cases,
this critical Reynolds number

74
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,400
where the transition

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,838
between laminar
and turbulent behavior occurs

76
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:17,642
is at the number 5 times 10 to the fifth.

77
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,343
So one can vary

78
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:22,493
density, velocity, or <i>x</i>, or <i>mu</i>.

79
00:06:23,464 --> 00:06:27,907
Always, the transition will be
for this value of the Reynolds number.

80
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,707
Here we want to give 
a physical interpretation

81
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,165
of the Reynolds number.

82
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,668
It can be thought of as

83
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,447
the ratio of inertia
to viscous shear forces

84
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:46,999
that act on a gas layer element 
in the boundary layer.

85
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:53,759
An inertial force per unit volume
can be written as the derivative

86
00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:00,222
in <i>x</i> of the kinetic energy density,
and this can be crudely approximated

87
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:03,968
by this formula:

88
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,530
average density,

89
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,045
average velocity,

90
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,730
and L is the dimension of the system
in the <i>x</i> direction.

91
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:15,900
A shear force per volume element
or per layer of gas

92
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,051
can be written as

93
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,641
derivative with respect to y

94
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:27,328
of the viscous shear forces 
that act on a plane

95
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,954
with normal along the <i>y</i> direction.

96
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:36,605
Again, in a very crude approximation,
we can write this shear force

97
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,054
by this expression

98
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,744
with L, dimension of the system,

99
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:44,193
this time in the <i>y</i> direction.

100
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:49,325
Taking the ratio 
of these two approximative expressions,

101
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:51,374
one obtains this,

102
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:54,944
which is the Reynolds number.

103
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:57,434
This gives us following understanding:

104
00:07:58,532 --> 00:08:02,664
In any flow exists small disturbances
that can be amplified

105
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,434
to produce turbulent behavior.

106
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:08,138
For small Reynolds number,

107
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:13,677
the viscous forces in the beginning
for small <i>x</i> are large enough

108
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,955
so that this turbulent behavior 
cannot develop.

109
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,958
With increasing Reynolds number,

110
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,577
that means with increasing <i>x</i>,

111
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,446
the viscous forces become
relatively less important

112
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:30,788
with respect to the inertia forces.

113
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:34,166
As the same difference in velocity

114
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:39,379
develops over the much larger
boundary layer in the <i>y</i> direction.

115
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:46,213
Therefore, for increasing <i>x</i>
above the <i>x</i> corresponding

116
00:08:46,241 --> 00:08:48,051
to the critical Reynolds number,

117
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:54,702
small disturbances may be amplified,
and turbulent behavior develops.

118
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:58,882
In this lesson,

119
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:01,481
we have seen 
an important theoretical concept

120
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,462
for understanding 
chemical vapour deposition,

121
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:06,200
namely the development

122
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,923
of the velocity boundary layer
in the gas

123
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:13,172
and the gas concentration boundary layer
near the heated substrate.

124
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:19,013
Also, we mentioned the role 
of inertia and viscous forces

125
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:20,909
and the Reynolds number

126
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:25,564
for inducing laminar or turbulent 
behavior of the gas flow

127
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:27,984
in the boundary layer.
