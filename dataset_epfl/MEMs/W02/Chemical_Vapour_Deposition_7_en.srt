1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:09,378
In this lesson we will discuss
three additional types of specific CVD

2
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:12,454
and Atomic Layer Deposition processes.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:16,394
We have already seen
that wet and dry thermal oxidation,

4
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:20,374
strictly speaking,
are no true CVD techniques

5
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:24,685
as they transform the silicone surface
into an oxide

6
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:28,645
by diffusion of oxygen atoms
into the silicon lattice

7
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:33,015
rather than depositing a layer
on the substrate from the gas phase.

8
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:37,906
However, the technique is using
the same technological infrastructure

9
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:39,816
as a true CVD process.

10
00:00:40,596 --> 00:00:43,396
As examples of atomic layer deposition

11
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:47,078
we will discuss the deposition
of aluminum oxide,

12
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:50,398
ruthenium, and titanium nitrite films.

13
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:55,698
Wet oxidation uses water vapor

14
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:59,290
resulting in a relatively fast
transformation

15
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,478
of the surface of a silicon wafer
into oxide.

16
00:01:03,328 --> 00:01:06,110
We have already seen that if one has

17
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:12,160
a local thin silicon nitrite layer
as protection

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,739
it is possible to create
locally thick silica layers

19
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,884
while protecting the region in the middle
against oxidation.

20
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:30,811
And this process was named
<i>Local Oxidation of Silicon</i>, or <i>LOCOS</i>.

21
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:37,284
Here we illustrate
the wet thermal oxidation process

22
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:41,474
using another type
of silicon microstructure.

23
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:47,946
One has prepared here
a pillar structure by etching,

24
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:53,387
using silicon nitrite as a masking material
in the etching process.

25
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:59,036
If one now performs
the thermal oxidation step,

26
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:05,837
the silicon nitrite again acts as a barrier
against the diffusion of oxygen atoms.

27
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:12,756
This gives relatively few oxidation
underneath the silicon nitrite

28
00:02:12,756 --> 00:02:16,729
and thicker regions here
where there is full access for the oxygen.

29
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:22,349
This picture shows
the experimental example.

30
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:28,892
And we clearly recognize here
the three types of materials.

31
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:34,891
So first we had here the silicon structure
made using the silicon nitrite mask,

32
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:37,883
and here we see the zones

33
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:42,332
where the silicon is transformed
to silicon dioxide.

34
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:49,464
In thermal oxidation one uses temperatures
in between 850 degrees Celsius

35
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:51,914
and 1100 degrees Celsius.

36
00:02:53,154 --> 00:02:59,415
We have already seen that one can use
either water vapor in the reaction,

37
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:03,075
and then the process
is called "wet oxidation",

38
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:05,225
or one can use oxygen gas,

39
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:08,277
and then the process
is called "dry oxidation".

40
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:12,567
Both processes are relatively slow.

41
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:22,077
Wet oxidation is a few factors more rapid
than dry oxidation, however.

42
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:30,089
This slide shows the transformation
of the silicon into silicon dioxide

43
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,917
as a function of time.

44
00:03:32,847 --> 00:03:40,530
Initially, the oxygen easily diffuses
to the silicon surface

45
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,981
so that the oxide thickness
is proportional to the time.

46
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:48,751
However, when the oxide becomes thicker

47
00:03:48,751 --> 00:03:53,541
it becomes increasingly difficult
for the oxygen atom

48
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:59,273
to reach the silicon surface,
and the oxidation will become slower.

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,983
That is why the oxide thickness
is proportional

50
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:07,485
to the square root
of the oxidation time.

51
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:12,625
In general, we can have
the following formula

52
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:16,913
which fits both the initial linear behavior

53
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:20,285
and the square root behavior
for longer oxidation times.

54
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:27,467
Here <i>Ï„</i> is a time constant
that takes into account

55
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:33,557
the thickness of an eventual
initial native oxide of the silicon wafer.

56
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:39,799
This is a schematic diagram
of a wet thermal oxidation equipment.

57
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,969
The generation of the water

58
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:47,109
in the wet thermal oxidation process
is particular.

59
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:54,641
Hydrogen and oxygen gas are mixed

60
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,983
at a temperature
of about 600 degrees Celsius

61
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:03,142
and react in a controlled
combustion process,

62
00:05:03,142 --> 00:05:06,622
reaching temperatures
of about 1200 degrees Celsius.

63
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:12,323
And as a result of this combustion
water is generated

64
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,943
which is then let into the reactor.

65
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:22,775
Dry thermal oxidation is mainly used
for the realization of thin oxide layers

66
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:26,523
that form the gate oxide
in MOS transistors.

67
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:35,914
In this process, one uses
dichloroethylene and oxygen

68
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:41,066
to create together hydrogen chloride

69
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:45,948
that cleans the surface
from eventual metal contaminants.

70
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:53,139
In this way, a very thin and pure
oxide layer of high quality can be grown.

71
00:05:54,329 --> 00:06:00,119
The picture shows a similar type
of structure like shown before--

72
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:08,089
a silicon pillar,
made with a silicon nitrite mask

73
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:15,151
and afterwards there is dry oxidation
leading to these oxide layers.

74
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:21,512
This is a schematic diagram
of the dry thermal oxidation equipment.

75
00:06:21,512 --> 00:06:24,112
It has the particularity

76
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:32,313
that nitrogen gas is bubbled through
the dichloroethylene bonds

77
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:38,434
to transport the dichloroethylene molecules
to the reactor.

78
00:06:40,854 --> 00:06:45,805
We will now discuss the deposition
of thin aluminium oxide layers

79
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,804
by atomic layer deposition.

80
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,704
This material is used
for its high dielectric constant

81
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:57,196
in certain microelectronic components,
like capacitors.

82
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:01,455
It can also be used
as a gas diffusion barrier

83
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:05,874
in packaging
and in flexible electronic devices.

84
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:10,888
The deposition temperature
during an ALD process

85
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,899
is typically a few hundred degrees Celsius.

86
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:22,656
ALD is very well suited for deposition
of very thin layers

87
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:27,790
without pinholes and/or for forming
conformal layers

88
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,010
onto microstructured substrates.

89
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,032
In the picture we see
a silicon etched structure

90
00:07:37,032 --> 00:07:45,622
which has been coated
with an aluminium oxide layer by ALD.

91
00:07:48,272 --> 00:07:53,764
Four steps are involved in the deposition
of aluminium oxide by ALD.

92
00:07:54,394 --> 00:08:01,815
The first precursor is tri-methyl aluminium;
this molecule,

93
00:08:02,685 --> 00:08:08,056
which is chemisorpted
onto a silicon substrate

94
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:11,425
that has hydroxyl surface groups.

95
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,646
Methane is a reaction product

96
00:08:16,646 --> 00:08:21,877
that is generated in this step
and is bumped away.

97
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:27,896
Here we see the chemical reaction
that was depicted

98
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,309
in these two schematic illustrations.

99
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:38,267
The reaction chamber is then purged
with inert nitrogen gas,

100
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:44,059
thereby removing
all methane reaction products

101
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,689
and any excess of the precursor TMA.

102
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:55,810
Next the second precursor
water vapor enters the system.

103
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:04,353
The water precursor 
reacts with the TMA at the surface

104
00:09:04,353 --> 00:09:07,853
forming methane byproducts.

105
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:16,364
The reaction chamber is then,
after this reaction, again purged

106
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:22,262
and nitrogen and any excess 
of the water vapor

107
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,144
and the byproducts of the reaction
are removed.

108
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:34,056
One is then left with a surface
of aluminium oxide with hydroxyl groups.

109
00:09:35,886 --> 00:09:40,837
In fact, one has created
one monolayer of aluminium oxide

110
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:45,507
with hydroxyl terminations

111
00:09:45,507 --> 00:09:50,510
so that the next monolayer
deposition process can be executed.

112
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,780
And this process can be repeated
over and over again

113
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,560
many thousands of times.

114
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,971
ALD exists for deposition
of many types of materials.

115
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,551
Here we show two other examples,

116
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:13,602
namely the deposition of titanium nitrite
and the metal ruthenium.

117
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:22,753
The table lists the used
precursor gasses for each case

118
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:27,153
and the temperature for each step.

119
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:34,715
The two pictures below demonstrate
the end result after deposition

120
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:38,615
during 2000 ALD cycles.

121
00:10:39,255 --> 00:10:41,436
So here we see the ruthenium

122
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:45,786
which is covering 
the silicon pillar structure

123
00:10:45,786 --> 00:10:50,828
which was made, in this case,
using an oxide etching mask.

124
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:56,646
And here we see a picture
of a cross-section of the titanium nitrite

125
00:10:56,646 --> 00:11:04,709
on silicon dioxide,
also after 2000 cycles of ALD.

126
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:11,899
Here we show an example
of atomic layer deposition equipment.

127
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:19,971
It is basically a chemical reactor--
if we look inside we see the reaction vessel

128
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:26,628
and one can then lead into this reactor
the different gasses.

129
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:31,541
For this type of reactor
there are seven gas lines

130
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,472
and there is an ozone generator,

131
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:40,563
and of course there is also a pump involved
to evacuate the reactor when needed.

132
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:46,324
In this lesson we have given
a few illustrative examples

133
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:49,063
of CVD-like processes.

134
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:52,775
We have started with oxide formation
on silicon wafers--

135
00:11:52,775 --> 00:11:55,965
my wet and dry thermal oxidation--

136
00:11:55,965 --> 00:12:00,286
at temperatures of about
1000 to 1100 degrees Celsius.

137
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:05,276
Subsequently we have discussed
the atomic layer deposition

138
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:11,058
of aluminium oxide, ruthenium metal
and titanium nitrite.
