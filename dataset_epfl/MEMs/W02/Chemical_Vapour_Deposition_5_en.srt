1
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,425
In the previous lesson we have introduced

2
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:09,721
the concept of velocity 
and concentration boundary layer

3
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:14,057
near a heated substrate during
a chemical vapor deposition process.

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:19,974
Now we will discuss theoretically
what is the gas molecule transport

5
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,267
from the bulk of the flow 
through the boundary layer

6
00:00:23,267 --> 00:00:28,071
towards the substrate.
This transport is key for understanding

7
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:30,574
the growth of the thin film 
on the substrate.

8
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:36,785
We will subsequently present 
a simple model for the CVD film growth.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,757
If we have a heated surface 
of an arbitrary shape

10
00:00:42,547 --> 00:00:45,465
like represented by the pink line,

11
00:00:46,235 --> 00:00:49,325
and if we apply a flow of gas

12
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:56,019
it is already clear that there will be
development of a thermal boundary layer

13
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:01,491
in which the temperature varies;
of a concentration boundary layer

14
00:01:01,491 --> 00:01:06,422
in which the gas concentration varies;
and a velocity boundary layer

15
00:01:06,422 --> 00:01:08,665
in which the velocity varies.

16
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:13,967
For simplicity, we will do here 
a two dimensional treatment

17
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:20,817
and we consider an infinitesimal 
surface element <i>dxdy.</i>

18
00:01:22,427 --> 00:01:27,368
We will consider now 
the transport of gas molecules

19
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:31,441
in and out of such element.

20
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:37,082
This element is again 
drawn here at a bigger scale.

21
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:43,715
The transport can be either by advection--

22
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,775
that is, by an imposed ordered flow--

23
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:50,651
or by diffusion from all sides.

24
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:55,621
If we have somewhere 
in our two dimensional surface element

25
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:59,673
the boundary layer of the heated surface--

26
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:03,693
that means if this element would be here

27
00:02:03,693 --> 00:02:06,798
exactly where the pink line is--

28
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:11,330
then there the gas molecules 
can be annihilated

29
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,349
leading to a deposition event.

30
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:20,136
This expression represents the net rate

31
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:24,156
at which the gas enters
the two dimensional surface element

32
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,534
due to advection in the x-direction.

33
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:35,896
The first term represents 
the transport to the line element <i>dy</i>

34
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:42,563
of our infinitesimal surface element
with <i>rho--</i>the density of the gas--

35
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,833
and <i>u</i>--the transport velocity
in the x-direction.

36
00:02:47,736 --> 00:02:50,653
If we move further in the x-direction

37
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:56,973
to the coordinate <i>x + dx,</i>

38
00:02:57,623 --> 00:03:01,801
we will have here 
the second line element <i>dy</i>

39
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,589
to which the transport by advection 
is possible.

40
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:09,525
Because we have moved 
over the distance <i>dx,</i>

41
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:13,764
the term <i>rho-u</i> can be different.

42
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,327
That is why we write it 
as a variational term,

43
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:21,853
as written here in the square brackets.

44
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:30,483
For describing the diffusion through 
the two dimensional surface element

45
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:34,236
we write Fick's law of diffusion

46
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,026
for the transport 
to the first line element <i>dy.</i>

47
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:44,318
And using a similar 
variational approach as before,

48
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:50,182
the second term describes 
the transport by diffusion

49
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,897
through the second line element <i>dy.</i>

50
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:58,268
Here we have written the net transport 
through the surface element

51
00:03:58,268 --> 00:04:00,847
by diffusion in the x-direction.

52
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:04,564
We can do a similar treatment 
for the y-direction

53
00:04:04,564 --> 00:04:08,687
and we define the advection velocity 
in this direction by <i>v.</i>

54
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:13,393
This gives us eight terms:
four advective terms

55
00:04:13,393 --> 00:04:15,637
and four diffusional terms.

56
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:20,814
The last term in the equation 
describes the annihilation of the mass,

57
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:25,023
which is only non-zero 
when the heated substrate

58
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:27,591
is present in the surface element.

59
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:34,212
Writing all these contributions 
in the the <i>x-</i> and <i>y</i>-direction down,

60
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:38,967
gives us the final equation 
with the two advection terms

61
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:44,921
and the two diffusional terms
and the annihilation term.

62
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:50,813
So this is the equation 
we need to solve in general.

63
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:57,444
Fortunately we can write 
this complex equation in a simplified way

64
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:01,962
by assuming that one is close 
to the surface

65
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:05,072
where there are no advective terms--

66
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:09,412
that means close to the surface
<i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are zero--

67
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:15,189
and by considering that there is 
no lateral variation in <i>x</i>,

68
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:20,837
which is a plausible assumption 
as we have a flat substrate

69
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:27,302
so there is no dependence 
in the <i>x</i>-direction on the gas density.

70
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:33,399
This equation is then simplified 
to this one

71
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:39,711
where we only have a variational term in <i>y</i>
and the annihilation term.

72
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:44,828
The solution of this last equation
is simple.

73
00:05:45,684 --> 00:05:50,956
Immediately at the surface 
where annihilation of the gas can occur--

74
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:56,312
where this term is non-zero--
this gives us a parabolic shape.

75
00:05:56,922 --> 00:06:01,115
Somewhat away from the surface
this term becomes zero

76
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:03,281
and this gives a line.

77
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:10,159
The solution is schematically illustrated 
here in this diagram.

78
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,197
This is the linear solution 
close to the substrate.

79
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:22,836
In reality, we will have a concentration
which gradually approaches

80
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:28,045
the value for the density of the gas
that is far away from the substrate,

81
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,321
as denoted by the full line here.

82
00:06:32,638 --> 00:06:36,326
We now consider that we are 
in equilibrium conditions

83
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:41,398
and that the density of the gas 
near the surface is lower

84
00:06:42,488 --> 00:06:45,999
than the density of the gas far away,

85
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,902
which is logical 
during a deposition process.

86
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:56,101
We can then write 
the gas transfer rate per unit surface

87
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,684
in three dimensions as following.

88
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:03,910
This is the difference between the surface

89
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,142
and the far away concentration of the gas.

90
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:11,352
And this is <i>h-- </i>
the mass transfer coefficient.

91
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:18,034
As close to the surface of the substrate
there are no advective terms,

92
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:21,581
Fick's law of diffusion should apply

93
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:27,623
which, by equalization to this expression,

94
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:32,703
leads to the value for 
the mass transfer coefficient <i>h.</i>

95
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:38,689
We see that <i>h</i> is proportional 
to the diffusion coefficient.

96
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,761
We will now find an expression 
for the diffusion coefficient.

97
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:48,013
If we consider somewhere in the gas plane

98
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:52,886
with a gas density <i>rho</i> minus at the left

99
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:56,906
and a gas density <i>rho</i> plus
at the right of that plane

100
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:02,049
and if <i>v</i> is the molecular velocity,

101
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:05,996
we can write down 
the effective number of molecules

102
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:10,146
flowing through the plane
by this expression.

103
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:12,672
It is the difference between molecules

104
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,982
flowing from left to right 
and right to left.

105
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,620
We can now follow again, 
a variational approach

106
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,274
to write down this difference

107
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:30,884
in which we subsequently equalize 
the variational distance <i>delta x</i> by <i>l,</i>

108
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:34,237
which is the molecular mean free path 
in the gas.

109
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:40,492
Comparing this expression with Fick's law

110
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:44,092
we find that diffusion coefficient

111
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:48,400
is given by the velocity of the molecule

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,022
times the mean free path of the molecule.

113
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:55,717
Here we repeat the expression 
we just found

114
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,722
for the diffusion coefficient.

115
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:02,564
We can write the mean free path in the gas

116
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:07,458
as function of the temperature
and pressure of the gas

117
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,558
using the ideal gas law.

118
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:16,572
And we can write the molecular velocity--
which is here--

119
00:09:16,572 --> 00:09:19,324
by the square root of the thermal energy.

120
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:25,013
This provides then the following expression
for the diffusion coefficient:

121
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:31,882
<i>T^1.5</i> and <i>P^-1.</i>

122
00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:36,424
Therefore the mass transfer coefficient
has the same dependence.

123
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:42,459
We present here again, 
the formula we have found before

124
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,689
for the diffusional flux of molecules 
through the boundary layer.

125
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:53,502
The second formula describes 
the flux of reacted molecules

126
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:57,107
that are consumed by the surface reaction,

127
00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:01,088
with <i>ksurf</i> the surface reaction rate.

128
00:10:02,488 --> 00:10:08,250
In equilibrium both fluxes 
should be the same

129
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,557
and this allows us to find an expression

130
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:16,097
for the gas density at the surface

131
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:20,081
in function of <i>h</i> and <i>ksurf.</i>

132
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:25,172
By substitution in the first formula 
of previous slide,

133
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:30,634
we find the following expression
for the growth rate.

134
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:38,296
If the mass transfer coefficient 
by diffusion is much higher

135
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:43,383
than the surface reaction rate,
we obtain the film growth rate

136
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:47,952
in the reaction-controlled case
from this expression.

137
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:54,441
Under these conditions 
there is no dependence on <i>h</i>

138
00:10:55,271 --> 00:11:00,873
as sufficient gas is provided everywhere
for the reaction to occur.

139
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:08,094
In the opposite case, we have 
diffusion-controlled film growth

140
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:12,262
and this evidently depends on <i>h.</i>

141
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,328
These theoretical findings 
allow us to understand

142
00:11:18,328 --> 00:11:22,521
the Arrhenius-type plot 
for the thin film growth,

143
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,502
which we have already introduced before,

144
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:29,045
with here the exponential 
temperature dependence

145
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:33,681
and here the T^1.5 dependence.

146
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:38,251
Finally on this slide we have plotted

147
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:41,961
a number of experimental data

148
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:46,694
of the growth of silicon 
on a heated substrate.

149
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:50,817
Here one has used silane as a gas

150
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:54,646
and this gas is diluted in hydrogen 
as a carrier gas.

151
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:57,598
The experimental curves

152
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:04,074
indeed are in line with the result
of previous theoretical finding.

153
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,881
In this lesson we have discussed 
gas transport by diffusion

154
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,931
in the boundary layer near the substrate
during a CVD process.

155
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,624
We then have written 
a simplified expression

156
00:12:17,624 --> 00:12:21,189
for the mass transport 
towards the substrate

157
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:23,614
as limited by diffusion.

158
00:12:24,114 --> 00:12:27,664
Finally, assuming equilibrium conditions,

159
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:32,528
we have compared a reaction- 
and diffusion-limited growth rates

160
00:12:32,528 --> 00:12:38,560
which have allowed us to understand
the dependence of CVD film growth rate

161
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,877
as a function of temperature.
