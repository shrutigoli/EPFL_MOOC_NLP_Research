00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:06,904
In the second lesson
on Chemical Vapor Deposition

2
00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:09,974
we will discuss in somewhat more detail,

3
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,535
common types of CVD processes.

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:14,689
First, we will discuss the CVD

5
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:18,369
as operated at different
operating pressures.

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,670
First technique is called
<i>Atmospheric Pressure CVD</i>, or <i>APCVD.</i>

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,200
Then, <i>Sub-atmospheric Pressure CVD,</i>
or <i>SACVD,</i>

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,330
followed by <i>Low Pressure CVD,</i>
or <i>LPCVD,</i>

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,238
and finally, <i>Ultra High Vacuum CVD,</i>
for the lowest pressure used.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,939
Next, we will discuss a technique called
<i>Plasma-enhanced CVD,</i> or <i>PECVD.</i>

11
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:45,003
And finally, the technique 
<i>Metal organic CVD,</i> or <i>MOCVD.</i>

12
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:48,868
This slide is taken from the first lesson

13
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:51,291
and lists again the different
CVD techniques

14
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:54,901
according to the pressure
of the gas used for deposition.

15
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:57,689
The first technique is practice 
at atmospheric pressure.

16
00:00:57,721 --> 00:01:04,540
SACVD is at lower pressure, 
down to 10 millibar.

17
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,138
And low pressure CVD is in between
1 millibar and 0.1 millibar.

18
00:01:10,589 --> 00:01:16,672
While ultrahigh vacuum CVD is using
very high initial vacuum

19
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:18,957
but standard growth 
is typically performed

20
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:22,018
at 10 minus 3 millibar of gas pressure.

21
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:27,728
In atmospheric pressure CVD,
the high pressure of the gas that is used

22
00:01:27,728 --> 00:01:33,426
leads to fast film growth rates. 
Typically microns per minute.

23
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:35,988
This leads to a high consumption of gas

24
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:39,498
and often a carrier or diluent gas is used

25
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,310
like nitrogen or hydrogen.

26
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,345
Typical deposition temperatures

27
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:49,365
are between 350 degrees Celsius
and 1200 degrees Celsius.

28
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:54,529
The technique is used for
growing oxides at lower temperatures

29
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:59,455
and also for the growth of epitaxial
silicon films on silicon substrates

30
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:00,906
at higher temperatures.

31
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,492
At the high temperatures
that are used,

32
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:07,556
film growth is in the
mass transport-limited regime.

33
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:12,150
Therefore gas flow control
and local concentration of the gas

34
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,387
is very important.

35
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:20,340
To enable a good control of the gas flow,
the wafer is placed horizontally

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,014
so that the flow smoothly passes over it
in a very controlled way.

37
00:02:25,587 --> 00:02:28,655
However, not so many wafers
can be used at the same time

38
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:32,696
as the exploitable surface 
in the reactor is basically limited

39
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:34,770
by the area of the heater.

40
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:39,231
As a consequence, the throughput 
of this technique is limited.

41
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:44,170
A possible disadvantage of this technique
is that the reaction may already start

42
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,443
in the gas phase itself,
rather than on the substrate.

43
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,173
So there is formation 
of particles in the gas.

44
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:58,199
This results in deposition
of unwanted precipitates on the wafer.

45
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:03,072
And when continuing the deposition, 
this results in non-uniformities,

46
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:06,262
or pinholes in the deposited film.

47
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:13,274
In sub-atmospheric pressure CVD,
the gas concentration is reduced.

48
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:16,513
And also the deposition rate decreases

49
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:20,343
but due to the larger
mean free path of the gas

50
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:24,042
inhomogeneities 
in the concentration are less important

51
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,558
and more uniform films are grown.

52
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:31,371
Also as the gas molecules have
less probability for interaction,

53
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:35,378
no or very little particles are formed.

54
00:03:35,896 --> 00:03:41,227
Still wafers need to be placed
horizontally occupying a lot of surface

55
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:45,947
and resulting in a relatively low
throughput of the deposition process.

56
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:51,728
In low-pressure CVD, the pressure
of the gas is further reduced,

57
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:56,847
leading to still longer mean free paths, 
and has an increased diffusion.

58
00:03:57,397 --> 00:04:01,019
Also, no gas concentration gradient
is present

59
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,012
perpendicular to the flow direction,

60
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:07,142
except of course the gradient 
that will develop

61
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:11,054
very close to the wafer
where deposition occurs.

62
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:15,592
More uniform films can be deposited
and typical growth temperatures

63
00:04:15,592 --> 00:04:19,633
are in between 400 degrees Celsius 
and 900 degrees Celsius.

64
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,683
Growth of the film
is in the reaction-limited regime,

65
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:27,005
hence a precise temperature control 
is very important

66
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:30,094
because the temperature variation
immediately results

67
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,484
in a changing reaction rate.

68
00:04:32,484 --> 00:04:34,837
Usually the LPCVD technique

69
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:39,355
has 10 to 100 times lower deposition rates
compared to APCVD.

70
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,060
Due to the low pressure and
the resulting homogenous gas conditions,

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,961
wafers can be stacked
vertically in batches,

72
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,961
occupying less horizontal space.

73
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:55,372
Therefore, in LPCVD,
the wafer throughput can be enhanced.

74
00:04:55,972 --> 00:05:00,962
Wafers that are situated
more upstream of the gas flow

75
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:04,166
may be exposed to a
higher concentration of gas

76
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,436
than wafers that are placed
further downstream.

77
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,149
This would result 
in a different film thickness,

78
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,709
but this gas depletion effect
can be compensated

79
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:16,699
by establishing with a heater system,

80
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:22,440
a slightly higher temperature
further downstream of the flow,

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,900
so that the film thickness
becomes uniform.

82
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,986
In ultrahigh vacuum CVD,

83
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:35,459
the molecular mean free path
is as big as the reactor dimension itself.

84
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,930
The gas behaves 
not so much as a viscous liquid

85
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,480
but as a collection 
of individual molecules.

86
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:46,822
There are no gas-phase chemical reactions
and a typical temperature for operation

87
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:50,200
is between 500 and 600 degrees Celsius.

88
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:54,404
Due to the high initial vacuum,

89
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,948
the partial pressure of
contaminant gasses is reduced

90
00:05:57,948 --> 00:06:02,028
so that one can deposit
during longer times at lower temperature

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:06,908
without incorporating too much
impurity molecules in the grown film.

92
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,380
Keeping a low temperature 
during growth

93
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,218
can be important

94
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,838
for sensitive semiconductor 
micro-fabrication processes,

95
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:21,488
where a too high temperature may result
in too high diffusion of active dopants.

96
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:25,248
Plasma-enhanced CVD

97
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:30,558
is based on the LPCVD configuration
we discussed before.

98
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:36,239
The difference is that now 
a radio frequency power can be coupled

99
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:40,891
via two electrodes into the gas.

100
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:48,627
And typically this is done at a frequency
of 400 kilohertz or 13.5 megahertz.

101
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:56,661
The RF power induces a plasma, 
which is a partially ionized gas,

102
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:01,501
containing ions, electrons, 
and neutral excited gas molecules.

103
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,803
It can be perceived in the reactor 
by the gas that is lighting up.

104
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:10,492
The light is caused mostly 
by accelerating free electrons,

105
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:13,606
but all molecules in the plasma 
become agitated

106
00:07:13,606 --> 00:07:16,274
as a result of the applied RF power.

107
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:20,565
As the film growth 
is in the reaction-limited regime,

108
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:26,026
the exponential factor that contains 
the reaction activation energy

109
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:28,130
and the temperature
plays an important role.

110
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:32,248
Schematically, one can imagine 
that without plasma

111
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:37,756
there is initially a gas molecule
that then, by a temperature fluctuation,

112
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:40,586
has to acquire 
sufficient energy

113
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:45,799
to be converted 
to a metal atom in this example.

114
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,772
If now the RF plasma is switched on,

115
00:07:51,772 --> 00:07:57,062
all molecules gain in energy
as indicated on the red curve,

116
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:00,062
so energy goes up everywhere.

117
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,238
As a result,

118
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:05,295
the efective activation energy
for the reaction to occur is lower--

119
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:08,025
the barrier height is lower.

120
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:10,735
This immediately leads
to a thin film growth

121
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:14,364
that becomes possible 
at lower temperatures than before

122
00:08:14,364 --> 00:08:15,654
without the plasma.

123
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:20,706
So in PECVD, deposition is done
typically at lower temperature.

124
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,609
Therefore with this technique

125
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:28,303
substrates do not need to be heated
as much as an LPCVD

126
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:30,563
for the reaction to occur.

127
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:33,153
So one has a wider choice 
of substrate materials.

128
00:08:34,406 --> 00:08:38,663
In this graph we show again the
Arrhenius plot of the film growth rate,

129
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:43,681
indicating the mass transfer controlled
and the reaction controlled regimes.

130
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,642
This was the case without using RF power.

131
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:51,623
We have now switched on the RF power
in the PECVD system

132
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:54,763
and obtained the red curve
for the thin film thickness.

133
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,191
The slope of the red curve 
is not as steep

134
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,954
because the slope gives the
effective activation energy

135
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,404
of the chemical reaction

136
00:09:01,404 --> 00:09:04,365
which is lower for the PECVD deposition.

137
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:09,886
Also one observes that there is a more
appreciable growth rate or film thickness

138
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:14,526
at lower temperatures--
that means at higher 1 over T values.

139
00:09:15,126 --> 00:09:17,959
The last technique that we will
discuss in this lesson

140
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,028
is metal organic CVD, or MOCVD.

141
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:26,958
This technique is also called, 
<i>metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy.</i>

142
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,876
Here one wants to deposit certain metals
from liquid precursor molecules

143
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:35,179
that normally 
are not in the gaseous phase.

144
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:38,852
To lead these molecules to the substrate,

145
00:09:38,852 --> 00:09:42,386
one uses a carrier gas,
like hydrogen,

146
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:46,146
that bubbles 
through the precursor liquid

147
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,499
and in that way one transfers

148
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:51,771
the precursor molecules
towards the substrate.

149
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,263
Here we give an example 
in which trimethylgallium

150
00:09:56,263 --> 00:10:00,149
or trimethylindium 
is transported to the reactor.

151
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:03,241
In parallel there is a line

152
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,616
where the gaseous products
arsine or phosphine

153
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:10,006
can be led to the reactor chamber.

154
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:13,067
Doing so one can deposit 
compound semi-conductors,

155
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,496
like gallium arsenide 
or indium phosphide.

156
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:20,263
Typical growth temperatures 
are between 300 and 500 degrees Celsius.

157
00:10:21,062 --> 00:10:23,753
The vapor pressure 
of the metal-organic source

158
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,094
is a critical parameter

159
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:31,594
and also due to the use
of the very toxic precursor compounds,

160
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:34,883
safety aspects generally
are very important

161
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:37,873
in MOCVD deposition.

162
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:43,552
This video shows 
a typical MOCVD equipment.

163
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:51,763
The MOCVD reactor itself, 
reagent sources, and supply lines

164
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:56,202
are all inside of a cabinet 
that is isolated from the outside

165
00:10:56,202 --> 00:11:00,591
to avoid release of toxic products 
into the environment.

166
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:05,678
One can manipulate
items inside the cabinet

167
00:11:05,678 --> 00:11:10,231
via the use of gloves
that are attached to the cabinet.

168
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,621
We see here an operator
who accesses the inside

169
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:21,205
and in particular he opens
the MOCVD reactor itself

170
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:26,635
to take out a wafer
after a deposition run.

171
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:37,921
In this lesson we have given an overview
of most common CVD processes

172
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,321
as classified by the reactor 
operation pressure.

173
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:45,484
These were atmospheric pressure CVD, 
sub-atmospheric pressure CVD,

174
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:48,372
low pressure CVD,
and ultrahigh vacuum CVD.

175
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,716
We also introduced 
plasma-enhanced CVD,

176
00:11:51,716 --> 00:11:54,570
where the use of RF power results

177
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,218
in a small effective activation energy
for the chemical reaction

178
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,797
so that deposition of the thin film
can take place

179
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:04,227
at lower temperature
than in the LPCVD reactor.

180
00:12:04,227 --> 00:12:07,457
Finally, we introduced 
metal-organic CVD.
