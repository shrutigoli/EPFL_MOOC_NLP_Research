1
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:07,239
Now, we'll have a closer look how
in a clean room the various

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,278
sputter equipment are working.

3
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:13,593
I will show DC, RF,
and Magnetron sputtering.

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:17,701
DC sputtering is one configuration
of a sputtering system

5
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:19,909
shown here on
the right of the slide.

6
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:22,881
As an average sputtering system

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,503
the material target
is placed on the cathode

8
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:29,645
while substrate
is placed on the anode.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,412
To create a plasma,
 a high DC voltage 

10
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:37,124
in the order of 1kV or more,
is applied between the electrodes.

11
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:40,224
This is why we call the system
"DC sputtering".

12
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,469
Usually the anode is grounded

13
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:47,126
and the negative voltage
is applied to the cathode.

14
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:49,254
Atoms that are ejected
from the target

15
00:00:49,372 --> 00:00:53,435
under the bombardment of positive
ions condense on the wafer

16
00:00:53,546 --> 00:00:57,408
there by forming the desired
thin film, like shown here.

17
00:00:59,187 --> 00:01:03,275
The main advantage of this
system is it's relative simplicity.

18
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:06,766
However, it suffers from
two main limitations.

19
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,949
Firstly, the plasma is present in

20
00:01:09,058 --> 00:01:11,683
the entire area between
the electrodes

21
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:15,736
which has the consequence that
this space is filled with electrons 

22
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,144
which are repulsed by
the negative cathode

23
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,607
and collide on the substrate.

24
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,215
As a result, the substrate
substantially heats up

25
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,561
and efficient substrate
cooling is required.

26
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,499
Secondly, it is possible to deposit

27
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:35,773
only electrically conductive
materials with DC sputtering.

28
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:40,682
Indeed, even if electrically
insulating target is used

29
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:43,093
it will charge within
a few milliseconds

30
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:47,297
due to the accumulation of
positive Argon ions on the target.

31
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:50,445
As a result, the plasma would stop.

32
00:01:51,584 --> 00:01:54,334
RF sputtering main difference from
DC sputtering is the way

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,210
how the plasma is created.

34
00:01:56,321 --> 00:02:00,646
As in the case of DC sputtering,
the target is placed on the cathode

35
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,405
to attract the positive ions

36
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:04,864
and the substrate is
placed on the anode.

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,338
The difference is that, here
the plasma is created applying

38
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:12,998
a high frequency RF voltage
between the electrodes.

39
00:02:13,405 --> 00:02:17,730
As you will see in details, using
AC voltage instead of DC voltage

40
00:02:17,816 --> 00:02:20,966
has the main advantage
to avoid target charging

41
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:25,415
and that allows the position of
electrically insulating materials

42
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,799
such a dielectrics.

43
00:02:27,924 --> 00:02:31,924
The key element to it, to this
system using an AC voltage

44
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:35,048
is a self-bias capacitor,
shown here.

45
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:40,878
To enable RF sputtering, the following
three conditions are required.

46
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:44,775
First, avoid target charging

47
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,745
as the cathode where
the target is placed

48
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,754
will alternate between
positive and negative voltages.

49
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,183
Both ions and electrons will
accumulate on the target

50
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:58,158
resulting in a null of
all charge of the target.

51
00:02:58,627 --> 00:03:01,315
However, if the frequency is too low

52
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:04,980
accumulation of ions during
one single negative period

53
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,935
of the signal can be
sufficient to charge the target

54
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:12,515
if it's electrically insulating,
and to terminate the plasma.

55
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:16,114
Using frequencies higher than 50kHz

56
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,123
allows overcoming this throwback
as charging time becomes shorter

57
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,850
than a millisecond, which is
too short to charge the target.

58
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:26,308
Second, it is required to have

59
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:29,418
energetic ions
colliding on the target.

60
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:33,466
If you simply use the AC
voltage to accelerate ions

61
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,765
the energy they will gain
during on cycle is too low

62
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,592
to eject atoms from the target.

63
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:41,334
A solution to overcome this effect

64
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,487
is to use frequencies
larger than 5MHz

65
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:48,843
typically, 5.6MHz, and the capacitor

66
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,905
at the cathode for DC self-bias.

67
00:03:52,262 --> 00:03:54,687
At such high frequencies,
ions cannot follow

68
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:57,278
the RF field anymore,
due to their mass.

69
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:01,567
On the other hand, electrons are
lighter and can follow the RF field.

70
00:04:01,698 --> 00:04:04,898
They will then alternatively
strike the cathode and the anode.

71
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:08,273
However, because of
the capacitor at the cathode

72
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,895
they will accumulate there,
and the cathode will progressively

73
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,963
be negatively biased.

74
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:18,853
This negative DC voltage will
then accelerate positive ions

75
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,405
from the plasma, and enable
the sputtering process.

76
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,087
The third condition is to avoid

77
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:28,508
sputtering of other
surfaces than the target.

78
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,830
For example, avoid having ions
colliding somewhere else

79
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:33,228
than on the target.

80
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:37,279
To do so, the anode must be
larger than the cathode.

81
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:41,345
This result is studied in more
details in the chapter about

82
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,490
dry etching given by my colleague,
professor Martin Heiss.

83
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:48,072
The reason behind is that
having smaller cathode

84
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,503
allows having a larger
potential drop

85
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:53,996
and thus more bombardment,
because of current conservation.

86
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:59,104
In a typical RF sputter system,
the anode and the entire chamber

87
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:02,209
are therefor grounded
to satisfy this condition.

88
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,622
The main advantage of
RF sputtering over DC sputtering

89
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,460
is it's ability to overcome
charging problems

90
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:13,772
and thus to deposit electrically
insulating materials, such as

91
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,230
dielectrics.

92
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:21,236
In addition, electrons oscillating
in the RF field couple the energy 

93
00:05:21,356 --> 00:05:24,856
more efficiently to the plasma,
as a result, compered to

94
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,450
DC sputtering, higher
deposition rates are achieved

95
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:32,132
and lower power consumption
is required in the RF sputtering.

96
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:36,864
However, there's one main drawback
leading to the deposition of

97
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,618
the electrically
insulating materials.

98
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:42,378
These materials are
often poor heat conductors

99
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:47,609
which requires very efficient cooling
of the target during the sputtering.

100
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:53,027
In addition, as for the DC sputtering,
the plasma is not localized

101
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,742
and many electrons hit
the substrate and heat it up

102
00:05:55,864 --> 00:05:59,927
thus substrate cooling
is also required.

103
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
To even further increase
the plasma efficiency 

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,750
and thus the deposition rate

105
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:10,331
magnetron sputtering
systems are introduced.

106
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,350
The added feature
compared to the RF system

107
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:18,454
is the magnet plate behind
the cathode, shown here

108
00:06:19,332 --> 00:06:24,144
which creates a magnetic field,
who's goal is to confide electrons

109
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:28,364
so they stay close to the cathode,
and induce a lot of collisions

110
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:30,668
with argon atoms to ionize them

111
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,244
and contribute to
the spotter process.

112
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,883
Let's have a closer
look how this works

113
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,686
and what it brings.

114
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:42,750
So, let's assume that we
have our target here

115
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:48,867
material that we want to sputter

116
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,740
any metal or dielectric

117
00:06:53,867 --> 00:06:59,592
so we mount our target
on a setup that includes

118
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:02,496
a magnet

119
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:07,837
so, here we have a magnet,
which has magnetic

120
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:10,421
field lines showing like this

121
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,840
and that means we have to
close the magnetic field here

122
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:19,819
here, magnetic field, that are
going into the plasma

123
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,883
and here we have an electron

124
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,880
in this area it will swirl
and follow the field line

125
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:34,266
as schematically show here.

126
00:07:34,643 --> 00:07:36,356
So why is that?

127
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,312
You all know that we have here

128
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,050
the south and north
pole of the magnet

129
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:52,823
and we have here, an electron
that has a certain velocity V

130
00:07:53,937 --> 00:08:01,737
and within the magnetic field B,
that we have then a force

131
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:04,914
that is orthogonal
to the two vectors

132
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:07,061
of the velocity and
the magnetic field 

133
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,522
so that, this electron has
no other choice than spiraling

134
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:17,303
around the magnetic field line,
and follow it, basically.

135
00:08:18,694 --> 00:08:22,806
Due to Lawrence forces,
electrons follow a helical trajectory

136
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:26,719
while ion trajectory is not influenced
because of the higher mass.

137
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:31,489
So, having a magnet behind
the target allows to confide

138
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:33,632
electrons close to the target.

139
00:08:35,337 --> 00:08:38,837
This improves ionization efficiency,
because of the larger amount

140
00:08:38,982 --> 00:08:41,982
of collisions between
Argon atoms and electrons.

141
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:45,749
As a result, it is possible
to use lower voltages

142
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:47,730
and lower pressure, which allows

143
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,791
deposition of film
with higher purity.

144
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:54,041
In addition,
the plasma is localized.

145
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:56,203
This enables higher deposition rates

146
00:08:56,338 --> 00:08:58,825
because of the larger amount of ions

147
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:00,823
impacting the target,
and also

148
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:04,573
decreases substrate heating,
as less electrons collide

149
00:09:04,652 --> 00:09:05,977
on the wafer.

150
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:09,263
On the other hand, the system
becomes more complex

151
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:13,026
and the ware of the target
is non-uniformed.

152
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:16,928
Here on these two photographs
you can see two targets of

153
00:09:17,043 --> 00:09:19,005
a magnetron sputtering tool.

154
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:22,539
The left image shows the target
after some short term usage

155
00:09:22,755 --> 00:09:25,830
where we can start seeing how
the material is being eroded.

156
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,068
On the right photo,
we see a similar target

157
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,783
after extensive use where
a lot of the material

158
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:33,573
has actually been removed.

159
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,936
The pattern shows here
that the ion distribution

160
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,016
has the function of
the magnetic field

161
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:41,154
provided in the magnetron
sputtering tool.

162
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,030
For now we have seen how DC, RF

163
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,604
and magnetron
sputtering are working.

164
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,803
Let's have a closer look
how actually the ions

165
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:51,079
are interacting with
the target material

166
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,554
to be able to remove material

167
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,630
and deposit it on the substrate.
