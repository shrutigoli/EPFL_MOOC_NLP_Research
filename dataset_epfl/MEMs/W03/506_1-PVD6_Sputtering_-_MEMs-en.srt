1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,075
After having seen 
the basic principles 

2
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:09,125
of sputtering and details 
on the film growth,

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,975
let's now present a couple 
of relevant examples

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:15,175
where sputtered films 
are used in MEMs.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,787
At the end of this lesson

6
00:00:16,837 --> 00:00:19,987
I will also show some details 
of the sputtering setup

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,825
 and take you into the clean room

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,325
to see the real tools at work.

9
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,525
At first, application where 

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,037
sputtering is advantageous 

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,025
is the fabrication 
of transparent

12
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:31,737
conductive oxide films

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,250
for photovoltaic solar cells (PV).

14
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:36,912
A photovoltaic solar cell

15
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,225
is a device which transforms light

16
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:40,987
into an electrical current.

17
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,871
In most common solar cells,

18
00:00:43,946 --> 00:00:45,496
the absorbing material

19
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:47,446
 is made of crystalline silicon

20
00:00:47,496 --> 00:00:50,409
contacted with metallic electrodes.

21
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,296
Incoming photons are absorbed

22
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:55,396
in the crystalline silicon layer

23
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:57,746
and generate electron hold pairs. 

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,084
These electron hold pairs

25
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:03,284
are then extracted 
through the electrodes.

26
00:01:03,884 --> 00:01:05,596
Although a simple cell

27
00:01:05,646 --> 00:01:07,509
made of silicon directly contacted 

28
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:09,409
with metallic electrodes could work,

29
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,909
its efficiency would be very low

30
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,759
because of ohmic losses

31
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,359
 in the silicon metal junction

32
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,659
and because of 
the surface recombination

33
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:19,221
of electron holds pair. 

34
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:21,359
To improve the efficiency 

35
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,246
of crystalline silicon solar cells, 

36
00:01:23,446 --> 00:01:25,059
amorphous silicon

37
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:26,059
or alpha silicon

38
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:29,084
and transparent conductive oxide

39
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,146
so-called TCO

40
00:01:30,209 --> 00:01:32,659
are added in between

41
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,609
the active crystalline
silicon area

42
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,159
and the metallic electrodes,

43
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:36,809
in silver.

44
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:40,009
As shown here 
in the right side of the slide.

45
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,373
In this specific example,

46
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,873
two different TCO are considered.

47
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:46,748
First,

48
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,511
the indium tin oxide 

49
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,098
or ITO

50
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,536
is added

51
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:53,636
at the front side of the device

52
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:55,086
where the light comes in.

53
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:56,548
And the second

54
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,948
a zinc oxide aluminum

55
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,761
silicon dioxide alloy,

56
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:02,748
shown here,

57
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,948
is added at the rear 
of the device.

58
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,415
The first call of the TCO

59
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,215
in the photovoltaic solar cells

60
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:12,240
is to decrease ohmic losses

61
00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:14,927
between the electrode 
and the absorbing medium.

62
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,427
However,

63
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,240
TCO also functions
as anti-reflection coatings

64
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,652
at the front of the solar cell,

65
00:02:22,702 --> 00:02:25,977
as well as for infrared light
absorption management

66
00:02:26,052 --> 00:02:27,777
at the rear of the cells.

67
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,266
In order to fabricate cells

68
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,766
with the highest 
efficiency as possible,

69
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:34,728
TCO layers must have

70
00:02:34,803 --> 00:02:36,228
low resistivity,

71
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:38,719
high transparency,

72
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,877
and a low refractive index.

73
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:44,981
To satisfy all these 
three requirements

74
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,156
at the same time

75
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:47,869
it is not that straightforward

76
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,431
by using standard 
thin film materials.

77
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,344
One way to succeed

78
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:54,456
to match all of these properties

79
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:56,481
is, for instance, to add SiO2

80
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:59,244
to zinc oxide aluminum TCO layer

81
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,019
On the right side of the slide,

82
00:03:01,106 --> 00:03:02,881
we can see a TCO layer

83
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:05,756
made of zinc oxide aluminum SiO2

84
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:08,519
in between the silicon
absorbing medium

85
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,319
and the silver rear electrode.

86
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,190
Like shown here.

87
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:16,027
Silicon, the TCO 
and the silver layer

88
00:03:16,918 --> 00:03:18,993
This sputtered composite layer

89
00:03:19,043 --> 00:03:22,268
allowed for tuning 
the optoelectronic properties

90
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,031
and for improving the PV efficiency.

91
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:27,643
Let's see in the next slide

92
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:29,643
how this film is actually made. 

93
00:03:30,542 --> 00:03:33,542
To deposit a zinc oxide 
aluminum SiO2 layer

94
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:36,167
cool sputtering 
of zinc oxide aluminum

95
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:37,930
and SiO2

96
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:38,955
is performed.

97
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:40,780
As shown here,

98
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,167
two targets 

99
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,592
are used within the same

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,467
vacuum deposition chamber. 

101
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:49,444
Tuning the voltage

102
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:50,544
on each target

103
00:03:50,594 --> 00:03:51,869
enables to change 

104
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,644
the zinc oxide aluminum SiO2 ratio

105
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:55,894
into film.

106
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:57,719
Formed here on the substrate.

107
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,588
And thereby to adjust 
the film microstructure

108
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:03,038
and refractive index.

109
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,699
The more SiO2 we add,

110
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:08,212
the less crystalline 
becomes the material

111
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,299
and the lower
is the refractive index.

112
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,589
In this concrete example,

113
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,002
sputtering enables

114
00:04:14,027 --> 00:04:16,902
the deposition of two compounds 
at the same time

115
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,627
and thereby tuning 
the final stoichiometry

116
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:21,164
of the deposited film.

117
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:22,991
Such a performance

118
00:04:23,028 --> 00:04:24,766
is impossible to achieve

119
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,628
with thermal evaporation.

120
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:27,981
The fabricated films

121
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,881
exhibit high transparency
and low refractive index.

122
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:34,252
Three different coatings 
are shown here.

123
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,315
First, on the left,

124
00:04:36,365 --> 00:04:40,440
the zinc oxide aluminum film 
without addition of SiO2.

125
00:04:41,551 --> 00:04:44,326
And then with increasing 
SiO2 concentration.

126
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,134
It shows that 
the texture is changing

127
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,747
towards less grainy morphology.

128
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,947
The same time,

129
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:55,547
the solar cell efficiency
 increases by 20%

130
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:56,822
in the infrared

131
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:59,534
when using 
the zinc oxide aluminum SiO2

132
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,184
TCO layer

133
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:02,747
at the rear of the device.

134
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:05,309
Instead of a standard 
zinc oxide aluminum layer.

135
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,897
For further details

136
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,134
let's have a look 
at this cited paper.

137
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:13,609
Our second thin film 
example of interest

138
00:05:13,672 --> 00:05:16,109
is based on piezoelectric materials,

139
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,034
that are often deposited 
by reactive sputtering.

140
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,909
Piezoelectric materials 
are very important 

141
00:05:21,984 --> 00:05:24,197
and used in many MEMs devices

142
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,959
such as ultrasound transducers,

143
00:05:25,997 --> 00:05:27,722
that means the devices

144
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:30,684
 that converts a pressure wave
into an electrical signal.

145
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,534
Or mass sensors,

146
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:36,047
where the mass change induces 
a resonance frequency shift.

147
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:38,322
And bulk acoustic wave filters.

148
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,672
For this latter application,

149
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,597
suspended 
piezoelectric microstructures

150
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,872
are sandwiched between electrodes.

151
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:48,388
When an incoming electrical signal

152
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:51,076
which matches the mechanical
resonance frequency

153
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:53,338
of one of the microstructures

154
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,226
is applied to the input electrodes,

155
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:58,176
the device enters into 
a mechanical resonance

156
00:05:58,226 --> 00:06:00,751
and an electrical 
signal is transmitted 

157
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,338
to the output electrode.

158
00:06:02,849 --> 00:06:03,962
Typically,

159
00:06:04,024 --> 00:06:06,337
bulk acoustic wave filters

160
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:08,049
are made of aluminum nitrate;

161
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,537
because of the excellent

162
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:11,962
 electroacoustic properties 
of this material 

163
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:14,162
and its chemical compatibility 

164
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:16,374
with micro-fabrication processes.

165
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,263
The quality of the filter

166
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:19,225
 is determined by 

167
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:21,850
the piezoelectric 
film crystal structure.

168
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,800
Reactive sputtering 
with an aluminum target

169
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,388
in a nitrogen atmosphere

170
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,013
is used to deposit 
the aluminum nitrate film.

171
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,000
As it is the only deposition method

172
00:06:31,075 --> 00:06:31,800
which allows

173
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,638
 for high film quality 
below 500° C.

174
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:36,167
However,

175
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,655
the film crystal structure

176
00:06:37,692 --> 00:06:40,255
is highly dependent 
on the underlying seed layer.

177
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,792
Film growth structure and stresses 

178
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:45,692
are explained in details 
in the film growth lesson.

179
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,592
In the case of bulk 
acoustic by-filters 

180
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,579
this underlying seed layer

181
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,679
consists either of 
the platinum bottom electrode.

182
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,967
Shown here.

183
00:06:56,029 --> 00:06:58,142
Or of a silicon dioxide layer.

184
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:01,010
Indeed,

185
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:03,773
the platinum electrode is 
patent and away for surface,

186
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,973
 prior to the aluminum
 nitrate deposition,

187
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,510
is thus made 
of two different materials,

188
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,610
platinum and SiO2.

189
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,585
As you can see 
here on the right,

190
00:07:12,635 --> 00:07:14,010
the aluminum nitrate

191
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:16,623
deposited on top of platinum,

192
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,210
has very defined 
crystalline structure,

193
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,989
compared to the aluminum nitrate

194
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,276
that grows on top of the SiO2

195
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,233
which is less uniform.

196
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:28,570
In addition,

197
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:31,133
the residual stress 
of aluminum nitrate

198
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,245
grown on platinum seed layer

199
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:34,295
is also lower

200
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:36,695
 in the order of 200 MPa,

201
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,220
tensile stress,

202
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,670
versus minus 700 MPa,

203
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,745
compressive stress,
respectively on the SiO2.

204
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:47,408
For the challenge here 
is to optimize crystallinity 

205
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,095
of the overall film

206
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,320
in order to acquire 

207
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:53,045
the best piezoelectric 
properties as possible.

208
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:57,089
Here is one further example

209
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:59,164
which illustrates how sputtering 

210
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,302
enables the manufacturing of MEMs.

211
00:08:01,377 --> 00:08:02,627
In this case,

212
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,927
we are depositing 
a silicon thin film

213
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:06,252
by sputtering

214
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:08,989
and followed by 
lithography and etching.

215
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,352
Many suspended 
microstructures are made 

216
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:16,027
of low-pressure chemical 
vapor deposition (LPCVD)

217
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:17,177
polysilicon.

218
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,052
Because of the 
well-characterized 

219
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:21,077
mechanical properties of polysilicon

220
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,064
and because of the residual stress

221
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,802
in thin films deposited by LPCVD

222
00:08:25,864 --> 00:08:26,852
can be tuned.

223
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,027
However,

224
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:29,764
the LPCVD process

225
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:32,502
requires temperatures
higher than 600° C.

226
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:35,127
And is thus not the most compatible.

227
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,397
Building the MEMs device

228
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:40,934
directly on top of a CMOS circuitry 

229
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,672
to control a MEMs device, however,

230
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,934
would increase a device performance 

231
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,334
as well as its functionality.

232
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,558
Indeed,

233
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,695
having signal amplification

234
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,495
close to the signal source

235
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,908
allows decrease in the noise,

236
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,283
and on-chip multiplexes

237
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:03,683
enables the dense integration 
of a large number of devices.

238
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:06,633
We thus look for a low temperature,

239
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:09,333
silicon deposition technique,

240
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,820
and use sputtering
instead of CVD.

241
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,852
Tuning the pressure 

242
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:17,089
and power of the sputtering process,

243
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,964
and performing a post-annealing

244
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,664
at 350° C,

245
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:24,577
allows depositing up to 2 μm thick

246
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,189
silicon films

247
00:09:26,277 --> 00:09:29,439
with residual stresses 
lower than 100 MPa.

248
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,218
In addition to be 
the most compatible,

249
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:36,055
such a process can also be performed

250
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:39,255
on a polymeric 
or organic sacrificial layer.

251
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:40,605
As a result,

252
00:09:40,693 --> 00:09:42,318
suspended silicon structures

253
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:44,905
can be fabricated
on top of CMOS circuitry

254
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:46,793
using a dry relief process

255
00:09:46,868 --> 00:09:48,443
in oxygen plasma

256
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:50,168
to remove the sacrificial layer.

257
00:09:51,077 --> 00:09:52,827
This process is much simpler

258
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:56,327
than the usual SiO2
sacrificial layer using HF,

259
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:57,677
wet release,

260
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,677
and critical point drying process.

261
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,521
An example of a sputtered 
silicon microstructure

262
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:07,859
suspended with 4 springs 
next to its CMOS circuitry

263
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:09,584
is shown here.

264
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:11,009
The silicon plates,

265
00:10:11,096 --> 00:10:13,334
shown here in the magnification,

266
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:16,134
is electrostatically actuated

267
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,009
and its deflection is quantified

268
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:20,534
measuring the change of capacitance

269
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,159
with a dedicated 
on-chip CMOS amplifier.

270
00:10:23,234 --> 00:10:24,359
Like, shown here.

271
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:27,559
And like it is nowadays integrated 

272
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:30,421
in many state of the art 
commercial MEMs.

273
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:33,926
Here is an example

274
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:35,489
of a cluster sputtering tool

275
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:36,614
from our green room.

276
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:38,801
A load-lock system. 

277
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,726
Here.

278
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,189
Enables to load the way
first into the tool,

279
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,430
without venting 
the deposition chambers themselves.

280
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:49,942
This way

281
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,142
pumping time is shorter

282
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,780
and there is
less contamination

283
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,217
of the deposition chambers

284
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,830
with gaseous atmospheric components.

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,455
A robotic arm,

286
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:01,417
located in the central chamber,

287
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,617
automatically moves 
the way for the load-lock,

288
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:05,942
here,

289
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,717
into one 
of the 4 deposition chambers.

290
00:11:09,742 --> 00:11:11,092
Shown here.

291
00:11:11,513 --> 00:11:14,288
Each chamber has 
a different target of material,

292
00:11:14,313 --> 00:11:17,751
which enables serial 
deposition of multiple materials 

293
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:21,151
without venting the sample 
in between each deposition. 

294
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:24,913
This is an advantage 
when the deposited material 

295
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:28,038
are very sensitive to native oxides,
for instance.

296
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,088
To conclude this chapter

297
00:11:30,138 --> 00:11:31,151
about sputtering,

298
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,663
let's now have a look

299
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:35,026
how such a system 

300
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,901
really works in reality.

301
00:11:36,926 --> 00:11:39,213
So let's come together 
in the clean room.
