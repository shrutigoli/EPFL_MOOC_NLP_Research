1
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:07,144
In this lesson I will introduce
the second PVD technique 

2
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,929
that is called sputtering,
and which allows for a whole 

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,950
variety of thin film
materials to be deposited.

4
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:15,692
In fact many more than
thermal evaporation.

5
00:00:16,078 --> 00:00:19,815
I will first show some basic
principal how plasma is created

6
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,066
for our purposes show
the different plasma zones

7
00:00:23,164 --> 00:00:27,026
in the sputter chamber, and how to
optimize it for efficient sputtering

8
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,738
and also introduce the Paschen law.

9
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:34,097
The goal of the sputter process
is to remove physical material

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:38,074
from the target and deliver
it to the substrate a wafer.

11
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:40,830
This is done by ion
bombardment in the plasma.

12
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,637
Ions that hit the target
with sufficient energy

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,638
eject atoms from the target.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,365
These atoms are then deposited
as a thin film on the wafer

15
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,357
placed adjacent to the target.

16
00:00:51,532 --> 00:00:53,032
So how is this done exactly?

17
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,641
Let's have a look.

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,953
First the air is pumped out of
the chamber to create a vacuum.

19
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:03,768
Shown here, this is the chamber
with the vacuum pump

20
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:07,081
that evacuates this are from air.

21
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:14,171
That chamber is then filled with Argon,
an inert gas until the pressure reaches

22
00:01:14,304 --> 00:01:18,566
values in the order of a couple
of hundreds of milliliter.

23
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:22,786
A plasma is then created
by applying the high voltage

24
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:28,422
of about 1500V between
two electrodes, shown here.

25
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:35,742
The positive Argon ions in blue
are accelerated towards the cathode 

26
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:39,858
which is the negatively
charged electrode

27
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,996
and hits the target here,
so the target, in this case

28
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,558
we choose Gold as a material

29
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:49,396
and here's the wafer on which
we want to deposit the gold.

30
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,456
The target is in fact made
of the material that we want

31
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:57,441
to deposit, and it's mounted
directly onto the cathode.

32
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,906
With the impact energy, atoms are

33
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,758
ejected from the target,
here in yellow

34
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:10,275
travel through the plasma,
and finally deposit on the wafer

35
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,836
as a thin film.

36
00:02:14,938 --> 00:02:19,513
Sputtering allows all kinds of
materials including metals, compounds

37
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,153
as well as refractory materials.

38
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,768
The deposited thin film has
a generally good adhesion

39
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,678
and excellent step coverage.

40
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,337
We will come to these
details later in this lecture.

41
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:33,607
Let's have a short look what

42
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:36,626
plasma is and how it
works for out purpose here.

43
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:39,437
Plasma is defined as
partially ionized gas

44
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:41,543
that is neutral,
and thus has the same

45
00:02:41,623 --> 00:02:43,598
number of ions and electrons.

46
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:47,178
It is commonly also referred to
as the fourth state of matter.

47
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,742
By the way, plasma is also
used for dry etching processes

48
00:02:50,834 --> 00:02:52,959
that my colleague Martin Gijs will

49
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:55,634
cover in detail in his
corresponding lesson.

50
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:59,185
The simplest form of plasma
for out purposes, the DC plasma

51
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:01,364
it is created as follows.

52
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:06,527
First, the chamber is pumped down
and filled with Argon gas to reach

53
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,272
at the position, pressure in
the order of 10 to 100 mTorr.

54
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:16,871
Shown here, some Argon
atoms in the chamber.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,995
Second, a DC voltage can be
applied between these two electrodes

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,099
shown here.

57
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,840
With the terminal resistance,
and here the potential that

58
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:41,161
can be applied to
the cathode and the anode.

59
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:45,843
At low voltages, the only measurable
current comes from so called

60
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:47,824
"background ionization".

61
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,935
Which is always present,
but often negligible. 

62
00:03:51,787 --> 00:03:55,287
The region of this background
ionization comes, for example

63
00:03:55,383 --> 00:04:01,245
from a photon that hits
one of the Argon atoms

64
00:04:01,385 --> 00:04:03,547
and ionizes it.

65
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,872
The result of this ionization
is that we get an electron

66
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,816
and an Argon ion.

67
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,578
This current is very low, and
the voltage on the electrodes

68
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,715
is about the same as
the voltage of the source

69
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,851
as there's nearly no
voltage drop over Rs.

70
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:29,425
If you increase the voltage,
the current first remains constant

71
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:33,417
since the voltage does not effect
the background ionization.

72
00:04:33,953 --> 00:04:39,053
We can draw here a typical curve
how this current increases if you

73
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:41,831
increase the potential
between the electrodes.

74
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:44,991
The slight increase,
but not very drastic

75
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:48,410
because it's only based
on the available ions

76
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,535
due to the background ionization.

77
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,418
When the voltage is further
increased over 600V

78
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,952
approaching 1kV, depending
on the gas and the pressure

79
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,494
electrons and ions resulting
from the background ionization

80
00:05:01,604 --> 00:05:05,054
gain enough energy
to ionize other atoms.

81
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,744
So this electron, for instance,
can ionize  this Argon atom

82
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,904
which would release another atom,
and be able to release another

83
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,793
Argon ion.

84
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:25,606
As a result the current increases
exponentially with the voltage. 

85
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:32,543
So, now we're increasing
the current drastically

86
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,041
for the given voltage.

87
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,220
The regime described here is called

88
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,486
"Dark discharge" as
no light is generated.

89
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,859
It is not used for micro
fabrication applications

90
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:47,981
as plasma in this regime
is not energetic nor stable.

91
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,550
When the electric field
between the two electrodes

92
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:55,242
is further increased,
breakdown of the gas occurs.

93
00:05:55,593 --> 00:05:58,731
The medium becomes ionized,
and an avalanche of inelastic

94
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:01,847
collisions between
electrons and ions appear.

95
00:06:03,292 --> 00:06:07,279
So now, even argon atoms
that have not been ionized

96
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:11,483
by the background radiation,
can be ionized by the strong

97
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:16,131
electric field between the two,
cathode and anode.

98
00:06:16,225 --> 00:06:23,363
So, one can create here electrons,
and here Argon ions

99
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:30,528
with all available Argon
atoms in the chamber.

100
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:36,412
And this is creating an avalanche
effect, because they can then

101
00:06:36,532 --> 00:06:39,619
ionize other Argon
atoms that are available.

102
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,095
That means we suddenly
have a very strong current

103
00:06:44,265 --> 00:06:47,927
that can be installed between
the cathode and the anode.

104
00:06:48,947 --> 00:06:52,010
So, this is also shown here
in the curve, where we now

105
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:58,310
get a very strong current, up to
a couple of hundred milliamperes 

106
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,442
but with the drop in the voltage.

107
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:06,785
Indeed, as the current increases
the voltage drop in the source

108
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:09,187
resistance becomes very important.

109
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:13,006
When Argon ions
collide on the cathode

110
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,598
secondary electrons

111
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:19,623
are ejected and sustain the plasma.

112
00:07:20,263 --> 00:07:23,638
Without these electrons,
 the plasma would rapidly vanish.

113
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,543
Finally, the plasma
reaches a steady state

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,900
and the loss and gain
of electrons is equal.

115
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:38,681
In this regime electrons have
enough energy to excite atoms

116
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:42,752
to an energy level where they emit
light when they are relaxed to

117
00:07:42,887 --> 00:07:44,574
a lower energy level.

118
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:49,109
The plasma is luminous, and this
regime is called "Glow discharge".

119
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:52,002
This regime plasma is
stable and energetic enough

120
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:54,377
to be used in micro
fabrication technology

121
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,469
ideal for sputtering or for etching.

122
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,685
Typically to achieve this regime,
a voltage of about 1.5kV

123
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,034
is applied between
electrodes separated by 15cm

124
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:09,132
which results in the electric
field in the order of 100V/cm.

125
00:08:09,938 --> 00:08:14,038
In this photograph we can see
the glow of plasma in one

126
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,654
of out sputter equipment.

127
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,827
We will see more of this later
when we go and see how

128
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:20,277
the equipment looks like.

129
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:24,205
Electrons and ions
don't have the same mass.

130
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:27,344
Electrons are lighter and
thus have a higher mobility

131
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,443
than an accelerated field gradient.

132
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:34,818
As a result, in a plasma
ions and electrons

133
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,836
don't move at the same
speed which creates

134
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,772
positively and negatively
charged areas.

135
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:45,684
Consequently,  electric field is
not constant along the plasma

136
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,959
and the electron energy varies
and creates the bright

137
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:54,506
and dark areas, as shown here
this light on the upper right side.

138
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:58,806
And we have the plasma chamber with
the cathode and the anode

139
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,165
in different zones in the plasma
due to the different mobility

140
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,456
of ions and electrons.

141
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,325
For more details about plasma
zones please have a look

142
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,306
at the accompanying documents.

143
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:16,947
Bright areas are called glow, and
dark areas are called dark space.

144
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:21,674
In the practical setup
for sputtering or etching

145
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,604
the distance between the two
electrodes is rather small.

146
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,978
In the order of 15cm,
as we have seen before.

147
00:09:30,326 --> 00:09:34,501
This is the showing of the chamber,
the cathode and the anode

148
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:36,969
and the plasma in between.

149
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:41,396
As a result, the anode, which is
the positive electrode

150
00:09:41,518 --> 00:09:44,068
is placed in the negative glow.

151
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:49,608
Therefore, the plasma column
can be simplified from here to here

152
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:53,974
and only the cathode dark
space the negative glow

153
00:09:54,116 --> 00:09:57,116
and the anode dark space subsists.

154
00:09:58,251 --> 00:10:02,513
Negative glow, cathode dark space,
and the anode dark space.

155
00:10:03,444 --> 00:10:07,732
The potential changes very
abruptly close to the electrodes

156
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:12,350
in the plasma sheets and it's constant
in the glow region of the plasma.

157
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:13,861
As shown here.

158
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,629
There is a very steep slope
of the potential difference

159
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:23,392
of the cathode into
the plasma vacuum

160
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:26,899
then the plateau
where's the glow area

161
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:31,061
and here again a steep slope,
and the approach to the anode.

162
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:33,280
And these are the two plasma sheets.

163
00:10:34,003 --> 00:10:37,340
The origin of this plasma sheet
has realized the computation

164
00:10:37,427 --> 00:10:41,414
of the potential, along the plasma
is studied in more details in

165
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:43,241
the chapter about dry etching.

166
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,770
The required voltage to initiate
the break down of the gas

167
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:52,235
and create the plasma,
depends on three main parameters.

168
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:55,645
Which are the pressure,
the inter-electrode distance

169
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,921
and some gas properties.

170
00:10:58,344 --> 00:11:01,819
This was firs observed by
Paschen who found out that

171
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:05,798
the breakdown voltage could be
plotted as a function of the product

172
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:09,748
between the pressure and
the inter-electrode distance.

173
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,333
It results in an asymmetric
parabola with a minimum

174
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:17,151
at a specific Pd product,
like shown here.

175
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:24,050
Here we have a typical curve,
for an example gas like Argon

176
00:11:24,724 --> 00:11:32,424
every plot, the breakdown voltage,
and the plasma is breaking down

177
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:35,893
as the function of the product of
the pressure and the distance.

178
00:11:36,956 --> 00:11:41,593
Paschen has found that this
curve in fact can be expressed

179
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:44,852
by an equation that is shown here

180
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:50,149
which gives the breakdown voltage
as a function of parameters like

181
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:54,536
for example, the pressure
and the electrode distance

182
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:58,992
as we already know, times
an empirical constant which is

183
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:05,385
observed experiment, and then
as a function of the secondary

184
00:12:05,486 --> 00:12:08,261
electron emission
coefficient at the cathode

185
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,761
which plays an important role.

186
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:15,473
Here, three example gases
with the breakdown voltage

187
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:19,425
for a given value of
pressure and distance.

188
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:25,448
On the left side of the curve minimum,
one needs a higher voltage to reach

189
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:30,077
breakdown because there are less
molecules between the electrodes

190
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:33,019
available for the reaction.

191
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:38,087
As a result, when the gas, atom,
or a gas molecule is ionized

192
00:12:38,234 --> 00:12:40,959
free electrons reach
the anode without colliding

193
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:44,008
with other gas molecules,
and they are lost.

194
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,513
For the breakdown of the gas
to occur, higher voltages

195
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:49,916
have to be applied in order
to increase the number

196
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:52,776
of free electrons and thus
the probability of collisions

197
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:54,443
with other molecules.

198
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:58,536
However, on the right side
of the minimum of this curve

199
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,354
we have another exact for
the breakdown voltage

200
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,010
to increase again.

201
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:06,318
Now, due to the large
number of gas molecules

202
00:13:06,438 --> 00:13:10,101
between the electrodes, electron
molecule collisions become

203
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:15,248
more frequent and electrons
mean free path becomes shorter.

204
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:19,068
As a result, electrons don't
gain enough kinetic energy

205
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:23,286
to ionize other gas molecules
when colliding with them, unless

206
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:26,125
the higher potential is applied.

207
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:31,089
For reach gas, the minimum breakdown
voltage and the corresponding Pd

208
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:32,854
product is different.

209
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,807
These values depend on
the gas molecules, mean free path

210
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:42,041
the ionization potential and the speed
that the gas molecules can recapture

211
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:44,796
electrons after they
have been ionized.

212
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:48,327
Numerical values for the most
common gases are given

213
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:51,919
in the table here at the bottom,
right of the slide

214
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:56,687
but values for many other gases
can be found in the reference book.

215
00:13:57,401 --> 00:14:01,251
For sputtering, it's not always
favorable to work at the minimum

216
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:05,004
breakdown voltage. Indeed,
it is more important

217
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,954
to work with lower pressures

218
00:14:07,076 --> 00:14:09,663
and thus with a higher
breakdown voltage

219
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:14,255
in order to have energetic ions
striking the cathode and removing

220
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:18,777
atoms that can be deposited
as a thin film on the wafer.

221
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:23,607
For now we have seen some
basic physical principles

222
00:14:23,703 --> 00:14:27,391
behind sputtering,
about how to create a plasma

223
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:28,857
and the Paschen's law.

224
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:32,612
For now, let's have a look
at the three main implementations

225
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:37,990
of sputter technique that is the DC,
RF, and Magnetron sputtering.
