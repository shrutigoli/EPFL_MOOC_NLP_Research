1
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:06,954
In this lecture, I will show you how
we can form

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:09,861
a high quality thin film 
on a substrate. 

3
00:00:10,055 --> 00:00:13,818
You may remember the case study of 
the bimorph thermal actuator beam

4
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:17,265
where we deposited a 500 Nanometer 
thick layer of chromium 

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,898
on a SiO2 silicon wafer. 

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,861
Such thin films in metals 
are deposited by so-called 

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,751
physical vapor deposition 
or PVD. 

8
00:00:25,965 --> 00:00:29,614
In this lecture, you will learn 
the basics of vacuum evaporation.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,425
I will start by showing 
the physical principle,

10
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:35,464
then show how the equipment 
looks like, and finally 

11
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,348
present some examples. 

12
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:40,786
Don't confuse thermal evaporation 
with spattering,

13
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:43,479
which is anther PVD method 
and that will be shown 

14
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,070
in the subsequent lessons 
part two. 

15
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,872
So in this first part, 
let's have a look 

16
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:53,981
at thermal evaporation, 
also called vacuum evaporation.

17
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:58,308
I will introduce the topic 
and show how the vapor is created. 

18
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:02,301
So how do we get from the source
of metal to a well controlled

19
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:06,959
thin film on the wafer
like shown here in grey. 

20
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:09,813
This is done by so called 
evaporation.

21
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:12,680
Let's take gold as an example.

22
00:01:12,917 --> 00:01:16,817
Evaporation occurs when the atoms 
of the evaporant

23
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:20,259
achieves sufficient energy 
to overcome the solid 

24
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,841
and liquid binding forces 
and enter the gas phase. 

25
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,218
By drawing here. 

26
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:31,794
This is physically achieved 
by heating the material,

27
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:34,879
but just heating is not enough
for our purpose

28
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,644
even at very high 
as you will see. 

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,772
In this process, we have to consider
three distinct phases as follows. 

30
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:46,000
First of all, how is the vapor 
created?

31
00:01:46,761 --> 00:01:51,849
Second, how the vapor flux
is directed towards the substrate?

32
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:57,098
And third, how the material 
condensates on the substrate 

33
00:01:57,321 --> 00:01:59,683
to form a thin film. 

34
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:03,064
So let's look at these steps 
one by one in detail now. 

35
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,406
As said, we will set gold 
as an example material 

36
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,284
but everything applies 
to other materials as well, 

37
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:12,476
just with different parameters 
and specificities.  

38
00:02:13,957 --> 00:02:16,919
The transformation of a material 
from condensed phase,

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,707
either solid or liquid into vapor 
is described 

40
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:22,106
by the Hertz-Knudsen equation.

41
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,805
In fact, it was found 
experimentally that the vapor flux e

42
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,451
is proportional to difference 
between Pv and P.

43
00:02:31,636 --> 00:02:33,336
Where Pv is still at equilibrium,

44
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:36,600
 vapor pressure of the evaporant 
at temperature t,

45
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,871
and P is the reactor pressure. 

46
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:42,047
It further depends on a series 
of parameters 

47
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:45,173
that are all listed here below. 

48
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,273
Another convenient way to quantify 
the deposition parameters

49
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,401
is to use the evaporation mass flux
in gamma,

50
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:55,029
which is the vapor flux 
multiplied by the molar mass

51
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,481
divided by the Avogadro number. 

52
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:01,454
It was found that the evaporation 
rate does not increase further

53
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,716
by supplying more heat unless 
the equilibrium vapor pressure

54
00:03:04,907 --> 00:03:07,594
is also increased by this action.

55
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,499
Thus, there is a maximum 
evaporation rate set by Pv

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,830
and can only be achieved in a vacuum
where P approaches 0. 

57
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:19,146
For highest vapor's flux, 
one therefore operates 

58
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:23,096
the evaporation in a vacuum chamber
and by heating up 

59
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:25,108
the material in the Crucible. 

60
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,734
Another advantage to operate 
in a vacuum is to avoid

61
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:32,528
any contamination of the evaporant
with residual gases. 

62
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:36,028
Please note that according 
to the formula, 

63
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:39,015
heating up should actually 
decrease the flux 

64
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:42,591
because T is in the denominator
but this is compensated 

65
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,861
by the fact that Pv 
also increases with T. 

66
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:52,021
There are various ways to hit up
the materials to evaporate.

67
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:55,142
One simple way to wrap 
some evaporant material 

68
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,600
around a tungsten wire 
like shown here 

69
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:01,668
but which has a limited source
lifetime.

70
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,915
Therefore, one typically places 
the evaporant material

71
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:10,167
in a so-called crucible or boat,
which is made of  a robust material

72
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,846
that resist very high temperature, 
meaning that 

73
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:15,222
it is not evaporating itself.

74
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:19,019
Heating can be achieved
by passing a current

75
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:22,573
either around the bolt
or by directly passing a current

76
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,292
through the crucible that warms up
and evaporates anti-metal. 

77
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,995
This technique is simple, 
but has the drawback

78
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:33,826
that there's a possible risk of 
alloy formation and contamination

79
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:36,734
if we heat the entire container. 

80
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,215
Therefore another way 
has  been developed which is based

81
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,389
on the use of an electron beam
to create the current 

82
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:44,546
that heats up the evaporant. 

83
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:48,513
So assuming here is 
an electron emitter,  

84
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:53,149
with a corresponding anode
that accelerates the electrons, 

85
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:56,916
now the electrons are...

86
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,387
have a trajectory 
that can be controlled

87
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:05,607
by a magnetic field so that the heat
the metallic target

88
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,970
enclose the current look.

89
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:12,729
So this induces the heat that melts
the metal in the crucible.

90
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:16,888
By changing magnetic field, 
one can scan the electron beam

91
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,980
to uniformize the heat generation 
on this molten metal. 

92
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:26,219
On the photograph you see nicely,
and the  electron beam 

93
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,170
coming from the left and heating 
the molten metal here,

94
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,007
in this, the crucible.

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,592
The size of this crucible 
is in the order of four centimeters.

96
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,089
The library of materials that can 
be evaporated 

97
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,621
is quite extensive and includes 
not only refectory metals

98
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,204
but also dielectric 
and organic material.  

99
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,609
See the accompanying documents 
for an overview

100
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:53,694
 of operation material and their 
corresponding specific parameters. 

101
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,854
On the left, you can see a crucible
with the electron's source. 

102
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,261
If we use it in our 
cleaning room operator, 

103
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,799
the typical size of the crucible 
here, shown here 

104
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,420
is about 40 millimeter and may 
depend on the equipment parameters.

105
00:06:11,623 --> 00:06:14,424
In the center you can see 
three optical images 

106
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,996
showing different materials 
being heated with the electron beam.

107
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,646
This images has been taken
from outside the vacuum chambers 

108
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,675
through a glass window. 

109
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:26,645
It is worthwhile mentioning that
each material

110
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:28,772
 has a very different structure 
in the crucible. 

111
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:33,025
For instance, SiO2 is forms 
of beads shown here 

112
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:36,119
with gold and silver, 

113
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:39,984
are completely molten 
under the e-beam current. 

114
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:42,937
This photo shows for instance
how gold looks like

115
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:46,194
as evaporant material when it 
is placed in the crucible

116
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,625
before it is heated and molten. 

117
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:51,608
Atoms leaving the evaporant's source
into the vacuum 

118
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:53,870
follow straight line paths 
until  they collide 

119
00:06:54,032 --> 00:06:56,482
with other guards molecules 
or strike the substrate

120
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:58,882
or the wall of chamber, 
condense there, 

121
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:00,537
and form a solid thin film. 

122
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,999
In Kinetic theory, one can define 
a distance that an object travels

123
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,266
between collisions with other 
moving objects.

124
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:10,558
This leads a mean free path, 
expression of lambda 

125
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,582
that is shown here, which primarily 
depends on the gas viscosity 

126
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:17,804
to molar mass, 
and last but not least, 

127
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,821
on the reactor pressure. 

128
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:23,862
So if we have less collisions, 
that means the deposit 

129
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:25,561
is more directional. 

130
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:28,258
This is one of the primarily 
characteristic

131
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,961
 of the vacuum evaporation 
and has some consequences

132
00:07:31,152 --> 00:07:33,427
for a particular case 
as you will see. 

133
00:07:33,613 --> 00:07:37,101
One of them is that there's 
a certain risk of shadow formation.

134
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:40,766
This table will give an overview 
of various mean free path values 

135
00:07:40,972 --> 00:07:43,421
as a function of chamber pressure.

136
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:46,955
At atmospheric pressure, we have 
very short mean free path,

137
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:50,717
and so the molecules 
are bouncing into each other

138
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:54,096
and the average, every 
65 Nanometer of travel

139
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:57,805
if you go to low vacuum, 
or medium vacuum and high vacuum

140
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,323
for example, we can already gain
mean free path of several meters. 

141
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:06,368
So our chamber that we built
is typically a half meter, 

142
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,816
one meter, in size.

143
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:11,917
So an atom or molecule 
leaving the evaporant's source, 

144
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,392
will not have any collision before 
it hits the substrate surface. 

145
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:19,757
That means this is very directional 
flux from the source 

146
00:08:19,963 --> 00:08:21,576
to the substrate. 

147
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:25,757
In contrast as you will see later, 
spattering is performed 

148
00:08:25,985 --> 00:08:29,497
at higher pressure and involves 
more collisions  of target molecules

149
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,506
and ions before deposition. 

150
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:34,717
This leads a very different 
film morphology. 

151
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:36,701
For instance, 
much less shadowing, 

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,317
which favors smooth film formation.

153
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,365
Let's now consider how we can derive
the thickness of the film,

154
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,929
deposited from an evaporation 
source.  

155
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:51,342
Consider a small sphere dS1
that evaporates material

156
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:55,770
in all direction at the given rate 
as shown here. 

157
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:59,832
You call such an evaporation source,
a point source. 

158
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:03,457
In this case, the material 
passing through a solid angle

159
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:06,797
the omega, in any direction 
per unit time is given by 

160
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,397
this equation.

161
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,196
In reality, the evaporation comes 
from a plane source 

162
00:09:19,383 --> 00:09:23,595
with the area dS1, and the material
is evaporated from one side

163
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:25,958
with a certain rate.

164
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:30,210
In this case, dm can be written as 
the following.

165
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:37,459
In the case, the material flux 
arrives at a small tS2 on a surface 

166
00:09:37,688 --> 00:09:42,126
that is inclined by an angle theta
with respect to the normal

167
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:45,704
to the direction of the vector 
stream as shown here,

168
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,870
we can write the equations 
as follows.

169
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,740
And we can rewrite the two equations
for the point source  

170
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,298
and the planar source 
as follows.

171
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:11,767
So how can we now get 
to the thickness of the film,

172
00:10:11,968 --> 00:10:15,293
let's assume that the material
has a density row D, 

173
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:19,243
in grams per cubic centimeter 
and the film thickness per unit time

174
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,747
is T in centimeter per second. 

175
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,200
Then the volume of the deposit 
on these two

176
00:10:24,398 --> 00:10:30,410
must be T times TS2, 
and we can rewrite dm as follows.

177
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:34,826
Then our two formula for the 
planar source and the point source

178
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:38,780
can be rewritten finally 
as shown here in green. 

179
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,611
For high throughput integrated 
circuit and MEMS processing, 

180
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:03,611
we need to be able to code
large numbers of wafers, 

181
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:07,206
each requiring a uniform 
film thickness.

182
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:11,208
In this case, we use 
a planetary system  that consists 

183
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:14,327
of rotating spherical sections. 

184
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,365
The principle behind 
is shown here. 

185
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:25,198
The receiving service is spherical,
having a radius r0

186
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,693
that includes also 
the planar source.

187
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,272
We can already state that 
the angle T

188
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:37,691
equals, T angle theta 
and we can write 

189
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,907
cosine C equals cosine theta

190
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:46,133
is given by r over 2r0. 

191
00:11:47,226 --> 00:11:50,488
Taking what we did use 
in the previous slide, 

192
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:55,603
we can rewrite now the thickness
like follows.

193
00:12:01,538 --> 00:12:06,476
So the thickness is independent
from the radius r.

194
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:11,120
That means that deposition rate 
is the same for each point

195
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:13,353
on the spherical surface. 

196
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,663
Thereby, a uniform film thickness
can be obtained also 

197
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,314
for a large number of wafers. 

198
00:12:20,511 --> 00:12:24,737
In a real evaporator system, 
the wafers are arranged therefore

199
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:28,435
in a spherical holder 
called planetary,

200
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:32,298
as you will see in the next section
of this chapter in more details.
