1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,930
Welcome to this lesson
on other PVD techniques

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,393
that are of interest 
for micro/nanofabrication.

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,293
I will first show the so-called
ion assisted methods,

4
00:00:12,343 --> 00:00:14,480
which are combination of evaporation

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,543
and ion induced surface preparation.

6
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:17,480
Second,

7
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,793
I will introduce MBE

8
00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,668
which is an important technique

9
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,468
to create crystalline thin films.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,405
Third,

11
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:25,855
I will present PLD,

12
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,430
which is a favorite method

13
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,268
to deposit composite material

14
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:31,743
with complex stoichiometry
at high quality.

15
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:33,780
These methods are more complex

16
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,918
and expensive than previously shown

17
00:00:35,968 --> 00:00:37,480
evaporation and sputtering

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,880
but they are very important

19
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,943
for advanced film 
control and formation.

20
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:42,830
This lesson will conclude

21
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,543
with some supplementary methods

22
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:45,555
and the comparison 

23
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:48,080
of the various PVD methods shown.

24
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:50,813
Ion assisted deposition

25
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:51,801
(IAD),

26
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:53,976
and ion beam assisted deposition

27
00:00:54,026 --> 00:00:55,251
(IBAD),

28
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:56,363
are 2 techniques

29
00:00:56,413 --> 00:00:58,663
combining material evaporation

30
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,638
and substrate sputtering with ions.

31
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:03,688
The differ in how the ions
are created.

32
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,801
In the case of IBAD,

33
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:08,638
ions are generated 
using an ion source

34
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,788
or ion gun

35
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,776
as shown in the schematics
on the right side of the slide

36
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:15,976
So here you can see

37
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,638
the setup that we already introduced

38
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:20,001
in the evaporation.

39
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:21,438
Now, in addition

40
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:24,026
to the crucible 
and the electron source

41
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:26,451
that evaporates the material

42
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,051
that is going to be deposited

43
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,251
on the substrate in the chamber.

44
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,201
We have, in addition, an ion source

45
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:32,988
or ion gun,

46
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,626
which emits ions
into the vacuum chamber

47
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,276
that heats the substrate

48
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,013
before or during the deposition. 

49
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,976
In such we can clean the surface,

50
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:45,363
and add additional energy,

51
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:48,401
to enhance the control

52
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,588
of the film growth

53
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,863
on the wafer
during the deposition.

54
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,838
In the case of IAD,

55
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,963
a plasma is created

56
00:01:58,013 --> 00:01:59,501
in the evaporation chamber

57
00:01:59,563 --> 00:02:00,863
and ions are accelerated 

58
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:02,776
by applying a negative bias voltage

59
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,963
on the substrate.

60
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:05,551
In both cases,

61
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,513
the high energy ion bombardment

62
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,338
of the substrate is used to clean

63
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,901
and activate the surface

64
00:02:10,976 --> 00:02:12,463
prior to the deposition

65
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:14,201
and to improve the film quality

66
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,488
during the deposition.

67
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,751
By doing so,

68
00:02:16,826 --> 00:02:20,438
thickness uniformity, as well as 
film adhesion can be improved.

69
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:23,013
In fact,

70
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:26,213
energetic ions enable atoms 
to diffuse on the surface

71
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,213
and also enables atoms to penetrate

72
00:02:28,276 --> 00:02:29,388
into the surface.

73
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:30,851
By this mechanism,

74
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:33,226
film density and hardness
can be increased,

75
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,876
which is particularly useful

76
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:36,913
when depositing dielectric films.

77
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,063
As we know,

78
00:02:38,113 --> 00:02:40,376
denser films have lower etch-rates

79
00:02:40,413 --> 00:02:42,401
and higher dielectric constant.

80
00:02:44,051 --> 00:02:45,601
Let's now have a look

81
00:02:45,651 --> 00:02:48,526
to how a typical ion source 
for IBAD works.

82
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,363
You can see on the right side 
of the slide a schematic

83
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,451
of a source 

84
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,188
used in one of the evaporator

85
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,438
in the EBF clean room.

86
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,926
The substrate is not shown,

87
00:02:58,001 --> 00:03:00,213
it will be somewhere
on the top of the slide.

88
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:04,563
The source consists of two parts,

89
00:03:04,626 --> 00:03:06,826
the hollow cathode
electrode source, 

90
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:09,513
and the ion source itself.

91
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:11,369
Firstly,

92
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,457
argon gas enters the hollow cathode

93
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,269
and a high voltage is applied

94
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:17,644
between the keeper
and the hollow cathode,

95
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,844
creating a plasma
within the hollow cathode.

96
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,352
Shown here.

97
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:26,992
Once the plasma is stable
in the hollow cathode,

98
00:03:27,054 --> 00:03:28,929
a bias voltage is applied

99
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:30,167
with a bias controller

100
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:32,542
to emit electrons
out of the hollow cathode.

101
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,717
Emitted electrons are deflected

102
00:03:34,754 --> 00:03:37,517
towards the ion source
using a magnetic field.

103
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,604
Shown here.

104
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:42,104
In the ion source

105
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,992
electrons collide with gas atoms,

106
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:46,192
here we use argon or oxygen,

107
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,542
and ionize them.

108
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,892
Resulting ions are then repulsed

109
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,154
by the positive anode

110
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:52,817
and bombard the substrate.

111
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,917
Upwards. Which is not shown here.

112
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:58,696
Electrons emitted 
from the hollow cathode

113
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,871
are also used to neutralize
 the substrate,

114
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,483
which charges positively
with ion bombardment.

115
00:04:05,156 --> 00:04:07,093
Ion beam assisted deposition

116
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,768
has 2 main advantages over
non-beam ion assisted deposition.

117
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:12,881
Both come from the fact

118
00:04:12,943 --> 00:04:14,268
that no plasma is used

119
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:16,018
in the actual deposition process

120
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,431
in contrast to sputtering.

121
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:19,093
Firstly,

122
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:21,018
better film purity is achieved

123
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:23,018
as a higher vacuum can be used.

124
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,256
Thin films,
with improved internal stress

125
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:28,068
and microstructure control,

126
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:28,981
can be deposited

127
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:30,431
as substrate temperature

128
00:04:30,481 --> 00:04:31,718
can be better controlled.

129
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,206
As there is no plasma 
close to the substrate.

130
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:36,818
On the other hand,

131
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,268
non-ion beam deposition

132
00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:39,856
also have some advantages

133
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,281
over the beam assisted deposition.

134
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:45,506
As evaporated atoms 
travel through the plasma,

135
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:48,106
they will be scattered 
and some of them will ionize.

136
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,268
As a result,

137
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:50,806
conformal coatings

138
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,131
and compound deposition 
can be achieved.

139
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,185
For compound deposition, 
an additional gas

140
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,510
is added to the chamber

141
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,998
and it will react with 
evaporated atoms

142
00:05:00,073 --> 00:05:03,398
that will have been ionized
in the plasma.

143
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:05,211
For instance,

144
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:07,599
dense and very hard 
titanium nitrate coatings

145
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:09,524
are thereby possible.

146
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:10,299
Finally, 

147
00:05:10,336 --> 00:05:12,061
IAD and IBAD

148
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,974
can be combined 
with sputtering deposition

149
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,236
as well as chemical
vapor deposition.

150
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,436
Let's have now a look at epitaxy

151
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:21,911
which is a method to create

152
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,711
crystalline material frames that

153
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:26,986
are not possible with evaporation
and sputtering processes.

154
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:28,474
Indeed,

155
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,749
evaporation and sputtering PVD

156
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:32,611
the deposited layers

157
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,486
either amorphous 
or sometimes polycrystalline,

158
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:36,936
but never monocrystalline.

159
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,136
The crystal structure 
of deposited thin films

160
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,836
will be studied in more detail 
in the chapter about film growth.

161
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,281
Epitaxial deposition consists

162
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:49,944
in growing a single crystal film

163
00:05:49,981 --> 00:05:51,706
on the crystalline substrate,

164
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:55,506
as shown in the top schematic
on the right side of the slide.

165
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,144
If the film is of the same material

166
00:05:58,181 --> 00:05:59,369
as the substrate,

167
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,956
the process is called "homoepitaxy".

168
00:06:02,006 --> 00:06:04,344
It is called "heteroepitaxy"

169
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:06,294
if the materials differ.

170
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,016
In order to have a successful growth

171
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:10,491
of the epitaxial layer,

172
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,003
several conditions 
have to be satisfied.

173
00:06:13,878 --> 00:06:14,966
In a thermal way,

174
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,641
the epitaxial layer

175
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,303
crystal structure is the same

176
00:06:18,353 --> 00:06:20,128
as the substrate crystal structure.

177
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,816
In the case of homoepitaxy,

178
00:06:21,866 --> 00:06:23,603
this is rather straightforward.

179
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:24,903
On the other hand,

180
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:27,303
in the case of heteroepitaxy,

181
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,066
things are more complex.

182
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,016
Indeed,

183
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,966
if there is a lattice mismatch

184
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,691
between the material
to grow and the substrate,

185
00:06:34,741 --> 00:06:36,578
the single-crystal film thickness

186
00:06:36,616 --> 00:06:38,816
will be limited or even zero.

187
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:41,578
In addition to 
the crystal structure condition,

188
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,778
there is also a condition
on the energy

189
00:06:43,841 --> 00:06:45,003
and diffusion time

190
00:06:45,053 --> 00:06:47,516
atoms have when they
arrive on the substrate.

191
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,137
If they are too low

192
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:52,399
or too short, respectively

193
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,599
atoms will not be able 
to go to the right location

194
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,949
in order to grow a single crystal.

195
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:00,174
There are several main applications

196
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,999
of epitaxy, such as the fabrication

197
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,399
of silicon membranes

198
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,737
on silicon substrate

199
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,474
with predetermined thicknesses

200
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:07,812
and doping levels.

201
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,512
And stacks of silicon layers

202
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:11,924
with sharp and large 
doping level changes.

203
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,221
Such stacks can be used

204
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,471
in microprocessors,

205
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:17,484
high-performance logic circuits,

206
00:07:17,534 --> 00:07:19,234
and as electrochemical [INAUDIBLE]

207
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:20,646
for MEMs fabrication.

208
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,906
More details are given`

209
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,369
about this last application

210
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,256
in the chapter 
about wet-etching. 

211
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,828
Another widely used application

212
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:32,503
of epitaxy is 
silicon-on-insulator wafers

213
00:07:32,565 --> 00:07:33,553
or SOI.

214
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,653
SOI wafers consist

215
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:37,153
of a thin surface

216
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,815
or device layer of silicon

217
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:41,790
an underlying layer 
of insulating material

218
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:44,753
typically SiO2 or aluminum oxide

219
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:46,703
and a support silicon wafer

220
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,703
as shown in the bottom schematic

221
00:07:48,753 --> 00:07:50,240
on the right side of the slide.

222
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:53,690
Such wafers can be used to fabricate

223
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,940
faster and more compact

224
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,290
transistor chips

225
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,478
in the thin epitaxial
device layer.

226
00:07:58,515 --> 00:07:59,690
It can also be used

227
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,090
to fabricate mechanically 

228
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:04,015
and electrically insulated layers
in MEMs devices

229
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,390
Two main types of epitaxy exists:

230
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:07,878
Chemical vapor deposition

231
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,640
and physical vapor deposition

232
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,240
In this chapter we will 
focus on the latter one,

233
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:15,090
also called 
"Molecular Beam Epitaxy",

234
00:08:15,153 --> 00:08:16,403
or MBE.

235
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,245
Molecular beam epitaxy, or MBE,

236
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,520
is a PVD technique

237
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,020
very similar to resistive
heating evaporation,

238
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,658
but with significantly
technical differences.

239
00:08:27,237 --> 00:08:29,125
Firstly, the crucible containing

240
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:31,062
the evaporant is placed in a cavity

241
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,925
with a very small aperture 

242
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,512
in the millimeter-side range

243
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,887
called Knudsen cell

244
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:39,000
as you can see on the figure
on the right side of the slide.

245
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:42,868
Typically, graphite crucible

246
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,068
with tantalum foil, 
resistive heatings are used here.

247
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,005
The use of Knudsen cell allows

248
00:08:48,068 --> 00:08:50,980
to better control both 
the temperature of the evaporant

249
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:53,818
and the flow of atoms
exiting the cell.

250
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,930
The flow of atoms is correctorized

251
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,068
by the Knudsen number, 

252
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:58,380
which is defined 

253
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,543
as the ratio of the atoms 
mean free path

254
00:09:00,605 --> 00:09:03,268
over the Knudsen cell 
orifice diameter.

255
00:09:03,318 --> 00:09:04,305
Shown here.

256
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,730
If the Knudsen number 
is smaller than 0.01

257
00:09:07,768 --> 00:09:10,443
the mean free path is comparable

258
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,818
to the orifice diameter.

259
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:14,143
This means that atom bounces against

260
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:15,768
 the orifice sidewalls. 

261
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:17,105
In such a case,

262
00:09:17,143 --> 00:09:18,830
atoms exit the cell

263
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,618
in a continuous whisk of flow.

264
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,854
In the case of MBE,

265
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:24,004
the mean free path is

266
00:09:24,017 --> 00:09:26,417
is in the range of 
ten-to-the-sixth meters,

267
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:30,292
and the orifice diameter 
in the range of 10 to the -3 meter.

268
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:31,504
As a result,

269
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:33,729
the Knudsen number 
is much greater than 1

270
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,029
and atoms are passing through
the orifice one by one

271
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,029
in a single, straight track.

272
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,129
Secondly,

273
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,329
MBE requires an ultrahigh vacuum

274
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,079
of about 10 to the -11 Torr.

275
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:47,017
in contrast to a vacuum 

276
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:49,329
of 10 to the -6, 10 to the -7

277
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,354
used in standard evaporation.

278
00:09:51,404 --> 00:09:52,579
As a result,

279
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:56,329
atomic stream evaporated 
from Knudsen cells

280
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:57,204
in MBE,

281
00:09:57,254 --> 00:10:00,591
 impinged to substrate surface 
in a line of side manner,

282
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:01,854
and then diffused 

283
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:03,329
to that thermodynamically

284
00:10:03,366 --> 00:10:05,229
minimal crystallographic location.

285
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:06,979
Finally,

286
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,766
as shown in the schematic 
on the right side of the slide

287
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,316
multiple Knudsen cells can be used

288
00:10:12,366 --> 00:10:14,391
with the same MBE chamber,

289
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:16,541
which allows depositing compounds,

290
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,941
alloys, and even multiple 
types of dopings.

291
00:10:19,979 --> 00:10:22,066
In addition to the main shutter,

292
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:24,066
that covers all the cells,

293
00:10:24,154 --> 00:10:25,966
each cell has its own shutter.

294
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,529
This way, stacks 
of different material

295
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:31,604
with various different 
doping levels can be deposited.

296
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,216
In order a single crystal film,

297
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,491
having molecular flow of atoms

298
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,716
impinging the substrate
is not sufficient.

299
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,066
As mentioned 
in the introduction slide

300
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:43,579
about epitaxy,

301
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:46,104
once the atoms land on the surface

302
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,979
they need to move around

303
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:51,179
until they find an atomic side
to chemically bound to it.

304
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,679
To do so, atoms on the surface

305
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:55,841
must have enough energy and time

306
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:58,329
to reach the right 
crystallographic location.

307
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:01,391
Several conditions have 
then to be satisfied.

308
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:02,616
Firstly,

309
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,979
the substrate 
has to be absolutely clean.

310
00:11:05,016 --> 00:11:07,991
Secondly, the substrate is heated

311
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:11,191
from 400° C up to 800° C,

312
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:13,116
to increase the atoms energy.

313
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,904
And thirdly,

314
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,641
giving atoms enough time

315
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:20,029
to travel to their 
energy minimum location

316
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,979
leads to very low deposition rates

317
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,816
in the range 
of 0.1 to 2 ångström (Å) per second.

318
00:11:24,866 --> 00:11:27,441
Which results in very long
deposition times.

319
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:29,516
Finally,

320
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,541
in the case of heteroepitaxy,

321
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,741
if the lattice from 
the material to grow

322
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,954
is different from 
that of the substrate

323
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:39,004
epitaxy might still be possible,

324
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:42,141
but the thickness of the thin
crystal film will be limited.

325
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:43,154
Indeed,

326
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,754
the film will strain 
in order to match

327
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,979
the substrate lattice

328
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:48,016
and at some point 

329
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,341
internal stresses will 
become too important

330
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,004
and dislocations will appear.

331
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:54,041
Such a slow deposition rate

332
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:57,241
and fast acting shutters
to control the atomic stream

333
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,166
allows very precise 
and accurate thickness control

334
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:01,529
for each material. 

335
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,629
Ultra-sharp doping profiles

336
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,829
and layers 
with a thickness precision 

337
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,004
of +/- 2Å can be achieved routinely

338
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,104
So in comparison 
to other PVD techniques

339
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:16,866
epitaxy allows for better
thickness control

340
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,066
and enables the deposition 
of single crystal layers.

341
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:21,729
And in addition,

342
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:25,291
in comparison to chemical 
vapor deposition epitaxy

343
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,954
molecular beam epitaxy 
requires lower temperature

344
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:31,066
400° to 800° C

345
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:33,554
versus 1200° C.

346
00:12:33,604 --> 00:12:35,429
And allows better thickness control.

347
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,766
Working at lower temperatures

348
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:39,904
enables to work 
with doped substrates

349
00:12:39,966 --> 00:12:41,741
and to deposite doped films

350
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:44,229
without auto-doping
and diffusion problems.

351
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,216
Better thickness control

352
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,229
allows for fabricating quantum wells

353
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,554
where layer control 
of +/- 40 Å is required.

354
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:54,079
Finally,

355
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:57,041
both low temperature
and precise thickness control

356
00:12:57,116 --> 00:12:59,991
are required to fabricate 
semi-conductor lasers,

357
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,466
such as laser diodes.

358
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,104
They are made of a stack
of different materials

359
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,066
with very specific doping levels

360
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:07,454
and they are widely used

361
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:10,129
for CD, DVD, BluRay Discs,

362
00:13:10,191 --> 00:13:11,879
reading and recording,

363
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:14,204
as well as pen-sized laser pointers.

364
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,691
On the other hand,

365
00:13:14,404 --> 00:13:17,404


366
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,254
MBE is more expensive

367
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:19,191
than other PVD systems

368
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,554
because of the required
ultrahigh vacuum

369
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:24,041
and because the deposition rate
is very slow

370
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:26,866
It is used only for applications

371
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,829
where no other technique can be used

372
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:32,004
Pulse laser deposition (PLD)

373
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,629
consists in using a 
high-energy UV excimer laser

374
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,879
to ablate material from a target.

375
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,904
The physical ablation forms

376
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:41,579
a high-temperature vapor plume

377
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,491
that reaches the sample surface.

378
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,004
We will see that the main advantage

379
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,991
of such a system is its ability
to deposit compounds

380
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:51,016
for very complex stoichiometry.

381
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,841
The working 
principle of PLD is as follows:

382
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:55,916
First,

383
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:59,054
a high-energy UV excimer laser pulse

384
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,516
is focused on a target

385
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,929
made of the material, to deposit.

386
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:04,254
Shown here.

387
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,741
As the laser focusing on the target

388
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,641
in green.

389
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:11,816
Typically, a krypton fluoride laser,

390
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:13,441
at 2.48 nanometer is used

391
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,728
and pulses of 10 to 30 nanoseconds

392
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,328
with an energy in the focus 
of 2 Joules per centimeter square.

393
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:23,053
Pulse repetition is 
in the order of 15 per second.

394
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,078
The energy of the pulse is absorbed 

395
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,366
by the target

396
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,178
a plasma plume is created

397
00:14:30,228 --> 00:14:32,003
at the surface of the target

398
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,078
and it interacts with ablated pieces

399
00:14:34,116 --> 00:14:35,266
and the target itself.

400
00:14:35,316 --> 00:14:38,466
Finally, the vaporized 
material rapidly expands

401
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:40,453
and condenses on the substrate.

402
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,416
In between pulses,

403
00:14:42,503 --> 00:14:45,353
the target cools down 
and solidifies.

404
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:51,038
For metal, the absorption depth
is about 10 nanometer.

405
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,701
The energy is further relaxed

406
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:56,751
through electron phonon interactions

407
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:59,551
in a phenomena which 
takes 1 to 10 picoseconds time.

408
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:03,001
Concretly, the electrons 
are removed from the atoms

409
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:05,213
and oscillate in 
the strong magnetic field,

410
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:06,613
created by the laser.

411
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,001
The generated heat diffuses around

412
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:12,451
due to collisions of these 
free electrons with other atoms.

413
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:15,026
In the first time, 
this melts the material.

414
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:16,188
And finally,

415
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:19,626
a small amount of material
is evaporated and ionized

416
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,042
PLD deposition at room temperature

417
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,855
usually results 
in amorphous thin films.

418
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:27,705
However,

419
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,592
heating the substrate 
to 700° to 900° C,

420
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:32,842
allows to get 
crystalline thin films.

421
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:35,017
Substrate heating can be achieved 

422
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,017
in two ways.

423
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,955
One conventional way is to use 
a substrate holder

424
00:15:39,017 --> 00:15:40,530
with an integrated heater.

425
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:43,742
Another way is to use a CO2 laser

426
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:46,130
which is focused on the substrate.

427
00:15:47,842 --> 00:15:50,905
Pulse laser deposition 
has several advantages

428
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,480
that make it into an attractive
PVD technique.

429
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:57,267
Firstly, the deposition 
pressure range varies

430
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,717
from atmospheric 
pressure to high vacuum.

431
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,755
Secondly,

432
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,517
it is almost possible to deposit 
any material on any substrate

433
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,855
and there is no X-ray [generation]

434
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,817
as it is the case with sputtering.

435
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:09,980
Finally,

436
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,542
the most important strength of PLD

437
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,067
is that the target material

438
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:16,067
is deposited onto the substrate

439
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:17,730
with almost no decomposition.

440
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,005
A stoichiometry is conserved

441
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:22,617
complex compounds 
and alloys can be deposited.

442
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,205
This makes PLD a unique
technique to deposit,

443
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,930
for instance, functional oxides, 

444
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,005
such as super conducting materials

445
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:30,917
or bio-compatible based ceramics

446
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:33,117
to protect sensors from body fluid.

447
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,692
On the other hand,

448
00:16:34,892 --> 00:16:37,067
PLD also has some 
severe limitations.

449
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,142
Firstly,
there is a risk of splashing,

450
00:16:39,305 --> 00:16:41,555
because of surface boiling 
or shockwaves

451
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:43,480
due to the plasma plume expansion.

452
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,105
Boiling occurs when the layer

453
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,755
below the surface of the target

454
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,392
reaches its evaporation point

455
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,617
before the surface 
of the target itself.

456
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,830
As a result, micrometer particles

457
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:55,405
are injected and impinged
to substrate surface.

458
00:16:55,605 --> 00:16:57,430
This problem can be partially solved

459
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,117
using ultra-short laser pulses

460
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,555
of less than 1 picosecond.

461
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:03,405
A such pulse with a shorter
 than the electron lattice

462
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,405
relaxation time,

463
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,867
the heat diffusion and melting
is reduced

464
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:09,605
and the material is forced 
directly into plasma state

465
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,567
without going into 
liquid phase first.

466
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:14,430
This leads to cleaner, 
smoother and higher quality films.

467
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,230
Secondly,

468
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,917
PLD is a line of side technique,

469
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:19,892
and results in poor step coverage

470
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:20,692
which means

471
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:22,892
on the positive side 
that it can be used 

472
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,130
for lift off and 
shadowmask techniques.

473
00:17:25,217 --> 00:17:27,867
Finally, because of 
the small source size

474
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:31,067
this technique is not suited
for large scale deposition

475
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:34,267
Call for new equipment is being 
developed for this purpose. 

476
00:17:36,317 --> 00:17:37,617
To conclude this chapter,

477
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,042
I briefly want to introduce

478
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,580
one important and recently

479
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,842
 very prevailing coating
 material for MEMs,

480
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,380
which is parylene.

481
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,117
It is widely used 
in microfabrication

482
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:48,942
as structural material,

483
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:51,492
thick protective coating
and thermal insulator.

484
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:55,317
Deposition process consists
of 3 subsequent steps.

485
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,330
During the first step,

486
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,655
a solid parylene 
diamond is evaporated

487
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,705
in a chamber at 150° C.

488
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:05,905
In a second chamber,

489
00:18:06,105 --> 00:18:09,530
the temperature is further
increased up to 670° C,

490
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,417
in order to separate 
the diamonds in monomers.

491
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,842
And finally, in the third chamber,

492
00:18:15,905 --> 00:18:17,717
the monomer gas is cooled

493
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,055
at room temperature

494
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:21,955
so that it condenses 
on the substrate and polymerizes.

495
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,380
Layer thicknesses ranging
from 50 [nm] to 10 µm

496
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,230
double side coating, 

497
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:31,017
as well as conformal
and stress-free layer are possible.

498
00:18:31,217 --> 00:18:32,767
In addition,

499
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:35,555
parylene shows excellent 
thickness and uniformity

500
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:36,717
below 1%.

501
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,367
Is thermally stable.

502
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,930
Has a good resistance to solvents,

503
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,530
acids, and bases.

504
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,267
Last but not least,

505
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:45,905
it is biocompatible,

506
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,717
which makes is an ideal candidate

507
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,017
 for packaging application
for bioMEMs.

508
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:53,830
This table summarizes
the key features

509
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,705
of the main PVD techniques 
introduced so far.

510
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:58,668
It allows to compare

511
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:01,618
the various parameters
and to select the proper method 

512
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,093
for one's own use.

513
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:05,718
Please have a look at the variations

514
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:08,405
in parameters and try 
to get an overview

515
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,230
of the pros and cons
of each of the methods.

516
00:19:12,993 --> 00:19:14,893
We have looked at the wide range

517
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:17,655
of different PVD methods, 
such as thermal evaporation

518
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,005
sputtering, ion plating,

519
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,030
molecular beam epitaxy
and pulse laser deposition.

520
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,230
The underlying physical 
principles have been explained.

521
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,768
So you should now be able
to distinguish the various methods

522
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,793
and to eventually choose 
the proper one for your purpose.

523
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:34,405
In an upcoming video lecture,

524
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,155
we will analyze more in details

525
00:19:37,355 --> 00:19:39,180
how PVD films grown 
unto to substrate.
