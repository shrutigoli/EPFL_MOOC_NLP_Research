1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,858
Evaporation is performed in the
vacuum chamber.

2
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:08,662
The evaporant is heated in a

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,113
crucible at the bottom of the 

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:11,514
chamber and the vapour flux

5
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,293
condensates on the wafer surface

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,390
placed in the upper part of
the chamber.

7
00:00:15,617 --> 00:00:17,842
A large source substrate distance

8
00:00:17,888 --> 00:00:19,463
of roughly 1 meter, enables

9
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:21,327
directional deposition that is

10
00:00:21,344 --> 00:00:23,244
important for lift-off precesses.

11
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:25,596
Different standard evaporants are

12
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:27,186
permanently loaded in various

13
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:29,679
crucibles inside the evaporation 
chamber.

14
00:00:30,173 --> 00:00:31,748
The material to evaporate is

15
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,993
selected by rotating the crucibles

16
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:35,844
at the bottom of the chamber.

17
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:40,458
If an additional material is
required, a crucible filled with the

18
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:42,242
material to be evaporated can be

19
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:43,862
placed in an empty pocket.

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,880
In this specific case we
used chromium.

21
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:48,496
A shutter is used to control the

22
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,317
deposition. When the shutter is 

23
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,476
covering the evaporation source

24
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,448
wafer flux can reach the substrate.

25
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,713
To start the deposition the shutter

26
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,623
is moved on the side and the flux

27
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,836
can reach the substrate.

28
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,723
Such a mechanical shutter is much

29
00:01:01,777 --> 00:01:03,902
better to control the on off state

30
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,879
of deposition, compared to switching

31
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:08,438
on or off the evaporation itself.

32
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,745
This sequence shows some typical
substrate before evaporation.

33
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:15,887
For standard micro nano
fabrication, we typically use

34
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,635
silicon or glass substrates.

35
00:01:17,853 --> 00:01:21,465
Here are shown a couple of silicon
wafers that are either bare silicon

36
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:23,671
in grey, or silicon with dielectric

37
00:01:23,715 --> 00:01:25,578
coating, silicon nitride in this

38
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,625
specific case, which gives the
nice blue colour.

39
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,059
The wafers are first loaded upside
down into the sample holder

40
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:35,430
which has an opening at the bottom

41
00:01:35,532 --> 00:01:38,882
which itself is then loaded into
the evaporator chamber.

42
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,867
The chamber is closed and pumped

43
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:46,917
down to reach a vacuum of about
10 to the minus 7 torr.

44
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,097
The pumping is the longest step
in the evaporation process.

45
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:55,219
It takes a few minutes to several
tens of minutes depending on the

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,908
required level of vacuum.

47
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:00,700
This leaves some time for the
scientists to discuss with students

48
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,657
and technicians.

49
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,061
The evaporant is then heated

50
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,909
in this case with an electron beam.

51
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,923
Depending on the material

52
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:11,054
the electron beam movement varies.

53
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,703
For chromium for example

54
00:02:12,745 --> 00:02:15,183
which is not a very good
thermal conductor

55
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:17,446
the beam sweep is rather large.

56
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,321
Here the sweep speed is reduced

57
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,830
compared to the one used in
a real process

58
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,786
for the purpose of this video.

59
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:26,649
When using gold on the other hand

60
00:02:26,694 --> 00:02:29,269
the sweep area is smaller as it is

61
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:31,308
an excellent thermal conductor.

62
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:37,891
Finally this last example shows
titanium in the crucible under the

63
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,776
bombardment of the electron beam.

64
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,952
The deposition time depends on the

65
00:02:42,998 --> 00:02:44,860
rate and required thickness

66
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,155
Typical time for 30 nano meter gold 

67
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:49,662
is on the order of 1 to 1.5 minutes.

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,375
Once the desired film thickness
is reached, the shutter is closed

69
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:56,716
and the e-beam power is ramped down.

70
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:00,665
After a cooling period of about 20
minutes, the chamber is vented

71
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,156
opened and the wafers are unloaded.

72
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:05,426
Note that here we see the back side

73
00:03:05,442 --> 00:03:07,705
of the wafers and not the
coated sides.

74
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,512
After removing the wafers from the

75
00:03:09,525 --> 00:03:11,062
holder and turning them around

76
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,815
we can see here the wafers
after deposition.

77
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:17,677
Gold in yellow and chromium in grey.

78
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:21,992
The blue ring of the underlying
silicon nitride layer at the wafer

79
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,082
edge stems from the shadow of the
wafer holder.
