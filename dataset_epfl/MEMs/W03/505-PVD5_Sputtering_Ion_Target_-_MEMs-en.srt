1
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,925
So in this lesson, we will now
have a closer look

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,637
at how ions interacting with 
the target material

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:12,413
in order to remove the material
from the target,

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:14,846
and to sputter it on the substrate.

5
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:18,332
When a so called primary ion
collides with a target,

6
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:20,507
made of the material to deposit.

7
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,457
Several interactions may occur,

8
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:25,657
as illustrated in the figure on
the right side of the slide.

9
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,190
The interaction depends primarily on
the ion kinetic energy,

10
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:31,989
the type of ion,

11
00:00:32,374 --> 00:00:33,861
and the target material.

12
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:37,159
Negatively charged electrons
in the cathode

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,959
will then neutralize the positive
ion, Argon in most cases.

14
00:00:41,746 --> 00:00:45,696
When the energy is low, smaller
than 10 electron volt.

15
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,146
Ions hitting the cathode 
may be reflected,

16
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:50,860
absorbed, or may migrate
on the surface.

17
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,549
During the inpinching, it can 
induce some surface damage

18
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:57,749
such as point defect, 
or topographical changes.

19
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:01,466
It may also induce some chemical
reactions on the surface.

20
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:06,434
Ions with high energy, 
10 kilo-electron volts or more,

21
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:09,272
will penetrate deeply into
the target material

22
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:12,722
and form an implant or compound
electron here.

23
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:18,963
When ions are in the energy range 
between 10eV and 10 keV, 

24
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:23,413
they will eject atoms
from the target

25
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:24,949
like the ones shown here.

26
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,311
This is the action that
we want for sputtering.

27
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:31,037
By doing so, they will simultaneously
create secondary electrons,

28
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:32,512
and secondary ions.

29
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:35,178
Finding the ions interacting
with the target

30
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:39,448
can also result in the emission
of photons and x-rays.

31
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:44,822
95% of colliding ions transmit
energy as heat to the target,

32
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:46,929
therefore cooling is required.

33
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:49,569
And it is worth noting
that in sputtering,

34
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:54,294
the deposition of compounds 
such as carbide, nitrite, and oxide

35
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:55,544
is indeed possible,

36
00:01:55,744 --> 00:01:59,094
because mechanical energy is used
to eject atoms from the target.

37
00:01:59,635 --> 00:02:02,234
This differs significantly from
the case of the thermal

38
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,997
or electron beam evaporation

39
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:07,985
where thermal energy is used to
vaporize the solid target material.

40
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:11,858
So once again, on the drawing
so you see here.

41
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:15,958
The target material in orange, 
which is biased negatively.

42
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:19,406
And the wafer in grey, 
that is biased,

43
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,104
positively on ground.

44
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:26,541
And now, a primary ion,
with a correct energy

45
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:28,703
will hit the target material,

46
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:31,691
will remove atoms from the target,

47
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:36,077
which then fly through the vacuum
and will land on the wafer and form

48
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:38,603
the thin film of 
the target material.

49
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,509
Unlike for evaporation,

50
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,556
the amount of material ejected from
the target does not depend on 

51
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:46,906
the vapor pressure,

52
00:02:47,205 --> 00:02:50,192
but is given by the so called
ejection rate, W.

53
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:55,447
The ejection rate W depends on 
parameters such as the sputtering yield,

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,990
the voltage between the electrodes,

55
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,702
the discharge current, 
as well as the pressure 

56
00:03:00,902 --> 00:03:03,040
and the inter electrode distance.

57
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:06,489
From the equation on the left hand
here on the slide,

58
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:10,214
we see that the target  ejection rate

59
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,714
increases with the voltage,

60
00:03:12,948 --> 00:03:15,848
but is inversely proportional
to the pressure

61
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:18,398
and the inter electrode distance d.

62
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,415
This can be explained as follows.

63
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,985
When increasing the voltage,

64
00:03:24,298 --> 00:03:27,185
argon ions are accelerated
more rapidly

65
00:03:27,517 --> 00:03:30,280
and strike the cathode with
more kinetic energy.

66
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:34,669
On the other hand, 
when decreasing the pressure,

67
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,783
argon mean free path is increased.

68
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,931
And when decreasing 
the inter electrode distance,

69
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,981
argon ions will collide 
with less argon,

70
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,631
before striking the cathode.

71
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,820
As a consequent, argon ions

72
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,120
impact the cathode with
more kinetic energy.

73
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:56,876
Finally, the target ejection rate

74
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:01,137
also depends on 
the sputtering yield, S.

75
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,721
Which is the ability of one ion
of a specific gas

76
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:08,972
to eject an atom from the target made
of the specific material.

77
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:13,592
Obviously, the sputtering yield
depends on the ion energy

78
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:16,017
which itself depends on

79
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:19,345
voltage, the pressure,
and the distance.

80
00:04:19,545 --> 00:04:22,807
But it's also related to the type
of gas in the reactor,

81
00:04:23,007 --> 00:04:24,632
and to the target material.

82
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,484
In general, heavier ions

83
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,971
usually have larger
sputtering yields

84
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,358
and harder target materials result
in lower sputtering yields.

85
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,511
A few typical sputtering yield 
values for common materials

86
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:40,711
are shown in the table on
the right side here.

87
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:46,143
The different metals, with their
corresponding sputtering yield.

88
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,330
So here, the target is bombarded with
500 eV argon ions.

89
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:54,705
You can see for instance 
that titanium sputtering yield

90
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,838
is significantly lower

91
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:00,126
than that of for example, gold.

92
00:05:01,476 --> 00:05:04,764
Because titanium is much harder
than gold.

93
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,536
As explained previously, 

94
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:11,254
only the target should be bombarded
by energetic ions.

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,395
To avoid sputtering off other 
surfaces than the cathode,

96
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:18,620
the anode as well as 
the entire chamber, 

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
is grounded to increase, in fact,
the anode area.

98
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:26,014
Still, this would not be enough
to prevent sputtering

99
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:28,177
on the backside of the cathode.

100
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:30,119
Indeed,

101
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,871
when all the walls
of the chamber are grounded,

102
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:37,721
a plasma will still install between
the 2 electrodes as wanted.

103
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:41,934
But also between the walls and
the backside of the cathode

104
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:44,622
as shown here, 
on the top left image.

105
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,097
In this case, energetic argon
plus ions,

106
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:51,084
shown here in blue,

107
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,809
will also sputter the backside
of the cathode

108
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,097
and deteriorate it.

109
00:05:58,522 --> 00:06:01,009
To prevent sputtering of 
the structural elements

110
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:02,397
of the cathode,

111
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,334
a grounded shield,

112
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:06,879
is placed at the distance

113
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,529
less than that of the plasma shield

114
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,141
as shown here on the lower
right illustration.

115
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:16,076
In this way, the space between
the shield

116
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,144
and the cathode is too small

117
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:19,979
to allow plasma formation

118
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,679
and the plasma is contained in front
of the target.

119
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:27,317
In order to create a plasma,

120
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:30,517
a certain amount of gas molecules
is required

121
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,017
between their electrodes.

122
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,873
Consequently,

123
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:38,160
The pressure at which the deposition
in a sputtering system occurs,

124
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:42,574
is higher than that used for thermal
or electron beam evaporation.

125
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,287
We use typically

126
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:48,162
10 to the minus one,
to 10 to the minus 3 tau

127
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,062
for sputtering, instead of 10
to the minus 6 

128
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,837
to 10 to the minus 7 tau
for evaporation.

129
00:06:54,676 --> 00:06:57,789
As a result, the mean free path
in sputtering

130
00:06:57,989 --> 00:06:59,939
is only a few millimeters

131
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:02,451
compared to meters in evaporation.

132
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,914
Atoms ejected from the target will
therefore collide

133
00:07:06,114 --> 00:07:09,839
with many gas particles, and ions,
before reaching the substrate.

134
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:12,841
You do the multiple collisions.

135
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,099
The atoms inpinch on the surface
with random incident angles.

136
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,558
Shown here,

137
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:22,171
with the yellow arrows 
on this cartoon.

138
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,735
Thus the way atoms deposit
onto the substrate

139
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,575
and the film grow is different
from evaporation.

140
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:33,734
For instance, having random incident
angle allows

141
00:07:33,947 --> 00:07:36,009
having better step coverage.

142
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:38,859
Compared to evaporation,

143
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,597
where a long
mean free path

144
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,971
produces a line of sight deposition

145
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,347
with a possible shadowing effect,

146
00:07:45,547 --> 00:07:47,897
as you may remember from
the evaporation lesson.

147
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:51,970
Adding a reactive gas
in the chamber,

148
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,246
reactive sputtering is possible.

149
00:07:54,446 --> 00:07:56,183
Atoms ejected from the target

150
00:07:56,383 --> 00:07:58,333
react with the gas,

151
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,446
for instance oxygen, and forms

152
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:04,183
compounds such as oxides.

153
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:07,349
Another deposition technique
to deposit compounds

154
00:08:07,549 --> 00:08:09,437
is called co-sputtering.

155
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,964
Finally, if needed,

156
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:15,713
the direction in a sputtering
deposition is possible

157
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,375
by using a collimated sputtering.

158
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,283
It's done by placing a grid
in between the electrodes

159
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:26,657
and thus filtering atoms with
high angles of incidence.

160
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:29,447
So on this micro graph,

161
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:31,147
taken by an electron microscope.

162
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,885
You can see an example
showing the

163
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,159
capability of sputtering 
aluminum

164
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:39,559
on a double layer lift-off resist.

165
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,222
So you see here, 2 layers
of photo-resist

166
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,347
with an over hanging geometry

167
00:08:44,547 --> 00:08:46,197
like a small mushroom

168
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:49,772
that has been coated by
sputtering aluminum.

169
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:53,451
And since the aluminum came
under various angles,

170
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:56,006
it was able to deposit also

171
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:58,295
underneath the mushroom.

172
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,108
If I'm drawing here again,

173
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,008
where we see the aluminum

174
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,006
on the mushroom structure.

175
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:10,328
The top, then also here, 
we have again

176
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,863
aluminum that has been deposited.

177
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:19,798
Only just underneath 
the over hanging structure,

178
00:09:19,998 --> 00:09:22,661
there have been no, or non visible

179
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:25,347
deposition of aluminum because

180
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:28,672
the incoming angles

181
00:09:29,346 --> 00:09:31,883
were for the aluminum.

182
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:35,796
Atoms could not reach

183
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,371
this shadow part.

184
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,048
So let's have a look at how
various parameters

185
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,011
influence the sputter film quality.

186
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:46,362
Increasing the voltage results
in more energetic ions

187
00:09:46,562 --> 00:09:47,849
striking the cathode.

188
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:51,049
Consequently, more atoms and
more energetic atoms

189
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:53,001
are ejected from the target

190
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,189
which leads to higher
deposition rate,

191
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,253
and better film adhesion.

192
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,327
Indeed, more energetic atoms

193
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:01,628
have a longer penetrating depth

194
00:10:01,881 --> 00:10:05,356
at the wafer surface, and also
allow cleaning the wafer surface

195
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:07,294
from remaining contaminants.

196
00:10:08,177 --> 00:10:10,902
Adjusting the pressure,
and the inter electrode distance

197
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:12,864
is a question of trade off.

198
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:15,961
As explained previously, 
Paschen's law 

199
00:10:16,385 --> 00:10:18,885
gives the breakdown voltage as
a function of the product

200
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,810
between the pressure and
inter electrode distance.

201
00:10:22,432 --> 00:10:24,569
Thus, for a fixed voltage

202
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:28,229
changing either the pressure,
or the inter electrode distance

203
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,492
will alter the plasma stability.

204
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,286
In addition,

205
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:35,486
increasing the pressure or
the inter electrode distance

206
00:10:35,686 --> 00:10:37,011
leads to more collisions

207
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:40,023
of the atoms on their travel
between the target

208
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,723
and the substrate.

209
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,315
As a result,

210
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:46,244
less atoms and less energetic atoms

211
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,319
will deposit on the substrate

212
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,319
which will lower the deposition rate

213
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,482
and also the film adhesion.

214
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,003
There's also risk
for contamination

215
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:56,947
of the deposited hin film

216
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,534
by argon atoms from the plasma

217
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:01,397
if the pressure is too high.

218
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,423
Too high pressure and large
inter electrode distance,

219
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:06,173
should thus be avoided.

220
00:11:06,373 --> 00:11:09,373
Finally, the pressure also impacts
the morphology

221
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,248
of the deposited thin film.

222
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:14,010
If it is an amorphous, or
forms crystal.

223
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,073
This point will be traded in more details
in the lesson about film growth.

224
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,406
The substrate temperature is another
controlled parameter.

225
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:24,451
Increasing the substrate 
temperature,

226
00:11:24,798 --> 00:11:28,472
increases atom energy
on the surface

227
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,955
and thus improves the diffusion.

228
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:33,674
This leads to better
film uniformity

229
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:36,874
and adhesion, and lower
internal stresses.

230
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,087
The temperature also impacts
the crystal structure

231
00:11:40,287 --> 00:11:43,987
as it will be explained in
the film growth chapter.

232
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,649
One of the main advantages 
of sputtering

233
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,625
over thermal evaporation 
is stability

234
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:52,175
to deposit almost any kind
of material

235
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,012
including metallic, and 
non metallic elements,

236
00:11:55,212 --> 00:11:57,725
alloys, ceramics, and polymers.

237
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:00,852
In addition,

238
00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:05,240
Reactive and co-sputtering enables
the deposition of oxides

239
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,865
and chemical compounds

240
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,040
such as nitrites, and carbides, 

241
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,490
among others as depicted in 
this table here on the right side.

242
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:17,252
In addition to the wide choice
of material to deposit,

243
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:21,102
sputtering ensures a good adhesion
of the deposited thin film

244
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,163
because of the relatively high
kinetic energy

245
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:27,367
of the atoms when they inpinch
on the substrate.

246
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,906
Due to the non directional
nature of sputtering,

247
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,597
which means atoms arrive on
the substrate

248
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,771
with random (INAUDIBLE)
of the incident.

249
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:40,620
This deposition technique
enables good step coverage,

250
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,476
good uniformity over large areas,

251
00:12:43,676 --> 00:12:45,725
and suppresses shadowing problems

252
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:47,914
typically of thermal evaporation.

253
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,455
Sputtering targets can be 
relatively large

254
00:12:51,655 --> 00:12:54,155
and thick, which allows
to deposit

255
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,343
more material than with evaporation.

256
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,906
Sputtering systems are compatible
with production processes

257
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:04,646
as large amount of material can be
uniformly deposited

258
00:13:04,846 --> 00:13:06,121
over large areas.

259
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,520
In addition,

260
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,720
sputtering systems can be adapted
to (INAUDIBLE)

261
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,333
deposition to it.

262
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,276
Finally, surface cleaning and 
activation is possible

263
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,817
with the process called 
sputter etching.

264
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:21,693
Reversing the electrode's polarity

265
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:24,443
and creating a low energetic plasma

266
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,763
sill result in ions colliding on
the substrate.

267
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:31,925
As a result, these ions will remove
contamination layers

268
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,813
or particles on the surface,

269
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:38,150
break oxide and surface bonds
to activate the surface.

270
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:40,888
Dry cleaning process using a plasma

271
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,274
is less efficient than wet cleaning

272
00:13:43,474 --> 00:13:45,524
but has no surface tension effects,

273
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,611
doesn't require any drying step,

274
00:13:47,836 --> 00:13:49,874
and is performed directly 
in the chamber

275
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:52,172
where the deposition 
will take place.

276
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:54,738
In practice, a cleaning step

277
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:57,938
is very common before starting
the sputtering process.

278
00:13:59,432 --> 00:14:01,207
Sputtering can be done
at room temperature,

279
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,469
but unless used with magnetron,

280
00:14:03,669 --> 00:14:05,482
substrate heating is substantial

281
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:07,994
because of the atom's kinetic energy

282
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,520
and bombardment by secondary
electrons.

283
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,640
Chemical reaction between 
the substrate 

284
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,727
and the deposited layer can start.

285
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,735
In addition, surface damage
can also occur

286
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,935
because of the substrate 
cooling system

287
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:25,008
the setup and material change
is more complex

288
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,158
than the thermal evaporation system.

289
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:30,283
And thus the sputtering equipment
is more expensive.

290
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,214
Finally, due to the high
deposition pressure,

291
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,763
it is difficult to have high
purity films.
