1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,394
This lesson on the growth

2
00:00:05,456 --> 00:00:08,044
of thin films in physical 
vapor deposition

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:09,831
presents the basic parameter

4
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:11,431
that influence the morphology

5
00:00:11,494 --> 00:00:14,106
of the added material 
on the substrate.

6
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:16,244
I will start by describing

7
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:17,981
what happens when the atoms

8
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:19,419
arrive on the surface

9
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:21,931
An important factor here

10
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:23,569
is the interface property

11
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,419
which determines 
the adhesion of the added film

12
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:28,156
as well as the way

13
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:29,919
the film actually grows.

14
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:31,406
I will then show

15
00:00:31,444 --> 00:00:33,069
the various growth modes

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,681
influence, on their turn,

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,506
the crystal structure of the film,

18
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,806
and will conclude

19
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,119
with some remarks on
the mechanical stresses

20
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,469
in the thin films.

21
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,539
Thin film deposition

22
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:45,639
and film growth

23
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,539
depend on the materials
involved

24
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,864
as well as on several 
process parameters.

25
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:51,364
These include

26
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:53,377
the energy of the impinging atoms

27
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:54,727
their arrival rate

28
00:00:54,777 --> 00:00:56,827
and the substrate temperature.

29
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,193
When atoms condensate
on the substrate

30
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:01,830
they are adsorbed 

31
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:03,468
and attached to the surface

32
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:04,918
either by chemisorption

33
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,368
or by physisorption.

34
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,905
In the first case,

35
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:09,768
atoms create chemical bonds

36
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:10,643
to the surface

37
00:01:10,718 --> 00:01:11,918
with the bonding energy

38
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,668
in the order of 1 electronvolt (eV).

39
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,130
The available energy depends

40
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:19,430
on impinging atoms energy

41
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,505
as well as on substrate temperature.

42
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,339
On the other hand,

43
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,601
physisorption occurs

44
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:29,389
when there is a chemistry mismatch

45
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:31,001
or when the energy is too low

46
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,801
to create chemical bonds

47
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:35,064
and which leaves 
the chemical species

48
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:37,663
of the adsorbate 
and the surface in tact.

49
00:01:37,738 --> 00:01:38,863
In other words,

50
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,838
there is no chemical 
reaction occurring.

51
00:01:42,426 --> 00:01:44,601
Physisorbed atoms are weakly attached

52
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,801
to the surface by
van der Waals forces,

53
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,376
with the bonding energy 

54
00:01:49,426 --> 00:01:52,463
in the order of 0.3 to 0.5 eV.

55
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:54,701
As a result,

56
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,938
physisorbed atoms can diffuse

57
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,913
on the surface.

58
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:03,013
And diffusion of physisorbed atoms,

59
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:05,051
increases with the available energy

60
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:09,176
but is inversely proportional
to the atom's arrival rate.

61
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,763
Why is that so?

62
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:12,726
The explanation is as follows:

63
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:15,063
If the arrival rate is high,

64
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:18,076
atoms on the surface 
will rapidly collide

65
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,776
with new arriving atoms.

66
00:02:20,826 --> 00:02:23,201
And this limits the diffusion

67
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,601
and strongly influences 
the growth mode.

68
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:29,037
Growth modes are detailed 
later in this chapter.

69
00:02:29,237 --> 00:02:31,012
Here on the figure you can see

70
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,462
various events that can occur

71
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:37,224
after the arrival 
of the atoms on the surface.

72
00:02:37,249 --> 00:02:39,962
As a result of this 
surface diffusion

73
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:43,162
physisorbed atoms will
either bind at the kink

74
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,012
- shown here, a small step -

75
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,649
or at the defect. 

76
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:49,887
Shown here.

77
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,249
Or nucleate with other atoms

78
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:53,599
and form clusters.

79
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,987
Nucleation is increased with 
available surface energy.

80
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:57,924
Finally,

81
00:02:57,974 --> 00:02:59,999
if the atom's energy is high enough,

82
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:03,074
they can also desorb 
again from the surface.

83
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,937
The likelihood of desorption 
is lower

84
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,599
for clustered atoms

85
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,812
in comparison to single atoms.

86
00:03:11,953 --> 00:03:14,953
Once there are enough atoms
on the substrate surface

87
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,965
the film starts growing.

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,003
A very important parameter here

89
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,903
is the interface stability.

90
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,465
Or in other words, the question

91
00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:26,553
whether the layer will adhere
to the substrate or not.

92
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,928
Thermodynamics allows determining

93
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,915
if the atoms will be chemisorbed

94
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,590
on the surface or not.

95
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,790
So if the change in Gibbs energy

96
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,320
which is given by the

97
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:44,045
Gibbs energy of the product

98
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,970
minus the Gibbs energy 
of the reactants

99
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:53,182
is smaller than zero

100
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,209
then the reaction is possible.

101
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,584
Let us take the example of titania

102
00:04:01,646 --> 00:04:03,121
on SiO2.

103
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,996
So the Gibbs free energy

104
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:09,196
is the product Gibbs free energy

105
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,871
of TiO2

106
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,396
minus Gibbs of SiO2

107
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,659
which is, in numerical values

108
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:23,946
known to be 
160 minus 165 Kcal,

109
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:28,379
which is minus 5 Kcal

110
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:30,904
which is smaller than zero,

111
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,904
for this reaction can happen.

112
00:04:33,929 --> 00:04:35,916
It means we can deposit 

113
00:04:35,966 --> 00:04:39,404
titania on SiO2.

114
00:04:40,503 --> 00:04:42,578
Another material of interest

115
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:43,753
may be cobalt.

116
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,666
Depositing cobalt on silicon

117
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,416
is also possible.

118
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:52,503
As a corresponding
Gibbs free energy calculation

119
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,828
would show.

120
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:57,628
But the deposition 
of cobalt on SiO2 is not possible

121
00:04:57,678 --> 00:05:00,366
as the ∆ G is larger than zero.

122
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:04,491
Thus the cobalt deposition
on silicon is very sensitive

123
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:06,891
to the presence of native oxides.

124
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:11,203
Besides the initial 
interface stability criteria

125
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:13,653
different types of interfaces exist.

126
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:16,376
An abrupt interface,

127
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,438
shown here,

128
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:21,251
is encountered in most
PVD and CVD depositions.

129
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,038
And which produces

130
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,476
an almost-ideally sharp

131
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,976
material transmission.

132
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:28,226
However,

133
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:31,551
if the goal is to grow a thin film
directly on silicon,

134
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:34,438
this is not as straightforward 
as it sounds;

135
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:36,738
because without special precaution, 

136
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,626
silicon is often covered

137
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,638
by a few nanometer-thick
native SiO2 layer.

138
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:42,976
In this case,

139
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:46,251
an interfacial layer 
exists between the substrate

140
00:05:46,338 --> 00:05:47,488
and the added film.

141
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:49,976
Shown here.

142
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,970
To remove

143
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,208
the interfacial SiO2 layer

144
00:05:55,245 --> 00:05:58,408
typically a special surface etching
and cleaning has to be done

145
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,533
priorly, to the deposition.

146
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,056
So in some other cases,

147
00:06:03,106 --> 00:06:03,881
for instance,

148
00:06:03,969 --> 00:06:07,531
during the deposition of copper
on silicon dioxide,

149
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:10,569
the added copper atoms

150
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:12,819
diffuse into the substrate.

151
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,431
Chemical reactions

152
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:16,481
between the thin film
and the wafer

153
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:17,556
may also occur.

154
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:20,472
This is the case of nickel, 

155
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:23,434
cobalt and titanium deposition
on silicon

156
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:25,509
which forms a so-called
"Silly Side"

157
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:29,047
at 400°, 500° and 600° C,

158
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,372
respectively.

159
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,909
There is a reaction going on

160
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:34,909
at the interface.

161
00:06:35,514 --> 00:06:36,527
In some cases,

162
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,127
an annealing step is sufficient

163
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:40,414
to ensure a good 
electrical conductivity

164
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:41,977
between the added thin film

165
00:06:42,014 --> 00:06:43,464
and the silicon.

166
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,702
See the case 
of the pitted interface,

167
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:46,714
for example.

168
00:06:47,914 --> 00:06:51,002
This is the case
of silicon in aluminum

169
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,864
when heated over 425° C.

170
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:56,027
The spikes of the film

171
00:06:56,064 --> 00:06:56,914
into the wafer

172
00:06:56,952 --> 00:06:59,489
can be several micrometers deep.

173
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,452
On the positive side,

174
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,814
they allow for better 
electrical contact

175
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:05,902
between aluminum and silicon

176
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:07,539
and is even able to break

177
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:10,739
through this thin native 
silicon dioxide interface

178
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,639
that we have presented here before.

179
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,814
The adhesion of the added thin film

180
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:17,927
to the substrate

181
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:21,039
is a very important issue
in microfabrication

182
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:23,464
and special attention 
is therefore required.

183
00:07:24,164 --> 00:07:25,327
Particularly,

184
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:27,214
substrate cleanliness

185
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,889
is of a major significance

186
00:07:28,927 --> 00:07:30,827
as residues from the environment

187
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,827
or from previous process steps

188
00:07:32,864 --> 00:07:34,939
will almost inevitably lead

189
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:36,289
to poor adhesion. 

190
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,264
The thin film 
deposition process itself

191
00:07:39,327 --> 00:07:40,752
also plays a role

192
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,802
if there is a strong
or weak adhesion.

193
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:44,777
For instance,

194
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,314
in sputtering, 

195
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:48,552
highly energetic ions and atoms

196
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,377
knock out surface contamination

197
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,452
and loosely bound atoms.

198
00:07:52,527 --> 00:07:54,789
This enhances the adhesion a lot.

199
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:55,764
Thus,

200
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,777
sputtered films tend to have

201
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:58,939
a better adhesion

202
00:07:58,989 --> 00:08:01,727
compared to films formed
by evaporation.

203
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:04,939
However, as explained 
in the previous slide

204
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,964
sometimes it is not possible

205
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:09,527
to grow a thin film 
of a desired material

206
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,739
directly on the given substrate

207
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,439
because of thermodynamics. 

208
00:08:14,264 --> 00:08:17,077
Examples are the cases
of noble metals,

209
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:19,702
which are inert and do not react
by nature.

210
00:08:20,248 --> 00:08:21,310
As a result,

211
00:08:21,373 --> 00:08:24,898
they do not adhere well
to silicon or SiO2.

212
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,898
So, what to do?

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,335
To deposit noble metals,

214
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,773
adhesion layers 
are therefore required.

215
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,598
These adhesion layers,

216
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,148
which are chosen according
to their ability

217
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:37,648
to make chemical bonds,

218
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,848
consist of few 
nanometers-thick films

219
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:43,398
deposited just 
before the noble metal,

220
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,135
in the same vacuum chamber.

221
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,610
This ensures

222
00:08:46,648 --> 00:08:49,560
that we have 
a clean interface 

223
00:08:49,623 --> 00:08:51,473
and substrate.

224
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,360
Two common pairs

225
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,185
of adhesion noble materials

226
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:56,735
in micro and nano fabrication

227
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,135
are titania and platinum

228
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,185
as well as

229
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,423
chrome and gold.

230
00:09:02,064 --> 00:09:03,377
Here is the example

231
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:05,314
that shows the silicon substrate

232
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:06,564
with the chrome

233
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:07,764
adhesion layer, 

234
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,727
and then the deposited gold,

235
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,177
that is now well-adhering

236
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,177
to the substrate.

237
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,072
This photo here, 
on the right side,

238
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,147
actually shows

239
00:09:18,172 --> 00:09:19,497
a failure process.

240
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:23,285
A 500 nm thick
chrome layer

241
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,735
aimed as electrical conductor

242
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,648
to drive current 
with bimorph actuator

243
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:31,023
has poor adhesion to the substrate,

244
00:09:31,023 --> 00:09:32,235
and is detached, 

245
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,685
or delaminated, how we call it,

246
00:09:34,723 --> 00:09:35,710
from the substrate.

247
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:38,673
You can see this
in this optical microscope

248
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:42,098
This is either due to poor adhesion,

249
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,685
and/or to high intrinsic stress,

250
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:45,985
 both.

251
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,298
This will eventually lead
to the complete failure

252
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,135
of the device

253
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,035
and needs to be overcome.

254
00:09:53,689 --> 00:09:55,564
To test thin film adhesion

255
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:57,526
a first, straightforward test

256
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,151
called the "tape-pull test",

257
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:00,464
can be performed.

258
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,376
A standard office tape

259
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:06,126
is attached to the wafer 
and then pulled off.

260
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:08,426
If the film peels off

261
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:09,414
with the tape,

262
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,814
then adhesion is not good enough,

263
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:14,051
and process or adhesion layer

264
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,626
should be modified.

265
00:10:22,937 --> 00:10:24,387
In the second example,

266
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,000
we added 10 nm chrome,

267
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,112
between the silicone nitrate

268
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,912
and the added 100 nm of gold film,

269
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,287
and as you can see,

270
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:36,175
now the gold film adheres very well,

271
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:38,750
under the tape-pull test.

272
00:10:39,685 --> 00:10:40,835
There are, of course,

273
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,835
more sophisticated equipment

274
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,010
that measure the adhesion 
of thin films.

275
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:47,060
But for first order information,

276
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,498
this tape-test is very convenient.

277
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,111
Now let us have a closer look

278
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,861
how the thin film grow

279
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,723
classify the modes, 

280
00:10:57,786 --> 00:11:00,248
and identify 
the important parameters

281
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,673
 on which this depends.

282
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:04,386
The 2D,

283
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:06,048
or layer-by-layer mode,

284
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,286
also called 
Frank - van der Merwe mode,

285
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:12,161
occurs when the adatoms,

286
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:15,011
here in orange,

287
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:18,051
bond more strongly 
with the substrate

288
00:11:18,088 --> 00:11:20,038
than with other atoms

289
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:20,938
and

290
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:23,526
when they have 
enough energy and time

291
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:27,188
to diffuse around to the energetic
minimum location.

292
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:29,338
This is the case

293
00:11:29,413 --> 00:11:31,001
in ALD,

294
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:32,213
MBE,

295
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:34,013
and also PLD.

296
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:36,842
Here, 

297
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:39,254
we have a relatively slow 
growth rate,

298
00:11:39,317 --> 00:11:41,429
so that the atoms have time

299
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,242
to rearrange themselves

300
00:11:43,317 --> 00:11:46,792
before the atoms
for the second layer are coming.

301
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,290
The second growth mode is the 3D,

302
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:51,240
or island mode.

303
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:52,240
Also called,

304
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,577
Volmer - Weber Mode.

305
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,066
It typically occurs

306
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:57,341
during the deposition 
of metal atoms

307
00:11:57,379 --> 00:11:58,604
onto an insulator,

308
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:01,991
since bonds between 
metal atoms are stronger

309
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,479
than bonds between 
insulator and metal atoms.

310
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,404
In the island mode,

311
00:12:08,454 --> 00:12:12,454
surface atoms have enough
energy and time to diffuse around

312
00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:15,141
but not as much as in the 2D mode;

313
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:18,791
because the growth rate 
is higher than the previous case.

314
00:12:18,841 --> 00:12:20,304
As a result,

315
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,004
a few surface atoms nuclei together

316
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,366
and form clusters,

317
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:25,341
or islands.

318
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:26,341
At some point,

319
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,079
islands merge together,

320
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,286
and a uniform film.

321
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
For films formed 
by sputtering and evaporation,

322
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:38,040
a continuous thin film forms

323
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:40,415
at around 10 to 20 nm thickness.

324
00:12:40,955 --> 00:12:42,992
Before this threshold value

325
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,855
the film does yet not cover 
the entire surface.

326
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,492
Island more typically occurs

327
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,330
with sputtering deposition

328
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,642
or with evaporation

329
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:52,430
when the substrate is heated.

330
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:53,980
A mixed mode, 

331
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:57,180
combining 2D and 3D mode

332
00:12:57,217 --> 00:12:58,217
also exists.

333
00:12:58,242 --> 00:13:01,605
It is then called 
the Stranski - Krastanov mode.

334
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,242
Finally,

335
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:07,792
when the surface atoms' energy
and mobility is low,

336
00:13:07,842 --> 00:13:10,480
atoms stick where they land,

337
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:13,117
and islands are not able
to merge together.

338
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:16,460
In this last mode,

339
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:18,485
which is called the columnar mode,

340
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:21,048
grains grow upwards

341
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,132
and voids between the grains

342
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:26,095
can remain.

343
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,830
Columnar mode typically takes place

344
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,580
when the deposition is performed

345
00:13:30,605 --> 00:13:31,867
 at room temperature.

346
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:35,979
The growth mode determines

347
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,666
the way in which the film forms.

348
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,967
For us as users,

349
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,955
what is more important
is actually

350
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,455
the resulting film 
intrinsic structure.

351
00:13:44,517 --> 00:13:46,055
It plays a key role

352
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,805
for many physical properties
of the thin film.

353
00:13:48,892 --> 00:13:50,742
Such as electrical band structure,

354
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:51,930
conductivity,

355
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,317
hardness,

356
00:13:53,367 --> 00:13:54,280
transparency,

357
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:56,692
and piezoelectric properties.

358
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,341
The first important 
question to ask is,

359
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,341
if the film is amorphous

360
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,254
polycrystalline or monocrystalline?

361
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:07,729
As a rule of thumb,

362
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,841
thin films made of silicon

363
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,741
covalently bonding materials,

364
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,629
compounds and alloys

365
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:14,966
are often amorphous

366
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:18,166
If no special precaution 
is taken during the deposition.

367
00:14:19,035 --> 00:14:20,823
Metals, on the other side,

368
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,573
are often polycrystalline. 

369
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,498
In order to grow 
monocrystalline films

370
00:14:25,548 --> 00:14:27,948
very special deposition techniques,

371
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,160
such as MBE or PLD,

372
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:30,985
are required.

373
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,185
However, it is sometimes difficult

374
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,848
to predict the exact structure 
of the thin film,

375
00:14:35,898 --> 00:14:39,160
as it depends on 
so many several parameters.

376
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:41,110
Such as the material itself,

377
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:42,935
the deposition method,

378
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,260
and the process.

379
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:46,848
In case of sputtering of metals,

380
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:47,723
for instance,

381
00:14:47,773 --> 00:14:49,410
a well-known model,

382
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,723
called the Thornton's Zone model

383
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:52,660
shown here,

384
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:53,873
can be used.

385
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:56,547
It shows in empirical diagrams

386
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:58,760
the morphology of thin films

387
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,410
as a function of 
the chamber pressure,

388
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,472
shown here on this axis,

389
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,760
and the substrate temperature (T).

390
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,497
Normalized by the melting 
temperature of the thin film (Tm),

391
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:11,297
shown here.

392
00:15:11,497 --> 00:15:13,297
Sputtered metal thin films

393
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:15,672
have a poorly crystalline structure.

394
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:20,045
At high pressure,

395
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:22,645
or low temperature,

396
00:15:22,682 --> 00:15:25,357
(zone one),

397
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:28,370
atoms do not have much 
energy to diffuse around.

398
00:15:29,034 --> 00:15:31,259
Which results in columnar grains.

399
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,084
We see them here.

400
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:36,791
Usually this leads to porous films

401
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,916
with tensile stress

402
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:40,403
unless oxygen is present 
in the chamber, 

403
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:43,016
which leads to compressed stress
in the film. 

404
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:46,766
At lower pressure 
and higher temperature

405
00:15:47,953 --> 00:15:50,603
impinging atoms are more energetic

406
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,941
and can knock out
loosely attached atoms,

407
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,091
and diffuse on the surface.

408
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:57,491
This results in denser films

409
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,953
with compressive stress.

410
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:00,316
Simultaneously,

411
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:02,028
the film grain structure moves

412
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:04,703
from zone 1 to the zone T,

413
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:05,753
for transition,

414
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,803
and zone 2,

415
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,603
where the grains are larger.

416
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:11,454
At some point,

417
00:16:11,491 --> 00:16:13,616
if the temperature
is further increased

418
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:16,816
the film's crystal structure
reaches zone 3,

419
00:16:16,854 --> 00:16:19,704
where annealing occurs,

420
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:21,991
and the film loses memory

421
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,804
of the deposition process,

422
00:16:23,854 --> 00:16:26,904
as it is called in technical terms,

423
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:28,791
In the case of sputtered aluminum,

424
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:29,979
typical grain size

425
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:32,679
can go up to 0.5 µm

426
00:16:32,729 --> 00:16:35,341
and can be in the order 
of the film thickness.

427
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:38,904
Processes which depend 
on grain boundaries

428
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:41,504
such as diffusion
and electromigration,

429
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,766
are strongly affected by the ratio

430
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:44,954
between grain size

431
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,091
and the characteristic dimensions

432
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:49,204
of the thin film in the microdevice.

433
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:51,476
For some materials,

434
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,264
the film crystal structure

435
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:55,364
does not change continuously

436
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,301
as described 
in Thornton's zone model.

437
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:02,301
Instead, it changes abruptly

438
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,264
due to a phased change

439
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:06,239
occurring at specific temperatures.

440
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:08,614
An example of such a material

441
00:17:08,651 --> 00:17:09,901
is tantalum.

442
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,823
Finally,

443
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,135
it is relevant to note

444
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,573
that the texture 
of the added thin film

445
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,860
is inherited 
from the underlying film.

446
00:17:17,948 --> 00:17:19,785
Seed layers are, therefore,

447
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:21,385
often used to obtain

448
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:23,285
a validifying crystal orientation

449
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,898
on the subsequent deposition

450
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,410
of a thicker film.

451
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,373
You will remember

452
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,760
 the case study 
of the bimorph actuated

453
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,135
that we saw in one
of the introduction lessons

454
00:17:33,198 --> 00:17:33,860
of this book.

455
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,748
After the (INAUDIBLE)
release of the beams

456
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:39,623
the cantilevers did not remain flat,

457
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,923
 but were bent upwards.

458
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:45,655
This is due to residual stress

459
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,118
in the thin films 

460
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,568
resulting from 
the different process steps.

461
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:52,586
Let's now have a more extensive look

462
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,324
at the different kinds of stress

463
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,774
that exist in the thin films,

464
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,561
and to their origin.

465
00:17:59,749 --> 00:18:01,486
As mentioned in the previous slide,

466
00:18:01,524 --> 00:18:04,511
the deposition method
and the process parameters

467
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,061
influence the crystal structure
of the thin film.

468
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:08,174
In addition,

469
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:09,299
they also influence

470
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,611
the residual stress 
in the thin films.

471
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,711
Stress in thin films

472
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:15,849
can be divided in two categories:

473
00:18:16,811 --> 00:18:18,761
Extrinsic stress

474
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:20,986
and Intrinsic stress.

475
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:23,899
Extrinsic stress results

476
00:18:23,961 --> 00:18:25,849
from a mismatch between the film

477
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:29,224
and the substrate's 
coefficient of thermal expansion, 

478
00:18:29,286 --> 00:18:30,061
CTE.

479
00:18:30,886 --> 00:18:33,361
If both the film and the substrate

480
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:35,474
undergo the same 
temperature difference

481
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,911
a simple formula, shown here,

482
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:39,336
describes the stress

483
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:41,174
which is directly proportional

484
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:42,661
to the difference between

485
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,436
the two expansion coefficients

486
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:47,149
and to the change in temperature.

487
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,624
Such a situation occurs,

488
00:18:49,699 --> 00:18:50,511
for instance,

489
00:18:50,536 --> 00:18:53,074
during cooling after a CVD process.

490
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,578
Indeed, during CVD,

491
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,215
the film and the substrate

492
00:18:57,265 --> 00:18:59,378
are at the same 
elevated temperature.

493
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,178
By convention,

494
00:19:01,253 --> 00:19:03,603
a negative stress is compressive

495
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:04,515
and generally

496
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:06,678
extrinsic stresses are uniform

497
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,128
over the film thickness.

498
00:19:09,003 --> 00:19:10,628
Finally, it is worth mentioning

499
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,715
that most materials 
used in microfabrication

500
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:17,328
have a higher CTE value than silicon

501
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:20,240
except SiO2, silicon nitrate,

502
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,265
and diamond.

503
00:19:22,864 --> 00:19:23,939
On the other hand,

504
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:27,689
intrinsic stress is less understood.

505
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,689
There is no simple theory

506
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,339
that allows computing them.

507
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:33,251
The understanding relies

508
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:34,776
on empirical results.

509
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:38,016
Intrinsic stress is closely related

510
00:19:38,078 --> 00:19:39,591
to the film material,

511
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:40,778
and microstructure,

512
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:42,753
as well as to the deposition method

513
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:43,978
and parameters.

514
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,053
For instance,

515
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,328
a lattice mismatch between the film

516
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,241
and the substrate,

517
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,141
or the incorporation of voids

518
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:52,266
and foreign atoms

519
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,328
generate intrinsic stress.

520
00:19:54,966 --> 00:19:56,328
On the contrary,

521
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:59,528
bombarding the substrate 
during the deposition

522
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:02,166
pinches of loosely attached atoms

523
00:20:02,216 --> 00:20:03,903
which can reduce stress.

524
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:07,878
And intrinsic stress is not uniform 
over the film thickness.

525
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:10,728
Which creates stress gradience.

526
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:15,016
These gradients are inducing 
the banding of cantilevers.

527
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,216
Even if they are made 
of a single layer material.

528
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:21,947
Intrinsic stress 
can be partially removed 

529
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,659
by means of an annealing step.

530
00:20:24,509 --> 00:20:26,359
The total stress in a thin film

531
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:30,334
is equal to the sum of the extrinsic
and the intrinsic stress.

532
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,809
Usually films deposited 
by evaporation

533
00:20:33,847 --> 00:20:35,934
result in tensile stress.

534
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,747
Stress in sputtered films

535
00:20:37,797 --> 00:20:39,534
depend on many parameters,

536
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,609
such as bias power,

537
00:20:40,634 --> 00:20:41,784
or argon pressure,

538
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,322
sputtering gas masks,

539
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,584
substrate temperature
and deposition rate.

540
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,122
As a guideline,

541
00:20:48,184 --> 00:20:49,922
sputtering at low pressure

542
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:51,934
at about 1 millitorr

543
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,709
usually results 
in compressive stress.

544
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:57,159
While sputtering at higher pressure,

545
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:58,597
10 millitorr,

546
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:01,197
usually results in tensile stress.

547
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:03,834
Depositing sequential layers

548
00:21:03,872 --> 00:21:05,872
with tensile and compressive stress

549
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,959
enables to perform 
stress compensation.

550
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,072
Residual stress in thin films

551
00:21:13,122 --> 00:21:15,822
leads to substrate 
or device curvature.

552
00:21:16,372 --> 00:21:18,434
To qualitatively understand why,

553
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:20,747
let's consider the schematics

554
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,347
on the top left corner 
of this slide.

555
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:26,384
This is the case corresponding

556
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,284
to an extrinsic tensile stress.

557
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,215
If a thin film,

558
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,127
here in yellow,

559
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,240
is deposited by operation

560
00:21:35,265 --> 00:21:37,102
on a substrate, here in grey,

561
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:39,215
at room temperature, for instance,

562
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:42,540
the film, which is initially hot

563
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,702
shrinks more relatively 
to the substrate,

564
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:46,990
which is cold.

565
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,124
However, the lateral dimension

566
00:21:49,187 --> 00:21:51,962
of the substrate 
and of the thin film

567
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:53,012
have to be the same.

568
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:54,742
Therefore,

569
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:57,280
film is under tensile stress

570
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,867
while the substrate 
is under compressor stress.

571
00:22:01,355 --> 00:22:04,630
Shown here,
in this second line of the drawing.

572
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,980
To satisfy the sum 
of the force's equilibrium,

573
00:22:10,017 --> 00:22:11,730
the tensile force in the film

574
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,380
is equal to the compressive force
in the substrate.

575
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,505
However,
the mechanical equilibrium

576
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,692
is not satisfied yet;

577
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,092
because the sum of the moment.

578
00:22:21,692 --> 00:22:24,555
Thus, the wafer and the film bend

579
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:27,080
in a concave way,

580
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:29,592
for the case of tensile thin films.

581
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:30,817
Indeed,

582
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,842
the film tends to retrieve

583
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:35,517
its shorter, unstressed state.

584
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,986
In the case 
of compressive thin films,

585
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,573
in the top right corner,

586
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,923
the same reasoning leads
to convex bending

587
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,611
of the film.

588
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:49,548
It is worth to notice that

589
00:22:49,586 --> 00:22:51,811
if a wafer with a thin film

590
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:53,223
were manually bent,

591
00:22:53,273 --> 00:22:56,023
a tensile stress in the thin film

592
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:59,111
would occur in the case
of a convex shape.

593
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:00,748
It is the opposite, then, 

594
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:02,123
for residual stresses.

595
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,011
Tensile stress

596
00:23:04,061 --> 00:23:06,711
in thin films leads to cracks

597
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,236
while compressive stress

598
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,773
leads to buckling.

599
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:13,324
The well-known Stoney equation

600
00:23:13,362 --> 00:23:15,037
quantitatively relates

601
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:17,562
the way a curvature 
to the residual stress is

602
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:18,937
in the thin film.`

603
00:23:18,974 --> 00:23:22,549
By measuring the radius
of curvature of the wafer

604
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,324
before and after the film deposition

605
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:26,887
and knowing the substrate

606
00:23:26,937 --> 00:23:28,374
and film thicknesses,

607
00:23:28,437 --> 00:23:30,137
it is possible to compute

608
00:23:30,162 --> 00:23:32,387
the average stress in the thin film.

609
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,737
Here we see 2 SEM images

610
00:23:36,762 --> 00:23:38,862
showing 2 different 
cantilever arrays.

611
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,162
In both cases,

612
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,587
we have free-standing SiO2 films,

613
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,562
1.1 µm thick

614
00:23:45,637 --> 00:23:47,287
grown by thermal oxidation

615
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:49,562
at 1050° C.

616
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:52,862
They are between 40 and 200 µm long.

617
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:55,912
The bilayer microcantilevers
 were obtained 

618
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:59,112
after an additional Ti (left)

619
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:01,287
and Al (right)

620
00:24:01,324 --> 00:24:04,487
that was deposited 
onto the SiO2 cantilevers. 

621
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:06,687
The Al films with thicknesses

622
00:24:06,774 --> 00:24:09,562
 ranging from 0.3 to 1.7 µm

623
00:24:09,612 --> 00:24:11,987
were deposited using
thermal evaporation.

624
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,187
In addition, the titanium films
were with thickness

625
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,711
ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 µm

626
00:24:17,774 --> 00:24:20,461
were deposited using 
electron beam evaporation.

627
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:22,449
The SEM images here show

628
00:24:22,486 --> 00:24:24,811
the bilayer microcantilever array

629
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:26,461
and their respective bending

630
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:28,024
due to  intrinsic stress.

631
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:30,327
In the case of titanium,

632
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,189
it bends upwards,

633
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,639
and in the case of aluminum

634
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:35,127
it bends downwards.

635
00:24:35,177 --> 00:24:36,189
In both cases,

636
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,077
we have SiO2,

637
00:24:38,127 --> 00:24:40,927
S material plus titanium.

638
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:43,864
And here we have the SiO2
plus the aluminum.

639
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,487
So we can obtain

640
00:24:45,537 --> 00:24:47,724
different types of stresses

641
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:49,662
in free-standing cantilevers,

642
00:24:49,712 --> 00:24:52,862
by playing with different 
material compositions.

643
00:24:54,512 --> 00:24:56,062
In this chapter we first saw

644
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,724
that depending on the chemistry,

645
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,837
that the deposition method
and the process parameters,

646
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,662
atoms can either be chemisorbed

647
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:04,799
or physisorbed at the wafer surface.

648
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,674
Once arrived on the surface

649
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:08,999
the atoms stay, move or desorb.

650
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:11,399
Once the film starts to grow,

651
00:25:11,449 --> 00:25:12,749
an important parameter

652
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:14,574
is to film substrate interface.

653
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:16,324
Will the film adhere or not?

654
00:25:16,374 --> 00:25:18,137
To answer this question,

655
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,374
thermodynamics allows 
computing interface stability 

656
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,974
and several types 
of different interfaces 

657
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,699
were shown in this lesson. 

658
00:25:26,199 --> 00:25:27,149
We have seen that

659
00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:28,337
all following factors

660
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,312
influence the thin film adhesion:

661
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,199
Interface compatibility,

662
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:33,712
substrate cleanness 

663
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:35,099
and deposition method,

664
00:25:35,174 --> 00:25:36,699
as well as adhesion layers.

665
00:25:37,224 --> 00:25:39,499
Film growth can be categorized

666
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:40,799
into different modes,

667
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:44,312
which are 2D, 3D 
and columnar modes.

668
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:45,749
These modes,

669
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,262
as well as the resulting

670
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:48,599
film crystal structure

671
00:25:48,637 --> 00:25:49,824
are strongly dependent

672
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:51,212
on the deposited material,

673
00:25:51,274 --> 00:25:52,762
the deposition method,

674
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,162
as well as 
on the process parameters.

675
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:57,537
There is no general theory

676
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,912
that allows determining 

677
00:25:58,962 --> 00:26:01,449
the final crystal structure
of a thin film.

678
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:04,649
Some empirical data
can sometimes be used,

679
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:08,974
but most of the time, 
trial and error method is required. 

680
00:26:09,174 --> 00:26:10,124
Finally,

681
00:26:10,187 --> 00:26:12,537
as a signature 
of the deposition method

682
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,049
and process parameters,

683
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,512
residual stress in thin film

684
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:17,712
was also studied.

685
00:26:18,686 --> 00:26:20,298
Extrinsic stress

686
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:22,673
is differentiated 
from intrinsic stress,

687
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:25,198
and the final total average stress

688
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,198
in a thin film

689
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:28,286
can be related to 
the ranges of curvature

690
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:31,023
of the wafer using
the Stoney equation.

691
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,061
With this lesson,

692
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:35,873
we close the chapter on
physical vapor deposition.
