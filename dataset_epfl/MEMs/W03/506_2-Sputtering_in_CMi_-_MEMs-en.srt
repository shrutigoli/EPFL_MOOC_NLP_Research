1
00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:06,681
The sputtering system that 
you see here is called

2
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:08,118
a cluster sputtering tool.

3
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,814
In this case with 4  of the 
precision chambers

4
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:14,314
allowing you to pass wafers to
various sputtering chambers without 

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,676
breaking the vacuum.

6
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,397
Per sputter process step, only one

7
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:21,297
wafer is used per chamber in this
particular equipment.

8
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:25,312
Wafers are loaded in the load lock
chamber of the system from behind

9
00:00:25,362 --> 00:00:27,862
the wall on the right side
of the image.

10
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:30,958
Then a robotic arm located in the

11
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,770
centre of the tool transfers the 

12
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:34,698
wafers from the load lock into one

13
00:00:34,723 --> 00:00:36,235
of the 4 sputtering chambers.

14
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:38,659
The robotic arm enters into the

15
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:40,784
load lock, moves up to lift the 

16
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:42,672
wafer from the chuck,  leaves the

17
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,609
load lock and distributes the wafer

18
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,453
in the desired sputtering chamber.

19
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:51,111
Let's now have a further look at the

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,899
inside of the tool and see how

21
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,507
the clean room engineer changes the
sputter target.

22
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,071
Remember the target is a plate

23
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:59,806
made of the material that we want to

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,777
sputter deposit on our substrate. 

25
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:04,451
In that specific case, the target

26
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:06,318
which is changed, is used for

27
00:01:06,355 --> 00:01:07,918
RF magnetron sputtering.

28
00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:10,111
You can see the RF generator

29
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,511
the grey metallic box

30
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,964
and the magnet, the black cylinders.

31
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:16,215
The other 3 chambers are DC

32
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,047
magneton sputtering with only the

33
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:20,484
magnet and no RF generator.

34
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,117
The first step when changing the

35
00:01:23,148 --> 00:01:24,973
target is to remove 
the target shield.

36
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:26,884
This shield is used to avoid

37
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,921
sputtering of the structural elements

38
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:31,646
 of the cathode and to improve
gas diffusion.

39
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:34,957
Then the target itself can be 
removed.

40
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:38,492
The home made tool is used to remove
the target in order to allow

41
00:01:38,692 --> 00:01:41,267
a single person to perform
this manipulation.

42
00:01:41,598 --> 00:01:45,210
In this specific case, the target 
is made of titania.

43
00:01:45,723 --> 00:01:49,885
It is changed not because it is worn
out,  but because we need to  sput

44
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:52,160
another material in this
particular chamber.

45
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:55,181
We can also see that a copper grid

46
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,040
is used at the back of the target

47
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,305
to ensure a good electrical contact.

48
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:02,321
When a sputter target is worn out

49
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:03,995
it also needs to be changed.

50
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,592
This operation is shown here

51
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,788
which also shows nicely how a 

52
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:10,831
sputter target in magnetron 
sputtering looks after some use.

53
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:15,590
The wear, clearly is not uniform,
because of the magnetic field

54
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:19,277
which concentrates ions along
magnetic field lines so that they

55
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:20,791
optimise the sputter yield.

56
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,590
In comparison, here are shown new

57
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:26,569
sputter targets where the surface
is still uniform.

58
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,614
The two examples shown in the video

59
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:32,222
are aluminum oxide and silicon
dioxide new targets.

60
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,490
To mount a target in the tool

61
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,803
the operation steps shown in this video

62
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,825
sequence are performed in the exact
reverse order.
