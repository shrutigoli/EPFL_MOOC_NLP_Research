1
00:00:04,674 --> 00:00:08,549
Now let's have a look in detail
how the film forms on the surface.

2
00:00:08,774 --> 00:00:11,187
As mentioned before, the long
mean free path

3
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:14,030
allows for very directional flux
of evaporant.

4
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:17,751
This has an effect for surfaces
that are not perfectly flat

5
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:21,018
as often encountered in MEMS
and microfabrication

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:23,746
with 3D surface features.

7
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:28,621
The left image shows a situation
for a type of surface structures

8
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,359
in grey ,

9
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:34,456
that has to be coated
by the thin film in green

10
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,065
with the source coming from
the bottom.

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,689
Now, by simple geometrical
consideration,

12
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,317
one can already see that
on the flat part,

13
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:47,976
that is facing the source, we
obtain the target of thickness t1,

14
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:52,703
whereas on the sloped part
of the structure,

15
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:59,190
we have a thickness of only about
one third of the target thickness

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,588
in the case of an angle
of 70 degrees like shown here.

17
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,358
This can be calculated simply by
a geometrical considerations.

18
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:15,649
Another important cases of x,
position of the wafer

19
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:19,284
which we always have in this sought
of arrangement,

20
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:24,279
is that if we have surface features
we can create

21
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,962
a shadow effect because
of the directionality of the beam.

22
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:33,657
which can not deposit
on the lee side of this structure.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,885
Consequently, there is a much
thicker film deposited

24
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:42,104
on the slope, facing the source,
than on the slopes

25
00:01:42,317 --> 00:01:45,205
that are under an angle
to the source

26
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,027
or actually invisible
to the source.

27
00:01:48,231 --> 00:01:52,606
To overcome this important drawback,
modern evaporator tools

28
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:57,898
are equipped with rotating
planetary systems as shown here

29
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:01,527
which repositions the wafers
during the evaporation

30
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,297
and to cancel the four
mentioned effects.

31
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:08,559
Thus, every wafer
in the planetary system

32
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,180
receives the exact same amount
of material under various angles

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,980
which yields a well controlled
film thickness

34
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:20,061
across a wafer's surface,
and from wafer to wafer in a batch.

35
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,324
In addition to the basic
configuration

36
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:25,924
of a thermal evaporator,
there are some other features

37
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:29,558
that have been incorporated
for better control and monitoring.

38
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,850
One of them is the
mechanical shutter shown here

39
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:37,111
that blocks the flux between
the crucible

40
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:41,134
and the wafers and allows
for very precise timing

41
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,197
of the deposition.

42
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:47,155
It's much more precise than
switching on and off the heat source

43
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,871
Another important feature
is the thin film monitor,

44
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,844
typically a quartz crystal
microbalance that measures

45
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,040
the added mass which can then
be used to reduce

46
00:02:57,234 --> 00:03:00,959
the thickness that has been added on
each of the wafer.

47
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:04,790
We can furthermore control
the temperature of the substrate

48
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:08,340
either by cooling or heating
which has an important influence

49
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:12,024
on the film morphology
as the thin film gross.

50
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,688
Further, we can always control
the pressure in the chamber

51
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:19,978
and also inlet some specific gases
for reactive evaporation.

52
00:03:20,176 --> 00:03:25,113
All these features have an influence
on the stress of the thin-film

53
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,670
as it grows on the surface
and can be optimized

54
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:33,824
if one knows how they influence
the growth mechanism.

55
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:37,267
Here on this photograph,
you can see the inside

56
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:41,112
of one of our clean room
thermal evaporators.

57
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:43,644
On the bottom you can see
the crucible

58
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,302
with the mechanic shutter,
and on top,

59
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:50,512
you can see the wafer holder system
that holds a couple of wafers

60
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,886
for thin film coating.

61
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:57,917
And here you can see a close up
photograph the crucible area

62
00:03:58,145 --> 00:04:00,745
with the mechanical shutters.

63
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:03,386
More details of these
equipment aspects

64
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,730
will be shown later
in a dedicated video

65
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,745
taken in our clean room.

66
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:11,228
So now that we have seen
the basic principles

67
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,879
and equipment aspects
of thermal evaporation,

68
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:16,829
let's have a look at
some characteristics examples.

69
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,183
I want to show you in particular
the so called lift off technique

70
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:22,316
and then stencil lithography.

71
00:04:22,476 --> 00:04:25,851
They both rely and benefit
from the long mean free path

72
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:30,397
and shadowing effect
that we can obtain in thermal PVD.

73
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:33,747
Let's have a look at the lift off
which is a particular example

74
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:36,920
where thermal of evaporation PVD
is very useful.

75
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:41,927
Lift off is done typically
on a substrate like shown here,

76
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:46,976
like a silicon wafer
that has been coated

77
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:53,304
with a layer of photoresist
and pattern by lithography,

78
00:04:54,606 --> 00:04:57,656
it is that photoresist layer
that has an opening

79
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,431
by lithography and development
and now we come

80
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:09,054
with the source that is far a way,
that emits chromium

81
00:05:09,753 --> 00:05:16,165
as material in a vacuum chamber,
which deposits now

82
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:18,167
all over the surface

83
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:24,754
and forms a film which has more
or less this shape

84
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:27,991
But this is chrome.

85
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,692
You notice now that the photoresist
was designed to have

86
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:34,417
a certain sloped angle
which prevents

87
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:37,374
that the direction of flux
of materials creates a breech

88
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:40,601
from the part of the film
that is on the photoresist

89
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:42,990
and part that is directly
on the substrate.

90
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:47,573
Now the extra lift of this then,
the stripping of the photoresist,

91
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,834
which is a liquid, a solvent,
that can penetrate

92
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:54,278
through the openings and start
to remove the photoresist

93
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,365
from this part and removes
everything

94
00:05:56,558 --> 00:05:58,833
that is also on top of it.

95
00:06:01,572 --> 00:06:03,972
And the same on this side.

96
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,095
Which leaves us at the end...

97
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:12,712
the chrome pattern that we want

98
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:15,243
and this chrome pattern
now has been made

99
00:06:15,413 --> 00:06:18,063
simply by one lithography
and deposition

100
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,810
without the need for etching.

101
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,742
Some materials are indeed
very difficult to etch

102
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:26,136
so the lift off is a very
convenient way

103
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:29,933
to create micro and nano patterns
by this technique.

104
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:35,862
Here you can a live demonstration of
a lift-off step in our clean room.

105
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:39,342
A glass wafer has previously
been patterned with a photoresist

106
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:43,403
and then coated by PVD evaporation
with a thin film of chrome.

107
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:48,132
When placing wafer in a solvent,
for example, Acetone,

108
00:06:48,794 --> 00:06:51,181
that photoresist dissolves
after some time

109
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:54,146
and also removes the metal layer
on top of it.

110
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,328
This lift off process takes
a few seconds

111
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,818
depending on the materials involved
and the dimensions.

112
00:07:00,037 --> 00:07:02,975
It helps to mechanically
move the wafer in the bath.

113
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:06,242
Also ultrasound can be applied
in some cases .

114
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:09,522
In this step, the appearance
of  the pattern metal structures

115
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:11,503
become visible.

116
00:07:11,688 --> 00:07:14,638
At the end, the glass substrate
is rinsed with the solvent

117
00:07:14,846 --> 00:07:17,483
to remove remaining residues
on the surface,

118
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,650
then rinsed in the high water
and finally dry it for further use.

119
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:27,644
The second example that benefits
from the long mean free path

120
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:31,388
and the shadow effect
in PVD in Stencil Lithography

121
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,614
which is shown here
where a very thin membrane

122
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:39,344
with apertures is approached
close to then surface to be coated

123
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:43,491
and then when we get
material evaporated

124
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:46,411
with a very directional flux,

125
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:50,208
there is the deposition
of the material on the stencil

126
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:55,386
but also through the apertures
on the substrate

127
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:57,159
like shown here.

128
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,942
The third step would then be
remove the stencils

129
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:05,066
simply mechanically
and the surface features

130
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:09,635
are create without any further heat
or chemical processes

131
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:12,781
which makes this technique
very suitable for partnering

132
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:14,719
fragile  substrate.

133
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:20,547
In the animation, you can see now
how the, material is deposited

134
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:22,498
through the stencil
on the surface

135
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,296
leaving their features
and the second step here

136
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,946
also shows that this stencil
technique can be used

137
00:08:28,126 --> 00:08:29,951
for local etching.

138
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,132
Here you see photos
of our clean room equipment

139
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,087
from thermal evaporation.

140
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,363
One the left side is shown
the front panel with a loading port

141
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,193
and the control panel.

142
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:44,823
On the right photo you see
how the equipment looks

143
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,094
from the back side
with all the connections

144
00:08:47,324 --> 00:08:50,324
for pumps, heat sources,
monitors, et cetera.

145
00:08:51,566 --> 00:08:54,978
A sophisticated equipment like this
has many features

146
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:59,361
as yo can see here, an e-beam source
with the pockets

147
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:03,067
for various materials,
resistive heating,

148
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:06,231
then here is your list
of possible materials

149
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,355
that can be evaporated
in faction equipment, it can hold

150
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:13,486
the four and six inch wafers.

151
00:09:13,671 --> 00:09:17,734
It has a very large distance between
the source and the substrate,

152
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,547
more than one meter
and you remember this is important

153
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:24,508
for the directionality and shadow,
and which is therefore

154
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,752
very good for lift off,

155
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:31,459
it can deposit from
room temperatures to 200 degrees,

156
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:34,761
and it has a very strong pump
to reach a vacuum

157
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,595
in the order 10 to -6,
10 to -7 Torr.

158
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,750
And it has  the before
mentioned quartz,

159
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,880
crystal deposition rate monitor.

160
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:48,286
This concludes this part of the PVD
lesson on thermal evaporation.

161
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:51,347
You have seen that it is the first
and simple technique

162
00:09:51,562 --> 00:09:53,687
to call the wafer with
a thin material film.

163
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:57,570
There is no surface damage,
it is done in a vacuum

164
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:59,832
which yields higher purity films.

165
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:03,868
No atoms from the atmosphere
are integrated into the film.

166
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:08,055
Limitations come from the shadowing
poor step coverage

167
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:12,484
of high aspect ratio status,
non uniformity over large areas

168
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:15,049
and a difficult to evaporate
compounds

169
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:19,353
because of their decomposition
or face change at high temperature.

170
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:21,797
So let's now have a look
in the clean room

171
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:24,924
how such an equipment
is operated in details.

172
