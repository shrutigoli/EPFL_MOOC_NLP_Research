1
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:07,543
This is our introductory lesson 
on wet etching

2
00:00:07,543 --> 00:00:11,885
where one uses liquid chemical baths
to etch away materials.

3
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:18,126
Wet etching can be used to etch away
thin films that are locally not protected

4
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:22,276
by a mask. But one can also etch 
through thick substrates.

5
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:26,144
In the present lesson we will 
introduce several topics

6
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:30,295
which will be more completely 
discussed in upcoming lessons.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:35,959
We will introduce anisotropic etching 
of silicon substrates

8
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:39,609
where certain lattice planes
are etched and others not.

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:43,358
We will discuss isotropic 
etching baths of silicon

10
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:48,371
and finally how we can make 
thin membranes using wet etching.

11
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,079
We will then discuss applications 
of wet etching,

12
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:56,081
such as wafer cleaning,
removal of sacrificial

13
00:00:56,081 --> 00:01:01,082
layers underneath a functional layer 
to realize free-standing structures

14
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:06,035
as has already been presented
in a previous lesson on dry etching.

15
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:09,613
Finally we will discuss
electrochemical etching

16
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:13,343
of silicon substrates 
for making porous silicon.

17
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:17,466
As the name <i>wet etching</i> says,

18
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:21,186
we will use a liquid 
bath for removing material.

19
00:01:21,779 --> 00:01:25,793
Chemical baths exist
for all type of materials,

20
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:30,206
like metals, oxides,
polymers and so on.

21
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,954
As there is a chemical reaction involved,

22
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:37,864
the different stages
of an etching process involve,

23
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:42,164
first, the transport 
of the etching solution

24
00:01:42,165 --> 00:01:44,138
to the material to be etched.

25
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:48,678
And this can be done by diffusion
or by agitation in the bath

26
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,959
which is faster than a purely 
diffusion-like transport.

27
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:58,223
Then one should have
a chemical surface reaction

28
00:01:58,223 --> 00:02:01,713
that generates a soluble reaction product.

29
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:07,016
And finally, one has to transport
the reaction product

30
00:02:07,016 --> 00:02:09,041
away from the surface,

31
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:13,121
and this is mostly by diffusion 
or by agitation.

32
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:17,171
The slower step of these three

33
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,730
determines the actual reaction rate.

34
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:26,215
The two pictures illustrate the etching

35
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,031
of a silicon wafer

36
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:31,701
which was immersed in a KOH bath.

37
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:38,476
As an example of thin 
filler material that can be etched

38
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,116
we present here the etching of gold films.

39
00:02:41,946 --> 00:02:45,106
Gold is an important material
for interconnections

40
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,975
and for making contacts

41
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,695
due to its very inert character.

42
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:54,745
For etching gold,
one needs a special bath

43
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:58,892
as it is not easily etched by 
common etching solutions.

44
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:04,671
A popular bath is the iodine-iodide system

45
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:08,066
which is made by adding

46
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:12,075
iodine and potassium iodide

47
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:14,202
to an aqueous solution.

48
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:17,333
One obtains an etching rate of about

49
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,899
one micrometer per minute
at room temperature.

50
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:24,358
The mechanism of this bath
is the following:

51
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:26,784
Iodine

52
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:31,308
and a negative iodide ion

53
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:35,558
recombine into a tri-iodide ion.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,460
By reception of two electrons,

55
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:41,292
this is converted

56
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:45,233
in three iodide ions.

57
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:48,153
The gold atom

58
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:52,373
reacts with two iodide ions

59
00:03:52,473 --> 00:03:55,753
that forms a complex that goes 
into the solution

60
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:58,245
under the release of an electron.

61
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:02,681
This is a purely chemical etching process,

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,380
so that etching occurs in all directions.

63
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,513
If you have a gold film

64
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:11,674
covered by a photo-resist masking layer

65
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:17,658
etching goes both in the vertical
and the horizontal direction.

66
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:23,454
The structure gets more and more
underetched with time.

67
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:26,785
And the underetching only stops

68
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:30,525
when one removes the substrate
from the etching solution.

69
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,690
In order to avoid a too-important 
mask underetching,

70
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:38,219
one needs to control the etching time.

71
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,107
A problem that can occur when depositing

72
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:45,950
gold directly on a substrate

73
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,811
is that it can be easily peeled off

74
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:52,191
due to the weak 
film-to-substrate interaction.

75
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:58,143
Therefore, often one deposits
a very thin metal adhesion layer,

76
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:02,248
like chromium,
just before the position of the gold.

77
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:06,483
The pictures below illustrate
the gold etching process.

78
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:11,264
Here one has made
an interdigitated electrode structure

79
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:14,294
as schematically illustrated here.

80
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:18,565
In reality, there are
much more of these fingers,

81
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:21,017
more than 500 in this area,

82
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:24,497
which you cannot see anymore
in this picture.

83
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:28,578
This is a detail of these electrodes

84
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,783
where you see that we have
seven micron-wide electrodes

85
00:05:33,783 --> 00:05:36,377
with three micrometer-wide gaps.

86
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:41,823
Next, we introduce etching
of a hole in a silicon substrate.

87
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,905
The substrate is covered

88
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:47,145
by a masking layer with an opening.

89
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:52,385
Both isotropic and anisotropic
etching baths exist.

90
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,450
If one has an isotropic etching bath,

91
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,120
etching proceeds both

92
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,792
in a vertical and
in a horizontal direction,

93
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:04,581
so mask underetching occurs.

94
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:09,025
If one has an anisotropic etching bath,

95
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:14,255
etching does not occur
for certain directions

96
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:18,645
or certain planes
of the silicon crystal structure.

97
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:22,361
For example, here etching stops

98
00:06:22,361 --> 00:06:25,547
when the etchant comes
into contact with this plane.

99
00:06:27,401 --> 00:06:30,627
Such anisotropic etching
results from the fact

100
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:35,337
that atoms in certain planes are
more bound than in other planes

101
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:38,158
and that we have
a single-crystalline substrate.

102
00:06:38,513 --> 00:06:42,503
And that the etching bath
is only strong enough

103
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:47,331
to remove the weaker bound atoms here

104
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:51,915
and leave the stronger bound atoms
on these planes.

105
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:59,907
While acidic baths etch silicon
in an isotropic way,

106
00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:06,463
alkaline baths usually 
result in anisotropic etching.

107
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,459
Anisotropic etching baths can also be used

108
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,469
for making very thin membranes

109
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,566
of the order of
one micrometer thickness.

110
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:21,090
The single crystalline silicon substrate

111
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,810
normally is around 
500 micrometers in thickness.

112
00:07:28,558 --> 00:07:31,828
If we have, again,
our mask opening structure

113
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,778
and we put the silicon wafer

114
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:38,008
in an alkaline potassium hydroxide

115
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:39,937
or KOH bath,

116
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:44,826
the etching stops at
a certain plane of the crystal,

117
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:47,498
we will see later in more detail.

118
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,441
So there is no etching
for these planes here.

119
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,203
If we proceed in time,

120
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:57,287
the thickness of the silicon layer
in the middle

121
00:07:57,287 --> 00:08:02,302
becomes always smaller but it is
impossible to stop this process

122
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:05,921
exactly when there is only
one micrometer left

123
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,782
by looking at the time
of the etching process.

124
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,651
Instead, as we will see later,

125
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:17,558
one can implant boron in a very thin layer

126
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:21,623
and when the KOH etchant

127
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:26,605
reaches this boron-implanted layer,

128
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,245
the etching stops.

129
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:32,674
This technique of microstructuring
a whole substrate wafer

130
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,568
for making a thin membrane or device,

131
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:38,974
is also called <i>bulk micromachining,</i>

132
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:44,297
as one etches away 
part of the bulk of the substrate.

133
00:08:45,907 --> 00:08:48,837
As an example of
a wet etching application,

134
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:53,055
we discuss here the so-called
<i>piranha</i> wafer-cleaning procedure.

135
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,512
A piranha solution consists of a mixture

136
00:08:57,512 --> 00:09:02,292
of concentrated sulphuric acid
and hydrogen peroxide.

137
00:09:03,636 --> 00:09:06,416
It is used for removal of organic residues

138
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:10,258
like photoresists from wafer surfaces.

139
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:16,259
The schematic diagram illustrates
some organic residues

140
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:19,537
that have been left on a silicon wafer.

141
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,449
These organic residues

142
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,630
are first attacked by the sulphuric acid,

143
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:32,482
which violently dehydrates
the organic molecules.

144
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:36,439
These get a black appearance

145
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,321
as water molecules have been extracted

146
00:09:40,689 --> 00:09:43,334
and a carbon-based structure remains.

147
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:47,843
Subsequently, a second reaction starts.

148
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:51,456
The sulphuric acid reacts

149
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,026
with the hydrogen peroxide

150
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,136
to produce atomic oxygen,

151
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:01,416
which can dissolve elemental carbon.

152
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:06,984
After these two reactions, in the process,

153
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:11,124
all organic residues are removed
from the surface.

154
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:16,466
This movie illustrates the
violent cleaning of a substrate

155
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:18,106
in a piranha bath.

156
00:10:20,016 --> 00:10:24,466
One first prepares the sulphuric acid
at the right temperature

157
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:28,156
and then adds the hydrogen peroxide

158
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:39,317
which results in the development of fumes.

159
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:51,229
In this bath, a silicon wafer is immersed
and cleaning proceeds here

160
00:10:51,229 --> 00:10:55,801
at a temperature above
130 degrees celsius.

161
00:10:56,826 --> 00:10:59,746
The violent action
of the bath on the substrate

162
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,196
is like the attack
of piranha fish on their prey

163
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:06,456
and this fact gave the bath its name.

164
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:16,117
Before we have seen that one can use
bulk micromachining

165
00:11:16,117 --> 00:11:18,987
to realize a thin membrane on a wafer.

166
00:11:19,332 --> 00:11:21,686
Now we will see that wet etching permits

167
00:11:21,686 --> 00:11:24,167
to make thin membranes by another way.

168
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:29,977
This technique uses the removal
of a so-called <i>sacrificial</i> layer

169
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:34,777
by the wet etching bath
from beneath a functional layer.

170
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:39,745
The first step in this process is
the deposition and patterning

171
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,851
of a sacrificial layer,

172
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:44,991
in this case, a silicon dioxide layer.

173
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:51,513
This patterning can be by dry
or wet etching of this oxide layer.

174
00:11:53,175 --> 00:11:57,845
The next step in the process is
deposition of a functional layer,

175
00:11:58,152 --> 00:12:02,004
and this can be polysilicon
in our example.

176
00:12:03,844 --> 00:12:06,802
It can be deposited by a low-pressure

177
00:12:06,802 --> 00:12:09,311
chemical vapor deposition technique.

178
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:13,938
The final step in the process
is the wet etching

179
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:16,179
of the silicon dioxide

180
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,979
using an HF bath,

181
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:24,431
forming fluorosilicic acid
as a reaction product.

182
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:28,167
This is a fluorosilicic acid molecule.

183
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,956
To remove the silicon dioxide

184
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:35,876
from underneath the polysilicon layer,

185
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:40,946
evidently one needs locally
some access holes

186
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:45,561
through the polysilicon layer
so that there is access to the HF bath.

187
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:50,215
Such a process where one makes
a very thin membrane

188
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:54,867
on top of a wafer is
an example of a so-called

189
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:58,237
<i>surface micromachining</i> process.

190
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:04,310
As a final application example of 
wet etching micromachining,

191
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,191
we mention here the realization of 
so-called <i>porous silicon.</i>

192
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,100
We will see later that silicon
can be made micro- or nano-porous,

193
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,420
as illustrated by these pores
in the drawing,

194
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:23,133
by etching the wafer in an HF bath

195
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,450
while connecting the wafer
to a positive voltage

196
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,939
and the counter-electrode
is in the HF solution.

197
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:37,963
Doing so, one can create
unidirectional pores

198
00:13:38,253 --> 00:13:39,923
that go into the silicon

199
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:44,494
and that have a large effective
surface area per wafer surface.

200
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:49,612
Also, we can create locally
at the top of the wafer

201
00:13:49,612 --> 00:13:55,422
a mechanically more fragile material
due to the presence of so many pores.

202
00:13:57,663 --> 00:14:00,233
This ends our introduction of wet etching.

203
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:04,623
We have seen the isotropic etching
of a thin gold film

204
00:14:04,813 --> 00:14:09,528
and subsequently, we have shown
the phenomena of anisotropic

205
00:14:09,528 --> 00:14:12,925
and isotropic etching
of a bulk silicon substrate.

206
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:17,350
As well as the realization of a
thin membrane in a silicon substrate,

207
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:20,758
a technique we called
<i>bulk micromachining.</i>

208
00:14:21,248 --> 00:14:24,028
Then we introduced
wet etching applications

209
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,289
such as piranha wafer cleaning,

210
00:14:26,451 --> 00:14:30,771
the removal of a sacrificial layer
underneath a functional layer,

211
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,885
a technique we called
<i>surface micromachining.</i>

212
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:36,418
Finally, we discussed the realization

213
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,198
of porous silicon in an HF bath,

214
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,618
under application of a voltage bias
on the silicon wafer.
