1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,883
In this lesson, we will explain 
the anisotropic etching of silicon

2
00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:13,353
by which certain crystal planes 
will be chemically attacked by an etchant,

3
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,562
while other planes will not react.

4
00:00:16,342 --> 00:00:20,633
These etching phenomena are observable
because the silicon wafer

5
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:25,904
is essentially single crystalline, 
that is, it has an order lattice structure

6
00:00:25,904 --> 00:00:27,640
on the scale of the wafer.

7
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:32,505
We will explain the etching mechanism 
and some of the etching baths

8
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:33,995
that can be used.

9
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:40,187
These drawings illustrate 
the silicon crystal structure

10
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:44,853
which is that of a diamond lattice 
and can be represented

11
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:49,268
by two interpenetrating 
face-centered cubic lattices.

12
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:55,564
A silicon atom forms four covalent bond
with other silicon atoms.

13
00:00:56,525 --> 00:01:01,199
If one cuts the silicon crystal 
along different planes,

14
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,416
one will see that the packing density 
of atoms and the bonding strength

15
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:11,546
between silicon atoms on 
different plane orientations is different.

16
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:18,361
And this gives rise to etching rates 
that can depend on the plane orientation.

17
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:23,504
A cubic crystal unit cell 
has three basis vectors

18
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:26,284
and every point in real space
can be written

19
00:01:26,856 --> 00:01:31,804
as the coordinate of a vector 
written in function

20
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,716
of the three basis vectors.

21
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:42,114
A real space coordinate or vector
can be represented

22
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:47,978
by three numbers 
as put in between the square brackets.

23
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:51,541
So this direction is the same 
as this direction,

24
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:56,031
only the vector here is shorter 
by a factor of two.

25
00:01:57,011 --> 00:02:03,551
In the crystal, 
the directions [100], [010] and [001]

26
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:06,070
are crystallographically equivalent.

27
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,321
One is along a different axis

28
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:12,621
but for the environment 
of the silicon atom,

29
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,343
there is no difference.

30
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:17,663
If one wants to speak 
of all these directions,

31
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:23,182
together, one puts 1 0 0 
with these triangular brackets.

32
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:29,345
In micro-fabrication, 
we are not so much interested

33
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:33,114
in knowing the real space coordinate
of each atom,

34
00:02:33,114 --> 00:02:37,487
but rather, we would like to know
how the crystal planes

35
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:39,266
are oriented in the wafer.

36
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:46,754
A crystal plane can be characterized 
by three so-called <i>Miller indices</i>

37
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:53,264
which describe a vector 
in the so-called <i>reciprocal space</i>

38
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:55,414
that is normal 
to the crystal pane.

39
00:02:56,455 --> 00:03:01,733
The Miller indices are defined 
by taking the inverse

40
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:05,784
of the intercept of the plane
at each axis in real space,

41
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:09,385
and we illustrate that now
in the following.

42
00:03:11,785 --> 00:03:15,128
A plane with Miller indices 
(hkl)--

43
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:19,535
and we use here now rounded brackets
because it's a plane--

44
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:24,495
is normal to this 
reciprocal lattice vector

45
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:29,145
where these are the basis vectors 
of the reciprocal lattice, these three.

46
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:33,818
A plane with a normal
(4-21),

47
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:38,927
means that the plane intercepts 
the three cubic axes

48
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,347
at 1, -2 and 4.

49
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,303
Indeed, if we invert 1,
-2 and 4,

50
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:52,683
we obtain this 
reciprocal lattice vector

51
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:57,517
and as one likes better whole numbers,

52
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:03,601
one multiplies this vector by 4
to get this vector.

53
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:09,033
By this operation, 
the orientation of the vector

54
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,318
does not change, 
so it's the same plane.

55
00:04:13,482 --> 00:04:17,515
As we already pointed out, 
a reciprocal space vector

56
00:04:17,515 --> 00:04:20,035
is denoted by the rounded brackets.

57
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:27,527
The upper drawing illustrates 
the position of a (100) plane

58
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:35,196
which intersects the <i>x</i>-axis at 1,
and the <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>-axis at infinity.

59
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,091
So if we invert these, 
we get (100)

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,979
The planes (001), (010), (100), and so on

61
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,714
are equivalent, and if you want 
to speak of all of them together,

62
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:55,410
we write it with these brackets.

63
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,627
So this means this is the family
of identical planes.

64
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:05,888
In the same way, 
the drawing in the middle

65
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,930
indicates the (110) plane.

66
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:13,814
And the drawing below, 
the (111) plane.

67
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,925
So this intersects, for example, 
each axis at one.

68
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:25,298
As planes are characterized by vectors 
of the reciprocal lattice,

69
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:30,107
one can simply calculate the angle 
between two planes

70
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:34,757
by calculating the vector 
in-product; this product.

71
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:37,767
And as an example, the angle <i>phi</i>

72
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:41,750
between the planes (111)
and (001),

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,610
is 54.74 degrees.

74
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,490
If one has in mind 
a cubic crystal structure,

75
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,071
one can know the orientation
of the different planes.

76
00:05:57,003 --> 00:06:00,621
For example, 
if the surface of the wafer

77
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,301
has a (100) orientation,

78
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:07,211
there are four (111) planes

79
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:13,341
that have each an angle 
of 54.74 degrees

80
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:15,671
with the plane of the wafer.

81
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:22,411
If the wafer has been cut from a crystal
that had a (110) orientation,

82
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:29,610
two (111) directions 
are now pointing outside of the wafer

83
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,274
and two (111) directions
are inside.

84
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:39,520
That means in this case, 
the (111) plane is vertical.

85
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,381
There are two vertical 
(111) planes

86
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,611
for a (110) oriented wafer.

87
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,822
In practice, 
wafers have so-called <i>flats</i>,

88
00:06:52,432 --> 00:06:55,063
a primary flat 
and a secondary flat.

89
00:06:55,693 --> 00:06:57,921
Here, there's only a primary flat.

90
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:02,382
If you see a wafer, 
in principal you know

91
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:04,922
by looking at the flats

92
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:08,275
what is the type of orientation 
of the wafer?

93
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:13,922
So here is the orientation
and here is the (100) orientation,

94
00:07:14,532 --> 00:07:17,551
and also you know
the type of doping in the wafer

95
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:19,174
by looking at the flats.

96
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,652
The reason why an etching bath 
preferentially

97
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:27,014
attacks a certain lattice plane,
and does not etch

98
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,061
another plane
is illustrated here.

99
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:35,105
A silicon atom that is present 
in a (111) plane

100
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:40,357
has three backbonds 
to the interior of the silicon wafer

101
00:07:40,357 --> 00:07:45,506
and one dangling bond which 
is interfacing with the etching solution.

102
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:50,090
So this bond can be attacked
by chemical molecules

103
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,277
from the etching solution.

104
00:07:53,277 --> 00:08:00,457
A silicon atom within a (100) plane 
has only two backbonds

105
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:04,509
and two dangling bonds 
pointing in the etching solution.

106
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:09,209
The second type of silicon atom
is hence less well anchored

107
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:13,708
to the silicon wafer
and will be more easily etched away.

108
00:08:15,556 --> 00:08:18,545
An example of such etching bath

109
00:08:18,545 --> 00:08:23,775
is potassium hydroxide 
or KOH solution.

110
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:30,052
In such a bath, 4 hydroxyl ions

111
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,482
bind progressively

112
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:37,547
to a silicon atom 
in a two-step process

113
00:08:37,547 --> 00:08:40,898
leading to the formation 
of this molecule.

114
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:45,094
This molecule is called <i>silicic acid</i>.

115
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:53,162
It is converted in a solution
to this molecule and into two protons.

116
00:08:54,472 --> 00:09:00,215
The four electrons that came
from the four hydroxyl ions

117
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,585
have been injected 
in the silicon.

118
00:09:05,955 --> 00:09:10,572
These four electrons, 
they are used here

119
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:15,620
to generate four new hydroxyl ions

120
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,641
so that there is no charging 
of the silicon

121
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,809
and the etching continues.

122
00:09:23,918 --> 00:09:28,654
The four hydroxyl ions that are generated 
at the silicon surface

123
00:09:28,654 --> 00:09:32,910
originate from water molecules 
and not from hydroxyl ions

124
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,197
initially present in the KOH solution.

125
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:41,064
The reaction rate of the KOH etching bath

126
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:44,474
can be written as this formula

127
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:50,055
and between brackets, 
you have the molar concentrations.

128
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:53,547
So this is the molar concentration 
of water.

129
00:09:53,547 --> 00:09:56,604
If there is more water, 
the concentration of water is higher.

130
00:09:57,634 --> 00:10:01,111
The power of four
gives the water concentration

131
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:06,250
the most prominent importance, 
while the KOH

132
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:09,030
has only a power of 1/4.

133
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,130
The red curve shows 
the actual etching rate

134
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,564
as a function of the KOH concentration.

135
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:24,343
And we indeed see if there is more KOH
dissolved in the water,

136
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:26,222
the etching rate goes down.

137
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:31,892
The black curve gives the power
of four dependence

138
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:35,174
on the water molar concentration.

139
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,519
Note that this etching rate 
was for atoms

140
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,269
on a (100) plane
while to first order,

141
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:49,021
there is no or very, very little etching 
of atoms on a (111) plane.

142
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:57,452
We draw here again our wafer
with (100) surface orientation

143
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:01,218
and cover it completely 
with the masking layer,

144
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:06,012
except for a rectangular opening

145
00:11:06,012 --> 00:11:11,069
that is oriented
along the (110) direction.

146
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:17,834
The diagram on the left side
shows the same wafer in cross section

147
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:23,167
with two of these rectangular openings
also indicated by the dashed lines.

148
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:29,279
Atoms along the (100) plane 
will be etched away.

149
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,996
So etching will go vertical 
and if one encounters a (111) plane

150
00:11:34,996 --> 00:11:39,252
like here or here, 
there will be no etching.

151
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:44,473
So gradually, the (111) planes
will become visible.

152
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:50,905
The hole here
has reached the final V shape

153
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,775
and no further etching 
will happen.

154
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:58,553
In a similar way, 
we can draw again

155
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:02,473
our wafer with (110) surface orientation,

156
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:07,136
cover it completely 
with a mask material

157
00:12:07,136 --> 00:12:12,304
and make now an opening in the mask, 
given by this dashed line again.

158
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:17,911
So this opening is parallel
to the (111) directions.

159
00:12:19,236 --> 00:12:23,326
If we look to the cross section 
of the wafer after etching,

160
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:27,616
we see following profiles 
with the structure on the right

161
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:33,216
representing a hole in its final state
where only (111) planes

162
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:37,309
are in contact 
with the KOH solution,

163
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:41,541
and this (111) plane indeed
is vertical.

164
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:49,218
Anisotropic etching is possible
in different alkaline aqueous solutions

165
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,765
but the most popular solution
is the KOH bath.

166
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:59,930
It is typically composed 
of 20 weight percent of KOH,

167
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,800
16 weight percent of propanol
and 64 weight percent water.

168
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,699
The bath is typically operated 
under agitation at 80 degree Celsius.

169
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,964
These are the etching anisotropies
for different silicon planes.

170
00:13:17,634 --> 00:13:21,651
Here we see that the (100) plane

171
00:13:21,651 --> 00:13:27,060
etches 400 times faster
than the (111) plane.

172
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,687
So the (111) plane etching rate
is not completely zero.

173
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:38,490
The etching rate of a (110) plane
is 600 times higher

174
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,684
than that of a (111) plane.

175
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:47,258
The picture shows the result
after a KOH etching process

176
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:53,714
and one recognizes typically 
these V-shaped channels and holes.

177
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:58,049
And this is the KOH etching bath.

178
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:04,177
This video shows the etching 
of the silicon wafer in a KOH solution.

179
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:08,690
Initially, the wafer is in a beaker 
of deionized water

180
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,742
and then transferred 
to the KOH solution.

181
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:17,558
One observes the formation 
of hydrogen gas during etching.

182
00:14:18,747 --> 00:14:22,291
In principle, the etching can go on 
for hours

183
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,244
if deep structures need 
to be etched.

184
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:38,627
KOH etching was used also 
in the final step

185
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:43,689
of our case study 
of the thermo-mechanical actuator.

186
00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:48,941
It was the process step
that released the cantilever beam

187
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:53,901
from the wafer by anisostropic 
underetching of the silicon.

188
00:14:54,901 --> 00:14:59,024
While there are several options 
that can be used to underetch,

189
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:03,157
such as dry plasma etching, 
and isotropic silicon etching,

190
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:07,221
anisotropic etching of silicon
was used here

191
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,325
due to its simplicity and efficiency 
for this type of structures.

192
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:18,001
The inclined side walls 
of the etched hole

193
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:23,041
immediately make clear that we used
an anisotropic etching process.

194
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:29,688
Also so-called <i>alkaline organic baths</i> 
are used for anistropic silicon etching.

195
00:15:30,418 --> 00:15:35,857
A well known example
is the ethylenediamine bath

196
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:42,132
with addition of pyrocatechol molecules,
so-called <i>EDP</i> bath.

197
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:49,166
It is composed typically of 75 percent 
of ethylenediamine,

198
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:55,674
13.58 percent of pyrocatechol, 
a half percent of pyrazine,

199
00:15:55,674 --> 00:15:57,837
and 11 percent of water.

200
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:03,446
Ionization of the ethylenediamine

201
00:16:03,446 --> 00:16:06,716
produces this ion 
and the hydroxyl ion.

202
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:11,426
That is why it becomes 
an alkaline bath.

203
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:16,721
Pyrocatechol is a chalating molecule.

204
00:16:17,891 --> 00:16:21,491
Two of such molecules
with these fingers

205
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:26,455
can grab a silicon atom
and transport it into solution.

206
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:31,538
We also present here, 
the etching anisotropy rates

207
00:16:31,538 --> 00:16:34,093
for different silicon planes 
using this bath.

208
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:40,168
So the ratio of the etching rate
for example, of a (111) plane

209
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:44,657
and a (100) plane 
is 8:200.

210
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,745
A third popular bath is the 
tetramethylammonium hydroxide bath

211
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:59,788
or TMAH bath
which produces good results

212
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:04,836
by adding a few weight percent 
of silicon powder

213
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:06,988
in the bath during etching.

214
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:11,146
This is a so-called seasoning 
of the bath and it results

215
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:17,724
in better aluminium contacts
that are preserved during the etching.

216
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:23,943
The etching anisotropy is lower
than for the two other baths.

217
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:30,843
In this lesson, we have discussed 
the anisotropic etching of silicon.

218
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:35,600
We gave a reminder of real
and reciprocal space vectors

219
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,555
whereby a reciprocal space vector
is characterizing a crystal plane.

220
00:17:40,425 --> 00:17:43,607
We explained the anisotropic 
etching mechanism

221
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,971
which is due to a difference 
in bond strength

222
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:48,322
for a silicon atom 
on a different plane.

223
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:53,373
We found that a (111) plane
etches very slowly.

224
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,847
Finally, we discussed 
different alkaline etching baths

225
00:17:56,847 --> 00:18:00,813
like KOH, EDP and TMAH.
