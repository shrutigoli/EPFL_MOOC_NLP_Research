1
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:07,518
In our introductory lesson on Wet Etching,

2
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:12,027
we have already introduced the concept
of <i>surface micromachining</i>

3
00:00:12,027 --> 00:00:16,979
which consisted in removing
a silicon dioxide thin film

4
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:19,768
from underneath a polysilicon layer

5
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:23,449
so that the latter becomes 
a suspended functional structure.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,249
In this lesson, we will present
an issue with this technique

7
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:33,514
that is related to the surface tension
of the drying etching liquid

8
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:37,249
which exerts a force 
on the suspended silicon structure

9
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:40,740
so that the latter 
can be permanently deformed.

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,131
<i>Supercritical drying</i> is a technique

11
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:48,571
in which such collapse of the functional
silicon structure can be avoided.

12
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,711
Another major issue 
with service micromachining

13
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,692
is the existence of stress
in the functional layer

14
00:00:55,692 --> 00:00:59,762
which becomes apparent
after removal of the sacrificial layer

15
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:03,873
and results in undesirable 
deformed microstructures.

16
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:08,255
Here, we will introduce 
some test microstructures

17
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:13,116
that are dedicated 
for quantifying stress in thin layers.

18
00:01:14,747 --> 00:01:19,245
We sketch here again a typical 
surface micromachining sequence.

19
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,887
In surface micromachining,

20
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:26,367
one needs to remove the sacrificial layer
from beneath the functional layer.

21
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:29,896
Step one of such process

22
00:01:29,896 --> 00:01:34,506
is the patterning of the silicon dioxide 
sacrificial layer.

23
00:01:34,506 --> 00:01:38,906
So we have patterned it, 
and there are two parts

24
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:41,497
where the silicon dioxide 
has been removed.

25
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,916
Step two is the deposition 
of a polysilicon layer,

26
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:52,047
which is a deposition 
that is conformal to the texture

27
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:54,439
which is already present on the substrate,

28
00:01:55,301 --> 00:01:57,869
and it can be performed, for example,

29
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,330
by a low-pressure chemical vapor
deposition step.

30
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,241
Etching in the HF liquid

31
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:10,850
is based on the formation 
of the fluorosilicic acid--

32
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,027
schematically represented here--

33
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:14,769
that goes into the solution.

34
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:18,093
The drawing here is shown

35
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:22,463
after removal of the wafer
out of the etching bath

36
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:25,332
and after rinsing in deionized water.

37
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,253
This is the ideal case 
where everything worked out fine.

38
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,523
However, in reality,
the situation may be different.

39
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:39,927
During drying of the etching 
or rinsing solution,

40
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:45,726
a limited amount of liquid
underneath the functional structure

41
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:50,705
can pull down the latter towards 
the substrate by capillary forces.

42
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,244
Often, after such collapse,

43
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:56,545
the functional structure 
cannot be released again

44
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,176
and can, hence, not be used 
in the application.

45
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:03,256
A solution to avoid such problem

46
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:06,687
is the technique 
of <i>supercritical point drying</i>.

47
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:12,516
In this technique we etch 
the sacrificial layer in HF bath

48
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:15,161
as schematically illustrated here.

49
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:21,589
Then we replace 
the HF by deionized water,

50
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:24,758
whereby, the liquid
is replaced by a liquid,

51
00:03:24,758 --> 00:03:27,478
and no drying is involved.

52
00:03:29,468 --> 00:03:31,779
In the next step, in a similar way,

53
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:35,249
we replace the water by <i>ethyl alcohol</i>,

54
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:37,538
which is a liquid 
with lower surface tension

55
00:03:37,538 --> 00:03:40,637
and higher vapor pressure than water.

56
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:45,359
This wafer is then placed 
in a closed chamber

57
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,468
that can be filled with CO2 gas,

58
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,509
to which one can apply high pressure

59
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:56,360
so that the gas is condensed 
in liquid CO2 that will occupy,

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,251
then, also, the space between 
the functional layer and the substrate.

61
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:05,850
So this will be replaced, 
this liquid, by liquid CO2.

62
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:11,619
The picture shows the stainless steel
pressurizable vessel

63
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,540
in which the wafer is positioned.

64
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,891
Here we show a phase diagram for CO2.

65
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,607
On the <i>x-axis</i>, there is the temperature,

66
00:04:22,607 --> 00:04:24,831
and on the <i>y-axis</i>, the pressure.

67
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:31,119
At high temperature and low pressure,
the CO2 is in the gas state,

68
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:35,349
while at low temperature,
the CO2 is in the solid state,

69
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:41,119
and in the intermediate temperature range,
the CO2 is in the liquid state.

70
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:45,739
At low pressure there can be
transfer from the solid

71
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:48,169
to the gas phase by sublimation.

72
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,670
Let us now discuss 
the <i>supercritical point drying process</i>.

73
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,680
The chamber is brought 
to 10 degrees Celsius

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,681
and then the chamber 
is pressurized to 75 bar.

75
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:07,192
This means we go from A to B
in the phase diagram.

76
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,102
Then we raise the temperature
to 31 degrees Celsius,

77
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:19,163
which is the critical point temperature
of CO2, this temperature.

78
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:24,742
This means that we go 
from B to C in the diagram,

79
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:30,322
and, in fact, our point C is just above 
this critical point temperature.

80
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:37,132
Due to this heating, the pressure rises
further to 93 bar in the chamber.

81
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:43,264
As when it's just above 
the critical point of CO2,

82
00:05:43,264 --> 00:05:46,772
a supercritical fluid is formed

83
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:51,537
in which there is no distinction
between the liquid and gas phase anymore

84
00:05:51,537 --> 00:05:54,125
and, hence, there is no surface tension.

85
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:57,988
Then one releases the pressure

86
00:05:57,988 --> 00:06:02,615
and one brings the CO2 in the gas phase

87
00:06:02,615 --> 00:06:08,480
going from C to D, during which,
the CO2 evaporates.

88
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:12,918
Finally, after removal of all CO2,

89
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:16,056
the chamber is brought to room temperature

90
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:19,788
going from D to E, this region.

91
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:23,858
We have now avoided 
the evaporation of CO2

92
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:27,648
from the liquid phase 
during the drying process,

93
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:30,597
and we have removed all CO2.

94
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:34,508
Another issue in surface micromachining

95
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:38,717
is the presence of stress 
in the surface machined microstructures.

96
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,008
This results from the fact 
that the polysilicon layer

97
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:47,250
is deposited at the high temperature,

98
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,998
and that, when cooling down 
to room temperature,

99
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:54,748
the thermal expansion coefficient
of the thick substrate

100
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,001
and the thin deposit layer
is not the same.

101
00:06:58,481 --> 00:07:00,889
The stress becomes most apparent

102
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,259
after removal of the sacrificial layer

103
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:11,086
and it is visible by deformed 
membranes and beam structures.

104
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:15,250
The stress may be compressive,

105
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,754
and this happens when 
the substrate, during cooling,

106
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,731
shrinks down more than the thin film,

107
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:26,232
resulting in the type of structure 
shown here in the schematic diagram.

108
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:30,910
The stress can also be tensile,

109
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,251
and this happens when the thin film

110
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,971
would like to shrink down 
more than the substrate,

111
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:39,753
but it's kept under tension
by the contact with the substrate

112
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:41,283
at these two points.

113
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:46,274
In such case, it may be
that one cannot see the tensile stress

114
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:50,363
because it will result 
in a straight beam or straight membrane,

115
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:52,923
just like a microstructure without stress.

116
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:56,505
Only in case the stress is so high

117
00:07:56,505 --> 00:08:01,584
that catastrophic failure 
of the thin film occurs,

118
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,085
it becomes visible.

119
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:08,434
Hence, generally, it is hard 
to detect tensile stress

120
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,766
as it is less easy to observe.

121
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:14,025
Suppose one can detect stress,

122
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:17,283
then this information will be used

123
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:21,763
to fine-tune the deposition process,
vary parameters,

124
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:26,336
eventually do annealing treatments 
of the structures to reduce the stress.

125
00:08:28,497 --> 00:08:32,785
So-called <i>ring crossbar 
test structures</i> are very useful

126
00:08:32,785 --> 00:08:37,270
for detecting and quantifying 
the stress in the thin film material.

127
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,529
The size of these structures

128
00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:45,060
is in the range of between tens of microns
to several hundreds of microns

129
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,500
and one designs them typically

130
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,540
in a row of structures of increasing size.

131
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:56,759
The microstructures consist of a ring

132
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,468
with connecting crossbar

133
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:07,510
that are suspended because one has removed
the sacrificial layer underneath.

134
00:09:08,461 --> 00:09:14,461
Fixation on the substrate is achieved
by two anchor points for each ring.

135
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,511
If there is no stress in the suspended
polysilicon ring crossbar structure,

136
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:25,591
and if one removes 
the sacrificial layer underneath,

137
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,861
the structures stay nicely flat.

138
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:34,521
If these structures 
are under tensile stress,

139
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:37,902
all suspended materials 
want to shrink down.

140
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:43,011
The ring is fixed at two anchor points,

141
00:09:43,011 --> 00:09:48,394
hence, will shrink down 
more than the crossbar in the <i>y-direction</i>.

142
00:09:48,394 --> 00:09:53,743
So the shrinkage 
of the <i>x-direction</i> is, in a way,

143
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:56,453
transferred to the <i>y-direction</i>.

144
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:02,013
A result is that the crossbar
in the middle will be deformed.

145
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,496
It will shrink down too,

146
00:10:04,496 --> 00:10:08,914
but not as much as the ring structure 
in this direction.

147
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:13,917
Planar microstructures
are easily recognizable as such

148
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,036
when looking through a microscope.

149
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:21,157
Also, the bigger the microstructure,
the more easy deformation is.

150
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:26,767
That is why one makes a series 
of microstructures of increasing size

151
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:31,936
to look at the size 
of the ring crossbar structure

152
00:10:31,936 --> 00:10:35,179
where deformation will first develop.

153
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:36,984
In this case, this ring.

154
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,187
This ring is okay,

155
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:42,599
and here, this is the first ring 
which shows deformation.

156
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:45,499
This allows quantifying 
the tensile stress.

157
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,690
We draw here again 
the test structures without stress.

158
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,110
If these structures 
are under compressive stress,

159
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,471
all suspended materials want to expand.

160
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:04,500
The ring is again fixed 
at the two anchor points,

161
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,370
hence, it will expand more 
than the crossbar in the <i>y-direction</i>.

162
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:14,591
A result is that the crossbar
will stay straight

163
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,980
while the ring will be non-planar.

164
00:11:19,231 --> 00:11:23,941
The bigger the microstructure,
the more easy deformation is.

165
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:28,492
That is why one makes, again,
this series of microstructures--

166
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:32,161
To look at the size 
of the ring crossbar structure

167
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,612
where deformation will first develop,

168
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,892
and this allows quantifying
the compressive stress.

169
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:45,742
The ring crossbar test structure,
hence, is a universal detector of stress

170
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:49,334
that can either be of tensile 
or compressive nature.

171
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:53,655
In this lesson we have 
explained the technique

172
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:57,052
of supercritical drying using CO2

173
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,754
by which evaporation from the liquid phase

174
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:03,966
underneath a functional microstructure 
can be avoided,

175
00:12:03,966 --> 00:12:09,715
leading to surface micromachine structures
that do not collapse towards a substrate

176
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:14,516
because of the absence of surface 
tension-driven bending forces.

177
00:12:15,365 --> 00:12:19,365
Also, we introduced the phenomenon
of intrinsic stress

178
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,956
in the functional thin film materials

179
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:24,916
and explained how 
ring crossbar microstructures

180
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:30,527
can be used for diagnosis 
of both tensile and compressive stress.
