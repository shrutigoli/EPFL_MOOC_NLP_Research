1
00:00:04,202 --> 00:00:05,748
In this lesson, we will explain

2
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:08,548
the hydrofluoric acid or HF bath

3
00:00:08,548 --> 00:00:10,746
that is used for silicon dioxide

4
00:00:10,746 --> 00:00:12,546
and glass wet etching.

5
00:00:13,946 --> 00:00:16,303
This type of etching was already used

6
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:19,303
in the process for the microfabrication

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,949
of the thermal mechanical micro-activator

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,298
for locally removing

9
00:00:26,298 --> 00:00:28,898
the silicon dioxide layer

10
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:33,298
to define the oxide cantilever beam.

11
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:38,252
We used a diluted HF solution,

12
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:42,246
known also as <i>buffered hydrofluoric acid</i>,

13
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:43,746
or <i>BHF</i>,

14
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:46,896
and locally protected

15
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:50,948
the chromium and silicon dioxide layer

16
00:00:50,948 --> 00:00:53,154
by a photoresist.

17
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:58,998
During the buffered
hydrofluoric acid etch,

18
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:02,100
the chromium layer
was then completely covered

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,854
with the photoresist,

20
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:08,597
so that it is not affected
by the HF solution.

21
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,847
Here, I show again

22
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:15,297
the mask design of the micro-activator,

23
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,848
and this is the result

24
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:19,948
after this processing step.

25
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,300
Glass is dissolved by HF

26
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,895
or HF-containing solutions.

27
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:32,195
When HF is dissolved in water,

28
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,797
it is a weak acid.

29
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:35,897
That means it is partially split

30
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:39,302
in protons, fluorine ions,

31
00:01:39,302 --> 00:01:41,902
and HF2 minus ions.

32
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:46,051
Vitreous silicon dioxide

33
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,001
and multicomponent silica glasses

34
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:53,603
are etched according
to this overall reaction,

35
00:01:54,804 --> 00:01:56,595
where this compound

36
00:01:56,595 --> 00:02:00,199
is called fluorosilicic acid,

37
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:04,195
so this is the molecule
that goes into solution,

38
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:08,246
and that originates
from the silicon dioxide.

39
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:12,097
These are the two reaction constants

40
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:14,297
at 25 degrees Celsius.

41
00:02:14,897 --> 00:02:18,248
<i>K1</i> describes the splitting

42
00:02:18,248 --> 00:02:21,948
of HF in protons and fluorine ions,

43
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:24,849
and the fact that this number is not large

44
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:27,152
means that it's a weak acid.

45
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:31,153
A second reaction constant

46
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:35,200
says that also HF2 minus ions

47
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,000
are present in the bath,

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,500
and in comparable concentration
as the fluorine ions.

49
00:02:41,898 --> 00:02:43,795
It's revealed by this number.

50
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:49,245
Sodium fluoride or ammonium fluoride

51
00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:52,545
are known to not etch silicon dioxide,

52
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:55,246
so that means that it is not
the fluorine ions

53
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:57,545
that are responsible for the etching.

54
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:03,046
Also, the etching is not sensitive
to agitation of the bath,

55
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:06,195
and that means
it's not a question of transport,

56
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:08,252
but it's kinetic control

57
00:03:08,252 --> 00:03:11,349
of the reaction at the surface
which is limiting step.

58
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:17,595
The following etching mechanism
is believed to occur.

59
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:21,599
HF is chemisorbed

60
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
on the silicon oxide network,

61
00:03:25,349 --> 00:03:27,247
and there is a combined action

62
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,347
of the hydrogen on the oxygen atom,

63
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:34,596
and of the fluorine to the silicon atom,

64
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:39,096
which weakens the bond
between the silicon and oxygen.

65
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:42,498
This is a so-called <i>siloxane bond</i>.

66
00:03:43,997 --> 00:03:47,050
At the end, this bond breaks,

67
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,551
and the network is cut in two parts.

68
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:56,149
The etching rate can be written

69
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:58,149
by the following formula:

70
00:03:59,749 --> 00:04:02,201
<i>theta</i> is the degree of coverage

71
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,801
of active adsorption sites on the glass,

72
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:10,403
so this means
that there are protons on the surface.

73
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:14,601
This says that the etching rate is there

74
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,901
if there are protons on the surface,

75
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:20,998
and there is a second species,
which is [necessary];

76
00:04:20,998 --> 00:04:23,245
these are HF2 minus ions.

77
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:27,548
So, this says that there is a combined
action of the two to etch,

78
00:04:28,248 --> 00:04:30,998
and also this protein concentration

79
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:34,248
is working together with HF, together,

80
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:37,053
to remove the silicon dioxide.

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,150
There is another process
where there are only protons,

82
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,953
so only protons can, already,

83
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,854
dissolve the silicon dioxide.

84
00:04:48,403 --> 00:04:49,845
In practice,

85
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:53,045
the etching rate in the HF bath,

86
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:54,385
at this temperature,

87
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:56,697
is a few micrometers per minute

88
00:04:56,697 --> 00:05:01,302
for 50 weight percent of HF in water.

89
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,004
An etching bath that is frequently used

90
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,548
is the one in which one adds

91
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:11,854
the non-etching ammonium fluoride

92
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,048
to the HF baths.

93
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:16,999
The ammonium fluoride

94
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,251
contributes with fluorine ions,

95
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,547
which has an impact
on this reaction constant,

96
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:27,751
but, as this reaction constant
still has to be the same,

97
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:31,301
this means that this increased
concentration here

98
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:34,503
gives a decreased concentration of protons

99
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,703
so, hence, less etching.

100
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,297
So, the etching rate goes down

101
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,797
by addition of the ammonium fluoride.

102
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:46,950
A mix of 40 weight percent
ammonium fluoride,

103
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,897
with 49 weight percent HF,

104
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,097
in these ratios,

105
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:55,747
is called <i>buffered oxide etch, BOE</i>,

106
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:57,199
or what we have called,

107
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,404
in the beginning, <i>buffered HF, BHF</i>.

108
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,397
49 weight percent of HF

109
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,297
is also called pure HF,

110
00:06:06,597 --> 00:06:10,199
as HF is, intrinsically, a gas

111
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,699
which is dissolved in water,

112
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:16,999
and this is the maximum
dissolvable weight percent concentration.

113
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,496
The use of buffered HF

114
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:22,646
produces a slower and less aggressive etch

115
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:25,499
so that photoresist masks can be used,

116
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:29,100
as we have seen for the micro-activator.

117
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:33,450
Photoresist would be
very strongly degraded

118
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,750
in pure HF baths.

119
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,099
The exact glass composition

120
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,600
also has an influence on the etch rate.

121
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:45,699
A glass can contain multiple other oxides

122
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:47,899
apart from silicon dioxide.

123
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:53,745
It can contain so-called
<i>network-forming oxides</i>,

124
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:56,145
which are compounds

125
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:58,951
that [in use] additional molecular bonds

126
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,401
which need to be broken,

127
00:07:00,401 --> 00:07:02,801
resulting in slower etching.

128
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,849
Boron oxide is an example

129
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:08,349
of such network-forming oxides.

130
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,901
A glass can also contain

131
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:14,101
<i>network-modifying oxides</i>,

132
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,145
such as sodium oxide,

133
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,996
and when these are introduced
in the silica network,

134
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:22,646
they generate so-called

135
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:25,746
<i>non-bridging oxygen sites</i>,

136
00:07:26,296 --> 00:07:28,397
resulting in faster etching.

137
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:31,598
So, here, we see, by adding

138
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,802
the sodium oxide to the network,

139
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:38,253
splits somewhere the network,

140
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:41,946
as the bond is fulfilled
by the sodium ion.

141
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:45,695
The effect of network-forming oxides

142
00:07:45,695 --> 00:07:47,745
and network-modifying oxides

143
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:50,803
is illustrated in the curves

144
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:54,003
obtained in buffered oxide etch

145
00:07:54,703 --> 00:07:56,295
for silica doped

146
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,295
with the network-forming boron oxide,

147
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:02,703
and these two network-modifying oxides.

148
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,399
So, here, when there is more dopant,

149
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,149
these etch rates go up,

150
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:09,545
and this goes down, at least initially.

151
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:14,201
Here, we introduce a pure HF-based

152
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:17,504
microfabrication process for Pyrex wafer.

153
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,997
A mask that resists

154
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:22,501
to this aggressive bath is gold,

155
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,347
which, for good adhesion,

156
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,199
needs to be deposited

157
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,701
on a very thin chromium layer.

158
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,196
On top of this gold layer,

159
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:36,146
one deposits a photoresist,

160
00:08:36,146 --> 00:08:39,246
which is prebaked, developed, postbaked,

161
00:08:39,846 --> 00:08:41,951
after which an oxygen plasma

162
00:08:41,951 --> 00:08:44,651
descum step is performed

163
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:48,452
to clear the liberated gold surfaces

164
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,904
from organic molecules.

165
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:54,998
Now follows a gold-etching step

166
00:08:55,398 --> 00:08:59,248
in a potassium iodide-iodine solution,

167
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,752
followed by a chromium etch to remove

168
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,251
the very thin chromium adhesion layer.

169
00:09:07,497 --> 00:09:10,199
Next follows the etching in pure HF.

170
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:14,101
That means the 49% HF in water solution.

171
00:09:14,849 --> 00:09:19,848
Etching rates of five to ten micrometers
per minute are obtained.

172
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:24,747
At the end, the photoresist is removed,

173
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,046
and the gold is etched away,

174
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,746
as well as the chromium,

175
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,747
leaving behind the microstructure

176
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,747
etched in the Pyrex wafer.

177
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:37,745
Now we present a Pyrex-etching process,

178
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:39,245
in buffered HF,

179
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,245
that does not require the microfabrication

180
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,752
of the expensive gold mask,

181
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:47,647
as photoresist can be maintained

182
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,552
in the buffered HF bath.

183
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:55,454
The process starts by sputtering
a very thin chromium layer onto the Pyrex

184
00:09:55,454 --> 00:09:57,501
to which there is a good adhesion

185
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,000
by the photoresist.

186
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,196
Then we spin coat the photoresist layer

187
00:10:03,196 --> 00:10:05,496
in which the mask structure is patterned

188
00:10:05,496 --> 00:10:07,895
via the usual procedure.

189
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,553
Next, we have to do the chromium etch,

190
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,353
and then the Pyrex etch

191
00:10:14,253 --> 00:10:16,850
using the BHF solution.

192
00:10:17,647 --> 00:10:21,098
The etch rate is now
five micrometers per hour,

193
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,799
much slower than with a pure HF bath.

194
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:27,900
However, we do not need to use
a gold mask now.

195
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,196
Note that, like in the pure HF case,

196
00:10:32,546 --> 00:10:34,746
there is mask underetching

197
00:10:35,796 --> 00:10:37,101
in this process,

198
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,696
because it's a pure chemical process.

199
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,200
The process ends by removal

200
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,697
of photoresist and chromium
adhesion layer.

201
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,799
Here, we show typical profiles

202
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:55,999
that result from an HF
or BHF etching process.

203
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:59,002
The profile in a) is the normal one,

204
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:01,496
but, sometimes,

205
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,197
one obtains a profile like shown here;

206
00:11:05,049 --> 00:11:07,352
much more widened

207
00:11:07,352 --> 00:11:09,745
with respect to the original

208
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,745
hole dimension in the mask.

209
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:14,395
This is an indication

210
00:11:14,395 --> 00:11:16,353
that there was not a good adhesion

211
00:11:16,353 --> 00:11:18,397
of this mask to the glass,

212
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:20,297
and that the etching liquid

213
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:22,302
could infiltrate in between

214
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,102
the glass wafer and the mask,

215
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,946
so that there is a continuous etching

216
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,554
underneath the mask.

217
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,154
The picture on the right

218
00:11:33,154 --> 00:11:36,054
shows an etched channel in Pyrex,

219
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:40,502
and, here, this was patterned
on top of the wafer,

220
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:43,349
which was then bonded,
at high temperature,

221
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,454
with another Pyrex wafer

222
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:48,204
to make a closed channel.

223
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,449
In this lesson,
we have explained the mechanism

224
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:55,953
of HF etching of glass wafers.

225
00:11:56,453 --> 00:12:01,103
We demonstrated the effect
of adding ammonium fluoride to the bath,

226
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,304
which produced a buffered oxide etch,

227
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:04,904
or BHF bath.

228
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:09,354
Then we explained the effect
of glass composition on the etch rate

229
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,545
by incorporating either
network-forming oxides

230
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:16,154
or network-modifying oxides
in the silica network.

231
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:19,346
Finally, we showed cleanroom processes

232
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:21,146
for Pyrex microfabrication

233
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:24,753
using both HF and BHF baths.
