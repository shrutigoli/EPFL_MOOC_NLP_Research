1
00:00:04,211 --> 00:00:08,155
In this lesson we will explain
two techniques for stopping the etching

2
00:00:08,155 --> 00:00:09,705
in a very controlled way,

3
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,351
allowing the microfabrication 
of very thin membranes.

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:17,334
Then we will illustrate 
the potential of this technique

5
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,618
for bulk micromachining,

6
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:24,464
which is microfabrication by etching
through bulk parts of a wafer.

7
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:28,085
In our introductory lesson on wet etching

8
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:33,686
we already mentioned that one can make
a very thin silicon membrane

9
00:00:33,686 --> 00:00:36,338
by implanting it with boron.

10
00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:40,396
And if one etches, then, in KOH solution,

11
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:46,018
the etching stops when one reaches 
this boron-doped membrane.

12
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,138
We can now understand this.

13
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,967
The figure shows the silicon etching rate

14
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,770
as a function of the boron concentration

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:01,239
for different KOH concentrations 
in the etching bath

16
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,341
For boron concentrations 
above 10^19th atoms/cm^3,

17
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,922
the etch rate drops,

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,064
and note that this is a logarithmic scale.

19
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:18,750
This is due to the following mechanism:

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,422
At high boron concentration, 
the silicon Fermi level drops

21
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:30,203
and the electrons that originate 
from the negative hydroxyl ions

22
00:01:30,703 --> 00:01:33,025
tunnel directly into the valence band

23
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:36,524
rather than staying on the silicon surface

24
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:39,979
for regeneration of new 
hydroxyl ions from the water.

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,024
Therefore the etching simply stops

26
00:01:43,024 --> 00:01:47,162
as these hydroxyl ions 
cannot be regenerated.

27
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:50,878
A disadvantage of the boron etch stop

28
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:56,210
is that we have to use 
very high boron concentrations.

29
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,028
And these are not compatible 
with standard microelectronic devices,

30
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:07,147
and also these compromise 
the crystal quality of the silicon.

31
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:13,264
Therefore an interesting alternative 
for making a thin membrane,

32
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,333
is the so-called 
<i>electrochemical etch stop.</i>

33
00:02:17,383 --> 00:02:22,750
In this case, we take
a lightly p-doped silicon substrate

34
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,808
and one deposits on top of that,

35
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:30,790
a lightly doped silicon layer 
with n-type impurities.

36
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,665
Then one brings this substrate 
in the etching solution,

37
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:38,239
in the KOH solution.

38
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:44,052
So the red part is 
protection against etching

39
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:48,802
and this part of the wafer 
is seeing the etching solution.

40
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:54,536
The end result of the etching 
is shown here.

41
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:58,173
We have etched through 
the p-doped silicon,

42
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:01,015
and we recognize the (111) planes here.

43
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:05,560
But when we have reached 
the n-type doped silicon,

44
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,688
the etching stops,

45
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:09,379
and in this way we can make 
here a thin membrane.

46
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:11,925
How does this work?

47
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,343
Two mechanisms are involved.

48
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,448
First, we apply a positive potential here,

49
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:24,668
which produces holes 
at the silicon solution interface,

50
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:30,236
and these attract hydroxyl ions
and form silicon dioxide.

51
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:37,185
A competitive process is
the dissolution of this silicon dioxide

52
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:41,097
forming this complex 
that goes into the solution.

53
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:45,904
If the voltage
that is applied to the wafer

54
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:50,060
is below the so-called 
<i>passivation potential,</i>

55
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,252
the oxide will be formed 
and will be dissolved,

56
00:03:55,252 --> 00:03:56,730
will go into the solution.

57
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,816
So there is continuous oxidation,

58
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:04,586
continuous removal of silicon,

59
00:04:04,586 --> 00:04:06,136
so that means etching.

60
00:04:06,896 --> 00:04:09,575
Above this passivation potential

61
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:13,165
there will be complete 
passivation by oxidation

62
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,952
and all etching stops.

63
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:21,789
Why does it stop at the interface
with the n-type doping?

64
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:26,318
That is because 
this passivation potential changes

65
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,836
and depends on the doping type.

66
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:35,899
This shows a typical current-voltage 
characteristic for p-doped silicon.

67
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,798
Below the passivation potential
that is on this side,

68
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:42,505
there is a current flowing.

69
00:04:43,045 --> 00:04:48,510
As holes get transported to the substrate,
where they oxidize the silicon,

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,730
after which the oxide is removed
by formation of the complex,

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,865
which is an etching process.

72
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:59,912
Above the passivation potential,
the current drops

73
00:04:59,912 --> 00:05:05,042
as the surface is covered 
with an oxide and no etching occurs.

74
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:09,916
Here we have added 
the current-voltage characteristic

75
00:05:10,366 --> 00:05:12,181
of n-doped silicon.

76
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,115
It has a similar behavior

77
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:18,945
but the passivation potential 
is different.

78
00:05:20,745 --> 00:05:24,941
So this shows where we have to put 
the bias voltage.

79
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:27,878
It's where there is the green arrow.

80
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,564
When this is the voltage we apply,

81
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:35,872
we will have high etching 
of p-doped silicon,

82
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:40,266
and zero or very little etching 
of n-doped silicon.

83
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:45,549
And then when reaching 
the membrane with n-type doping,

84
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,314
the etching will stop.

85
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:51,686
We now give examples 
of bulk micromachining

86
00:05:52,176 --> 00:05:56,707
of a (100) oriented silicon wafer
in a KOH bath.

87
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,130
We draw the wafer with the four vectors

88
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,564
indicating the norms
to the respective (111) planes.

89
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:11,537
We have covered the wafer with a mask
with a rectangular opening,

90
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:18,389
which is oriented along 
the &lt;110&gt; direction in real space.

91
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:23,557
The picture below shows 
a cross section of the etching,

92
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:29,579
where one recognizes the typical V-shape
for a rectangle opening.

93
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,960
If the &lt;110&gt; direction 
is in this direction,

94
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,134
the (111) planes, indeed, 
are oriented with these facets.

95
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:48,499
After etching, potassium salt residues

96
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,429
originating from the KOH bath,

97
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:53,900
may remain on the etched structure.

98
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,267
These deposits can be removed
by immersing the wafer in an HCl bath.

99
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:07,808
We have again drawn the same (100) wafer

100
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,928
but now we have deposited a mask

101
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:16,443
with a circular opening, 
like given by this dashed line.

102
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:21,877
If we look through a circular opening 
after etching,

103
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,940
we see, again, four (111) planes.

104
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,307
And we see that the mask is underetched,

105
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:37,286
so a complete inverted pyramid is present

106
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,526
underneath the circular mask.

107
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:44,736
The contour of the basis of this pyramid
is shown by this dashed line.

108
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:50,134
The end result of such a
microfabrication step

109
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:54,384
is a square or more generally 
a rectangular structure,

110
00:07:54,944 --> 00:08:00,495
which encompasses 
all extremities of the mask.

111
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,729
That is because for this situation,

112
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,464
all (111) planes 
are perfectly protected by the mask

113
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:17,005
and no chemical attack via etching 
of other crystal planes

114
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:20,445
are possible to remove the silicon atoms

115
00:08:20,445 --> 00:08:21,827
on a (111) plane.

116
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:26,899
The picture here shows, again,
an arbitrary mask.

117
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,528
And underneath, one sees, indeed again,

118
00:08:30,528 --> 00:08:34,014
these V-shaped underetched structures.

119
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:40,208
This example shows 
the etching of a (100) wafer

120
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:43,613
where we have here a U-shaped mask.

121
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:48,395
We know already that 
the final structure that will be etched

122
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:51,337
will be an inverted pyramid,

123
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:56,888
the basis of which encompasses
all extremities of the mask opening.

124
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:58,708
So the pyramid will be like that.

125
00:08:59,638 --> 00:09:02,250
However, before reaching this end result,

126
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:06,634
the etching bath will etch 
rectangular openings,

127
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:08,808
like shown here,

128
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:14,001
and at this stage 
the etched structure is stable,

129
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,077
and has (111) planes

130
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:23,237
that are not attackable 
via other crystal planes,

131
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,647
except for these two ridges,

132
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:30,376
indicated by the green lines.

133
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:36,644
At the top of these ridges,
the silicon atoms that are fixed there,

134
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:42,623
have less than three backbonds 
to the silicon,

135
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,774
which is the reason why 
they are not so strongly bonded,

136
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:51,115
and why these get attacked 
in the KOH bath.

137
00:09:53,056 --> 00:09:57,288
Therefore at the ridges, 
the etching continues,

138
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:00,909
and the etching front proceeds 
underneath the mask

139
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:04,859
creating this suspended mask structure.

140
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:10,703
At the same time, the etching proceeds 
also in the vertical direction

141
00:10:11,323 --> 00:10:15,430
so that the pyramidal hole 
gets deeper and deeper.

142
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,727
This picture shows 
the situation when the etching

143
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,230
under such a beam is proceeding.

144
00:10:23,712 --> 00:10:28,253
So here we have a mask beam.

145
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,922
These are (111) planes,

146
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:33,620
are not attacked,

147
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,950
but here there is attack on these planes.

148
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,911
So this feature is magnified here.

149
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:47,983
So you see here that the (111) planes 
will disappear at the end

150
00:10:48,711 --> 00:10:52,563
because the attack is going on by 
these planes here,

151
00:10:52,563 --> 00:10:56,232
and the complete silicon 
underneath the beam

152
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:58,328
will be etched away like that.

153
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:04,936
A last example of bulk micromachining
is one in which one has again,

154
00:11:04,936 --> 00:11:09,284
a (100) wafer with a rectangular mask

155
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,594
that has now been oriented

156
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:16,054
along an in-plane &lt;100&gt; direction.

157
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:21,170
That means that this rectangle
has been re-oriented

158
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,797
over an in-plane angle of 45-degrees,

159
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:29,884
with respect to the initial 
rectangular mask we considered.

160
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:32,576
So this is the mask,

161
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:35,522
this is the &lt;110&gt; direction,

162
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:41,531
and we know that the end result
will be an inverted pyramid like that.

163
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:44,664
From the beginning of the etching,

164
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:49,454
the (111) planes in these four corners

165
00:11:50,284 --> 00:11:54,743
will immediately appear 
and will not be attacked.

166
00:11:55,687 --> 00:12:00,952
However, an interesting intermediate 
etching result appears,

167
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:04,259
which is sketched in this cross section.

168
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,746
Here one sees a hole that is etched,
and a vertical plane.

169
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,013
And this vertical plane, during etching,

170
00:12:14,013 --> 00:12:17,044
is going further and further 
underneath the mask.

171
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:20,623
How can we understand this?

172
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,963
We have here a (100)
orientation of the wafer.

173
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:31,384
If we orient the square 
in the mask like this,

174
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:38,316
this direction will be a (010) plane,
and this will be a (001) plane.

175
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:42,381
So that means that 
the planes are identical

176
00:12:42,381 --> 00:12:45,438
in the vertical and in 
the horizontal direction.

177
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:50,778
So exactly the same etching rate,
which will give such rectangular hole.

178
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,999
And these vertical walls, we see it here,

179
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,999
and progessively the vertical holes
will move in this direction

180
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,736
to the extreme directions.

181
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,600
At the end, one will reach a (111) plane

182
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,614
and if one waits long enough,

183
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:13,622
there will be only the (111) facets

184
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:15,993
of the inverted pyramid,

185
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:17,933
which are visible.

186
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:22,615
In this lesson we have discussed 
two etch stop techniques

187
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,172
by which one can make very thin membranes.

188
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:29,040
One etch stop technique 
was due to a heavy boron-doping,

189
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,396
and the second technique 
was the eletrochemical etch stop

190
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:37,234
exploiting the junction 
between lightly p- and n-doped silicon.

191
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:41,070
Finally, we gave examples 
of bulk micromachining

192
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:46,808
based on the orientation and shape
of the mask on a (100) silicon wafer.
