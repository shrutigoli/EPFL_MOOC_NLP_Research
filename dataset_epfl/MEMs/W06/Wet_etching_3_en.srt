1
00:00:04,453 --> 00:00:06,903
Now we will discuss
a chemical etching bath

2
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:09,447
for the isotropic etching of silicon,

3
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,251
which is a so-called <i>HNA</i> bath

4
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,745
consisting of nitric acid,

5
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:17,645
HF, and acetic acid.

6
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:20,495
Then we present the HF bath

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,854
for electrochemical etching of silicon,

8
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:25,553
and for creation of porous silicon.

9
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,145
The HNA bath has three components,

10
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,995
two of which are active in the etching,

11
00:00:32,995 --> 00:00:36,595
namely, the nitric acid and the HF.

12
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,997
The acetic acid is a diluent for reducing

13
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:44,700
and for better controlling
the etching rate.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,150
That is why we only see

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,750
these two components in the reaction.

16
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,800
The silicon is etched from the substrate,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,895
and transported into the solution

18
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:58,253
in the form of this molecule,

19
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:01,550
which is called <i>fluorosilicic acid</i>,

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,400
while the HNO3 and HF are consumed.

21
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,798
Now we will detail
what happens during etching.

22
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:15,301
In acidic media, like nitric acid,

23
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:17,400
the silicon etching process

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,395
first involves hole injection

25
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:22,998
into the silicon valence band

26
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:24,202
by the oxidant,

27
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:26,795
in this case, the HNO3,

28
00:01:27,895 --> 00:01:30,595
which is meaning the same
as removing an electron

29
00:01:30,595 --> 00:01:32,797
out of the valence band of silicon.

30
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:36,399
In the absence of light,

31
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,802
or an electric field,

32
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,451
holes are produced by nitric acid

33
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,751
in an autocatalytic process.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,650
HNO3, when it is dissolved in water,

35
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,651
partially splits up in HNO2,

36
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,048
and it is this HNO2

37
00:01:59,048 --> 00:02:02,648
that reacts with HNO3

38
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:06,703
to form this compound, N204,

39
00:02:06,703 --> 00:02:10,503
or dinitrogen tetroxide, and water.

40
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,452
The dinitrogen tetroxide

41
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:20,549
decomposes in 2NO2,

42
00:02:20,996 --> 00:02:24,201
or nitrogen dioxide molecules,

43
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,750
while the water splits up

44
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,750
in two hydroxyl ions and two protons.

45
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:35,004
The nitrogen dioxide

46
00:02:35,445 --> 00:02:38,703
is the active molecule
that generates the holes,

47
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:41,245
denoted as <i>h+</i>,

48
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,645
as well as <i>N02-</i>,

49
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,445
or so-called <i>nitrite ions</i>.

50
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:54,454
The nitrite ions recombine with protons

51
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:58,452
to form HNO2 molecules,

52
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:02,703
while the holes charge the silicon.

53
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,398
We see here that a nitrous acid,

54
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,698
the HNO2, is regenerated

55
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:12,203
because, in the beginning,

56
00:03:12,203 --> 00:03:15,495
we spoke of an autocatalytic process.

57
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,604
HNO2 is not consumed,

58
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:22,995
but the HNO3, in a way, is consumed,

59
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,346
as, on the other side,

60
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:26,845
we have 2HNO2 molecules.

61
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:30,598
Now we have

62
00:03:30,598 --> 00:03:34,598
a double positive charge on the silicon,

63
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,797
and this combines with two hydroxyl ions

64
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:42,548
to form this <i>Si(OH)2</i> group,

65
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:45,647
and these groups on the surface,

66
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:50,047
they recombine to generate silicon dioxide

67
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,747
and the release of water.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,151
The overall reaction until now

69
00:03:56,151 --> 00:04:00,051
is the transformation
of silicon in silicon dioxide,

70
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:06,101
under the reduction
of nitric acid into nitrous acid.

71
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:10,248
Now the HF comes into play.

72
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:12,950
We have seen, in the previous lesson,

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,750
how HF reacts with the silicon dioxide,

74
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,900
forming the molecule,

75
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,750
fluorosilicic acid,

76
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,950
and water.

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,600
As said before,

78
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,949
the acetic acid is not entering
in these chemical reactions

79
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,547
because it's a diluent.

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,103
Also, water can be used
in the bath as a diluent, by the way.

81
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,251
A ternary diagram like this allows to plot

82
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:47,301
the three chemical components of the bath

83
00:04:47,301 --> 00:04:49,800
on a two-dimensional sheet of paper.

84
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,601
So, this is an axis where we plot

85
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:57,651
the HF concentration from 0 to 100%.

86
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,652
This is an axis where we plot

87
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:04,802
the nitric acid concentration
from 0 to 100%,

88
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:08,151
and, on this axis, we plot the diluent,

89
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:11,251
in this case, water, from 0 to 100%.

90
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:15,351
Each point of the triangle corresponds

91
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:17,752
to a unique composition of the bath.

92
00:05:18,853 --> 00:05:20,045
For example,

93
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:21,347
this red point

94
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,947
corresponds to a mixture

95
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:27,097
with 50% pure HF,

96
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:32,946
15% of HNO3,

97
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,351
and 35% of water,

98
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,498
and you see, together, this forms 100.

99
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:43,816
This red line says that,

100
00:05:43,816 --> 00:05:46,896
all along this line,
if I continue just like that,

101
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:50,298
there is, everywhere, 50% of HF,

102
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:52,949
and, when moving on the line,

103
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,746
one interchanges HNO3 with water.

104
00:05:57,048 --> 00:06:00,096
So, the more we go in this direction,

105
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:02,902
more will there be HNO3 and less water.

106
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,100
Now we can measure the etching rate
for each bath composition,

107
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,400
and then plot the ensemble of points

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,500
where the etching rate is the same.

109
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,352
This is a so-called <i>iso-etch curve</i>.

110
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,651
For example,

111
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,950
this dashed line

112
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,150
corresponds to all
compositions of the bath,

113
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,349
where the etch rate
is 500 micrometers per minute.

114
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:32,749
On this line,
it is 100 micrometers per minute.

115
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:35,353
We see that the highest etching rates

116
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,553
are obtained in a zone of the diagram

117
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,554
where one has about the same quantities

118
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,554
of HNO3 and HF,

119
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:45,504
because both are needed,

120
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:48,345
and where there's only
a small concentration of water,

121
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,749
which is logical.

122
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:55,500
For high HF concentration,
that's in this region,

123
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,751
the iso-etch curves

124
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,803
are parallel

125
00:07:00,803 --> 00:07:03,503
to the lines of constant HNO3,

126
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:08,402
and this means
that it's the HNO3 concentration

127
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:10,802
that controls the etching rate.

128
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,002
In fact, there is enough HF,

129
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,201
and the little number of HNO3 molecules

130
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:20,701
limit the etching rate.

131
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,053
And, in the same way,

132
00:07:24,053 --> 00:07:26,702
for high HNO3 concentration,

133
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:30,701
the iso-etch curves are parallel

134
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,501
to the lines of constant HF concentration,

135
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:39,552
and this means that HF
controls the etching rate,

136
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:43,152
as there are relatively few HF molecules,

137
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:46,152
and the removal of the oxide

138
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,046
represents the limiting step.

139
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:53,498
Here, we present the temperature
dependence of the etching rate

140
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,398
for a bath of particular composition,

141
00:07:56,803 --> 00:08:00,452
namely that having 45% of nitric acid,

142
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,500
20% of HF,

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,200
and 35% of acetic acid.

144
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,550
The x-axis is linear

145
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,554
in one over the temperature,

146
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,554
while, on the top,

147
00:08:13,554 --> 00:08:15,695
we have plotted the temperature

148
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,903
corresponding to this linear axis.

149
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,651
At low temperature,

150
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:25,651
that means at a high one over T value,

151
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,801
the etching reaction
is limiting the process,

152
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:32,200
and the activation energy,

153
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,100
that is the slope of this curve,

154
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,198
is associated

155
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,547
with the oxidation reaction
which is the slowest.

156
00:08:41,245 --> 00:08:42,746
After etching,

157
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:46,152
the surface shows some roughness.

158
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:51,345
At high temperature,
that means at low one over T,

159
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:55,004
diffusion of the active
species in the bath

160
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:57,502
is limiting the etching reaction,

161
00:08:57,502 --> 00:09:00,300
and the etching
results in smooth surfaces.

162
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:03,153
At high temperature,

163
00:09:03,153 --> 00:09:05,703
this etching rate depends now

164
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:08,353
on the agitation of the bath,

165
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:09,945
as, by agitation,

166
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:11,895
transport of molecules

167
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:14,695
is better than by diffusion only.

168
00:09:15,495 --> 00:09:18,599
Also, when diffusion
is limiting the reaction,

169
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:21,999
when one has a wider opening in the mask,

170
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,352
this results in deeper etching,

171
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:29,051
as the access for the reactive molecules
is facilitated.

172
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:33,154
What are the mask materials
that one can use

173
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,554
in an HNA etching process?

174
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:38,150
If one is at a temperature

175
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,648
where the silicon etching rate
is 50 micrometers per minute,

176
00:09:45,048 --> 00:09:48,299
the silicon dioxide
etching time is in between

177
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,395
30 and 80 nanometers per minute,

178
00:09:51,795 --> 00:09:53,295
much slower,

179
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,798
so that silicon dioxide can be used

180
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,799
as a mask when etching silicon.

181
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,900
For very deep etching,

182
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,700
one needs gold or silicon nitrite masks.

183
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,449
One cannot use photoresists

184
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:11,447
as they do not withstand
long to a strong oxidizing agent

185
00:10:11,897 --> 00:10:13,499
like nitric acid.

186
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,151
There are some issues
with isotropic etchants,

187
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:21,951
like the etch rate
that is agitation dependent,

188
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:24,853
and depends on the local condition
of the bath.

189
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:28,502
We explained, during the discussion

190
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,152
of the isotropic etching mechanism,

191
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:34,309
that there is a hole transfer process

192
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:37,952
to the silicon, hence, there is
an etch rate dependence

193
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,954
on the dopant type,

194
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:42,304
and concentration of the dopant

195
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:44,054
in the silicon,

196
00:10:44,054 --> 00:10:45,753
so it makes a difference

197
00:10:46,403 --> 00:10:50,453
whether one has n- or p-type regions

198
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,253
doped in the silicon,

199
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:55,546
or if they have different
dopant concentrations.

200
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:59,246
However, this characteristic can be used

201
00:10:59,246 --> 00:11:01,949
to reveal the number of defects

202
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,546
on the surface
of a silicon wafer, for example.

203
00:11:06,196 --> 00:11:08,896
One etches the surface,

204
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,896
and defects can be etched faster,

205
00:11:11,896 --> 00:11:15,696
and can then be directly
seen on the surface.

206
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,249
We explained that etching
of silicon in an acidic solution

207
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:23,148
involves the transfer of a hole

208
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:25,549
from the nitric acid to the silicon.

209
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:30,451
It is possible to replace
this chemical injection of a hole

210
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:32,995
by an electrochemical procedure,

211
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:35,545
utilizing a milder solution,

212
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:38,951
so that a photoresist mask can be used.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,700
Suppose one has a p-doped silicon wafer,

214
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,000
and that one attaches a conducting wire

215
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,499
where one puts a positive voltage bias.

216
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:54,748
By this, holes will be
transported in the silicon,

217
00:11:55,398 --> 00:12:00,996
and accumulate
at the silicon electrolyte interface.

218
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,353
We have seen that these holes

219
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:08,150
are essential for oxidation,

220
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,150
so the oxide forms,

221
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,945
and this can now be removed

222
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,345
by just having an HF solution,

223
00:12:15,345 --> 00:12:18,196
so there is no longer nitric acid,

224
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,695
but there will be etching

225
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,645
because there was oxidation

226
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,253
at the surface.

227
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,800
Now we change to silicon with n-doping,

228
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,701
and we attach, again,
a wire to the back of the substrate,

229
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,001
and apply the positive voltage.

230
00:12:36,001 --> 00:12:38,698
What will happen now
is that the electrons,

231
00:12:38,698 --> 00:12:40,598
that are the mobile carriers,

232
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:42,399
will be attracted

233
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,699
towards the positive voltage,

234
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:49,400
and we will get, here,
an electron depletion zone

235
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,100
at the contact with the solution.

236
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,652
No etching will occur

237
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:57,352
in a diluted HF solution

238
00:12:57,802 --> 00:13:02,097
as no holes are present at the surface,

239
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:06,200
except if this positive voltage

240
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,000
would be so high

241
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,648
that there is an electrical breakdown

242
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:14,752
by which holes can be transported
to the surface.

243
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:20,604
We are now, again,
in the case with anti-doping,

244
00:13:21,003 --> 00:13:24,896
and we have applied here
a moderate positive voltage.

245
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,246
If we now add to the setup

246
00:13:28,246 --> 00:13:29,453
a light source,

247
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:31,904
we create photons

248
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,704
that generate electron hole pairs,

249
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:40,195
and the electrons go
towards the positive voltage,

250
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:42,503
while the holes remain here.

251
00:13:43,549 --> 00:13:45,896
Now there can be oxidation,

252
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:50,999
and, subsequently,
the HF etches away the oxide.

253
00:13:52,996 --> 00:13:54,696
We are now looking

254
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:58,396
at the current voltage characteristic

255
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,597
of p-doped silicon,

256
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:04,197
which is put into the diluted HF solution.

257
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:07,599
When we apply a positive voltage,

258
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,499
we transport holes to the interface,

259
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:13,899
due to which there is oxidation,

260
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,199
and etching occurs.

261
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,703
More voltage means more holes,

262
00:14:19,703 --> 00:14:23,203
means more etching,
and it follows this particular behavior.

263
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,248
If we apply a negative voltage,

264
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:30,953
this attracts the holes to the wire,

265
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:35,453
leaving a depletion
of holes at the interface.

266
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,099
No reaction is occurring,

267
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:40,400
hence, no current is flowing,

268
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,049
except if the voltage is so high

269
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,249
that one has electrical breakdown.

270
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,750
If one now shines light,

271
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,649
the photons generate electron hole pairs,

272
00:14:52,949 --> 00:14:55,749
the electrons of which
stay at the interface,

273
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:58,299
and these electrons

274
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,699
recombine with protons
from the electrolyte,

275
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,952
thereby generating hydrogen gas.

276
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,000
So, under negative voltage bias,

277
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,898
there is a current that is generated

278
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:14,653
by the generation of hydrogen

279
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,153
and not by etching.

280
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:21,804
If you look back again
at the positive part of the curve,

281
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:24,395
we know that, for high currents,

282
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:28,453
the surface that was etched

283
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,803
appeared bright.

284
00:15:30,703 --> 00:15:32,899
Due to the high number of holes,

285
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:35,653
electropolishing results.

286
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:38,600
If one is at lower current,

287
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,496
the number of oxidation events
is reduced,

288
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:46,096
and one gets only locally
oxidation and etching,

289
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:48,595
resulting in a rougher surface.

290
00:15:50,445 --> 00:15:53,999
If we now take
an anti-doped silicon wafer,

291
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,195
and bring it in the diluted HF solution,

292
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:00,946
and we apply a negative voltage,

293
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:03,349
electrons will be transported

294
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,999
to the silicon electrolyte interface,

295
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,050
in a straightforward way,

296
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,945
to generate hydrogen gas.

297
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,404
If we apply a positive voltage,

298
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:15,703
we will have the depletion layer effect,

299
00:16:15,703 --> 00:16:17,699
which we have introduced before,

300
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,746
so there will be no current

301
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,149
except if there is voltage breakdown.

302
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,598
Shining a light to the wafer

303
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,898
creates holes at the interface

304
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:29,748
leading to oxidation,

305
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,652
and this positive current,

306
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:33,750
represented by the dashed line.

307
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:37,945
A condition for realization

308
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,545
of porous silicon

309
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,345
is to have a low current

310
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,795
and low light intensity

311
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:47,752
in order not to have too many holes

312
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:51,199
at the electrolyte silicon interface.

313
00:16:52,752 --> 00:16:54,349
The top picture shows

314
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:57,249
a cross-section of an n-type wafer,

315
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,999
the surface of which was transformed

316
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:01,595
into porous silicon.

317
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:05,457
The lower picture shows a view

318
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,997
from the top of the wafer.

319
00:17:07,997 --> 00:17:09,751
Pores can be created

320
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:13,554
with diameters ranging
from a few nanometers

321
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,246
to 10 micrometers.

322
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,749
The bigger pores are obtained

323
00:17:17,749 --> 00:17:20,599
by applying a high positive voltage,

324
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,353
resulting in electrical breakdown

325
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,153
of the n-doped silicon.

326
00:17:25,053 --> 00:17:26,653
The smallest pores

327
00:17:26,653 --> 00:17:28,496
are realized at low voltage

328
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:32,303
and by tuning the intensity
of the light source.

329
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:36,850
Pores can be very narrow and very deep,

330
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,845
with an aspect ratio of up to 250.

331
00:17:41,245 --> 00:17:46,154
They can be 250 times deeper than wide.

332
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,003
These very long and narrow pores

333
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:51,853
originate from the fact

334
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:54,203
that the electrical field lines

335
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:57,297
are focused towards the bottom of a pore,

336
00:17:57,697 --> 00:17:59,703
where the holes accumulate,

337
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,595
resulting in oxidation only there,

338
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:06,497
and continuing etching

339
00:18:06,847 --> 00:18:08,546
in the vertical direction.

340
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,504
If one has too many holes,

341
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,197
the holes will be everywhere,

342
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:16,096
and one will not have porous silicon.

343
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:18,447
If there are just enough holes,

344
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:21,947
only etching will occur
at the bottom of the hole,

345
00:18:21,947 --> 00:18:24,752
and the pore becomes deeper and deeper.

346
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This ends our lesson
on the isotropic wet etching of silicon.

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,999
We have first explained the chemistry
involved in isotropic wet etching

348
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:37,700
in a so-called HNA bath,

349
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,246
pointing out the importance
of having holes

350
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,652
originating from the nitric acid

351
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,352
at the silicon surface

352
00:18:44,352 --> 00:18:46,053
to induce oxidation,

353
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:49,003
after which the HF removes the oxide.

354
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:53,504
Then we have explained
the electrochemical etching in an HF bath.

355
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,246
If you apply a positive
voltage to the wafer,

356
00:18:56,246 --> 00:18:58,845
holes can be transported to the surface,

357
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:01,247
and the nitric acid can be avoided.

358
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:05,498
We then explained how porous
n-type silicon can be made

359
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:08,399
by electrochemical etching in an HF bath

360
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,650
by applying moderate current
and light intensities,

361
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,004
so that the number of holes
at the surface is limited,

362
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,102
and they accumulate
only at the bottom of the pores.
