1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,790
We have just seen that the activities that
we desire to specialize in are not known in

2
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,840
advance.
They must be discovered.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,230
The Government needs information
to make decisions

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,740
in terms of priorities and projects.
Not only a general and abstract information,

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:26,180
but a concrete information,
from entrepreneurial practices themselves.

6
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,910
It is the entrepreneurial discovery process
that has to provide this information,

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,160
useful to both the Government
to base its decisions for public actions

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,630
and also to companies
to help them in their investment decisions

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,930
of R & D and innovation.
In this short video,

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,350
we wish to briefly see the heart of the entrepreneurial
discovery.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,590
Its theory will be discussed next week
and its operationalization

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,630
during the third week,
by Martin EICHLER.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,960
The process consists of two phases,
in any case, two logics.

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,430
A logic of identification of priority areas,
and a logic of exploration of each area

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,080
thanks to projects, platforms and collaborations
representing somehow the embryo of the critical

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,030
mass
which is the goal,

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,410
which also helps learning
on the potentials of this area.

18
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,500
Here is the fundamental diagram that will
be often used during the course.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,470
The first phase
is the analysis of the real economy,

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,220
the existing structures,
the major societal,

21
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,150
technological, environmental trends,
the entrepreneurial activity in the region.

22
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:44,300
We have to do a systematic analyze
of economic and industrial structures,

23
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,450
based on relatively standard data and indicators.
This analysis produces various types of information

24
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,020
on the strengths and weaknesses, relative
specializations,

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,180
disparities in terms of dynamism.
Martin EICHLER will present the method developed

26
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,190
by his institute BAKBASEL,
very useful and fruitful to realize this analysis.

27
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:09,110
This analysis must itself be combined
to the analysis of entrepreneurial resources.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,860
More detailed, qualitative and contextual
information,

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,170
that we can not always draw from the statistics
and which are held by regional actors.

30
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:22,120
It could be about
information on the particular dynamism

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,829
of a group of companies
or the presence of a successful actor,

32
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,540
for example a Technological University active
in such and such a field,

33
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,609
or again of the quality of some cooperative
networks

34
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:39,200
with entities outside the region.
This combination of systematic information

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,659
and a more profound and qualitative
knowledge of entrepreneurial resources

36
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:49,349
is the basis of interactions
and dialogues that have to lead to the identification

37
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:56,159
of priority areas.
But the entrepreneurial discovery process

38
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,800
does not stop at the identification
of these strategic areas.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,590
We still have to discover if new and high
potential

40
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,930
for innovation and transformation activities
can be developed.

41
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,840
In these fields,
we must mobilize, stimulate

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,239
and organize the actors of innovation
so that they implement concrete exploration

43
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,930
projects
which will themselves be relatively linked

44
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,430
or related
to form the beginning of a critical mass.

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,489
This block
forms what is called

46
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,519
the entrepreneurial discovery.
From this entrepreneurial discovery process,

47
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,430
new specialties
and transformative activities will emerge

48
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,859
and grow
to reach the structural change.

49
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:41,829
For here is the ultimate goal:
to promote transformative activities

50
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:46,189
which appear most promising at the end
of these different entrepreneurial discovery

51
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,019
phases.
Let's make a few more comments on this fundamental

52
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,730
diagram.
The formal structural analysis

53
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,290
as already said,
must be complemented by a more contextual,

54
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:01,319
more specific
knowledge of entrepreneurial resources,

55
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,379
which is not necessarily shown in the statistics.
We will need to ask the right questions,

56
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:12,471
during the dialogue between all the stakeholders.
What structural changes appear to be the priority

57
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:16,889
for the region?
What kind of transformative activity

58
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,420
would lead to these changes?
Are there enough potentials and entrepreneurial

59
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:25,290
resources
for this activity to be developed here in

60
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,690
a credible way?
The analyzes and knowledge bases

61
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,230
should allow to get a robust
and transparent decision process.

62
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,010
Within the entrepreneurial discovery
the difference between the identification

63
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,840
of priority areas
and

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,800
the exploration or realization of these areas
is very simple.

65
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,860
The identification of priority areas is the
result of formal analysis

66
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,150
and consultation.
It is work “in the office”.

67
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,970
And then,
real investments must be made in R & D and

68
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,030
innovation
to concretely explore the possibilities

69
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,580
and the capacities for transformation,
with projects, platforms, networks in each

70
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,110
area.
The entrepreneurial discovery is only the

71
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,290
first step
of the smart specialization strategy,

72
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,740
because the ultimate goal
is to promote the most promising

73
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,570
transformative activities
to concentrate

74
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,100
and agglomerate complementary resources and
capabilities,

75
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,600
to make critical masses emerge.
The transition to a significant activity,

76
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
the scaling up,
allows to get to a smart specialization.

77
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,090
This scaling up process
is crucial. If it does not happen,

78
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,770
there will be no impact on structures.
Note also that scaling up, Agglomeration and

79
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,970
coordination, can only be done if the potential
field

80
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,030
of specialization is not too wide.
In too wide a field,

81
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,060
for example a field that we would call
transformation of the energy sector,

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,990
there is nothing that can prevent
the scattering of experiments and projects,

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,840
and so ultimately,
there won't be any critical mass.

84
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,140
We also see that such a priority is sectorial;
which is not pertinent,

85
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,260
as already noted.
However,

86
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,900
an area that we could call development of
flexible technologies

87
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,030
for the textile and shoe industries
is a field that is much more circumscribed.

88
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:17,040
We would be then
at the level of a transformative activity.

89
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,760
In this fairly narrow field,
some experiments and projects

90
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,480
would be connected in different ways.
This would lead to the formation of a critical

91
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,040
mass of actors
and services.

92
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,270
Finally let's not forget
that smart specialization strategy

93
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,760
is a living document.
And the entrepreneurial discovery process

94
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,700
is therefore restless.
New priority areas can be identified later,

95
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,060
whereas areas that fail to materialize
will have to be abandoned or at least redirected.

96
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,560
Similarly, in each area, some inconclusive
projects

97
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,800
will be interrupted.
Others will be able to be stimulated more

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,540
strongly.
This principle of flexibility and its operationalization

99
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,820
will be presented during the fourth week.
This principle obviously requires mechanisms

100
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:03,380
of rigorous
and continuous evaluation.

101
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,160
These actions of monitoring
and evaluation which cover all the process

102
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,230
sequences
will also be presented during the fourth week.

103
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:17,120
We can finally observe that
this process of entrepreneurial discovery

104
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,780
is the "bottom up" element of a strategic
action

105
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,990
in which the role and place of the government
are essential.

106
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,300
We are neither in the pure "bottom up"
because the Government decides ultimately

107
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,820
the priority areas
and stimulates the projects in these areas,

108
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,360
nor in the total 'top down'
because the entrepreneurial discovery brings

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,510
to the process of decision,
in a decentralized manner,

110
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,760
decisive information.
We are therefore in an intermediate process

111
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,760
which aims to consolidate entrepreneurial
initiatives,

112
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,380
and their coordination,
in a framework established by the Government.

113
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,450
The diagram that we just outlined is really
central.

114
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,490
Variations are certainly possible,
but the principles announced -

115
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,630
the importance of knowledge
on industrial economic structures

116
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,240
and on innovation;
the analysis of entrepreneurial resources;

117
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,630
the interaction and dialogue
about the potentials and opportunities;

118
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,700
and the double phase of discovery -
the strategic fields

119
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,050
and then the opportunities
and capabilities within each field -

120
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:29,510
are essential principles.
These principles allow to profoundly renew

121
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,339
the political action
when the latter aims to intervene preferentially

122
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,039
to promote certain strategic activities.
We will often see this diagram.

123
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,589
It will be further discussed and operationalized
by Martin EICHLER,

124
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:41,979
during the third week.
