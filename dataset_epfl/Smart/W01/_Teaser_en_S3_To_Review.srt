00:00:18,049 --> 00:00:19,925
Hello and welcome !

2
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:21,287
I'm Dominique Foray,

3
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:24,287
professor at the Federal Polytechnic School
of Lausanne in Switzerland,

4
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:27,762
I lead the Chair of Economics
and Management of Innovation.

5
00:00:28,249 --> 00:00:31,475
I would like to say a few words about
the courses I offer with Martin EICHLER.

6
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:35,500
This course is called
"Design a smart specialization strategy."

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,800
Hello and welcome !

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,662
My name is Martin EICHLER.

9
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,250
I am the chief economist
of BAKBasel,


10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,812
a private economic research
institute from Basel, Switzerland.

11
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:48,012
You know that innovation
and innovation policies

12
00:00:48,212 --> 00:00:48,687
are

13
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:51,974
critical determinants
of economic performance in

14
00:00:52,174 --> 00:00:52,837
the regional level.

15
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,962
But each region is different.

16
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:58,037
And in most areas, we can not do everything.

17
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:01,074
It can not be good for research and innovation

18
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,650
in all areas. It's just a major problem,

19
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,737
of size, of resources.

20
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:09,400
I had the chance to write
the first article on this issue

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,987
in 2009, with my colleagues Bart van ARK

22
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:14,449
Paul DAVID, Bronwyn HALL.

23
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,800
This concept has spread rapidly,

24
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:21,687
particularly in Europe

25
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:23,937
but also in many other countries.

26
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,112
The experience of working

27
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:29,362
with various regions for many years

28
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:32,137
able us to
quickly incorporate the smart specialisation ideas

29
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,874
in the region analysis
and strategy building.

30
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,949
There has been great
excitement around these ideas,

31
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,124
and also some

32
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:42,974
diversity of approaches and procedures.

33
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,149
It seems therefore it is time

34
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:47,237
today to propose a course

35
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:50,287
on how these strategies can be devised

36
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:51,799
and practiced,

37
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,112
on why

38
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:55,487
and especially on the how.

39
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:58,474
During the course we will share
this experience with you.

40
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:01,274
Not only we propose
a systematic approach

41
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,987
but also how to practically apply it

42
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:06,949
and the difference steps
needed in the process.

43
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:09,537
Furthermore,

44
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:12,737
we will show you a couple of
analytical tools and methods,

45
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:15,612
as well as the data
you need to accomplish

46
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:17,562
the sound base of evidence,

47
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:21,262
which is an essential for building
the successful S3.

48
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:23,312
Thanks to the course,

49
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:26,099
you will understand
this set of methods and tools

50
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:27,450
that you can use then

51
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,900
in defining your own

52
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
individual smart specialisation strategy.

53
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,325
Of course,

54
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:35,412
as the strategy is individual
so is the analysis.

55
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:38,150
But the basic toolbox we provide

56
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,850
will come quite handy
once you get started.

57
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,725
We look forward to meeting you

58
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:44,225
during this course.

59
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,000
Join us for this journey

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,087
that takes you through many areas,

61
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:51,387
observe many situations, meet many people

62
00:02:51,587 --> 00:02:53,612
and test tools and methods

63
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:57,312
all this in relation
to smart specialization

64
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:58,437
strategies.

65
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,775
We are looking forward

66
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,700
to see you online soon.

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,087
We want you

68
00:03:03,287 --> 00:03:05,150
for smart specialisation.
