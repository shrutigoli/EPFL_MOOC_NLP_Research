1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,049
Specialization.

2
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:11,120
The big word is out.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,240
It is also a bit of a rude word too,
even if we have just seen that specialization

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,480
is a source of efficiency
in the field of knowledge and innovation production,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,000
and also in the field of the government action.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,930
But this word can also mean
standardization,

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,980
monoculture,
impoverishment of the potential of evolution.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,239
The big question is : if we need to specialize,
on what should we do so?

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,340
How to make choices?

10
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,460
When should we start this process?

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,360
Let's start with "On what should we specialize?"

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,460
Does that mean
choosing two sectors

13
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,810
among the five or six that count in the region,
according to their relative importance,

14
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,489
and
give it all for these two sectors?

15
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,920
But in this case we drag the region
in an impoverishment logic,

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,850
A logic of shrinkening the knowledge base
Why neglect the other sectors?

17
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,820
This is a question that can be asked.

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,390
The spirit of smart specialization,
its philosophy is that this concentration

19
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,499
of resources
on critical areas

20
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,869
is an opportunity to transform.

21
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,149
Smart specialization is therefore not done
at sector level

22
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,039
but it focuses on ways to transform these
sectors

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,509
or create new ones.

24
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,619
A track is identified to transform a sector
and we concentrate resources,

25
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,600
not on the sector itself, but on this path,
this track of innovation and on the actors

26
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,439
and capacities
involved in this transformation.

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,090
We can call this track "transformative activity"
or "new specialty".

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,130
This activity does not concern an entire sector
but the part that is mobilized for this.

29
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,899
I will take the example of Galicia, in northwestern
Spain.

30
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,009
A region
which is not among the most developed in Europe.

31
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,319
It is classified in the group of moderate
innovators.

32
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,799
In Galicia, there are many things.

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,049
There is tourism.

34
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:04,419
There are maritime resources.

35
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:09,050
There is a large university campus
dedicated to the sea.

36
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,140
There are also a large number of automotive
sector companies,

37
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,080
important food and energy
activities.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,030
What could Galicia
develop as transformative activities,

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,140
as smart specializations?

40
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,099
I discussed with my colleagues of the University
of Saint-Jacques,

41
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,959
Carmela Sanchez Carreira in particular,
and we thought that

42
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,180
it would be nice if we could, for example,
promote the development

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,620
of the application of biotechnologies
to improve the productivity and quality of

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,099
fishing activities
and canning factories.

45
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,430
It would be good too
if we could better integrate information

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,459
and communication technologies
in the touristic offer for the development

47
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,420
of digital cultural products.

48
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,590
Or,
develop applications of information technology

49
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,000
for the food industry
to improve the quality of local products.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,569
In all these cases, we see that a smart specialization
emerges through the integration of knowledge

51
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:09,290
from regional capacities
to transform existing sectors.

52
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,469
Sometimes certain required skills are lacking.

53
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,200
They must therefore come from outside.

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,830
We will have to get them.

55
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,590
This is for example the case
of the development of new components

56
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,780
for the car industry
and the companies that will be part,

57
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,129
which requires the cooperation of major contractors
located in other regions,

58
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,219
as well as consulting
services

59
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,299
from a famous University, the MIT.

60
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,989
So,
the food industry in Galicia or the car industry

61
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:42,540
are not smart specializations
just because it is important.

62
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,769
However, the exploration and discovery of
the potential

63
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,120
of information technologies to modernize
certain parts of the food industry,

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,230
or the mobilization of small and medium sized
automotive sector companies

65
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,500
for the development of new products,
can become smart specializations.

66
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,579
In all these cases
the sector does not constitute a smart specialization

67
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,970
but the activity of transforming it
can become one.

68
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,319
Most often, these innovation tracks, these
activities,

69
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,950
are connected to existing structures
and aim to transform them.

70
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,510
It consist in entrusting the smart specialization
strategy

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:22,880
these modernization or diversification objectives,
for the existing industrial structures.

72
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,170
We speak of related varieties
and we will come back to this concept

73
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,170
next week.

74
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,720
We can also have more rarely the exploration
of a new area

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,170
from almost nothing.

76
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,910
That is what we will call a radical creation.

77
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,780
The strategy does not describe an inanimate
structure

78
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,830
of the best industrial branches.

79
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,470
This is not a shop window
where we want to place the most beautiful

80
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:45,260
things in the area,
but it expresses a process

81
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,840
and reflects the ability of a region to generate
new activities

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,510
or specialties to transform structures.

83
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,310
This is the strategy!

84
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,230
It is all of these transforming activities
which have been selected

85
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,880
and on which we will concentrate resources.

86
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,860
And at some point in time,
the strategy does not necessarily express

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,760
all the potential of the region,
all of its strengths, its objectives,

88
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,820
but it reflects what at that time
is the bearer of concrete promises for structural

89
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
change.

90
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,230
Let's now talk about the "how".

91
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,350
We have observed
that specialization was not sectoral

92
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,280
but it is at the level of transforming modes
of these sectors.

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,200
By definition, these ways of transforming
sectors

94
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,160
these tracks of innovation are not known in
advance

95
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,640
and they can not be decreed by the Government.

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,030
They will have to be discovered
by the actors of the innovation.

97
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,160
We will speak of entrepreneurial discovery.

98
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,450
It is a question of interaction between the
Government and the actors

99
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,760
of the innovation.

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,270
The Government does not decree the new specialties
to develop.

101
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,500
It has no ex-ante knowledge to do so.

102
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,430
It will base its decisions
on what this process of entrepreneurial discovery

103
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,760
will reveal.

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,350
We will dedicate the next video to describe
this process of entrepreneurial discovery.

105
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,090
Finally, last question,
When ?

106
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,130
When should we start a strategy?

107
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,360
Nothing is fixed in a smart specialization
strategy.

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,750
It is a living document where new priorities
can always

109
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,160
be added or withdrawn,
according to new opportunities

110
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,260
and what we learn constantly
from the entrepreneurial discovery process.

111
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,910
This flexibility is the logical consequence
of a changing world

112
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,430
in which potentials and opportunities change
constantly.

113
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,760
The answer to the question "When?", is "all
the time".

114
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,530
We have briefly looked at the vast question
of "how to specialize"?

115
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,770
On what should we do it?

116
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,310
How to choose ? When to start?

117
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,130
At the heart of smart specialization strategy,
there is the constant discovery of these strategic

118
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,780
areas
which represent opportunities or ways to transform

119
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,240
and in which we will therefore concentrate
resources,

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,650
form specific capabilities
and generate a critical mass of actors and

121
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:57,650
activities.

122
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,390
You have understood that the discovery of
these priorities and actions to undertake

123
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,370
is the central point.

124
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,000
We will talk about it a bit more
in a final video.
