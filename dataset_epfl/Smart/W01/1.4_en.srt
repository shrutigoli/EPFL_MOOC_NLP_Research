00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:13,130
Quickly to conclude this long introduction,
we want to review

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,160
the main message of smart specialization strategy
already mentioned.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,530
Identify a few strategic areas to build capacities
which will lead to structural change.

4
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:27,279
Thus,
smart specialization strategy has two facets.

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,829
First, lead the structural change,
that is to say the transformation of structures

6
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:34,590
of economy
in a positive direction.

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,020
Diversification, modernization
or establishment of a new industry.

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,359
We have seen the different types of structural
changes

9
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,980
which may seem desirable to preserve
or increase the vigor and dynamism of a regional

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,980
economy.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,940
Diversification,
as the passage from the manufacture of molds

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,430
for glass,
to molds for plastic in the case of Marinha

13
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,430
Grande.

14
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,679
Modernisation, as the example of the sector
of ​​pulp

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,539
thanks to nanotechnology in Finland.

16
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,339
Transition,
as the example of the silk industry moving

17
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:06,500
to technical fabrics in Lyon.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,710
Finally,
the radical foundation as the creation of

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,090
a medical technology sector
in the regions of Basel and Jura.

20
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,280
And the other face of the strategy,
is the building of new local capacities

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,580
to lead to these structural changes.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,399
We identify a desirable structural change
based on the entrepreneurial discovery process

23
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,159
and we will build capacities
in the strategic area concerned,

24
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,360
open and explore this new area and if successful,
move to a larger scale of activities or new

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
specialties.

26
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,840
Of course, one can always
import factors of structural change.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,560
For example, it can modernize its tourism
sector

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,159
by buying the services of a large consulting
company

29
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,549
that can provide a complete service.

30
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,579
This is a sectoral policy which may have its
relevancy,

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,670
but this is not a smart specialization strategy.

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,189
Smart specialization strategy implies
that part of the necessary capacities

33
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,990
for structural transformation
be located in the territory considered.

34
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:09,220
It is upon the policy to decide,
where, in what areas,

35
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,700
to what sector it would be important to set
up

36
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,080
a smart specialization strategy
and where can we settle for a “simple”

37
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,270
sectoral policy.

38
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,440
This depends on the potential and opportunities,
productivity, innovation, and entrepreneurial

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
activity.

40
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,640
In some cases,
perhaps it is better to outsource structural

41
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,050
change
because we do not see too much in the system

42
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,050
who could take charge.

43
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,970
In other cases, it's worth to bet
on local capacities to lead structural change.

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,190
The methodologies presented during the third
week

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,920
will help us to make such decision.

46
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,070
Take the example of tourism.

47
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,730
Many regions dream of placing tourism in their
strategy.

48
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,500
But there is often a confusion
between the fact that,

49
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,350
we must modernize the sector,
diversify it, find new services,

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,190
and that this can be done through potentials,
capacities,

51
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,830
transformative activities developed locally.

52
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,580
In some cases, indeed there are
potentials and opportunities

53
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,880
for the development of smart specialization
linked to the tourism sector.

54
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,200
A few months ago, I visited
Heraklion in Crete,

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,480
where there is a first order research institute
called FORTH.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,850
This institute
develops world-class research

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,530
in information technology and biotechnology.

58
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,010
And the integration of tourism in the smart
specialization of Crete

59
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,870
is possible on this basis.

60
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,790
There is a range of opportunities of application
of information technology

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,820
in the management of knowledge for the archaeological
heritage

62
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,470
or of application of biotechnology to tourism.

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,180
A striking example,
is the project design and demonstration of

64
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,550
an artificial oasis
to promote diving activities.

65
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,570
The exploration of this area mobilizes the
Department of Biotechnology

66
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,630
and marine resources of FORTH, specialized
services

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,450
and actors of scuba diving.

68
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,840
This suggests that the potential and opportunities
present locally justify

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,040
the development project of this transformative
activity.

70
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,450
Another example,
the Centre-Val de Loire region and its famous

71
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,460
castles -
Blois, Chambord, Chenonceau and many others.

72
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,460
Why the integration in the strategy
of an activity linked to tourism

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,890
would be relevant here?

74
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,680
There is in this region a large number of
companies,

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,980
some large, specialized in the restoration
of monuments.

76
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,010
There is therefore an industrial dynamics
and a capacity of innovation at least potentials,

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,810
Within the sector of tourism and cultural
heritage.

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,759
And one can well imagine
a transformative activity to modernize the

79
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,990
sector,
thanks to new technologies

80
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,090
(laser, optical fibre, IT).

81
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:41,050
This in direct connection with the local market;
that of restoration of castles and other monuments

82
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,699
and also historical research, which is brilliant.

83
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,520
But in many cases,
the tourism sector may be economically significant,

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,789
but the capacities for innovation and entrepreneurial
activity

85
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:52,889
are very low.

86
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,460
And therefore, there is no real prospect
of smart specialization

87
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,419
because if structural change there must be,
this can only come from the outside.

88
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,949
The effort of constructing innovation and
entrepreneurial capacities

89
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:09,389
would be too great, probably unrealistic
and economically irrelevant.

90
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:11,669
So we find this problem of being able to give
up,

91
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:16,819
even if the sector is important in the region,
based on the analysis of existing capacities

92
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,030
and entrepreneurial activity.

93
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:21,539
The entrepreneurial discovery process is the
key mechanism

94
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,900
that permits to decide what is worth to undertake
in terms of capacity building in strategic

95
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,599
areas
and what it might be reasonable not to do;

96
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,860
always with the possibility of coming back
to the initial choices,

97
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:36,419
the first priority and the first renounciation,
as we will see later

98
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,449
when we will deepen the principle of flexibility.
