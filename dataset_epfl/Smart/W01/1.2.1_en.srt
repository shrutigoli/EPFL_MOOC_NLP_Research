00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,120
Hello ! In this module,
we want to achieve a feat,

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,369
almost say all in three short videos
on smart specialization strategies

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,090
so that from the start, we can share
a minimum of common notions and convictions,

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,759
to detach from some beliefs
and therefore to adhere to some principles

5
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:27,059
that describe the essence of these strategies.
Let me start with an example :

6
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:32,360
the Oulu region in Finland.
A region specialized in the exploitation

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,620
of natural resources and mechanical
engineering in the 50s and 60s.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:42,160
In 1960, Nokia installed a cable factory.
Here is the industrial structure,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,660
simplified of course, in that region at that
time.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,850
From there and thanks to the commitment of
the local University

11
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,590
and the famous VTT Research Institute
and also thanks to regional policies,

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,780
a high-tech activity develops in development
and production

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:02,500
of mobile and wireless communication system.
This business develops and grows

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,280
to the point of transforming the economic
structures.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,970
We now speak of Oulu as the Silicon Valley
of the North.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,520
The concentration of resources and the integration
of different actors

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,259
helped transform the structures.
Nokia has played a vital role,

18
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,569
but also part of the local industry,
the University, the research centre, the public

19
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:22,859
agency.
However, from 2008,

20
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:27,280
Nokia stops playing the leading role
because its new strategy favours the relocation

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,010
of R-D capacities.
Given the risk of decline,

22
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,700
new activities emerge from the Silicon Valley
of the North

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,579
to lead up to
the development of green information technologies

24
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,509
whose applications are found naturally in
the mining sector

25
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:45,420
which experienced a revival in the 2000s.
We see how, in each period,

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,880
the economic structure has changed,
through building of new capacities

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,609
in new strategic areas.
Capacity in information technology

28
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:58,799
then in clean technology.
We are at the heart of a smart specialization

29
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,840
strategy
even though the concept was not used at the

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,719
time.
The Oulu region gradually discovers

31
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,509
its potential and opportunities.
Strategic areas are identified

32
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:10,940
and we specialize according to these potentials
and these opportunities

33
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,790
to transform the structures.
Structural change is an essential perspective,

34
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,560
it is the opposite of rigid and mired structures
in ancient productive modes

35
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,280
which do not allow businesses to be competitive
or to create modern and attractive jobs

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,439
that young graduates look for.
We will see in the next module

37
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,019
that the structural change can occur spontaneously
thanks to the initiative of companies

38
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,349
and their capacity for collective action.
It works in some cases,

39
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:39,099
especially in the most advanced regions.
But in most cases it does not work.

40
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:43,340
The smart specialization strategy
offers to create the conditions and to set

41
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,430
up a process
to mobilize the actors of innovation,

42
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,360
to embark them in collective action
to develop these new specialties

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,969
which will allow the evolution of structures,
transforming some sectors, diversify the economy,

44
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:59,430
establishing new ones according to a certain
vision of the future.

45
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,080
Develop oneself new specialties
that will transform its economy,

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,670
it is the motto of the smart specialization
strategy.

47
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,969
They are not necessarily
new tools, new instruments,

48
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,040
it is rather a new "mindset"
characterized by an additional intentionality

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,189
and action to establish priorities
and to facilitate coordination

50
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:21,299
for the development of new specialties.
It is a new approach of the innovation policy

51
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:25,580
which requires new knowledge
new information on the region's economy,

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,569
its potential and opportunities.
In this module, we will talk about the four

53
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,280
basic elements
of a smart specialization strategy

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280
which refers to the question of "why, what,
how and when".

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,849
Let's start with the "why".
There are actually two reasons that come together

56
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,770
to justify or motivate a specialization process
in the field of research and innovation.

57
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:51,109
First, when we look at what determines productivity
and the effectiveness of research and innovation

58
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,000
activities,
the logics of scale and spatial agglomeration

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,530
economies
are still there.

60
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,989
There are important indivisibilities
in the field of R & D and innovation,

61
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,629
particularly in terms of a territory.
This means that research and development and

62
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,609
innovation
require many services, infrastructures and

63
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:08,739
skills
whose availability is possible

64
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,530
only if enough activities are undertaken.
And then there is the constraint of spatial

65
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,409
agglomeration.
The innovation remains highly dependent

66
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,470
on the interactions between people, informal
communication,

67
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,220
whether they are planned and repeated meetings
or accidental and surprising encounters.

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,090
The greater the agglomeration
of people, researchers, businesses,

69
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,560
the more the interactions and communications.
With these indivisibilities and these agglomeration

70
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,130
effects,
the concept of critical mass becomes essential.

71
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,750
But a medium sized area can not generate
critical masses everywhere.

72
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,180
Admittedly, a region can be tempted to do
a little bit of everything

73
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,240
but this is not enough. Besides, when we do
a bit of everything,

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,491
we try to do more or less like everyone else,
because we are not specialized in a particular

75
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,410
field
we have a lack of specialty,

76
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,220
we do not stand out, we do not particularize.
If we do a bit of everything and more or less

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,490
the same as the others,
we endanger ourselves to remain subcritical

78
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,770
in every field of research and innovation
and we are therefore not so efficient and

79
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,880
innovative.
And on the whole, for example, the European

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,230
Union,
we will have a map

81
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,740
with a lot of weaknesses and few strengths.
By using the economists jargon,

82
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,340
I will try to avoid it, most often,
we could say that the rare resources here

83
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,910
are the agglomeration economies.
And they dissipate

84
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,020
when all the regions are in competition
to attract the same resources and so ultimately,

85
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,750
most remain under criticism.
We will be able to distinguish ourselves

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,940
only by deepening certain tracks, certain
activities.

87
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,140
This is the first reason of specialization.
We will need to make choices, set priorities

88
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,630
and specialize to create these critical masses
necessary for the efficiency of research and

89
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,940
development,
creativity and innovation.

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Specialization is nothing but a mean
to generate these critical mass effects

91
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,010
in the regions that can not do everything.
There is a second reason that reinforces the

92
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,000
first one.
It takes the limited capacities of the government

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,470
in front of the complexity
and the specificity of innovation systems.

94
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,310
When we seek to form a critical mass
in a specific field of R & D and innovation

95
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:09,840
we also try to form an innovation system.
The innovation system

96
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,380
is somehow the other face of critical mass.
An innovation system

97
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,610
are companies operating in the same field,
or connected fields, a few big actors,

98
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,490
companies and research centers specialized
in this area,

99
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,850
additional services and capabilities also
specialized

100
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,600
and finally the extra-regional networks
which allow local actors

101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,050
to increase their ability to benefit
from knowledge and resources available elsewhere.

102
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,830
But all these elements of the innovation system
are specific

103
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,960
depending on the technological field,
the specialty that is to be developed.

104
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,730
Each innovation system is different
in its composition and its content,

105
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,900
depending on the sector or the technology
area.

106
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,670
The development, as in Oulu,
of a new information technology specialty

107
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,080
involves creating certain capabilities
and certain infrastructures that will be different

108
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,840
from those that should be provided for another
specialty.

109
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,370
But the government will not be able to do
everything,

110
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,610
solve specific problems in each area,
in terms of new infrastructures

111
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,760
and required capabilities
to develop something new.

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,000
Again, we must choose.
And so you see that the argument of complexity

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,080
and specificity of each innovation system
joins that of critical mass

114
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,090
to motivate a certain specialization
given the limited resources

115
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,730
both of the regional economy and the regional
government.

116
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,410
We will talk about the three other questions
in the next video

117
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,639
whether it is necessary to specialize, on
what, how and when.
