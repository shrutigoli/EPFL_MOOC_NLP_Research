1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,366
Welcome everybody.

2
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:11,432
This online course is on defining
smart specialization strategy.

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,523
And we will not only look into
it theoretically, and look at

4
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:19,856
the academic foundations
of the concept, but we will

5
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,153
keep ourselves busy with
how it works in the real world.

6
00:00:25,288 --> 00:00:30,551
Therefore, also it's only in week
three that we really look into

7
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:33,934
the details of the process
of defining the strategy

8
00:00:34,112 --> 00:00:38,300
it is helpful to have a real world
example right from the beginning.

9
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:42,531
And therefore, we have
a first case study today.

10
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:46,563
Of course, this case study
will not look that much

11
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:51,049
into how a region defines
the smart specialization strategy

12
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:52,506
over the strategy itself.

13
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,841
Looks like we are particularly

14
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:59,344
interested in how
the strategy might help

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,743
a region to develop, what are
the advantages if a region follows

16
00:01:03,874 --> 00:01:07,949
the concept of smart specialization,
and how that concept fits in

17
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,273
with other economic
policies in a region.

18
00:01:11,416 --> 00:01:15,304
We are very glad that Jean Severijns
agreed to discuss this with us

19
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:19,372
and help us to provide this
first case study of the course.

20
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:23,411
Jean is a project manager of
internationalization of

21
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,046
the province of Limburg,
in the Netherlands.

22
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:30,379
He's also a long time expert
on smart specialization

23
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:33,624
within his province, but also
in the broader context of

24
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:37,330
the Netherlands, as well as the EU.

25
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:42,084
And actually, Jean applied
the concept of smart specialization

26
00:01:42,263 --> 00:01:46,563
for a much longer time than
the notation of smart specialization

27
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:48,079
actually exists.

28
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:51,666
But, let's listen to
himself about that.

29
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:57,244
We are most grateful to Jean
for his time, his expert knowledge

30
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,530
and that he shares his
vast experience with us.

31
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,513
Jean glad you're here today, it's nice
to have you talking about

32
00:02:06,657 --> 00:02:10,694
smart specialization and what
you do in your province.

33
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:14,184
Maybe you can quickly tell us
what is your role in your province?

34
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:17,609
I work for the province of
Limburg in the Netherlands.

35
00:02:17,743 --> 00:02:19,993
I'm the project manager
for the internationalization

36
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,992
which means I'm responsible for
the international economic relations

37
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:28,769
of the province, I'm involved in
the smart specialization strategy

38
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,241
discussion on the provincial level,
and on the European level.

39
00:02:33,373 --> 00:02:36,673
I'm a member of the Mirror
group for smart specialization

40
00:02:37,211 --> 00:02:42,273
and I was a member of
the stakeholders group

41
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,574
in the southern part of
the Netherlands

42
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,248
for smart specialization,
because smart specialization

43
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:50,859
in the Netherlands, they divided
the Netherlands into four

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,262
geographical areas. The province
of Limburg belongs to

45
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:58,079
the southern part of
the Netherlands,

46
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:00,342
they have their own
smart specialization.

47
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,309
Together the province of Limburg
and our neighboring provinces

48
00:03:03,462 --> 00:03:08,274
Noord Brabant and Zeeland are
members of that preparation group

49
00:03:08,401 --> 00:03:09,776
for stakeholders.

50
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,617
So you're very experienced already
with smart specialization

51
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:15,786
although the concept
is not that old yet.

52
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:19,419
The basic concept of
the smart specialization started

53
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:22,555
more or less twenty
years ago, DG REGIO.

54
00:03:22,809 --> 00:03:26,709
And the province of Limburg
was lucky to produce the first,

55
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:28,382
what was called at that time

56
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:31,722
a regional technology plan,
you can see it here.

57
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,027
It's a collector's item, I think.
It has long history but since

58
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:42,823
2014, smart specialization
is the core content

59
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:46,056
of the operational plans,
by the European commission

60
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:53,584
to invite and to challenge regions
to think about their real strengths.

61
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,367
That was called smart specialization.

62
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:59,184
Yeah, very good. So you
get a kind of a concept

63
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:01,917
to something you were
already doing beforehand.

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,882
-Yes.
-Yeah. Let's have a look

65
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:07,301
in what is your smart
specialization strategy

66
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,551
in the south of the Netherlands.

67
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:13,413
The southern part of the Netherlands

68
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:19,926
has chosen to start thinking,
and we had more than fifty

69
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:24,766
meetings with all the stakeholders,
so regions, companies, cities

70
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:28,494
consultants, ministry,
and a lot of other

71
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:34,889
stakeholders to dig
deep into our real strength.

72
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:40,774
And we came up with
the strategy that consists of

73
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:46,259
three main issues where we think

74
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:47,717
in the southern part
of the Netherlands

75
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:51,238
where our real strength is.
That's high tech systems,

76
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,585
the chemicals and advanced materials

77
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:56,785
and agrofood,and waterculture.

78
00:04:56,924 --> 00:05:02,474
These are the three themes
that we think can really play

79
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,191
an important role on a world level

80
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:13,617
and is a layer of four
other issues and themes

81
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:17,059
that have a kind of
national importance.

82
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:20,816
Like, maintenance, and

83
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,260
medical technology,
and things like that.

84
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:33,661
These are our, let's say,
seven core choices we made

85
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,145
on the geographical level,
the southern part of the Netherlands

86
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:41,366
that was a kind of negotiation,
because a lot of regions said

87
00:05:41,469 --> 00:05:44,469
"But we are strong in design"
or "We are strong in water"

88
00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:52,515
it was a very intensive process,
that's also meant to be

89
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:55,127
a strong intensive process.

90
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:58,994
And two things are important.

91
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,068
First of all, the crossovers
between our choices

92
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:09,678
are very challenging issues,
because the innovation

93
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:15,268
and technology, opportunities,
you often find them between

94
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,231
different issues.

95
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:20,788
And between different industries?

96
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,795
Between different industries,
the different approaches. Yes.

97
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:30,316
And a second important issue is
that we try to give the contribution

98
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,834
to, what is called
societal challenges.

99
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,102
And the societal challenges
are defined on the European level

100
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:43,379
with all member states,
and we think it's important that

101
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:52,415
we, all the actions, we implement
make a contribution to improve

102
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:56,304
to solve the societal challenges.

103
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,426
Now we are very deep
into the discussion

104
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,662
why smart specialization strategy ?
We saw, you presented the focus areas,

105
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,342
the choices you've made, and
the concept is actually about

106
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:12,076
doing choices, but we
call in the course later on

107
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:14,661
priority areas that
you have to choose.

108
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,881
But, again, why did you choose
smart specialization as a concept

109
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:24,937
for your strategy, how is it
different from other kind of policies

110
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,526
like the innovation policy

111
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:30,566
the cluster policy,
or the classic industrial policy?

112
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,010
Yeah, good question.
I think, because we know that

113
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:37,683
in order to survive
you have to choose.

114
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:41,940
Because 99.99% of all

115
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:45,479
the know-how assets are
outside your own organization

116
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,228
whether your organization is,
as mine multi-national

117
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:51,973
or regional, authority or whatever.

118
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,692
And we realized that even before

119
00:07:56,825 --> 00:08:00,000
the policy was called
smart specialization

120
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,135
because we have a mono-economic
structure in our region, in Limburg

121
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:08,214
with coal mines, and also
in our neighboring region

122
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:12,161
there's a very strong automotive,
we closed our coal mines

123
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:16,328
and the automotive industry
in Noord Brabant, the region

124
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:21,988
went bankrupt in the 90's
and then all stakeholders

125
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,329
led by politicians thought:
"We have to make new choices."

126
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:30,855
And you cannot
make choices everyday.

127
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:35,552
So, if you make a choice now,
and you ask money for it

128
00:08:35,657 --> 00:08:38,732
and support from all your
stakeholders in your region

129
00:08:38,872 --> 00:08:46,685
you have to be sure that your
choice is good for the next period,

130
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:54,260
for the next decade, so we
already were on that track

131
00:08:55,077 --> 00:09:00,315
and in addition the Netherlands,
and that's not the same in all

132
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:04,551
European regions, is
a consensus based society.

133
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:11,197
So a cooperation with each other
is more or less in our genes

134
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:17,347
so from that process, that lasts decades,
the start of small specializations

135
00:09:17,466 --> 00:09:20,016
strategy that originally
came from Brussels

136
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:23,611
fit exactly in our process.

137
00:09:23,818 --> 00:09:28,206
So we did not make fundamental
choices in our process

138
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,249
but smart specialization
activities were additional

139
00:09:32,369 --> 00:09:36,419
and fit perfect in things
that we already did.

140
00:09:36,514 --> 00:09:39,627
Priority choosing. So,
focus on focus.

141
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:43,417
So, what I understood correctly,
there are two particular things

142
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,161
you mentioned, one is that
you have to know yourself

143
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,481
really know your strengths
and build on them

144
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:51,149
you have to do research into that,
and agree on that.

145
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,496
-Yes.
-And on the other hand

146
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:56,821
to make choices and focus
your resources on the topics

147
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,220
you can cope with, not on
everything at the same time.

148
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,905
And that makes it different
from horizontal policies.

149
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,564
You have to dig deep, and
you have to base on evidence,

150
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,949
evidence based, and BAK Basel economics

151
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:14,047
for instance, helped us
with these types of studies

152
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:19,966
to know, really, what type of
companies, what is your innovative

153
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:24,660
potential, that when you start
negotiating on your choices

154
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:30,158
to focus on, you need content,
you need evidence based

155
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:35,556
elements, otherwise your choices
are based on more or less nothing

156
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:40,957
and we are very strong in our
consensus based society, as I said.

157
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:48,711
To mobilizer people, building
networks, putting people together

158
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:53,218
to think about what is
really important for us now

159
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,775
and those choices
have to be relevant

160
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,433
for the future too, of course.

161
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,450
Yeah. You mentioned evidence
just a second ago now

162
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,308
do we have some evidence of what
smart specialization strategy or

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,140
concept following it
did for the province?

164
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,300
Did you have success?

165
00:11:10,443 --> 00:11:12,580
As you do it already for
twenty years more or less.

166
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,640
-Yes.
-What are the successes of it?

167
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,596
The success is that

168
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,820
apart from  projects, of course

169
00:11:20,956 --> 00:11:23,593
I can list a long
number of projects

170
00:11:23,739 --> 00:11:29,551
that's probably not what
you are referring to

171
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:37,217
but we managed to bring partners
together in investment strategy

172
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:45,520
so the university at
the province of Limburg

173
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:52,135
and multinationals are shareholders
in what we call clusters

174
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:57,981
because, perhaps in between you
have a smart specialization strategy

175
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,520
for the southern part
of the Netherlands

176
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,215
part of the operational program,
and at the same time

177
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:09,308
of course we have also based on that
priorities in our own sub-region

178
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:11,229
a part of the south part
of the Netherlands.

179
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:15,720
So, in our region, province,
we have four, what we call

180
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:19,854
campuses, on agrofood,
on chemicals and advanced materials

181
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:24,919
on health and life science,
and on smart services.

182
00:12:25,147 --> 00:12:31,047
And those who made an agreement
with the university they connect

183
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,235
all the campuses, so
they decide our policy

184
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,763
to invest also with students,
on every campus so they start

185
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:48,008
teaching on every of the four
campuses, to give the students

186
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,060
the opportunity to link
the academic world and

187
00:12:52,195 --> 00:12:55,195
the day-to-day practical
business world.

188
00:12:55,655 --> 00:13:00,830
And as I said,  we made a strategy
as a province we invest together with

189
00:13:00,966 --> 00:13:04,779
stakeholders for the next ten years,
and we put millions and millions

190
00:13:04,894 --> 00:13:10,744
of euros into our choices, so we
really choose and for the next

191
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:15,975
ten years we will keep that structure,
and we'll keep those choices

192
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,505
and, step-by-step
everyone knows that.

193
00:13:19,701 --> 00:13:23,364
So everybody, small, medium
size enterprise and others

194
00:13:23,481 --> 00:13:28,469
national, international,
now try to join the bandwagon.

195
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:32,959
So we know the choices that we have,
based on our smart specialization

196
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:36,446
strategy, and I will say it's
a success, you can see it

197
00:13:36,564 --> 00:13:37,976
in the figures, perhaps we can

198
00:13:38,094 --> 00:13:41,094
discuss that later,
in another setting.

199
00:13:41,468 --> 00:13:44,881
But in that way, you bring together
the entrepreneurial resources

200
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:49,434
activities from the companies
on one side, and the academia

201
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:53,705
and the industry, the production on
the other side, and the government

202
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,302
is kind of facilitating
the whole process.

203
00:13:56,412 --> 00:14:00,049
-That's perfect.
-You started in the past

204
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,820
but now we see, the past,
it was more of a major role

205
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:09,161
of the regional government,
now we share that role

206
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:12,889
in the strategy building,
the priority setting

207
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:17,083
and the implementation together
with universities so the academic

208
00:14:17,144 --> 00:14:21,344
world, the science, and
the business community.

209
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:25,840
Great. If you broadened it a little
bit about the success smart

210
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:29,381
specialization strategy,
the southern part of

211
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,044
the Netherlands is quite
successful throughout the region.

212
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:38,318
Your personal feeling, what did
smart specialization contribute

213
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:41,110
to that success,
or did it contribute?

214
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:48,455
It absolutely contributed,
but perhaps also in another way

215
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,047
that was not expected before

216
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,948
and that's the cooperation
in your own member state.

217
00:14:56,147 --> 00:15:00,597
There's a lot of effort to
cooperate internationally

218
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,397
and I'm responsible for
international relations

219
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:03,774
so I loved it.

220
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,777
But what you also see is to
cooperate with your neighbors.

221
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:14,412
And that's caused mainly by
smart specialization strategy.

222
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:18,788
Now we cooperate more with our
neighboring regions in Noord Brabant

223
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:22,272
for Limburg, and
the Zeeland because

224
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:25,296
there is smart
specialization strategy.

225
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:29,136
And there is the ERDF, money
from the European commission

226
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:30,215
and now we start thinking:

227
00:15:30,344 --> 00:15:33,719
"Well, we choose for
the bio-based economy."

228
00:15:33,871 --> 00:15:38,396
for instance, as a cross-over
in our priorities, so now we

229
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:45,824
investigate in depth what are these
opportunities with our neighbors

230
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:49,194
and perhaps we wouldn't
have done that so in depth

231
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,416
without the smart specialization
strategy, just as an example.

232
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:59,154
And our relation with
the national ministry also

233
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,749
it's not changed, but it's given
extra dimension, because

234
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,624
in smart specialization is
co-financed by the national

235
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:12,214
government and Europe, we have
additional relation in those types

236
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,950
of discussions with our
national government.

237
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,928
So, there's also impact and also
the relation to our neighbors in

238
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,044
Belgium and Germany, because
we are a border region.

239
00:16:22,257 --> 00:16:26,394
And ten percent of our budget we
can use for cross-border activities.

240
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:27,875
Just as an example.

241
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:31,540
-Okay, so big impact.
-Yes it has a big impact. Yes.

242
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,578
Now, the Netherlands and, as you
said also a cultural thing is a very

243
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:43,995
it seems suiting setting for such
a strategy and that's probably

244
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,853
the reason why you already
do that for about twenty years

245
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:50,664
and you pointed out, so the concept
was not there at that point.

246
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,747
What do you think for other regions?
What can other regions take from it?

247
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,820
Is it something that needs
the special setting, or can

248
00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:01,438
other regions with other cultural
and economic background also

249
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,331
advance by smart specialization?

250
00:17:04,749 --> 00:17:06,137
I think you can make smart

251
00:17:06,224 --> 00:17:09,224
specialization
strategy for all regions

252
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:16,297
because it is not necessary to have
a high-tech or high-innovative or

253
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:20,089
or high research potential in order
to make a smart specialization.

254
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:24,842
You can also do it for
tourism or for whatever.

255
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:30,964
It's important that you reel in
evidence based, good insight

256
00:17:31,098 --> 00:17:38,960
into the strength of your region,
and try to organize commitment

257
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,495
and consensus to make choices

258
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,310
and organize consensus
on your choices, but you have to

259
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:50,028
prove that you make a proper
process, that you involved all

260
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,870
the relevant stakeholders in your
choice, so focus on focus

261
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:58,896
define priorities, and make sure
that all your relevant stakeholders

262
00:17:59,057 --> 00:18:02,857
in your region follow that choice.

263
00:18:03,198 --> 00:18:06,010
Jean, thank you very much for
your time, it was most interesting

264
00:18:06,145 --> 00:18:09,383
for us and it will help to
continue that discussion.

265
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,087
Okay, thank you for the invitation.
