1
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:10,320
In this module,
we want to draw your attention to the following

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,350
difference:
the difference between a spontaneous dynamic

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,480
entrepreneurial discovery and structural change
and a smart specialization strategy.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,539
This difference is important to understand
two things.

5
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,839
The entrepreneurial discovery in the sense
of identification

6
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:30,439
and exploration of a new strategic area,
of opportunity

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,860
which eventually leads to a structural change,
is not a new phenomenon.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,890
These entrepreneurial discoveries have allowed
in all time

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,690
for industrial structures to evolve and transform
in a spontaneous dynamic framework.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,989
We shall see with examples taken from the
history of innovation.

11
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,670
What is new is the idea that
today, we need very often, a strategy

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,749
or a policy for organizing these entrepreneurial
discoveries

13
00:00:57,749 --> 00:00:59,739
and lead structural change.

14
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:04,610
We come back here to a graph already seen
and we remove everything concerning the organized

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,410
part
of the entrepreneurial discovery.

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,300
We have left what concerns the real economy.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,000
The transformation of a sector by an entrepreneurial
discovery

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,360
which occurs naturally or spontaneously
thanks to firms capabilities

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,330
to identify new strategic areas and to exploit
it,

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,950
and thanks to the fact that the activity or
the specialty that is generated

21
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,310
can grow without much difficulty.

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,840
In other words, the structural change
can be driven by the natural ability of firms

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,100
to diversify and create spin-offs
which explore new areas

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,640
by the arrival of new players, etc.

25
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,520
And history is full of these spontaneous processes
which often start

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,810
by entrepreneurial desire to diversify
and which result in a structural change

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,890
that benefits an entire region.

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,810
I'll give you some examples.

29
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,630
These are ancient examples
that appear to you far from present realities,

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,300
yet they offer each a particular version of
a spontaneous entrepreneurial discovery process

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,650
which leads to a profound structural change.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,990
It is located in Morez, French Jura,
in the factory of Pierre Hyacinthe Cazeaux,

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,090
1790.

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,270
This one has a small nail factory.

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,310
He will soon discover that his production
system

36
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,990
can be adapted fairly easily to the production
of eyeglasses.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,960
This is the critical moment of the entrepreneurial
discovery

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,530
which focuses on technology but also on the
market opportunity.

39
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,460
Indeed, the market for eyewear
is a market on the verge of phenomenal growth.

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,310
Pierre Hyacinthe is transforming his production
workshop,

41
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
and goes into the eyewear.

42
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,380
This entrepreneurial discovery informs
the entire local community

43
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,319
so that other companies enter this new market
and complementary capacities are made available.

44
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:50,610
There is therefore a rise in scale and agglomeration.

45
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,320
A few decades later, Morez will appear
as a world capital of eyewear.

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,590
The entrepreneurial discovery of Pierre Hyacinthe,
and his transformation into new specialty,

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,310
have created a very significant structural
change for the entire region.

48
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:12,110
The entrepreneur has explored a new area
on the basis of important investment

49
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,150
relative to its capacity and has assumed great
risks.

50
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,260
In the case of Morez
we speak here less of diversification

51
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,760
than transition from a declining area to
a growing field.

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,110
Let us now visit Hannibal Abrantes
in the small Portuguese town of Marinha Grande

53
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,670
in 1920.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,220
Hannibal had a mold manufacturing company
for glass.

55
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:38,150
But its main market stagnates.

56
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,470
And Hannibal also observed
the flood of new objects on Europe,

57
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,180
plastic objects.

58
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,290
Hannibal will travel across Europe to bring
to Marinha Grande

59
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,140
all kinds of plastic products: toys,
utensils, other products.

60
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,910
And he decided to convert his production facility
to start production of molds

61
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,770
for the emerging plastics industry.

62
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,040
This entrepreneurial discovery
that is, once again, technological and economic,

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,349
borns a structural change of which we still
see today

64
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,080
the traces in Marinha Grande.

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,120
Two interrelated clusters,
molds and plastics industries.

66
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,519
Now we go to a map which I love because I
am

67
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,210
native of this city and I would like to mention
the Lyon-based companies of silk.

68
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,800
The Lyon silk, modern heirs of the Canuts,
occupy a prestigious and secure place

69
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,460
in the tapestry market, sailing and luxurious
fabrics.

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,110
Again, the market declines.

71
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,189
But a group of silk entrepreneurs
observes from 1950

72
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,090
the advent of composite fibres and polymers.

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,379
In collaboration with the Lyon chemistry,
they will explore a new area:

74
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:57,620
combine their knowledge with those chemists
and develop the specialty of technical fabrics.

75
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,559
Technical fabrics whose markets are of aeronautic,
transportation equipment, sporting goods

76
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:04,530
or medical technology.

77
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,270
Famous products like the nose of the Concorde,
Airbus A330 drift

78
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,990
or sailing for some boats of the America's
Cup

79
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,439
symbolize the success of this process of entrepreneurial
discovery.

80
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:22,599
Again, exploring a new area,
spontaneous entrepreneurial discovery

81
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:26,699
led to a major structural change.

82
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,379
Move quickly to Finland now,
to quickly evoke the pulp industry.

83
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:35,939
Here again, a spontaneous entrepreneurial
discovery is observed.

84
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,180
These companies facing problems
of productivity and product quality

85
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:44,479
come together to explore the potential of
nanotechnology

86
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,419
in order to improve their operational process
and control and regulation,

87
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,659
Here again, a spontaneous entrepreneurial
discovery

88
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:58,069
which will provide additional modernization
in the sector.

89
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,589
A final example of spontaneous dynamics
but this time not about the modernization

90
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:08,110
of industry
or the diversification of some companies

91
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,180
but rather on the radical creation of a new
activity.

92
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,199
We're in the Basel region,
northwest of Switzerland in the 60s.

93
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:25,249
A region known for its chemistry and pharmacy,
and also near an exceptional industrial base

94
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:30,189
in the high quality metallurgy
and micromechanics domains, especially related

95
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,259
to the activity of watchmaking.

96
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:34,360
I'll tell you the whole story.

97
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,740
These are surgeons who want to revolutionize
how they heal fractures

98
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,330
at a time when road accidents
and those of winter sports multiply.

99
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,699
They bet on osteosynthesis.

100
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,419
Internal fracture fixation with plates and
screws,

101
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:52,240
early functional exercise of the patient.

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,839
A project whose artistic vision
is due to one of them, Martin Allgöwer.

103
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,219
It also combines micromechanics SME,
including that of Robert Mathis to make tools

104
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:10,339
and instruments of high quality standard.

105
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:15,680
This entrepreneurial discovery is at the origin
Of the Swiss medical technology industry

106
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,749
that counts today
several world leaders.

107
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:22,360
These stories are very different.

108
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,689
Morez, Marinha Grande, Lyon, Finland, Basel
and Biel.

109
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,499
They are much more complicated than what we
said.

110
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,490
But our simplification
helps to discover a common structure.

111
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,770
In all cases, there was an entrepreneurial
discovery,

112
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,999
opening and exploring a new area of ​​opportunity
and this entrepreneurial discovery turns

113
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:51,080
in a new business and a new specialty
which grows by feeding on the entry of new

114
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,150
firms,
and the agglomeration of complementary activities

115
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,699
of suppliers,
specialized services, adequate training,

116
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:04,069
which results possibly
to the transformation of existing structures.

117
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,039
History is full of cases
of smart specialization

118
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,430
With very little public action.

119
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,689
The exploration of a new strategic area
to transform a sector or create a new one;

120
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:22,110
and this exploration is provided spontaneously;
for example, when it happens within a large

121
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,819
company,
which looks for some diversification,

122
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,849
or when it takes place
through collective action of SMEs

123
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:34,020
or tthanks to the persuasiveness and organization
of a very entrepreneurial university.

124
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,839
However, history also abounds in blocked industrial
structures

125
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,930
and missed opportunities;
an industrial base that fails to renew itself.

126
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:49,520
This may concern companies that are weakened
and therefore, have poor entrepreneurial capacity.

127
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,709
This would be the opposite of all the examples
that we had just seen.

128
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,910
But this can also involve a cluster
and there will be no taboo in this course.

129
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,610
We know of many situations of stiff clusters
and a little bogged down, which can no longer

130
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,810
lead
these entrepreneurial discoveries

131
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:08,149
that would allow them to renew;
with, as results, structures that don't evolve

132
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:11,630
any more,
do not renew any more, do not diversify any

133
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,630
more.

134
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,519
We would then need
a smart specialization strategy.
