00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,990
Hello everyone, and welcome to the introductory
lecture

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,840
of our MOOC on designing a smart specialization
strategy.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,090
My name is Andrea and I'm a project manager
at Bak Basel economics.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:19,570
And I'm also one of the teaching assistants
of this MOOC.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,529
We are very excited to be able to offer this
online course,

6
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,420
since we believe this approach has great potential
to assist you,

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,859
policy makers, experts, as well as public
agencies,

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,350
in structuring their policy and development
programs.

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,370
This course will equip you with the most fundamental
methods

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,870
and techniques to design a smart specialization
strategy for your region.

11
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:44,710
This introductory video will give you a general
overview,

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:48,980
as well as an idea on how the course is organized,
and what you can expect from us.

13
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,460
Also, I would like to point out what we expect
from you.

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,030
I presume the information on this slide is
not much news to you.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,180
This MOOC is led by Professor Dominique Foray
And Martin Eichler,

16
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,520
both experts in the field of smart specialization
strategies.

17
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,290
Dominique, who co-authored the concept during
his time in the

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,630
knowledge of growth expert group In the European
commission.

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,939
And Martin in turn, who engages himself in
regional benchmarking

20
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,860
as chief economist at Bak Basel economics
since many years.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,170
Teaching assistants are Camille and me.

22
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,780
If you have questions or suggestions regarding
the course,

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,610
please just drop Camille or me an email
to the following email addresses.

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,960
Let's have a quick look at the general objectives
of the course.

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,759
During the course we will propose not only
a systematic approach

26
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,000
to understand the Smart Specialization concept,
but we will also explain how to apply it,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,830
in concrete terms, through case studies.

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:46,590
And we will identify the different stages
necessary for the designing of a Smart Specialization

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,689
Strategy.

30
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,890
In addition, we will present the analytical
tools,

31
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,479
methods, and data that permit the development
of a knowledge base,

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,860
essential for the implementation of this strategy.

33
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,260
What you see here is the basic structure of
our MOOC.

34
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,579
We put a lot of effort in this because we
believe that

35
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,270
the application of the presented methods and
tools is crucial.

36
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,660
We base our tools on of course the lectures,
the storyboards, and the recommended reading.

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,760
Also, since we consider you experts in the
field of

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,790
smart specialization strategies,
we would like to get as interactive as possible

39
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,480
in the next five weeks.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,230
therefore, we offer a wide range
of different learning activities, in which

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,320
you can express yourself.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,500
We prepared a storyboard for each week.

43
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,449
It not only describes what will happen during
this week

44
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,359
but also sums up the most important learning
objectives

45
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,330
of the respective week.

46
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,480
It also includes the bibliography of the week,
as well as the topic of the peer reviewed

47
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
assignment.

48
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,510
Now let's discuss the learning activities
proposed in our course.

49
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,040
As I already mentioned before, we consider
you experts

50
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,600
in the field of smart specialization strategies,
or regional economic development in general.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,570
We do not only want to teach the concept,
but also would like to give you the opportunity

52
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,661
to share your experience
in order for us to, together with you, learn

53
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,920
from it.

54
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,290
Your expertise is part of our teaching material.

55
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,350
We therefore offer several channels in order
to make our online course

56
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,540
as interactive as possible.

57
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,320
In order to test yourself with respect to
the required knowledge,

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,620
after every module, you will solve a quiz
in the form of multiple choice questions.

59
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,440
We would like you to think outside of the
box

60
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,820
and reflect on what you've learned.

61
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,750
For this reason we will have special forums,
where we will start an interactive discussion

62
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,260
on a specific topic related to this content.

63
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,600
Note that there will always be a general forum
for each module

64
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,820
where you can ask questions, or share your
thoughts and suggestions

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,220
with us and your peers.

66
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,290
Furthermore we will have formative assessments,
and a graded assignment

67
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,900
reviewed by your peers at the end of every
week.

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,750
The purpose of the formative assessment
is to prepare you perfectly for the final

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,750
assignment
at the end of the five weeks.

70
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,979
It will give you the opportunity
to reflect on your knowledge and update it

71
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,040
along with the course,
and therefore learn in a very effective way.

72
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,820
All those channels of learning activities,
together with the peer-reviewed assignment,

73
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,910
will enable you, together with us,
to take very much advantage of this MOOC

74
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,940
and interact with each other as much as possible.

75
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,120
Our goal of this course is not only to teach
the concept,

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,400
and its implications, but also to learn about
your experiences,

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,220
and practical knowledge, since your expertise
matters a lot

78
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,720
for this MOOC to fulfill its purpose.

79
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,010
And therefore, we are very much looking forward
to the following five weeks that we will spend

80
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,380
with you.

81
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,400
We very much hope that you will enjoy it as
much as we do,

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,760
and did, during the production of this course.

83
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,650
Thank you for your attention and see you soon.
