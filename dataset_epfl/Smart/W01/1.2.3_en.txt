We have just seen that the activities that we desire to specialize in are not known in advance.
They must be discovered.
The Government needs information to make decisions in terms of priorities and projects.
Not only a general and abstract information, but a concrete information, from entrepreneurial practices themselves.
It is the entrepreneurial discovery process that has to provide this information, useful to both the Government to base its decisions for public actions and also to companies to help them in their investment decisions of R & D and innovation.
In this short video, we wish to briefly see the heart of the entrepreneurial discovery.
Its theory will be discussed next week and its operationalization during the third week, by Martin EICHLER.
The process consists of two phases, in any case, two logics.
A logic of identification of priority areas, and a logic of exploration of each area thanks to projects, platforms and collaborations representing somehow the embryo of the critical mass which is the goal, which also helps learning on the potentials of this area.
Here is the fundamental diagram that will be often used during the course.
The first phase is the analysis of the real economy, the existing structures, the major societal, technological, environmental trends, the entrepreneurial activity in the region.
We have to do a systematic analyze of economic and industrial structures, based on relatively standard data and indicators.
This analysis produces various types of information on the strengths and weaknesses, relative specializations, disparities in terms of dynamism.
Martin EICHLER will present the method developed by his institute BAKBASEL, very useful and fruitful to realize this analysis.
This analysis must itself be combined to the analysis of entrepreneurial resources.
More detailed, qualitative and contextual information, that we can not always draw from the statistics and which are held by regional actors.
It could be about information on the particular dynamism of a group of companies or the presence of a successful actor, for example a Technological University active in such and such a field, or again of the quality of some cooperative networks with entities outside the region.
This combination of systematic information and a more profound and qualitative knowledge of entrepreneurial resources is the basis of interactions and dialogues that have to lead to the identification of priority areas.
But the entrepreneurial discovery process does not stop at the identification of these strategic areas.
We still have to discover if new and high potential for innovation and transformation activities can be developed.
In these fields, we must mobilize, stimulate and organize the actors of innovation so that they implement concrete exploration projects which will themselves be relatively linked or related to form the beginning of a critical mass.
This block forms what is called the entrepreneurial discovery.
From this entrepreneurial discovery process, new specialties and transformative activities will emerge and grow to reach the structural change.
For here is the ultimate goal: to promote transformative activities which appear most promising at the end of these different entrepreneurial discovery phases.
Let's make a few more comments on this fundamental diagram.
The formal structural analysis as already said, must be complemented by a more contextual, more specific knowledge of entrepreneurial resources, which is not necessarily shown in the statistics.
We will need to ask the right questions, during the dialogue between all the stakeholders.
What structural changes appear to be the priority for the region?
What kind of transformative activity would lead to these changes?
Are there enough potentials and entrepreneurial resources for this activity to be developed here in a credible way?
The analyzes and knowledge bases should allow to get a robust and transparent decision process.
Within the entrepreneurial discovery the difference between the identification of priority areas and the exploration or realization of these areas is very simple.
The identification of priority areas is the result of formal analysis and consultation.
It is work â€œin the officeâ€�.
And then, real investments must be made in R & D and innovation to concretely explore the possibilities and the capacities for transformation, with projects, platforms, networks in each area.
The entrepreneurial discovery is only the first step of the smart specialization strategy, because the ultimate goal is to promote the most promising transformative activities to concentrate and agglomerate complementary resources and capabilities, to make critical masses emerge.
The transition to a significant activity, the scaling up, allows to get to a smart specialization.
This scaling up process is crucial. If it does not happen, there will be no impact on structures.
Note also that scaling up, Agglomeration and coordination, can only be done if the potential field of specialization is not too wide.
In too wide a field, for example a field that we would call transformation of the energy sector, there is nothing that can prevent the scattering of experiments and projects, and so ultimately, there won't be any critical mass.
We also see that such a priority is sectorial; which is not pertinent, as already noted.
However, an area that we could call development of flexible technologies for the textile and shoe industries is a field that is much more circumscribed.
We would be then at the level of a transformative activity.
In this fairly narrow field, some experiments and projects would be connected in different ways.
This would lead to the formation of a critical mass of actors and services.
Finally let's not forget that smart specialization strategy is a living document.
And the entrepreneurial discovery process is therefore restless.
New priority areas can be identified later, whereas areas that fail to materialize will have to be abandoned or at least redirected.
Similarly, in each area, some inconclusive projects will be interrupted.
Others will be able to be stimulated more strongly.
This principle of flexibility and its operationalization will be presented during the fourth week.
This principle obviously requires mechanisms of rigorous and continuous evaluation.
These actions of monitoring and evaluation which cover all the process sequences will also be presented during the fourth week.
We can finally observe that this process of entrepreneurial discovery is the "bottom up" element of a strategic action in which the role and place of the government are essential.
We are neither in the pure "bottom up" because the Government decides ultimately the priority areas and stimulates the projects in these areas, nor in the total 'top down' because the entrepreneurial discovery brings to the process of decision, in a decentralized manner, decisive information.
We are therefore in an intermediate process which aims to consolidate entrepreneurial initiatives, and their coordination, in a framework established by the Government.
The diagram that we just outlined is really central.
Variations are certainly possible, but the principles announced - the importance of knowledge on industrial economic structures and on innovation; the analysis of entrepreneurial resources; the interaction and dialogue about the potentials and opportunities; and the double phase of discovery - the strategic fields and then the opportunities and capabilities within each field - are essential principles.
These principles allow to profoundly renew the political action when the latter aims to intervene preferentially to promote certain strategic activities.
We will often see this diagram.
It will be further discussed and operationalized by Martin EICHLER, during the third week.
