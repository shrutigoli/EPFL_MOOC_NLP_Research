1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,750
The objective of structural change
is, without doubt, reachable without deliberate

2
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,530
policy
by simply betting on the ability of companies

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,139
to diversify
on the dynamism of startups, on the mobility

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,390
of people
and the motivation of firms to cooperate and

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,090
combine their knowledge.

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,940
All of this can work in certain conditions.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,790
But this does not always work.

8
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,660
We talk now, and to finish,
about the failures and structural blockages.

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,230
The signs of a failure of entrepreneurial
discovery

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,260
and structural change are numerous.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,550
Weakness of new activities and new industries
creation,

12
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,890
employment structure which remains dominated
by traditional jobs and skills.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,440
Paula Stephan, a colleague, an economist in
the United States,

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,930
analyzed what she called: the "Midwest syndrome".

15
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,680
She described this situation of the midwest
states of the US

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,200
which are states of rich industrial tradition.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,399
These states have invested heavily in an infrastructure
of public

18
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,280
and scientific training research.

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,760
Important and well equipped doctoral programs.

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,420
They attracted excellent scientists.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,020
The problem is that those who are trained
in advanced research fields

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,900
will then go to find their first job elsewhere
on the west coast, on the east coast.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,710
The figures in this brain drain are striking.

24
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,700
In the 2000s, these states retained on average
only 3% of their PhD.

25
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,030
These figures express
a big gap between research and quality training

26
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,310
and outdated industrial structures,
which have not been able to renew by spontaneous

27
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,560
processes
of structural change and are therefore unable

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
to offer
the attractive jobs that these young graduates

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,759
are looking for.

30
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,240
These failures can come from multiple sources
:

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,900
Lack of entrepreneurial discovery:
Potential new areas of diversification or

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,070
modernization
are not identified or explored.

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,140
There are problems of information externality,
sorry for the jargon,

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,439
we'll talk about it again in the second week.

35
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,900
There are also problems of capacities, risks
and financing.

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,440
There can also be cognitive problems,
of creative myopia linked, for example,

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,980
to the phenomenon of "Company town".

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,580
There is only one large company in the region
and it tends to overestimate its own capacities,

39
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,560
it neglects the external inputs
and will have difficulties in engaging in

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,190
new strategic areas.

41
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,599
There are also problems of collective inertia.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,190
In this case, it is a group of companies
which have been successful in a certain field,

43
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,420
and because of this exact success, have difficulties
to engage

44
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,280
and explore new directions.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,170
We can also think about coordination failures
and difficulties of all kinds

46
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,129
which prevent an entrepreneurial discovery
to turn into a new activity

47
00:02:55,129 --> 00:03:00,220
to reach a critical size
and to eventually lead to a structural change.

48
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,510
It is certain that the importance today of
science,

49
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,900
and technology in innovation
and the complexity of the relevant knowledge

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,569
bases
force to go more than before through partnerships

51
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,150
and collaborative networks.

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,130
Which makes the entrepreneurial discovery
less spontaneous obviously.

53
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,730
Morez is gone, remember.

54
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,040
Pierre Hyacinthe who does everything alone.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,830
The financing of activities,
aiming to open and explore a new area,

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,680
activities that are, by definition, risky,
is also more difficult.

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,970
Global competition also increases the level
of demand.

58
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,520
It is less easy to find a competitive niche
and to keep it for a long time.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,700
Even a cluster is not a guarantee,
an insurance against all risks

60
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,080
that we will be able to produce enough entrepreneurial
discoveries.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,980
A cluster is just a structure
which has certain spatial concentration characteristics

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,420
and from which a certain dynamism is expected
thanks precisely to its virtues of proximity.

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,200
But there is no magical effect.

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,459
And a number of clusters are not so dynamic
and do not represent the expected engine

65
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,409
to trigger the dynamics of entrepreneurial
discovery

66
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:09,750
because the simple spatial juxtaposition does
not do everything, far from it.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,550
I will take the example of the wind power
cluster in the Basque Country.

68
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,930
This cluster has a hundred firms
specialized in different stages of development,

69
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,120
design and manufacture of wind turbines.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,339
But in front of the competition with new actors,
including Chinese actors, few are doing well.

71
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:31,939
And most of the cluster companies are in danger
due to not engaging in exploration of new

72
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,349
technological opportunities activities.

73
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:39,849
Hence the need for a smart
specialization strategy or policy

74
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,240
which puts in place a process
aiming to identify priority areas

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,199
which will be realized through concrete coordination
projects

76
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,589
for the development
of new transformative activities.

77
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,650
This is precisely the case
of smart specialization strategy of the Basque

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,069
Country
whose one of the components is the energy

79
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,469
as a general priority,
which brings together several research and

80
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,569
innovation projects
in the field of wind power cluster.

81
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:08,370
Offshore, turbines and technology of production.

82
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,569
The spontaneous sequence, the entrepreneurial
discovery

83
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:16,610
the new specialty, the structural change,
is a big classic of the history of innovations.

84
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,749
But it is probably more difficult today than
yesterday

85
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:24,069
and therefore, the spontaneous dynamic
of entrepreneurial discovery, of structural

86
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:26,259
change
are probably rare.

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,630
Most often, we must do much more.

88
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:33,659
We must put in place a process
to identify strategic areas for the future

89
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,830
and to stimulate projects in these areas
and activities that will allow, ultimately,

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,150
to obtain a change in structure.

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,399
Hence, the importance today of policies
that run and coordinate the entrepreneurial

92
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,409
discovery process
to identify the strategic areas

93
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,970
and generate new transformative activities
which the region needs.

94
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,259
To make sure also, and we will come back to
it,

95
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:02,469
that the maximum information about these areas
and their potentiality are diffused.
