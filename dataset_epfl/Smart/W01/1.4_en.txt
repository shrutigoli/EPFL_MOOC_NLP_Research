Quickly to conclude this long introduction, we want to review the main message of smart specialization strategy already mentioned.
Identify a few strategic areas to build capacities which will lead to structural change.
Thus, smart specialization strategy has two facets.
First, lead the structural change, that is to say the transformation of structures of economy in a positive direction.
Diversification, modernization or establishment of a new industry.
We have seen the different types of structural changes which may seem desirable to preserve or increase the vigor and dynamism of a regional economy.
Diversification, as the passage from the manufacture of molds for glass, to molds for plastic in the case of Marinha
Grande.
Modernisation, as the example of the sector of â€‹â€‹pulp thanks to nanotechnology in Finland.
Transition, as the example of the silk industry moving to technical fabrics in Lyon.
Finally, the radical foundation as the creation of a medical technology sector in the regions of Basel and Jura.
And the other face of the strategy, is the building of new local capacities to lead to these structural changes.
We identify a desirable structural change based on the entrepreneurial discovery process and we will build capacities in the strategic area concerned, open and explore this new area and if successful, move to a larger scale of activities or new specialties.
Of course, one can always import factors of structural change.
For example, it can modernize its tourism sector by buying the services of a large consulting company that can provide a complete service.
This is a sectoral policy which may have its relevancy, but this is not a smart specialization strategy.
Smart specialization strategy implies that part of the necessary capacities for structural transformation be located in the territory considered.
It is upon the policy to decide, where, in what areas, to what sector it would be important to set up a smart specialization strategy and where can we settle for a â€œsimpleâ€� sectoral policy.
This depends on the potential and opportunities, productivity, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity.
In some cases, perhaps it is better to outsource structural change because we do not see too much in the system who could take charge.
In other cases, it's worth to bet on local capacities to lead structural change.
The methodologies presented during the third week will help us to make such decision.
Take the example of tourism.
Many regions dream of placing tourism in their strategy.
But there is often a confusion between the fact that, we must modernize the sector, diversify it, find new services, and that this can be done through potentials, capacities, transformative activities developed locally.
In some cases, indeed there are potentials and opportunities for the development of smart specialization linked to the tourism sector.
A few months ago, I visited
Heraklion in Crete, where there is a first order research institute called FORTH.
This institute develops world-class research in information technology and biotechnology.
And the integration of tourism in the smart specialization of Crete is possible on this basis.
There is a range of opportunities of application of information technology in the management of knowledge for the archaeological heritage or of application of biotechnology to tourism.
A striking example, is the project design and demonstration of an artificial oasis to promote diving activities.
The exploration of this area mobilizes the
Department of Biotechnology and marine resources of FORTH, specialized services and actors of scuba diving.
This suggests that the potential and opportunities present locally justify the development project of this transformative activity.
Another example, the Centre-Val de Loire region and its famous castles -
Blois, Chambord, Chenonceau and many others.
Why the integration in the strategy of an activity linked to tourism would be relevant here?
There is in this region a large number of companies, some large, specialized in the restoration of monuments.
There is therefore an industrial dynamics and a capacity of innovation at least potentials,
Within the sector of tourism and cultural heritage.
And one can well imagine a transformative activity to modernize the sector, thanks to new technologies
(laser, optical fibre, IT).
This in direct connection with the local market; that of restoration of castles and other monuments and also historical research, which is brilliant.
But in many cases, the tourism sector may be economically significant, but the capacities for innovation and entrepreneurial activity are very low.
And therefore, there is no real prospect of smart specialization because if structural change there must be, this can only come from the outside.
The effort of constructing innovation and entrepreneurial capacities would be too great, probably unrealistic and economically irrelevant.
So we find this problem of being able to give up, even if the sector is important in the region, based on the analysis of existing capacities and entrepreneurial activity.
The entrepreneurial discovery process is the key mechanism that permits to decide what is worth to undertake in terms of capacity building in strategic areas and what it might be reasonable not to do; always with the possibility of coming back to the initial choices, the first priority and the first renounciation, as we will see later when we will deepen the principle of flexibility.
