00:00:03,914 --> 00:00:08,595
Hello everyone and welcome to
this introductory lecture of our MOOC

2
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,630
on "Designing a Smart Specialization Strategy".

3
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:16,277
My Name is Larissa and I’m a Project Manager
at BAK Economics.

4
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:20,997
I am also one of the two teaching assistants
of this MOOC.

5
00:00:20,997 --> 00:00:23,877
We are very excited to offer this online course

6
00:00:23,877 --> 00:00:27,322
since we believe that this approach 
has great potential

7
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:32,171
to assist you in structuring your
policy and development programs.

8
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:36,458
This course will equip you with the most
fundamental methods

9
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:41,743
and techniques to design a Smart Specialization
Strategy for your region.

10
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:47,863
This video will give you a general overview
on how the course is organized.

11
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:53,726
Also will I clarify what you can expect and
what we expect from you.

12
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:58,279
This MOOC is led by Professor Dominique Foray
and Martin Eichler.

13
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:03,089
Both are experts in the field of Smart Specialization
Strategies.

14
00:01:03,248 --> 00:01:05,587
Dominique co-authored the concept

15
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:10,961
during his time in the “Knowledge of growth”
expert group in the European Commission.

16
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,570
Martin is the chief economist of BAK Economics

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,020
and has been engaged in regional benchmarking
for many years.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,031
The two teaching assistants are Camille and I.

19
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:26,271
If you have questions or suggestions
regarding the course,

20
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:30,806
please don’t hesitate to write one of us an email.

21
00:01:30,806 --> 00:01:34,291
Let’s have a quick look at the general objectives
of this course.

22
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:39,251
During the course, we will approach the Smart
Specialization concept systematically.

23
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:43,497
We will explain how to apply it in specific terms.

24
00:01:43,497 --> 00:01:49,477
We will also identify the different stages
of the design of Smart Specialization Strategies.

25
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:53,239
In addition, we will present analytical tools,

26
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,513
methods and data that permit the development
of the knowledge base

27
00:01:57,513 --> 00:02:01,393
essential for the implementation of this strategy.

28
00:02:01,984 --> 00:02:04,800
This is the basic structure of our MOOC.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,675
The different learning tools and activities
are very carefully chosen

30
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,982
as they are crucial to the learning success.

31
00:02:11,982 --> 00:02:14,462
Additionally to the lecture videos,

32
00:02:14,466 --> 00:02:17,146
for each module we have a storyboard

33
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:20,298
and we recommend some extra reading.

34
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,543
As we consider you experts in the field
of Smart Specialization,

35
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:27,983
we would like you to be as interactive
as possible

36
00:02:27,983 --> 00:02:30,252
during the next twelve weeks.

37
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:33,242
Therefore, we offer different learning activities

38
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,991
in which you can express yourself.

39
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,286
We prepared a storyboard for each module.

40
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:42,448
It not only describes what will happen during
the module

41
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:47,947
but also sums up the most important
learning objectives of the respective module.

42
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:51,127
It also includes the bibliography of the module

43
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,294
as well as the topic of the module assignments.

44
00:02:54,294 --> 00:02:58,754
Now, let’s have a look at the learning activities
proposed in our course.

45
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,697
As I already mentioned before,

46
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:04,065
we consider you experts in the field of
Smart Specialization

47
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:06,771
or regional economic development in general.

48
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:10,500
We do not only want to teach the concept of
Smart Specialization,

49
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,670
but would like to give you the opportunity
to share your experience

50
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:17,275
in order to learn from each other.

51
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:21,534
See your expertise as part of our teaching
material.

52
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,716
We therefore offer several channels

53
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:27,806
to make our online course as interactive
as possible.

54
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:33,311
In order to test yourself with respect to
the acquired knowledge after every module,

55
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:37,703
you will solve a quiz in form of multiple
choice questions.

56
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:43,346
We would like you to think outside of the
box and reflect on what you’ve learnt.

57
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,310
For this reason, we will have special forums

58
00:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,969
where we start an interactive discussion

59
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:53,039
on a specific topic related to the content
of the module.

60
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,778
Note that there will always be a general forum
to each module

61
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:02,253
where you can ask questions or
share your thoughts and suggestions.

62
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:07,180
Furthermore, we will have a graded assignment
reviewed by your peers

63
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,190
at the end of every module.

64
00:04:10,211 --> 00:04:14,811
To give you a detailed idea of what you can
expect from the next twelve weeks,

65
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:17,267
we have prepared an agenda.

66
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:21,418
You have two weeks available to complete a
module.

67
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:25,963
We recommend to watch the lecture videos
during the first week

68
00:04:25,984 --> 00:04:29,543
and to do the module assignment in the second week.

69
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,532
The quizzes and forums are optional,

70
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:37,972
but of course quite a good help to apply
the knowledge from the lectures.

71
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,880
At the end of the second week of each module,

72
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,930
you have to hand in your module assignment

73
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,838
and during the next week

74
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,524
– which is the first week of the next module –

75
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:54,104
you have to evaluate the assignment
from one of your peers.

76
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:58,877
Each module assignment has a maximum
of 9 points.

77
00:04:58,877 --> 00:05:02,257
After module 5, you have three weeks to do

78
00:05:02,257 --> 00:05:07,977
and hand in the final assignment which has
a maximum of 64 points.

79
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:14,158
To successfully complete the course, you have
to get at least 80 of the 100 possible points.

80
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,448
Our goal is not only to teach the concept
of Smart Specialization Strategies

81
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:21,423
and its implications.

82
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:25,078
Our course is unique thanks to
the general validity

83
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:30,098
which means that the communicated knowhow
is adaptable to any kind of region

84
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:34,042
in combination with the academic atmosphere.

85
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:39,527
In this course, we want to deepen the knowledge
by applying it in the assignments,

86
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:46,560
by swapping ideas and by learning more about
the experience of every single one of you.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,270
And therefore, we are very much looking forward
to the following twelve weeks

88
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,966
and hope that you will enjoy it as
much as we do

89
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:57,749
and did during the production of this course.

90
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:01,888
Thank you for your attention and see you soon!
