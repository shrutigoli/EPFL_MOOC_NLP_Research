1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,880
Hello everybody let's have a
look on a couple of details

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,070
of the process in a
little deeper closer way.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,100
It starts with this
overall picture again, the first

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,650
thing I will look at more
detail as promised already is

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,600
the base of evidence.

6
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,090
And I have already pointed
out in the last video, the

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,860
base of evidence actually
is a big box of different

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,320
analytical tools and steps
to be done and let's have a

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,330
closer look what belongs to
it, I already pointed out in

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,650
the last video a few
differences or different aspects of

11
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,710
the analysis there and actually
we can follow up that further.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,610
The first part, what should
be done in a base of evidence

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,830
is a kind of an
outward-looking view, a view looking from

14
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,630
the region to the outside
to the rest of the world and

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,180
particularly how the
region is positioned within this

16
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,080
global and competitive world.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,390
It is a very statistic
analysis, there's a lot of data

18
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,050
available, we come back to
the data in a later session

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,390
and so we can base a lot of
analytics and a lot of data in that part.

20
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:23,840
From the topics to be
covered in that analysis, we can

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,580
sort it in five topics here,
it could be some more, some

22
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,870
less if you want but we
have to experience that these

23
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,110
files are pretty much what is needed.

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,530
It is first a performance,
you need to know what the

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,290
region already achieves,
we'll use it as a starting

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,790
position (the values) of
the region, the productivity,

27
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,930
how strongly it grew
lately and things like that.

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,820
Secondly, the industrial
focus of course is very

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,020
important for this smart
specialisation strategy in

30
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,950
knowing which areas, you have to
know which areas the region is good.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,250
Then in a world with more
and more competition, it's

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,070
getting more globalised all
the time, competitiveness of

33
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,310
the region as a whole but
also with the key industries in

34
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,230
that region is an
important element in that

35
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,660
analysis. But it's not only
about the industries, which

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,180
you need to look at, you
also have to look at location

37
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,710
factors, the conditions the
economy faces within the regions.

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:30,880
They have topics like
taxation, regulation, or

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,860
accessibility of the
regions but they also (start) the

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,450
topics like quality
of life or cultural

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,530
(availabilities) which need
to be considered here and, of

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,230
course, also natural
resources, might it be in real

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,920
resources, coal and
steel, might it be in

44
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,810
infrastructure or in
connectivity assets like the

45
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,870
possibility for a harbour
city or might it be in natural

46
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,840
resources in the sense
that it's very good for

47
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,730
recreational issues,
mountains, a lake or things like that.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,390
And, of course, smart
specialisation is about innovation,

49
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,130
new things,
entrepreneurial activities.

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,780
So the innovation
capacities, in the region, all those

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,950
parts of the analysis, we
will come back to that in more

52
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,440
detail, remember this is for
international comparison of

53
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,150
the region, where the region
stands but it's also part of

54
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,180
that analysis. Now we
call that often international

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,450
benchmarking, this part
of the analysis because

56
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,130
benchmarking is the method
you should apply here or one

57
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,660
of the methods, the most
important method to be applied

58
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,450
here, benchmark the region with
other regions, compare it with them.

59
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,060
And it certainly should
be international today.

60
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,710
Competition is actually
global and the competition

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,470
between regions is not
between two or three neighbouring

62
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,230
regions, although there are
some competition as well but

63
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:03,940
to really know your
competitive position in the world,

64
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,040
you have to look internationally.

65
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,800
If you want to characterise
that part of the analysis, we

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,750
often put it as it is a kind
of a helicopter view of the

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,430
region, it gives you the
broad overall picture in the

68
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,790
region, it also shows you
the surrounding, the setting

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,610
the region is in and it is
a bit of a neutral overall

70
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,190
look on the region.

71
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,850
In the next step, that will
be a little bit different.

72
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,020
The next step still draws on
data and on statistics a lot

73
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,890
but it focuses much
more on the region itself.

74
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,740
It goes much more into
detail of the region and one reads

75
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,130
that is a separate step
is that often data which is

76
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,770
available for international
comparison is not as detailed

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,250
as the data which is
available if you only look

78
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:57,750
particularly at your own
region and we (inaudible) of

79
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,170
course make use of
these available information.

80
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,860
The topics you are keeping
yourself busy with is that

81
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,870
part of analysis are
actually not that much different

82
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,580
from the part of the
international analysis but instead

83
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,960
of getting a broad over
view, here you really go into the

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,510
details and try to understand in
detail what is behind these figures.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,440
Again industrial structures
is an important issue here,

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,250
look at the details of
the industries, you might

87
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,390
internationally
recognise you have a very strong

88
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,820
pharmaceutical industry
but when you look into the

89
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,650
details you probably can
find out, is it headquarter or

90
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,910
is it research or maybe it's
the production side of this

91
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,010
industry which is important
for you, which of course the

92
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,340
end of (discretion) has
very different implications for

93
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,300
the strategy building.

94
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,730
Clusters are an important
part of regional economic

95
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,910
development by now, it is
very well established that

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,860
clusters can add quite a
bit to regional values.

97
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,000
Therefore they are also
the starting point for new

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,170
specialisations not the
clusters themselves but they

99
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,880
might provide input so part
of the individual analysis of

100
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,120
the region is also an
analysis of available clusters.

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,840
And clusters is not only
concentration, concentration is

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,200
something you already look
at industrial details but a

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,580
cluster is defined as a
concentration combined with

104
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,900
activities of working
together with an organisation and

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,940
network or another kind of a
 structure and these can, of

106
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,150
course, build a starting point.

107
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,950
And again the regional
innovation system is important and

108
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,190
particularly not the system
only by itself, the number of

109
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,530
universities and so on
but also if it fits well,

110
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,710
(inaudible) structures do
the focus of the innovation

111
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,040
system, the good faculties
of the university, for example

112
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,150
or the independent
research companies, do they fit

113
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,220
together with the
industrial structure or not and

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,590
actually if tree answer is
not, it might be part of this

115
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,770
smart specialisation
strategy to achieve a better fit

116
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,250
here, to find new
connections between the innovation

117
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,400
system and the economic structure.

118
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,500
As we've said, we know already a lot
about the region but not everything.

119
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,160
There are things which are
not visible in statistics and

120
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,790
that is why also a
contextual analysis should be part of

121
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,230
the base of evidence analysis.

122
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,290
Here we look beyond
statistics to test the knowledge of

123
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,170
the region and particularly
one area which we often have

124
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,960
to look on is the
political environment the region is

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,110
living in, the governance
of the region itself, of

126
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,490
course, what are the region
strategies, has it policies

127
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,120
which might influence their
economic strategy but also

128
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:50,630
the broader economic
environment like national framework

129
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,740
conditions what it
can be used for that.

130
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,140
That is something you don't
find in statistics but, of

131
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,480
course, it's very
important to understand the region.

132
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,100
The next step is something
we already discussed but it is

133
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,330
at that moment in the analysis,
it has to move into the picture.

134
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,600
It is the global
mega-trends in the general purpose

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,080
technology and the
questions how do they influence the

136
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:20,120
regional assets which we already
analysed in the first three steps here.

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,180
What is really the
impact of these trends and the

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,020
possibilities of these
technologies for the regional

139
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,370
economies or the
assets and structures.

140
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,250
So it's kind of, after doing
the analysis once, you look

141
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,940
at the global mega
trends and the general purpose

142
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,940
technology and find out where in
the region do they influence that.

143
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,560
From all these
analytical steps, we get a lot of

144
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,250
information altogether
and they have to bring that

145
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,580
together now to find out
the… to condense that to an

146
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:59,610
overall picture and that is
actually what a swot analysis

147
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,750
does, the strengths and
weaknesses, the chances and the

148
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,680
threats for the region
that is the real output of all

149
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,000
this kind of analysis
and brings it all together.

150
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:14,920
All this builds the base of
evidence and you've probably

151
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,230
noticed that it is very
similar to other strategies, it

152
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,810
is not really particular to
smart specialisation strategy

153
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,740
but if you do a detailed
economic strategy for a region,

154
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,850
you will do exactly
these steps to build it.

155
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,280
What is really new about
smart specialisation is what

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,100
comes after building a base
of evidence but without that

157
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,930
base probably you won't be
successful in smart specialisation strategy.
