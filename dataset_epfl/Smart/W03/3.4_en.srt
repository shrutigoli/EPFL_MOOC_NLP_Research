1
00:00:04,827 --> 00:00:07,040
Welcome everybody. 

2
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:10,234
In the last module, 
we had a detailed look

3
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:13,121
at the so called Base of Evidence,

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,495
the first pillar 
of the information foundation

5
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:19,509
for a smart specialization strategy.

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:21,564
But there is a second pillar 
and that

7
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,458
 are entrepreneurial resources
available in the region. 

8
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:30,397
The idea of smart specialization
is not 

9
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:34,188
that entrepreneurial activities 
or innovation 

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,886
has to be generated from scratch
started from a new, from nothing

11
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:42,195
but to build on what
if already existing. 

12
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:45,121
It is a smart strategy. 

13
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,228
It builds on what we have. 

14
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:51,305
But to do that, we of course need 
to know what kind 

15
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:54,377
of entrepreneurial resources 
are available

16
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:57,563
and to gather this information, 
is everything else, 

17
00:00:57,775 --> 00:00:59,175
than straight forward. 

18
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:05,202
Nearly by definition the information
 on entrepreneurial resources

19
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:09,095
is scattered and only unstructured. 

20
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:12,616
So, that makes it so difficult
to gather it. 

21
00:01:12,837 --> 00:01:16,125
But let's have a look 
how we can proceed. 

22
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:21,580
The process will be interactive 
and exploratory. 

23
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,254
It is an unstructured set
of information

24
00:01:24,463 --> 00:01:26,514
and therefore we need 
to adopt our process

25
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:29,162
to the kind of information
which we find. 

26
00:01:29,354 --> 00:01:32,418
Also it will be usually 
qualitative information,

27
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:36,231
not quantitative ones, 
which we need in that part

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,029
of the process. 

29
00:01:38,237 --> 00:01:41,662
Therefore, it will be also
region specific. 

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,958
But it's also because regions 
differ a lot between each other. 

31
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:50,068
There might be 
different institution settings

32
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:54,192
and different institutions involved 
in entrepreneurial activities

33
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:55,772
in the region.

34
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:58,219
There might be also 
cultural differences in how 

35
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,656
the attitudes towards 
entrepreneurship

36
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:04,316
and who is behaving 
entrepreneurial.

37
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:07,630
So, we need to adopt 
to be regional conditions,

38
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,791
that part of the analysis.  

39
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:16,309
But in any case, it will involve
many different kind of people.

40
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:19,367
There will be 
entrepreneurs themselves

41
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,160
there can be innovative firms, 
there are researchers 

42
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,136
at universities 
and other institutions

43
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:29,887
or other inventors or innovators. 

44
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,410
To name just a few, 
there might be more, 

45
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,628
there might be government agencies, 

46
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:40,221
there might be investors involved
in that process, or as a people.

47
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:44,799
So if need to gather as much
qualitative information as possible,

48
00:02:44,988 --> 00:02:48,488
all these stakeholders should be 
involved in the process

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,070
and the task of the, 
of you, 

50
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,253
in designing a smart specific 
and strategy, 

51
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:00,462
is more that of coordination 
and gathering the information,

52
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:04,823
than of really doing the analysis
yourself. 

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,388
Most of the information will be 
of that more qualitative nature

54
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,013
and come from people, 
but of coarse, 

55
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:15,486
data analysis can support you 
in that process,

56
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:19,021
particularly to identify  
the institutions, 

57
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,976
the areas to look at,
the people to talk to, 

58
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,266
the statistical analyzers might be 
the helpful part of that process. 

59
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,409
Let's have a bit a look
what kind of data 

60
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:35,542
might be available 
to give us such hints. 

61
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,805
During our analyze
of the base of evidence, 

62
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:42,602
we already touched some 
of this data and here is one example

63
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,262
which you already know here
from our discussion

64
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:49,068
of the Base of Evidence, 
the patent network a region has.

65
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,831
Of course any connection
we see here

66
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,121
in the patent network of the region
might also be a hint

67
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,882
 to resources available 
to the region 

68
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,587
and we can follow up that
in more detail. 

69
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:03,632
And of course, resources available
to the region 

70
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,910
are primarily within the region
but such a network connection

71
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:10,493
to other regions, 
to other institutions,

72
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:13,007
can also be a resource available 

73
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,566
to the regions 
in a smart specialization process

74
00:04:16,774 --> 00:04:20,137
So, while doing the base of evidence
analysis, you already gather

75
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:23,662
a lot of information 
which you then can use also

76
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:26,121
for the entrepreneurial resources. 

77
00:04:26,326 --> 00:04:28,614
But we can go into more detail. 

78
00:04:28,828 --> 00:04:32,152
One example or one good source
for information

79
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,331
are publication statistics 
of course. 

80
00:04:35,544 --> 00:04:39,531
Particular in the research field,
not the applied innovations 

81
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:44,134
but more of the research part, 
publications are an important output

82
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,780
of activities and therefore, 
they reflect

83
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,344
the activities available 
in the region. 

84
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:54,281
What we see here in this example, 
is the fields where publications 

85
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:57,284
are done, and we see 
for in this case, 

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,667
it's Ticino again, that nearly 
a quarter of all publi... 

87
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:03,686
no, actually more than a quarter 
of all publications

88
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:07,134
is in Medicine, 
and the second quarter

89
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:11,733
is in two more fields, 
Computer Science and Biochemistry. 

90
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:15,983
So these are fields where there 
are a lot of publications available

91
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,890
in the region, and probably 
a lot of access points

92
00:05:20,098 --> 00:05:23,410
for innovation 
and entrepreneurial activities.

93
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,812
Of course, the culture 
of publication in different fields 

94
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,292
might be different, the high number
of medicine publications 

95
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:34,890
might be, over estimate 
the importance of the field

96
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:38,891
because in medicine you usually 
publish a lot, but still,

97
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,433
it is a resource available 
and by comparison 

98
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:47,224
this general publications numbers, 
you can even filter for such things.

99
00:05:47,423 --> 00:05:51,048
But it gives a hint, for Ticino, 
where to look at 

100
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:53,856
for specialization possibilities. 

101
00:05:54,055 --> 00:05:57,430
Of course you can also look at 
publications in another dimension. 

102
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,501
You can look at the institutions
the publications come from,

103
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:03,376
which university, 
which research institutions,

104
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:06,989
or maybe other bodies 
do publish a lot 

105
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:10,385
and are therefore worth
to do have a closer look at

106
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:13,569
the entrepreneurial resources 
which they might provide

107
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,713
to the region and to 
the smart specialization strategy. 

108
00:06:17,935 --> 00:06:22,922
Here we have another example
of possible information to be used.

109
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:26,419
It fits and entails a actually 
Federal Program

110
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:29,153
supporting the cooperation
between universities

111
00:06:29,332 --> 00:06:31,032
and other research institutions, 

112
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:36,212
and small and medium sized 
enterprises called CTI funds.

113
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:40,306
These projects nearly by definition
are entrepreneurial 

114
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,436
in their spirit and therefore 
might be good starting point

115
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:46,943
to be included
in a smart specialization strategy. 

116
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,449
And we see from the statistics 
in here 

117
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,254
that there are 8 to 12 projects 
in every year 

118
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:56,372
in that program 
within the Canton of Ticino

119
00:06:56,587 --> 00:07:00,861
and this is 8 to 12 chances to start
smart specialization 

120
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:05,616
and to have entrepreneurial resource
for a smart specialization strategy.

121
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:09,008
So it might be worth following 
that up in more detail

122
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:12,578
and look and deliver the projects
and insist unions

123
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:15,346
involved in these projects. 

124
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,149
Coming back to the patents again
because this

125
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,313
is a very rich data source 
for our innovation

126
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:24,798
and entrepreneurial activities,
we want to have a look, 

127
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,507
a bit more detailed 
what could be done here. 

128
00:07:27,683 --> 00:07:30,871
Of course, instead of just looking
at the number of patents, 

129
00:07:31,103 --> 00:07:36,541
we can also look at who is involved
in patent activities 

130
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,999
within the regions, 
and again we have here an example

131
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:43,689
for Ticino and see that there are 
a number of companies

132
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,450
very active in patenting 
their innovations

133
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:50,208
and all these might be possible 
starting points

134
00:07:50,405 --> 00:07:52,717
 for smart specialization again. 

135
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:56,538
But we can have a more detailed look
at patents actually.

136
00:07:56,748 --> 00:08:00,048
Patent databases provide 
a lot of information

137
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,447
on the contents of the patents 
and which fields

138
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,615
the patent belong to, 
and this information can be used.

139
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:14,060
In an exercise we have done, 
we defined 40 future technologies

140
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:18,404
or cutting edge technologies
which will shape the future world

141
00:08:18,609 --> 00:08:21,446
from what we can 
from our today's perspective.

142
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,684
Of course, there might be 
different developments in the future

143
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,645
but, these are technologies 
with the potential 

144
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:29,918
to shape the future. 

145
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,265
It is like internet of things, 
drones, biomedical research, 

146
00:08:36,471 --> 00:08:39,634
and similar technologies.

147
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:43,764
We now can draw pattern profiles
relating to these

148
00:08:43,955 --> 00:08:47,805
forty future cutting edge 
technologies, 

149
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,844
and in this example 
we see it, for one region,

150
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:54,972
what is their technological profile
for number of selected

151
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:58,597
of these new 
cutting edge technologies. 

152
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:03,032
And we see that the region
is particularly well positioned

153
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:06,793
in the area of medical technology
and pharmaceuticals. 

154
00:09:06,989 --> 00:09:09,664
This has the highest number 
of patents. 

155
00:09:09,866 --> 00:09:13,004
Of course, this is also on areas 
which are already

156
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,255
for quite some time active 
though it's not surprising 

157
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,354
that the number of patents 
is higher here, 

158
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:21,679
patent which is very well positioned
in them. 

159
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:24,911
Apart from looking 
at the technologies 

160
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,431
so that patent fields are in, 
we can also look 

161
00:09:28,616 --> 00:09:32,103
at the quality of the patents, 
there are...

162
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:35,225
there is a high tendency 
to a lot of patents 

163
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,673
in the world right now 
to secure the elected property, 

164
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,698
but there are possibilities 
to assess the values 

165
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:44,799
of a certain patent, 
and it is done 

166
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,252
in the right part of this graphic.

167
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:52,546
It shows the share of patterns 
in the technological field

168
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:57,875
which is among top 10 % 
of worldwide patents. 

169
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:01,159
The top 10% quality. 

170
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:04,315
And we see that 
for the medical technology, 

171
00:10:04,517 --> 00:10:10,592
it is 36 % or 37 % nearly
in the top quality of the patent.

172
00:10:10,783 --> 00:10:12,970
So that's quite a good number 
if you recall 

173
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,968
that only 10 % and of all patents 
in that field in the world

174
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:19,318
are defined as top quality.

175
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,881
But the regions even doing better 
in pharmaceuticals, 

176
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:26,344
it's nearly half of their patents 
which is of this kind 

177
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,030
of a top quality. 

178
00:10:29,224 --> 00:10:31,423
And we can also see if we look
at another thing,

179
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:36,080
the Internet of Things, 
here, shortcut-ed we see IoT 

180
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:38,949
The Internet of Things 
is a very new development

181
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,052
so it's not surprising 
that the number of patents

182
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:45,579
is not so high, but regions again, 
nearly 50 % of all patents 

183
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:51,415
are in the top area of the top 10 %
patents in the world. 

184
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:56,530
The region has a very high quality
of their research in that field 

185
00:10:56,729 --> 00:11:01,242
and though, therefore again probably
that's a good starting point

186
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:04,506
for any smart specialization 
strategy.

187
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,447
We can even go a step further 
after identifying the technologies

188
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,625
and where regions are strong in,
we can look at the institution

189
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:19,377
and companies behind that, patents, 
and analyze them in more detail. 

190
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:22,412
That can be done
in a regional perspective

191
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,189
but in the next example,
that will be done 

192
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,128
in a company perspective

193
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,400
The example is for the company 
of Siemens, 

194
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:34,187
huge, world wide player 
and we analyze 

195
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:37,298
their technological portfolio here.

196
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:39,377
The size of the bubble
in the graphic 

197
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,870
shows the number of patents 
in a certain areas.

198
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:45,700
So it's not surprising 
if you know Siemens a little bit,

199
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:50,074
that energy generation 
is the most important patent field

200
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:51,978
they're active in. 

201
00:11:52,165 --> 00:11:54,540
But again, they're also 
in a number of other

202
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,514
of these cutting edge technologies, 
very active,

203
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,567
particularly then there's 
digital processes

204
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,787
and internet of things
are quite important.

205
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,208
So, if a new region Siemens is 
and company of a certain importance,

206
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,496
you might have access 
to all these technologies 

207
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:18,790
for your smart specializations 
strategies via this company.

208
00:12:18,983 --> 00:12:21,170
We can also again 
have a more detailed look

209
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:24,062
how important these patents are 
and that is actually 

210
00:12:24,238 --> 00:12:27,525
what is provided by the two axis 
in that graph.

211
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,580
Under horizontal axis we see, 
how often is this field used again

212
00:12:32,798 --> 00:12:36,623
in other companies activities 
in activities of Siemens

213
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:39,415
and we see a huge difference 
for example, 

214
00:12:39,605 --> 00:12:42,092
the internet of things is not 
that much used

215
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:45,390
in other parts of the company
while robotics for example, 

216
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:48,975
or material designs is used a lot
in other fields as well. 

217
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:52,155
But internet of things 
is one of the more important areas

218
00:12:52,353 --> 00:12:54,765
Siemens is active in,
where other companies, 

219
00:12:54,978 --> 00:12:57,940
Siemens might cooperate this
or licensing out  

220
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:03,146
it's patents them here these use
these kinds of technologies a lot.

221
00:13:03,338 --> 00:13:05,938
So we see that there's already
kind of a network 

222
00:13:06,115 --> 00:13:08,878
for the internet of things 
activities of Siemens there 

223
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:10,912
when other companies 
used it heavily. 

224
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,455
That is what's given under
vertical axis

225
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:16,492
and might be a useful information
to define 

226
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
your smart specialization strategy
if internet of things 

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,343
might be part of it. 

228
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,398
All these are of course 
only examples.

229
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:31,708
As I said before, there must be 
a region specific analysis 

230
00:13:31,905 --> 00:13:36,692
and there might be quite different
depending on your demands, 

231
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:40,150
but this kind of statistics 
can help you to get 

232
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:42,199
into the right directions. 

233
00:13:43,102 --> 00:13:47,489
Now, summing up briefly 
what we have seen. 

234
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:53,626
We know entrepreneurial resources
as in, essential informational input

235
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,557
into the smart specialization 
strategy.

236
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:59,912
We don't want to generate
all entrepreneurial activities 

237
00:14:00,102 --> 00:14:02,539
from the scratch or...

238
00:14:02,745 --> 00:14:05,545
get new innovation projects 
from the scratch

239
00:14:05,726 --> 00:14:09,026
but we rely on
what is already there. 

240
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,950
But it is very difficult 
to analyze it.

241
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,827
There is no clear statistics 
we can look at.

242
00:14:16,046 --> 00:14:17,734
We have to do it contextual,

243
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,808
we have rely on qualitative
information.  

244
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:26,787
Therefore, of course we have to use
various sources, 

245
00:14:26,987 --> 00:14:30,637
access various sources 
of entrepreneurial resources

246
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:35,121
where data and statistics analyzers
might be one, part of, 

247
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:38,391
but certainly not the most 
important one.

248
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:42,820
The most one is people active 
in your region 

249
00:14:43,022 --> 00:14:46,735
in both in entrepreneurial activities,
in both in innovation 

250
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:50,480
and get them into the process, 
gather the information found 

251
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:53,154
and at the same time probably
involve them 

252
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,950
into this strategy building.

253
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:00,214
Last not least, 
there might be one way 

254
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,652
to gather this information 
which we haven't mentioned yet.

255
00:15:03,851 --> 00:15:08,901
But if you recall our discussion
of a top-down or bottom-up approach,

256
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:13,062
you find priority area first, 
and then ask in a call

257
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:15,824
for proposals 
for entrepreneurial activities

258
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:21,453
in that field or to do it bottom-up,
we find the information 

259
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:24,518
of entrepreneurial activities
and possible priorities 

260
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,481
and then combine them.

261
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,042
The first one might actually 
be the one

262
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,727
 how to gather the information,
or call for the proposals 

263
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,458
is also a tool 
for information gathering.

264
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:40,458
Though, it is a difficult task
but there are many opportunities 

265
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:44,545
to get to it, and it is essential 
that we are smart and build

266
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:47,994
our smart specialization strategy
on existing resources 

267
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:51,521
and not starting everything 
from scratch. 

268
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,782
Thank you very much.
