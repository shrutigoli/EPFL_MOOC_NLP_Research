1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,910
Welcome back everybody to our course
on smart specialisation strategies.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,090
Now in week three we'll have
a more detailed look at how

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,920
really develop such a strategy.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,600
With a bit of theoretical
foundation and the properties

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,060
of that concept in the first
two weeks, we now really get

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,060
to the work, to
build such a strategy.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,320
To do so let's first look at
a few properties which need

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,140
to be reflected in this process.

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,510
As the name of three S
already says, such strategy is

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,380
smart and special. It's
smart in the sense that it

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,350
provides intelligent
combinations and individual

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,840
solutions for the region.

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,420
And it is special in that
sense that from this process

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,100
there should resolve new
specialities for the regional economy.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,370
While it builds on
existing assets, new specialities

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,140
should be generated.

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,710
Given these properties, it
is probably not surprising

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,170
that there is no one size fits all.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,400
There's no blueprint for a
smart specialisation strategy

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,680
which fits each and every region.

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,670
Instead, the strategy
itself, the contents of the

22
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,320
strategy, of course, have
to be individually adapted to

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,510
the region, but not only
the contents, but also the

24
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,570
process leading to this
strategy, the analytical

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,910
foundations of that
strategy must be adapted already to

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,740
the region itself and
its properties and assets.

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,600
But, of course, this is
not the end of that session.

28
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,450
There are a number of
tools, of materials and also a

29
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,240
stylised process
available that you can follow when

30
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,750
developing such a strategy.
Always keep in mind that's

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,940
not fixed, but needs to be
individually adapted but you

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,200
can take out the elements
out of these tool boxes to

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,370
build your
individual analytical process.

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,440
It's a little bit like if you imagine
you want to build some new furniture.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,040
I can give you a blueprint
for a wooden table one by two

36
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,820
and a half metres but
probably it won't help any because

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,720
the space you have is much
smaller and actually, you want

38
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,170
to have a glass and not wood.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,590
So what we do here is we
provide you with a process which

40
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,200
you can follow, do the
measurement, get a shopping list,

41
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,150
cut the materials, and so on.

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,140
We also provide the
materials, you can use glass, wood or

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,670
maybe you want to use steel.

44
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,700
And we can provide you with
some tools, a toolbox which

45
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,230
can be used in
building that furniture.

46
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,870
You have to build it
yourself, but you will get a lot of

47
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,690
things you can use in that process.

48
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,530
Now what will we do
throughout that week?

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
The first session is
really devoted to a suggested

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,690
process with elements which
are absolutely necessary for

51
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,260
building a strategy, but
also elements which can be

52
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,900
individually adapted.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,600
In the second session, we
will look at a tool box which

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,920
is available for
particularly analytical part of the

55
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,100
strategy building. In the
third session we look at the

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,520
data which can be used in
such a process and then the

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,590
properties the data must have
which is being used in such a process.

58
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,950
Session four is devoted to
entrepreneurial resources, as

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,710
this is especially
important for smart specialisation,

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,860
and actually the unique
property of that concept.

61
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,450
And finally we'll give an
example how such a dialogue and

62
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,070
interactions section in the
process building could function.

63
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,690
We will have a lot of
examples throughout the week, the

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,600
further we go into
sessions the more we have to work

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,920
examples, because there
is less given structures

66
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,160
available, and we will very
often look at the canton of Ticino.

67
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,620
For one reason it helps
to do the examples with one

68
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,580
canton, it gives you a
better overview how the different

69
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,500
steps interact with each other.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,300
But, of course, there's also
the reason that we know the

71
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,380
canton of Ticino very well,
coming from Switzerland, and

72
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,750
it is necessary in the detailed
process that you know the region.

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,920
And last not least, we
already did such processes as with

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,050
Ticino therefore a lot of
material to build on was available.

75
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Now before going into the
process, what do these other

76
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,760
institutions say about that process?

77
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,270
The EU for example says:
sound analyses of regional

78
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,360
assets and technologies
is part of building a smart

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,370
specialisation
strategy, or the OECD puts it at

80
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,280
identifying and selecting a
limited number of priority

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,320
areas, identify and select
a limited number, focusing

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,450
on their strengths and their
comparative advantages, the

83
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,740
strength and a
comparative advantage of the region.

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,560
What do we get out
of these definitions?

85
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,660
First of all, we need a
structured process to really

86
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,060
achieve the goals
given by these definitions.

87
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,570
Without such a process we
will not have a sound base of

88
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,010
analyse and probably not
identify the strengths and all

89
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,410
comparative advantages.

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,810
And it must be based on
facts, that is very clear from

91
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,750
that definition,
therefore data is needed for the

92
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,000
process, it's absolutely
essential to build on data.

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,830
Now let's go back to
what you already know.

94
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,390
This picture was
already provided in week one.

95
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,910
We will again follow this
picture, but this time with

96
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,160
more focus on: what are
the steps to be done in a

97
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,620
strategy building process?

98
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,730
Of course, we again have to
start with the economic and

99
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,220
industrial structures of a region.

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,820
But before going further,
there is one step which might

101
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,000
be a little bit surprising
in the first sight, but to our

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,720
experience is very
important. And this is the definition

103
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,960
of the region we are
talking about, of the region the

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,720
strategy should be valid for.

105
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,700
Why is this so important?

106
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,610
If different people
involved, and there are many people

107
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,920
involved in the strategy
and in the implementation of

108
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,830
that strategy, if these
people have different ideas about

109
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,630
what region we're talking about,
the strategy in the end won't work.

110
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,810
Therefore, doing this step
explicitly helps a lot in

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,100
building the strategy successfully.

112
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,910
But it's also important
that you create some kind of

113
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,680
commitment, which all
of the steps can help by.

114
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,510
If everybody talks about
the same kind of region, then

115
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,330
they commit themselves
stronger towards this region.

116
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,860
When you do so, you
have to keep in mind that

117
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,350
administrative and
functional orders are not already the

118
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,000
same, or functional region is not the
same as in an administrative region.

119
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,880
The functional region is where
there are heavy economic interactions.

120
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,770
And actually a strategy
should be built for a region, for

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,340
a geographic area which has
heavy economic interactions

122
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,760
with each other. Of course,
the complete world interacts

123
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,470
today with each other, but
interactions are very strong

124
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,960
that should be a region,
a strategy is valid for.

125
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,270
Of course you also have to
follow administrative borders

126
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,530
and the final
definition will be a compromise.

127
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,840
But it is very important,
in the end, that you agree on

128
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,270
one definition and that
everybody involved in the

129
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,300
strategy is clear
about that definition.

130
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,820
And this is why we put that
at the start of the process

131
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,610
of developing a 3S.

132
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,750
A note on the name region.

133
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,940
Here, and in the following,
we often use "region" as a

134
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,910
synonym for the geographical area
the strategy should be valid for.

135
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,020
Of course that can be a
city, can be a city region, a

136
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,370
city area, a metropolitan
area, there are many different

137
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,460
names a smart
specialisation strategy should work for,

138
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,200
and we just use region
for all of them as a name.

139
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,240
It is important that they
work together as a functional

140
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,480
area and their economic
interactions, it doesn't really

141
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,680
matter what it is named.

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,200
Clearly, the next step
is the base of evidence.

143
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,640
Here actually the most
analytical work is necessary.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,420
To be done, there might be a
lot available already, there

145
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,660
might be more work to be
done, but you need to produce a

146
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,000
lot of inputs in that part.

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,300
Actually, different kinds
of views are necessary here,

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,650
you have to look at the
world and the competitive

149
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,290
position of the region and
the regional industries, the

150
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,300
regional economy, but you
also have to look inside the

151
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,380
region, get a detailed view
on the region itself and on

152
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,090
its assets and properties.

153
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,310
As there is a lot of
elements in there, we will look

154
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,000
at that later on again in
some more detail, let's first

155
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,890
go on with the process.

156
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,800
The next input is
something the region can't change,

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,300
which is given from
the regional perspective.

158
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,580
It's the global mega
trends, the trends are

159
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,770
worldwide and driving the
economic conditions of the

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,210
region as well. That
could be things like aging of

161
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:48,000
society, the globalisation
itself is such a mega-trend,

162
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,710
or to digitalisation of
production is also such a mega-trend.

163
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,550
And the second part here is
the general purpose technologies.

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,290
Again something which is
not driven by the region, but

165
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,280
kind of given from the
outside of the region, but must be

166
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,010
part of the analysis. Again,
digitalisation is somewhere in between.

167
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,820
Digitalisation could be
named all the communication

168
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,360
technologies, but also
things like nanotechnology for

169
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,050
example, or new materials
are such general purpose

170
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,000
technology that can be applied
in different parts of the economy.

171
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Of course, you're not just needing a
list of these trends and technologies.

172
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,040
You also need to analyse how
they influence the specific

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,700
characteristics, the
specific assets, the specific

174
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,830
economy within the region,
how important they are for the

175
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,780
region and how exposed is
the region to these changes.

176
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,750
That is actually part of the
analyse in the base of evidence.

177
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,740
Until now these steps,
global mega trends, the

178
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,400
base of evidence with an
outside and inside view is

179
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,300
pretty well known from
other economic strategies as

180
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,930
well, but now we come to
that part which is really

181
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,420
particularly for smart
specialisation strategy.

182
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,680
That's the analysis of
entrepreneurial resources

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,230
available in the region.

184
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,260
In any region there are
entrepreneurial activities, there

185
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,230
might be more or there might
be less, but certainly there

186
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,700
are some activities in this field.

187
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,940
Particularly if you define
that entrepreneurialism in the

188
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,000
broad sense is not just
building start up companies, but

189
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,000
it can be
entrepreneurial activities in existing

190
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,460
companies, it can also
be an earlier stage in the

191
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,820
innovation and invention process.

192
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,630
But there are certainly
activities around, and you should

193
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,690
analyse these activities
so that you get a base of

194
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,640
information, what entrepreneurial
activity you can build the strategy on.

195
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:56,120
All this information in the
end has to be combined and

196
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,870
brought together,
particularly as, usually, many

197
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,670
different people are
involved in these different steps of

198
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,910
the process, they all and
their information needs to be

199
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,370
brought together, therefore
the dialogue and interaction

200
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,680
part of the strategy
building is quite an important

201
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,820
element.

202
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:17,110
And then we go to
what we already know.

203
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,270
Of course we have to define
the strategy itself, we have

204
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,170
to define our priority
areas, the promising areas, then

205
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,700
we have to define
activities in these areas, projects,

206
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,790
networks, all these
kind of things, so that the

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,420
strategy really is implemented.

208
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,780
Then what you also already
know is we should create that

209
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,900
circle by that
transformative activities building

210
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,800
critical mass by our
activities so that we begin to

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,460
influence economic
structure and the whole process

212
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,530
actually can be started
from the beginning again.

213
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,720
Because it's not a one
time off shot, a smart

214
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,370
specialisation strategy, but
it's a continuously adapted

215
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,600
process and a continuously
repeated process actually.

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,200
Once you've had success
with one priority area that

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,590
probably drops out, but then
another area might be a new

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,900
priority area to be
developed and to generate the change

219
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,420
in the economy which
we want to achieve.

220
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,740
Part of this continuous
process is, of course, monitoring

221
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,790
of the process, of the
success of the strategy, of the

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,290
impact of the
strategy at different stages.

223
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,600
On the priority areas, we
have to look if this is really

224
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,680
the right priorities. Do
they provide strategic value

225
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,280
for the region? Is the
priority on the activities area,

226
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,700
of course, we have a usual
project monitoring, project

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,060
evaluation on going.

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,730
Then we have to analyse if
you see the critical mass,

229
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,030
does our priority areas really
create critical mass in the economy?

230
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,430
And then finally is that
really resulting in a structural

231
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,490
change in the economy, or not?

232
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,910
And if any of these fail the
test, we have to, of course,

233
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,490
go back to that step in
the process and review it.

234
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,720
If it's all successful,
then probably the priority at

235
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,740
some point it's kind like
the change is achieved and we

236
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,650
can look for a new priority areas.

237
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,170
Now, summing up, quickly
what we have seen here.

238
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,280
We need a structural
process for a smart specialisation

239
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,730
strategy development.

240
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,330
It's a complex process, it
has many steps and elements

241
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,810
which have to be brought
together in a clever way and

242
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,860
which have to successfully
interact with each other, not

243
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,940
just standing side by side.

244
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,730
It's a multistage process,
we have a couple of areas, we

245
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,050
have an analytical
part, we have a dialogue and

246
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,870
interaction part and then we
have a strategy formulation

247
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,460
part and finally a
monitoring part, there's a consecutive

248
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,640
order to that part.

249
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,420
It is individual for any region.

250
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,210
There is no one size fits
all, you have to adapt, the

251
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,170
strategy itself has to
be adapted to the region's

252
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,140
specific, but also the
process needs to be adapted to the

253
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,280
region specifics to be
successful, but still we

254
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,630
have some structure provided
which helps us building it.

255
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,370
It is interactive, as I have
already pointed out, and it's

256
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,390
continuous, it never ends really.

257
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,130
A successful strategy just
leads to new priority areas

258
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,010
and new activities, but
also in any step of the process

259
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,890
implementation it can be
necessary to go one step back

260
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,190
and do the analyse again
and change the process.

261
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,890
Data is essentially
required for that process.

262
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,790
Without a sound base of
evidence, which is data driven,

263
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,170
the process will only be
successful accidentally, but not

264
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,290
structurally. And there
are two important parts of

265
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,290
analytic input. One is
the base of evidence, we

266
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,120
discussed a little bit which
it would be, we will have a

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,030
look at that in the next
session in more detail, and the

268
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,670
entrepreneurial resources
available in the region.

269
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,270
Again we will look at
that in an example in a later

270
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,390
session again, but we have a
little bit of an idea what is in there.

271
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,760
Thank you for your
attention for that session.

272
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,190
In the next part of that
session we will have a look at a

273
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,690
few more details of that process.
