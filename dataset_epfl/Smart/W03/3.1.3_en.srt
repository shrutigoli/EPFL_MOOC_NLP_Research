1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,830
After the base of evidence
let's look in another part in

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,390
more detail and from the
graphical representation of the

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,080
process we have already seen
here that base of evidence,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,210
on the one hand, and the
analysis of the entrepreneurial

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,850
resources, on the other
hand, are going together into the

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,950
dialogue and interactions.

7
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,230
But let's look in a bit
more detail in the interplay

8
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,610
between these three parts.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:38,040
In this process there are actually
two ways how it could be organised.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,630
Any of all drawing of the
process we've drawn it like it

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,120
is represented here with the
two arrows going towards the

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,010
dialogue and interactions.
It could actually be called a

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,280
kind of a bottom-up
tactic of the process.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,450
On the one hand we
have the base of evidence.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:59,630
The base of evidence
provides us with a lot of

16
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,760
information of the economy
and provides us with areas

17
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,330
which have potential for
change, it might be that they

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,050
are in need for change,
it might be under pressure,

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,380
economic pressure, but it
could also be it's already a

20
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,610
successful area in the
economy but still has potential

21
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,290
for an even further step
change in the future, even

22
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,380
increasing that success more.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,670
On the other hand we have
the analysis of entrepreneurial

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,530
resources and that
provides us, completely

25
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:35,090
independent from the areas
of need, with a list of all

26
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,100
entrepreneurial activities,
projects, people, available

27
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,000
resources for entrepreneurship,
which is available within the region.

28
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,910
And then independently from
these two information in the

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,900
dialogue and interactions
part, it is that we combine

30
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,700
these two information to
identify our priority areas.

31
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,000
Then we have to ask
questions like: are there enough

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,930
innovation activities in
a possible area in need

33
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,890
or in the potential to
change to achieve finally the

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,070
scale necessary really
to have structural change.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,230
Are there sufficient
starting points in the economy for

36
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,760
entrepreneurial activities
which we observed to build one

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,080
of the priority areas and
to really be able to get in a

38
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,750
leadership position in
these priority areas, and then

39
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,940
from that discussion you
define the priority areas.

40
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,390
Organising the process in
this bottom-up fashion is

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,130
actually the
theoretically optimal way to do it.

42
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,130
It is that what the theory
of smart specialisation would

43
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,780
really say how to do it.

44
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,540
The advantage is that it's
most flexible because you do

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,160
the two analytical steps
independently from each other,

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,890
they don't influence each
other, and there's not a danger

47
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,000
of missing important
opportunities, particularly out of

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,120
the entrepreneurial side
which you might miss if you

49
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,120
don't do that analysis
independently of the economic structure.

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,010
But they are of course also
some disadvantages of this process.

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,580
There might be an
information overflow actually because

52
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,470
there might be many
entrepreneurial activities and very

53
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,340
difficult then to sort them
and to find all of them actually.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,340
There is a high level of
coordination necessary.

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:32,640
This high governance
difficulties probably.

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,600
And it might be dangerous
that pressure groups push the

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,220
process (to us to stay)
interested as there is no

58
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,100
pre-defined direction and
might end up capturing the

59
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,060
process.

60
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,620
The alternative
organisation of the process could be

61
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,110
called a more top down
approach and you see that the flow

62
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,900
of information is quite
different in this case.

63
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,400
You do the base of evidence
analysis in a first step, and

64
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,920
that provides us again
this area, this potential for

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,100
change, and also provides
as in this case these areas,

66
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,850
these chances for
innovation or competitiveness games.

67
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,510
These areas are now
pre-defined and then given to the

68
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,520
analysis of
entrepreneurial resources, and

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,170
entrepreneurial resources
analyses focus on the areas

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,330
which had been
identified in the base of evidence

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,500
analysis already as
potential areas, and just looks for

72
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,180
entrepreneurial
activities, entrepreneurial projects

73
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,770
fitting within these areas.

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,840
That makes it much easier
of course to identify the

75
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,000
appropriate activities,
but you might miss good

76
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,790
chances by that because if
you have a large number of

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,640
entrepreneurial activities,
but they don't fit in one of

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,520
the priority areas,
you will miss that.

79
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,040
And then after the
analysis of the entrepreneurial

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,810
activities, then we go
back to the dialogue and

81
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,740
interaction section and
actually the step then is not as

82
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,420
important as it is in the
other case because here we then

83
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,120
particularly ask the
question does the areas we

84
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,310
identified with
potential for change and the

85
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,470
entrepreneurial activities
that fit to these areas, do

86
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,140
they have this size and
the right potential to really

87
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,250
generate externalities and
the scales necessary to lead

88
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,470
to structural change?

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,060
The danger of organising a
process in this way is of

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,800
course that you miss
important information as you limit

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,700
already the analysis of the
entrepreneurial activities.

92
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,370
And again it might be
dangerous that interest groups push

93
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,250
already for priority
areas and then limit the

94
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,430
entrepreneurial resource
analysis just to the areas of

95
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,940
interest, so here again
there are some governance issues.

96
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,250
In reality usually we will
have a mix of both, and you

97
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,850
should keep in mind the
properties of that so that you

98
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,270
can find the optimal mix
which is for your own region,

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,500
which also depends on
structures and governance

100
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:25,680
capacities available which
process, or if your processes

101
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,840
more going towards the top down or
more towards the bottom-up approach.

102
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,760
Let us a last point for
that video, have a look

103
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,570
on a kind of wording issue,
because we talk about smart

104
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,420
specialisation strategy
or the process of smart

105
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,000
specialisation, and we also
talk about entrepreneurial

106
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,200
discovery and these two are
actually not much different.

107
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,100
An entrepreneurial
discovery process is as it is for

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,830
smart specialisation, an
analytical process, it needs

109
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,810
analytical foundation,
it needs a definition of a

110
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,890
priority area and then
includes a number of projects in

111
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,420
these priority areas
interacting with each other, working

112
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,610
together to generate at
the scale and externalities

113
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:18,690
necessary to really do the
step change for the structural

114
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,000
change in the economy.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,650
But an entrepreneurial
discovery process is the

116
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,630
definition of one
priority area, while a smart

117
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,850
specialisation strategy has
a number of priority areas

118
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,360
and it also has the
monitoring enablation phase which is

119
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,700
not really entrepreneurial discovery.

120
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,230
So, smart
specialisation strategy is actually a

121
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,380
collection of results of
entrepreneurial discovery

122
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,190
processes which each
leads to one priority area.

123
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,830
You could also say smart
specialisation is a kind of

124
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,770
portfolio management of
entrepreneurial discoveries for

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,050
one region.

126
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,370
Let's recapture quickly what
the process would look like.

127
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,880
We looked in the first
video of that session, we

128
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,420
discussed the complete
process, in the second video now

129
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,130
we looked at a
couple of more details.

130
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,010
Let's go through the most
important elements again just

131
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,510
to recap them.

132
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:22,610
The first step we pointed
out as an important element

133
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,660
is the definition of the region.

134
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,060
It is about
identifying your identity.

135
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,690
Be sure of who you are, be
sure what you talk about, and

136
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,520
although it's not really
part of the theoretical concept,

137
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,710
it is really essential that
the strategy is successful,

138
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,950
that you agree on one
definition, there might be already

139
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,770
one, then it's fine, but it
might also be necessary to do

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
that as a first step.

141
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,380
The second important element is the
base of evidence: identify your needs.

142
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,590
Where is the potential
for structural change?

143
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,080
And where is the need
for structural change?

144
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,290
The next step, or the
next element, the analysis of

145
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,080
entrepreneurial resources.

146
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,480
Identify your opportunities.

147
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,770
What are the chances you face?

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,480
What can you do with the
entrepreneurial assets in the region?

149
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,380
What are the opportunities?

150
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,130
Then dialogue and interaction
are the next essential element.

151
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,470
Identify the promising combinations.

152
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,880
Bring the information from
different areas you created

153
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,470
before, you analysed before,
together to really identify

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,140
your combinations which
might be most promising for you.

155
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,950
Then define your priority areas.

156
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,230
It's like identify your focus.

157
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,160
Where do you want to focus on?

158
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,380
You can't focus on
everything, you should not focus only

159
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,330
on one thing but identify
the areas you want to focus on.

160
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,420
Then of course in the focus
area, in the priority areas,

161
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,020
you have to define
projects which interact with each

162
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,120
other, create
networks, platforms, invest in

163
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,260
R&D collaborations, all of
these kinds of things, it's

164
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,060
like identify your activities,
identify what you want to do.

165
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,160
Last not least, don't forget
to monitor and if necessary

166
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,940
adapt your strategy.

167
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,070
At each different step,
where this is possible, it could

168
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,570
be said identify what works.

169
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,580
And if it doesn't work,
change something, and if it still

170
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,430
doesn't work probably you
have to drop a priority area.

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,910
That can happen. Smart
specialisation is about

172
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,260
entrepreneurship,
entrepreneurial discovery.

173
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,700
Entrepreneurial
discovery is a discovery

174
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,850
process, you can be
successful with it but you might also

175
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,870
fail, this is why you
should not only have one priority

176
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,420
area but look at several,
and you should monitor that you

177
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,270
recognise in time if it works or
not, not to waste more investment.

178
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,810
The seven elements presented
in the last slide, these are

179
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,800
essential for a smart
specialisation strategy, you need

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
them really, but even one
step further, we also provided

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,230
more individual steps
for such a strategy.

182
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,950
They are maybe not all of
them essential, but if you

183
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,570
follow them, you
cover all important areas.

184
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,220
You might have to focus
more on one, than another, but

185
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,430
still you will cover all
areas which might help in

186
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,640
building such a strategy.

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,870
Thank you for the moment.

188
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:32,320
Thank you for this session,
and in the next session we

189
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,650
will look into more detail
into the tools available for

190
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,430
these steps, and
particularly available for analysing

191
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,350
the base of evidence.

192
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,550
Thank you.
