1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,100
Welcome back to the
second part of the session.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,410
When in last part we
focused on the outward view of the

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,080
evidence-based, this time
we will look more into the

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,320
inward side of the analyse.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,760
Let's look first what are
the main characteristics again

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,100
of this inward view.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,660
We will focus on the
individual region and really going

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,320
to the specific and details
of those regions and not look

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,660
that much on the
competitive position.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,010
There are a number of
consequences of this feature.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,340
There are analytical tools
of course available for this

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,560
kind of analyse but it is much less
standardised than in the outward view.

13
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,000
We need to look more at a
specific need, into specific

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,410
 characteristics of the regions
and adapt our analyse to this.

15
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,280
Still the focused area of
the analyse are not that much

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,140
different from the outward analyse.

17
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,850
We again look at the industry
 structure, that's in a much more detailed way.

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,720
We will keep us busy with
clusters and we will look at

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,380
the regional innovation
system in more detail.

20
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,410
But let's go into some examples.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,960
The examples provided in
the following for analyses on

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,280
the inside view are much
more of an illustrative

23
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,580
 character than they have
been for the outside view.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,340
But for the outside view there's
a relatively structured process.

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,000
For the inside view we
have to look much more on the

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,590
 characteristics and
individual properties of a region and

27
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,270
adapt the analyse according to it.

28
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,600
Still, the examples,
which I again take in from the

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,220
Canton of Ticino, do
provide a couple of interesting

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,700
insight and how such an
analyse can be conducted.

31
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,660
Actually the first example already
points to a very important issue.

32
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,760
In a discussion, I pointed
out that the different steps

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,730
of the analyse, for example
the industry structure and

34
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,550
the innovation system,
can't be seen all completely

35
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,000
separately but have to
interact with each other.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,680
And that is well something,
precisely, this example does.

37
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,050
It analyses if the
industry structure and innovation

38
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,320
system are harmonised, if
they work together well or if

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,600
they do not.

40
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,200
We measure here, with
an RTA index, a Relative

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,890
Technological Advantage
index, the importance of

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,150
different fields of the
industry, by gross value added

43
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,270
actually, and the
importance of the innovation system

44
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,840
in that field by the
patents intensity actually.

45
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,300
And we can see that, for
Ticino, there are in a number of

46
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,460
industry's areas,
this fit is quite well.

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,790
For example the
chemical raw materials or the

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,750
pharmaceuticals, in both
cases the concentration index

49
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,090
is higher than in Western
European average, and pretty

50
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,910
close to each other
actually, (inaudible).

51
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,000
So the Ticino innovation
system is focused in the same

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,820
areas as the industry in Ticino is.

53
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,550
But that is not true
for all industries.

54
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,310
For example in the
electrical engineering Ticino is quite

55
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,620
focused in this area,
in the industry side.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
But the innovation system,
measured by the patents here,

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,090
does not reflect that.

58
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,820
So here probably we don't
have that much innovation

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,020
capacities to support that industry.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,340
And all this is relative.

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,040
Of course some
industries, like, for example

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,880
pharmaceutics, produce much
more patents than for example

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,350
electrical engineering.

64
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,640
But all of these
measures are relative to Western

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,470
European averages, so the
relative patent intensity in

66
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,460
Ticino is lower
than in other regions.

67
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,070
But their relative industry
share is higher and therefore

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,000
that does not fit together perfectly.

69
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,530
Which might of course be a
possible approach for a smart

70
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,000
innovation strategy.

71
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,840
If you find innovative
activities which can push the

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,070
research side of the
electrical engineering industry,

73
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,120
that could create the transformative
action for these industry possibly.

74
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,000
But we're still in the
statistic analyses, not in the

75
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,540
project of priority area definition.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,640
But it might be a
possible point to follow up.

77
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,040
The next example shows
how the analyse from the

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,350
outward side can be driven
down in much more detail by

79
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,220
the inward analyse,
inward looking analyse.

80
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,040
From the outward analyse we
know that the life science

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,660
industries, one of the focus
areas of the Ticino industry.

82
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,160
But let's get in,
somewhat, deeper into it.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,840
Although Ticino is one
region, it has several sub-regions

84
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,400
which can be analysed
separately and that's the first

85
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,680
thing which was done in this example.

86
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,580
We see the life, the
location quotient of the life

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,360
science industry in this 5
sub-regions of Ticino, and we

88
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,460
clearly see although it is
rather high in nearly all of

89
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,930
these regions, it is very much
concentrated in one region particularly.

90
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,000
Even going into more
details we can look at the

91
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,760
municipalities the life
science industry is located in.

92
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,380
And we see that by the
dots on the graph, that it is

93
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,510
really focused very much in a
fairly small area of the region.

94
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,870
So here really some
cluster features appear.

95
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,910
Furthermore it's a callous
demonstrate, it is not only

96
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,690
one part of that industry,
but if you look at production,

97
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,920
trade with this goods and
research separately, you see

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,440
that particular production
and trade are closely related,

99
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,760
and their many
activities in this area also quite

100
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,140
substantial by the size,
reflected by the size of the bullets.

101
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,850
Which is less prominent is
divide spots which reflect

102
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,910
the research side.

103
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,040
And there are also not
really located in the middle of

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,000
the cluster but a little
bit further out, although the

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,480
distances are not far,
there might be some potential

106
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,850
again here for more
research driven parts.

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,000
But again we're not at the
point of that finding priority

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:37,960
areas yet.

109
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,730
That is still the
statistically analyse and we have to

110
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,370
check if we find project
which have the potential to

111
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,020
increase the research side
of the life science industry

112
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,740
which might then help
to complete cluster.

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,130
This last example's focus on the
research network of the region of Ticino.

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,460
Actually we used again
patent data, joint patent

115
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,310
applications, to see where
are research cooperation with

116
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,190
other regions and Ticino.

117
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,130
What we observe is that
Ticino has quite a number of

118
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,450
corporations but most
of them are focused on a

119
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,120
geographically fairly
near base to Ticino itself.

120
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,220
Most of the corporations
have a Swiss origins or this is

121
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,180
northern Italian origins.

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,940
There are less further away
corporations like with London

123
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,840
or the States,
although there are some.

124
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:36,050
For the smart
specialisation strategy development, that

125
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,580
is a hint that probably we
can use research potential,

126
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,420
some closer by regions quite
well, as these corporations work well.

127
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,380
But on the other hand
also project improving their

128
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,460
further away connections,
if they are useful for the

129
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,000
local industry, might be an option.

130
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,240
Again we are not in
the area of defining

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,020
priorities now. But
still in the analytical area.

132
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,220
The defining of
priorities needs more inputs.

133
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,140
And that's what I
want to look at next.

134
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,670
Up to now, the examples that I
provided work the statistics.

135
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,190
But as we recall from
the process, there's also a

136
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,130
contextual part of the
base of the evidence analyses

137
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,190
which is not based in
statistics, where we go beyond statistics.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,880
In that part we have to
access the knowledge of people.

139
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,070
People in the region, but
they also, maybe be outside the

140
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,370
region, access their
knowledge and access their ideas and

141
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,020
their information to
include them in the analyse.

142
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,240
This of course is the most
complex part, probably, of the analyses.

143
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,680
But at the same time it's
the less standardised part.

144
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,030
Therefore we can't provide
many tools here, but we will

145
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,790
see in a later session an
example how that might look

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,560
like in a region and how
may that might be organised.

147
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:07,650
But there are few principles
which we can follow in that

148
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,610
part of the analyses.

149
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,900
It should be interactive.

150
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,240
We should talk to the people,
we have to talk to the people.

151
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,540
But we also might need to go
back to them again, with new

152
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,680
ideas and re-ask them
certain questions to really get all

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,450
information which is available.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,650
And it does an explanatory process.

155
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,470
We don't up ahead exactly
know where it will lead.

156
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,560
There might be some misleading parts.

157
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,510
But in the end you have to
follow the map to find out if

158
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,000
they are misleading or not
and you'll find very useful

159
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,170
parts by doing so.

160
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,650
Secondly it is very regional focused.

161
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,500
It is not about international
competition and comparison and benchmarking.

162
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,400
It's really going into
the details of the region,

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,220
actually also into details
of certain areas which might

164
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,450
be priority areas later, or even
already to individual projects.

165
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,930
Also at that part of the
analyse, we're not really

166
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:07,920
looking at projects, these
information, these bits and

167
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,160
bytes of information, which
in the beginning might not be

168
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,770
really connected, might be
important in the end for the

169
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,530
 structural analyse, for the base of
evidence to have that really complete.

170
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,340
And thirdly this part of
the analyse can't be done by

171
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,710
administrative people only
alone or by researchers alone.

172
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,680
It is actually
about talking to people.

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,620
That administrative part is only
coordinating all the information.

174
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,290
But you need to talk to
people in innovative firms, you

175
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,000
need to talk to researchers, in
universities or other institutions.

176
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,460
You need to talk to
inventors and investors into regions,

177
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,760
and innovators, to all
these kinds of people.

178
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,580
But you also need to
talk to policy makers.

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,650
What are they up plans,
what are their views on this.

180
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:00,900
You probably also need to
talk to senior administrative

181
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,950
people to really get a
complete contextual picture of

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,000
the region.

183
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,890
With that, we have seen
examples of the most parts of the

184
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,020
base of evidence analyse.

185
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,540
So we should be
able to follow that up.

186
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,230
In the next few sessions we
will also have a few examples

187
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,800
how that really works but we
now know a little bit about

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,180
a toolbox and how to use it.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,500
So looking forward to see
you again in the next session.

190
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,460
Thank you.
