1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,370
Welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,480
In this session we will
have a look at the tool box.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:12,090
You will see a few
examples of tools which we can use

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,290
when do the analyse
the base of evidence.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,140
The first step is to remember
why we are doing this at all.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,490
The base of evidence is the
foundation of the complete

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,270
strategy, we need to know
exactly what we are building

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,160
on, on what we can rely on.

9
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,520
And that's what the SWOT
analysis provides us with the

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,570
strengths and weaknesses of
the region we can build on,

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,860
but furthermore the
available resources and existing

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,950
specialities in the
regions, these are our departing

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:47,570
points for further smart
specialisation, so this is also

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,780
something which should come
out of the base of evidence,

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,730
but even one step further
the analysis should also

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,490
provide us with first ideas
of possible priority areas,

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,760
of areas of interest for a change.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
Might it be that they need
to change, or might it be that

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,170
the change generates
more dynamics in this area.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,910
That's also part of what the
base of evidence should tell

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,680
us, or the analysis
underlying it should tell us,

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,200
potential priority areas.

23
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,910
But there is even one step
more, it's not only about

24
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,020
identifying priority areas.

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,120
The goal is that these
priority areas and the activities

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,430
resound in the step change
for the whole economy, that

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,420
they have a critical mass,
or generate a critical mass,

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,600
they provide externalities
and transformative activities

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,320
so that they get a
 structural change in the complete

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,000
economy, and again the
analysis we do when we build the

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,480
base of evidence should
provide us with some information

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,950
if this is possible in
the potential priority area.

33
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,120
Before going into the
tools available, let's quickly

34
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,890
recap what questions
we would like to answer.

35
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,090
Which industries which
sectors or activities are

36
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,210
important for the region?

37
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,720
What are the drivers
of the regional economy?

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,210
Are these industries
competitive in the international

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,540
competitive environment?

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,780
Or are they only locally focused so
they are not exposed to competition?

41
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,630
What's the future
potential of these industries?

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,050
Are they in a growing area
or in a decreasing market?

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,730
Do we already identify
key sectors, or unique

44
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,440
combinations or clusters in
the region which we can build on?

45
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,480
And how is the location
quality in the region?

46
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,580
And does it relate well to
what we found (inaudible)?

47
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,070
Are classes supported by the
right quality factors in the

48
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,680
region, or do they not fit together?

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,370
As much specialisation is
a lot about innovation and

50
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,670
change, of course the
innovation capacities are very

51
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,100
important, what are
available in the region?

52
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,880
and how does the
regional innovation system work?

53
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,840
should be answered.

54
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,600
And last not least how do
megatrends and general purpose

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,600
technology influence the
results we found (inaudible)

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,230
what do they mean for the
future perspective of the focus

57
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,910
areas of the region industries?

58
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,600
Now did I bore you with
these questions a little bit?

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,870
I hope so because that should
be already clear that that's

60
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,000
what needs to be answered.

61
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,230
Now let's have a look at
how we can answer that.

62
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,530
Instead of now going
directly to the tools I would like

63
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,200
to try to structure the
further process a little bit.

64
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,940
We at (inaudible) developed
a regional profile toolbox

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,730
which should help to have
more structure in the analysis.

66
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,850
It's actually based on
three pillars, what we call

67
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,530
performance attractiveness
and structural potential.

68
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,600
The performance is the
part looking backwards.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,170
It looks at what has been achieved
until now, where is the region today?

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,590
and of course as trends
often go on longer, it is often

71
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,270
an indicator what the
region might be developing to.

72
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,480
The second pillar, the
attractiveness, looks at the

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,150
location conditions of the
region, how is the region

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,760
positioned in a competitive
world: is it attractive for companies?

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,860
is it attractive for
certain industries?

76
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,690
is it attractive for people,
particularly for highly qualified people?

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,010
And finally the third
pillar, the structural potential,

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,250
we want to have a look into
the future, but not in the

79
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,420
sense of a forecast, but in a
sense of potential of development.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,900
Therefore we analyse the
economic structure and look what

81
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,630
potential is inherent
in these structures.

82
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,740
But this is not only a
 structure for the analysis, it's

83
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,610
also that we build
indicators for each of these three

84
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,280
pillars, they allow a quick
overview of the results of that pillar.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,080
But of course there's a lot
of underlying analysis and

86
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,810
data and that drill down
possibilities into all these

87
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,230
indicators until
very detailed levels.

88
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,790
But let's see how
really works in reality.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,210
The first example is the
performance index, reflecting

90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,160
the economic
performance of the region.

91
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,140
An example taken is actually
for the canton of Ticino as

92
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,470
I announced before we have many
examples for Ticino so is this one.

93
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,390
And Ticino is doing
quite well in the economic

94
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,860
performance, you can
see that in this index.

95
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,670
The index is constructed in
a way that one hundred equals

96
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,150
the western European
average, and with a value of above

97
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,420
110 Ticino is doing better
than the western European

98
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:48,450
average, and actually doing
quite substantially better as

99
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,690
a difference of ten points
means one standard variation,

100
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,400
and so the medium
variations on the average of all

101
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,290
European regions, so
Ticino is even better than the

102
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,520
western European average
than one standard variation, and

103
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,520
you can also see that
if you compare it to the

104
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,600
benchmarking regions, also
given in the chart, Ticino is

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,640
in quite a leading position,
all the other Swiss regions

106
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,230
are actually doing better.

107
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,730
Of course a performance
index is only a very brief

108
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,150
overview but gives a first
insight into the development

109
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,530
of the region, to understand
that in more detail you have

110
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,870
to drill down much for more
in the data, and that's what

111
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,860
we will do in the next
few slides and examples.

112
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,200
Of course it won't be
possible to do the complete

113
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,080
analysis here, that would
overstretch the videos quite a bit.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,000
But in the reading materials
you have the example of the

115
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,640
analysis we did for Ticino,
there are many more examples

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,230
of graphics and analytics in there.

117
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,540
And actually even there in
the report not everything was

118
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,810
done in the analytical
phase, before to report we did

119
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,260
much more and selected to
analysis which are interesting.

120
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,760
But here I really have to
focus on a very few examples

121
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,410
illustrating that, and the
next example will really show

122
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,330
how much deeper into
the details we can go.

123
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,620
In this example we look at
the details of the industry

124
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,150
 structure and actually it
looks at the whole of the

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,430
industry of the canton of Ticino.

126
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,790
It compares these industries with
the same industries in other regions.

127
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,120
And the first thing we
see is that the whole of the

128
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,280
sector is fairly important
in Ticino as the horizontal

129
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,540
axis which provides the
share of this sector within the

130
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,320
complete economy, only
central Switzerland has a higher

131
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,290
share, all other regions
have the same or a lower share.

132
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,910
We also see that the
wholesale trade is a quite

133
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,870
successful sector in
Ticino it had not the top growth

134
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,230
but it is among the stronger
growing regions in the last ten years.

135
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,770
So it's a sector which
has some potential and some

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
importance for Ticino and
could be analysed so for smart

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
specialisation strategy.

138
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,840
The third example moves away
from the economic structure

139
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,540
now and looks at the
location quality, and this time the

140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,250
example is not for
Ticino but for Brussels.

141
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,040
We have a number of
locations sectors reflected in that

142
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,000
 chart, and again we compare
that to do western European

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,730
average of all regions
which equals again one hundred.

144
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,900
We also observe here how the
 structure changed, what did

145
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,570
Brussels achieve over this
period of six years from 2006 to 2012?

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,770
And if you look at the
details, there is particular

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,170
manpower taxation where
Brussels performs first in the

148
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,770
western European average and
actually only improved very

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,160
slightly since 2006.

150
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,790
By the way the indicators
defined are defined in a way

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,150
that lower values reflect
what is less attractive for

152
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,040
economic activities, so
higher taxes have lower values in

153
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,700
that chart and vice versa.

154
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,800
But Brussels also has
a couple of strengths.

155
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,370
Particularly in the
accessibility, which is one of the

156
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:22,170
strength of Brussels which
actually improved, at least at

157
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,250
a continental level, over time.

158
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,200
And also in the area of
innovation, the Shanghai index

159
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,910
which measures the
university quality and the (inaudible)

160
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,560
density and the patent
density are rather good in Brussels.

161
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,100
So Brussels is positioned
quite well with its location

162
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,670
factors and also not only
for administrative work like

163
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,210
the EU, but also for
innovative industries, as you can

164
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,580
see on the innovation indicators.

165
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,620
The fourth example now
goes further down into the

166
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,600
analysis, it drills
down further into details.

167
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,070
It's what we call the
capacity to compete.

168
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,940
The idea here is that the
industries have to compete

169
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,370
on interregional and
international markets, and we want

170
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:14,720
to know how competitive they
are as an indicator for the

171
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
possible future success.

172
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,320
You see from that
description that is part of the

173
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,830
 structural potential
pillar of the analysis.

174
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,210
Now first of all we have
to know which industries do

175
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,670
compete
interregionally and internationally.

176
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,010
It's not only the industries
which exports their product.

177
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,940
It can also be industries
with produce for the regional

178
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,930
market that could
potentially be replaced by imports to

179
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,490
these market so that they
also face the international

180
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,450
interregional competition.

181
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,100
That's true for most of the
producing industries of the

182
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,210
secondary sector, but it
also is true for quite some

183
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,550
services for example
tourism, in the financial sector, or

184
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,750
in the wholesale trade.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,150
Now let's look at the result
of this example again, which

186
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,160
is again for the canton of Ticino.

187
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,730
We first had a look on the
share of the export-oriented

188
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,830
industries, and is given
again on the horizontal axis,

189
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,740
and we see that wholesale
trade is very important, the

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,600
sector we already analysed
before in the example, but

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,470
also medical profession
and optimal instruments for

192
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,200
example, or chemicals
and pharmaceuticals.

193
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,550
But now we also need a
measure of the competitiveness of

194
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,890
these industries on the inter
regional and international markets.

195
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,870
And we do that by the
productivity as an indicator for

196
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,120
competitiveness, which is
readily available, it's not the

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,180
optimal indicator of
course, but it is the one which is

198
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,820
internationally comparable.

199
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,910
And here we see that the
picture changes somewhat, these

200
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,340
particular textile and
fashion industries which is very

201
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,680
productive in Ticino
compared to other regions in Europe,

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,480
it has actually three times
the productivity of the other

203
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,860
regions, that's what
two hundred percent mean.

204
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,580
So although this industry
is rather small in the Ticino

205
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,000
economy, it contributes a
lot to the competitiveness of

206
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,810
the industry overall, that is
given by the size of this figure.

207
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,910
The other very important
industry and it's also the

208
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,560
reason we looked at it in more
detail before, is the wholesale industry.

209
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,160
It is more competitive, it
has a higher productivity than

210
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,060
the average European region,
but is not as far up as the

211
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,620
textile industry, but he
has a very big share in the

212
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,670
economy, so therefore it's
important, it is very important as well.

213
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,770
There is also one
industry which had a negative

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,840
contribution to competitiveness,
and its hotels and restaurants.

215
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,940
If you know the Ticino
economy a little bit you know this

216
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,190
is an area where Ticino
really faces difficulties.

217
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,130
And it's now a question
for a smart specialisation

218
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,390
strategy if a step change
in a transformation in that

219
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,510
sector could be possible or
if the potential is higher to

220
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,440
increase the
wholesale sector's success.

221
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,890
These few examples gave an
impression but it's possible

222
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,620
for the outside part of
the evidence base analysis.

223
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,160
Of course there is much
more to be done and much more

224
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,580
tools and analysis to be
used to really get there, much

225
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,570
more than I can
introduce in such a short time.

226
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,920
I did give you an
impression, first of all that there

227
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,540
might be a structure, we
propose a structure of potential

228
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,390
attractiveness and
performance, but other structures can

229
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,560
be chosen as well, and
that there are drill down

230
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,560
possibilities, you start
with an overview analysis, and

231
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,210
then drill down further
into areas of interest, where

232
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,570
they show up that there might
be potential then you go further.

233
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,250
Now what does the outward
looking analysis provide us with?

234
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,300
It is the foundation, of
course, of the complete

235
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,360
strategy, without it it's
not possible to formulate a

236
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,630
successful strategy, or
just accidentally but not

237
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,000
systematically. It focuses
on the relative position of

238
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,120
the region, compares the
region inter regionally and

239
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
internationally and reflects
global competition thereby.

240
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,810
And it's that part of the
analysis where the most tools

241
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,940
are available and the most
standardised structures can be

242
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,480
used to analyse it
has been done often.

243
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,590
In the next part of this
session we will see how that can

244
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,380
be more drilled down to the
region, more an inward view

245
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,240
which goes into more
details of the region, and I'm

246
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,200
looking forward to see you
back for that second part of

247
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,910
this session, thank you.
