1
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:09,856
Welcome again. Today, we're going 
to have a closer look at the data.

2
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:12,981
We already saw, in the last session

3
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:14,581
how the data can be used,

4
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:17,818
what are the analytical tools we can
use with the data.

5
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:19,768
But today we'll look a little bit

6
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:23,843
more in what sources of data are
available.

7
00:00:24,043 --> 00:00:25,406
And what are the properties 

8
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:29,806
the data needs to have to be 
valuable for analysis.

9
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,545
As we know from earlier discussion

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,533
smart specialisation is based
on facts

11
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,733
and therefore all the data
is required.

12
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,908
But the analysis we want to conduct

13
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,920
is very demanding on the data.

14
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,294
It has to have certain properties

15
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:50,231
so that the analysis is valid
and valuable at the end.

16
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,200
The most important properties are

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,738
these that cover the relevant topics

18
00:00:55,938 --> 00:01:00,625
reflecting the economic and the
industry structure of course

19
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:05,413
But also looking at the quality of
the location and of innovation

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,663
resources available in the region.

21
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:13,975
Because all that is an important 
part of smart specialisation.

22
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,031
The data also has to be very
differentiated and detailed.

23
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,509
Smart specialisation is a strategy

24
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,597
not looking at the industry level

25
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:27,222
but at the sub-industry stage
where things really happen

26
00:01:27,422 --> 00:01:29,097
in a smart specialisation.

27
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,412
And to really have the right inputs

28
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:35,912
from the data analysis the data
of course needs all  that to reflect

29
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:40,249
the sub-industry stage of the
economic structure as well.

30
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,645
Furthermore, the data has to cover
the region we want to analyse.

31
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:51,483
We pointed out before in the
discussion how important it is

32
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:54,158
to define the region consistently

33
00:01:54,358 --> 00:01:57,183
and to create a commitment
towards the region.

34
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:01,180
But if the data doesn't cover that 
region then of course the analysis

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,817
is only of a limited value
to the strategy building

36
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:08,605
and it might also be bad for
the identification of the region.

37
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,668
Finally, the data should be
internationally comparable

38
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:15,305
and of course have an
international coverage.

39
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:22,168
Global competition today is what is
really facing regions and just a 

40
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:26,343
national data analysis would not
really reflect that global

41
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:29,668
competition for the region
and therefore be again only

42
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,868
of limited value in a smart

43
00:02:31,895 --> 00:02:35,333
specialisation strategy
building process.

44
00:02:36,493 --> 00:02:39,305
Now all these demanding properties

45
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:43,180
for the data makes it clear that 
it is not so straightforward

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,680
and there are not so many data
sources available for this

47
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:49,271
Actually you need to combine

48
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,683
various data sources to get at
those goals anyway.

49
00:02:54,004 --> 00:02:57,279
But there's one data source which we
developed at BAK Basel

50
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:01,486
as we do that kind of analysis for
many years for regions

51
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:05,071
it is just that properties which
follows this database

52
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,171
which might be quite useful.

53
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:11,058
And I will introduce that database
and its properties and its coverage

54
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:13,296
in the next few slides to you.

55
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:17,933
Of course you can also use it as a 
database, but it might be easier

56
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:22,758
and more efficient  to use the
existing one than to combine others

57
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,571
but I will come back to that
at the end.

58
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:30,924
This database, the BAK Regional 
Economic Database is explicitly

59
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:35,374
built to support regions as a key
player in economic development.

60
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:41,286
Most other databases focusing on
national level and only have 

61
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:43,661
a derivative regional coverage

62
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,861
are not really focused on the needs
of the regions.

63
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,724
In this database it is really the
regions we look at

64
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:55,711
and the information is supposed to
be useful for regions.

65
00:03:58,288 --> 00:04:02,425
We also take of course a global
perspective and the perspective 

66
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,800
of international competition.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,913
It is always the international few

68
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:11,713
and the comparison of the region
which is of interest to us.

69
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:15,625
Actually, benchmarking is the 
essential tool we use there

70
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:20,488
and until recently actually the

71
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,688
database was called International
Benchmarking Database.

72
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,063
We just renamed it to Regional
Economic Database because we think

73
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:33,213
region is the important property
of the database and not 

74
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,625
the benchmarking which is nestled 
behind it.

75
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:39,588
But still benchmarking is also
learning from the best that is also

76
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,000
what you can do with that database.

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,063
What do other regions do and how
successful are they with what they

78
00:04:46,263 --> 00:04:48,425
do can be analyzed there.

79
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,522
It covers the relevant topics,
economic performance

80
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:56,897
location quality and innovation
capacities, and all that together

81
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:02,572
then builds the Regional Economic
Database, powered by BAK Basel.

82
00:05:03,444 --> 00:05:07,019
Now what are the properties of this
database?

83
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:11,619
As we are interested in regions,
of course the first important part

84
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:15,482
is the geographical coverage of the
database.

85
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:20,557
At the core of the database we focus
on OECD countries, the most

86
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,994
developed industrialized countries

87
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:26,644
as the benchmarking sample for the
regions we are interested in here

88
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:31,017
but the structures of the database
are easily expandable

89
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:34,542
so other countries can be covered
there as well.

90
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:38,129
But of course countries are only
geographic coverage, the core

91
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,204
interest is on regions

92
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:43,854
And within the 24 countries which
are included in the database

93
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:49,342
at the moment, there are more than
1100 regions covered in the database.

94
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:54,892
And this is only the lowest level,
of course we can aggregate further

95
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:58,892
regions out of these 1100
individual regions.

96
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:04,193
And this is what we call flexible
geographies within the database and

97
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:07,205
also provided by the example here.

98
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:10,630
This actually is the metropolitan
region of Hamburg

99
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,430
and if you know Hamburg

100
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,193
the administrative region of the
city of Hamburg is rather small

101
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,618
and that's actually a Bundesländ
in Germany

102
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:20,780
so from an administrative level it's

103
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:28,168
a very divided functional region
the metropolitan area of Hamburg

104
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,246
In most German data you will only
find the Bundesländer

105
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:36,246
while our database allows you to
flexibly define

106
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,059
what is the metropolitan area 
Hamburg.

107
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,259
In that graph you see 3 different
examples but of course

108
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,859
there are more possible and that you
can work with this definition.

109
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,084
And the structure of the database

110
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:53,259
the consistency and all the data

111
00:06:53,334 --> 00:06:55,584
is complete allows you really to be

112
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:59,821
very flexible within the geographic
definitions.

113
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,884
Any combination can be used and can

114
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:05,534
be analyzed into all details.

115
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:09,534
In this graph you see a quick
overview of the countries which

116
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,984
are covered  and the number of
regions in the individual countries

117
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:18,009
I leave that to you for further
or detailed analysis

118
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:22,313
and like to move on to the
sector coverage.

119
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:26,188
Regions are very important in the
database, but actually for smart

120
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:30,650
specialisation it is important to
have a detailed industry data

121
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,738
available because you want to go
beyond the usual industry level

122
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:38,988
like car manufacturing or trade

123
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:41,975
and go into more details

124
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:44,025
Within our regional economic

125
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:50,188
database we cover at the lowest
level, 115 individual industries.

126
00:07:51,063 --> 00:07:52,650
The definitions are based on the

127
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,800
international ISIC classification

128
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,188
which is quite common  and also the

129
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,650
European definitions are based on
the ISIC with very small variations

130
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:07,050
which helps to compare it with
external data if necessary.

131
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,725
Within  these 115 industries we

132
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:14,025
usually use the 2 digit ISIC
classification is so-called

133
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,925
but in the production sector we
consider that very important for the

134
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:20,088
economic development and also very

135
00:08:20,288 --> 00:08:22,325
important for smart specialisation

136
00:08:22,438 --> 00:08:25,525
we also cover the so-called 3 digit

137
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:27,975
level of the ISIC classification.

138
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:31,175
So in the production sector we are
even more detailed

139
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:36,350
while in the service sector the
level of detail is a little bit less.

140
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,928
It is very interesting with that
database that we can also go beyond

141
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:43,503
the ISIC classification of course.

142
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,390
You see that in the example here
for the Life Science Industry.

143
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,715
The Life Science Industry as it is
defined here,

144
00:08:50,915 --> 00:08:52,528
consists of the pharmaceutical

145
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,678
industry, that's fairly
straightforward

146
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:58,378
but then there is the manufacture
of medical instruments

147
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:01,903
or of electro medical instruments.

148
00:09:02,103 --> 00:09:04,978
These are different industrial areas

149
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,665
in the ISIC classification they are
not just next to pharmaceuticals

150
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:12,215
and usually it is difficult to
analyse them together

151
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:13,740
but we can do that.

152
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:17,815
But even more, there is also
a service part related to the

153
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,990
Life Science Industry, and it is the

154
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:22,103
research in biotechnology that's

155
00:09:22,165 --> 00:09:24,915
also part of the Life Science
Industry but in the usual

156
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:28,678
structure of economic analysis part
of the services

157
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,596
within our database, it is possible

158
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,546
to create such a Life Science
aggregate and analyse

159
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,371
the Life Science Industry, and that
is only one example of many

160
00:09:38,571 --> 00:09:40,434
Which are possible.

161
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:42,409
Now of course it is very important 

162
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:45,784
what indicators are covered
within the database.

163
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:49,621
and it is a kind of two split
database,

164
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,821
the core part is what we call 

165
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,709
economic performance which really

166
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,459
looks at economic indicators

167
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,421
and then we also have location
factors, I'll come back

168
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:00,209
to that in a minute but let's stay

169
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:02,596
for the moment with the economic
performance.

170
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,409
The structure of the database and

171
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:08,296
the definition is based on the
system of national accounts.

172
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:11,121
so that guarantees and helps to have

173
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:13,246
all the data internationally
comparable

174
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,296
if at some point we need to do
adaptions to that

175
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,134
we did that so really all data

176
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:21,334
in the database is internationally
comparable.

177
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:25,046
The two key indicators in the
database are GDP, 

178
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:27,821
or if you look at an industry level

179
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:30,384
value added, which is the same
concept

180
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,159
and employment, of course.

181
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:38,314
But there are a number of further
indicators a number of

182
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:43,639
calculated indicators from these 
key figures like working hours

183
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,964
labour costs, unit labour costs

184
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,676
productivity very important in the

185
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:50,426
competitive analysis

186
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:53,126
GDP per capita and so on

187
00:10:53,326 --> 00:10:54,989
and so forth.

188
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:00,689
The database also has various prices
and currencies within the database

189
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:05,201
though for example of course 
we look at real anomaly developments

190
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:10,164
but you can also use purchasing
power, parities or current exchange

191
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:14,014
rate, you can have the data in 
different kinds of currencies

192
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,214
with Francs, US Dollars or Euros

193
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:20,651
or any other you are interested in.

194
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:24,876
So it is very flexible and complete
from that perspective.

195
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:30,039
In the example here you see
a drawing for another region

196
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:32,376
for Villa Manin, it's a Euroregion

197
00:11:32,576 --> 00:11:34,814
and actually a cross border region

198
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:39,039
so you can see how flexibly we can
build these kind of analysis

199
00:11:39,076 --> 00:11:40,539
and you can see the GDP

200
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:46,401
the productivity and the employment
growth for this cross border region.

201
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:51,064
I already mentioned that the database
also includes location factors.

202
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:55,864
Of course while the economic
performance based on the system of

203
00:11:55,926 --> 00:11:58,976
national accounts is very much
harmonizing, the national lean

204
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:02,351
only needs small adaptions to be
comparable, that's not true for

205
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,826
location factors.

206
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:07,026
There are many differences in 
international measurement

207
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,864
and the way the location factors
are defined.

208
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,014
But what we do in the databases,

209
00:12:12,076 --> 00:12:15,214
the location factors we include,

210
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:18,414
we guarantee that they are 
internationally comparable

211
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:22,714
and we also usually have
quantitatively comparable 

212
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:26,714
location factors with a quantitative
measure behind them.

213
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:30,351
Or we use qualitative measures
but then put them through 

214
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,439
in depth processes that are similar
to a quantitative measure. 

215
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:39,947
So the location factors which are in
the database can be internationally

216
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:44,634
compared and can be quantitatively 
compared with each other to define

217
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,759
the position of the region

218
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:49,772
It includes the most important

219
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,859
location factors, particularly

220
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:55,347
so-called hard factors like taxation

221
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:59,597
regulation, labour markets, diggers

222
00:12:59,622 --> 00:13:03,797
availability of qualified labour
force and so on.

223
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,334
But we also look at softer factors

224
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:09,697
if possible of course quantification
is more difficult yes

225
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,359
but for example the quality of life

226
00:13:12,421 --> 00:13:14,821
is one factor which we are
looking at.

227
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:21,222
Finally there's a special focus on
all innovation related location

228
00:13:21,272 --> 00:13:23,784
factors so that this important

229
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:26,259
part of smart specialisation is

230
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:30,547
all covered in the database to the
best possible extent.

231
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,797
Again it is very important that 

232
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,934
all this is  broken down to the
regional level if appropriate

233
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:41,897
but there are also some national
figures in if they drive

234
00:13:41,972 --> 00:13:43,997
the regional economy like national

235
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:48,222
regulation is of course relevant
for the regional economy as well but

236
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,709
usually like in tax levels
or inaccessibility we look at the 

237
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:54,759
regional level for the location
factors as well.

238
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,722
Furthermore on the indicator side we

239
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,771
not only have what we might call the

240
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:03,147
the raw information which I
presented up till now

241
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,434
but there are also quite a number of

242
00:14:05,472 --> 00:14:07,472
summarizing information which makes

243
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:10,597
the database more easily accessible

244
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:12,584
but then always has the drill down

245
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,784
possibility into the details.

246
00:14:15,984 --> 00:14:18,572
One of them is summarized indexes

247
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,346
which I already introduced last week

248
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:24,922
in one of the examples, the
performance index attractiveness

249
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:27,359
or structural potential indexes.

250
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,996
And there are various ready to use

251
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:32,196
new industry definitions, I showed

252
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,809
one in the example before the Life
Science Industry but there are

253
00:14:35,884 --> 00:14:41,459
quite some more which can be used
in the analysis and they can also

254
00:14:41,484 --> 00:14:44,659
be easily built and then
incorporated on a regular basis

255
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,421
into the database.

256
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,652
And we also have predefined sets of

257
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,027
benchmarking regions.

258
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:52,140
Who do we compare with?

259
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,890
We can compare with an average of
all regions for example

260
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:58,440
but we can also look for a region

261
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,402
with strong financial sectors

262
00:15:00,602 --> 00:15:03,602
we can pick all the other financial
sector regions.

263
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:07,240
Or for a harbor and trade city
we could pick all the other regions

264
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,002
with harbors and trade activities.

265
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,365
And there are a number of sets

266
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:15,240
already defined of regions with

267
00:15:15,327 --> 00:15:19,315
common properties which built the
right benchmarking samples.

268
00:15:19,515 --> 00:15:23,640
Now summing up what are the key
advantages of our database and what

269
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:27,352
properties of other data sources
should we follow as well

270
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,477
if they are valid for the analysis
of the smart specialisation strategy.

271
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,059
The extended regional and the
extended industry coverage

272
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:38,247
is a very important habit

273
00:15:38,297 --> 00:15:40,472
particularly because it goes across

274
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,447
this many numbers of indicators.

275
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,109
You can of course find other
databases which go

276
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,434
into the same regional detail maybe
even more and you can find databases

277
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:55,472
which have even more detailed 
industry coverage, 

278
00:15:55,672 --> 00:15:58,672
but usually you don't find that
combined.

279
00:15:58,872 --> 00:16:02,397
And particularly then you can't
compare that internationally.

280
00:16:03,584 --> 00:16:05,234
One thing that I didn't mention yet

281
00:16:05,284 --> 00:16:08,359
is the coverage over time of the
database.

282
00:16:08,422 --> 00:16:13,359
This is actually a database of 
annual data, starting in '95 of the

283
00:16:13,422 --> 00:16:19,097
last century and going currently
until 2015 so it covers 20 years.

284
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:22,272
And usually the database is expanded

285
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,347
around the middle of the year to
cover the last year

286
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:29,722
so the information is quite up to
date compared with other sources.

287
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,497
The complete database is consistent
and balanced.

288
00:16:34,572 --> 00:16:36,910
That means that many combinations

289
00:16:36,947 --> 00:16:41,347
are possible and you don't get
missing data or not working 

290
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,835
because of missing data or some
small parts of it.

291
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:47,385
So you really have the consistency

292
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:51,635
and the balanced properties of the

293
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,835
database which allows you a
flexible analysis.

294
00:16:55,035 --> 00:16:56,760
And then the already mentioned

295
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:59,060
summary indexes are quite valuable

296
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,260
for the analysis and as well as the

297
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,222
new industry structures and the 

298
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,385
facts of benchmarking regions.

299
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:08,390
If you are interested in more

300
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,277
details we are happy to provide them

301
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:12,340
there is also a web page of course

302
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,940
where you can find all that kind of
information.

303
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:20,552
Now I introduce our own database and
the properties of it

304
00:17:20,752 --> 00:17:22,377
which shows what is possible

305
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:24,652
but also there are some limits to it

306
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:29,761
Of course you can use other
databases as a data source

307
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,024
and actually we did that in building
that database.

308
00:17:33,224 --> 00:17:36,224
We didn't do any primary research

309
00:17:36,424 --> 00:17:38,649
but we used various different

310
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:41,436
databases to get our internationally

311
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,911
consistent and complete database

312
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,086
together as well as a couple of

313
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,186
statistical and economical tools
to fill the gaps.

314
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:53,461
But you could go directly to the
original databases and particularly 

315
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,036
with the regional accounts 

316
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,111
is one of the most important sources

317
00:17:57,149 --> 00:18:01,511
for us and that could be a first
source of access for you as well.

318
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,924
And if you are only interested in

319
00:18:03,986 --> 00:18:05,699
Europe and not look at the global

320
00:18:05,774 --> 00:18:07,599
competition but focus on Europe 

321
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,811
you will start of course as an

322
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:12,086
important source for data.

323
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:16,361
And both of these sources are more

324
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,149
on the economic performance side

325
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,224
and for the innovation side of the

326
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:22,149
smart specialisation analysis

327
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:24,699
always the patent databases ones of

328
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:27,161
or again if you look more at Europe

329
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:29,736
it's the European Regional
Innovation Scoreboard

330
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:32,849
which might be a very useful source.

331
00:18:33,486 --> 00:18:37,486
All this data, our own database
which I introduced but also these

332
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:40,861
sources I named until now, they are

333
00:18:40,924 --> 00:18:43,686
more suited for the part of the

334
00:18:43,724 --> 00:18:47,249
evidence base which is international
benchmarking setting

335
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:50,449
the position of the region in the
international setting.

336
00:18:51,474 --> 00:18:53,411
For going into more details you have

337
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:59,624
to go into more detailed national
statistics which cover the regions.

338
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,824
There's of course national accounts
and regional accounts

339
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:06,024
production accounts as possible
sources.

340
00:19:06,524 --> 00:19:08,161
Most of what is available at that

341
00:19:08,199 --> 00:19:10,074
level is included actually in our

342
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:13,774
international database so that we
would give too much additional

343
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,024
information, but particularly labour
force survey

344
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,849
or business righteousness

345
00:19:19,049 --> 00:19:23,249
These are the sources providing very
detailed information on the industry

346
00:19:23,274 --> 00:19:27,449
structure within a country and
within your region then as well

347
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,811
so they should be accessed for that.

348
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:33,886
And then there are many other
sources, there might be regional

349
00:19:33,936 --> 00:19:36,211
cluster maps or cluster atlases

350
00:19:36,411 --> 00:19:41,174
cluster lists which you can use
and so on and so forth

351
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:44,761
That then really depends on your
individual region.

352
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:47,111
Summing up

353
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,586
data is an essential input for

354
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:51,799
developing a smart specialisation

355
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:56,961
strategy, without data it will be

356
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:58,849
very difficult if not impossible

357
00:19:58,924 --> 00:20:00,611
to realign such a strategy

358
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,511
There are numerous data sources

359
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:09,699
which can be explored but most of
them are not detailed enough for the

360
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:12,836
kind of analysis which we like to do

361
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:14,736
as a basis for smart specialisation

362
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:17,311
therefore you need to combine these

363
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:19,236
data sources and that's part of 

364
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:22,436
the work we already did at BAK Basel

365
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:28,074
resulting in the RED, the Regional
economic database which offers an

366
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,549
efficient and effective starting

367
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:33,749
point for such an analysis.

368
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,611
Thank you for today, looking forward

369
00:20:37,686 --> 00:20:40,149
to see you again soon.
