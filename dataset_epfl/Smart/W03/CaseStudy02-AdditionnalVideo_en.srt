1
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:11,561
I will, very brief and quick
of course go through these

2
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:14,660
studies and take up
all the time we have

3
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:17,605
but I think you have, I hope
you had the chance to look in

4
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:19,827
and if you need any
detail information

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,758
during the discussion of course
come back to the date at any point.

6
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:29,286
For the background of this study
also says smart specialization

7
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:32,568
in the title, it's not about
the complete smart specialization

8
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:36,771
strategy, it provided a lot of
information, which is necessary

9
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:40,911
to form such a strategy, but it
was not really going all the way

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,118
really to formulate such a strategy.

11
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:45,456
And explicitly,
there are two sectors

12
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:48,180
the finance sector, the tourism
sector which are not a part

13
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:52,261
of the study, because teaching had
detail analysed of that before.

14
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:55,166
So, it is not that we don't
consider that important

15
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,043
that they are not in the study,
but they were already covered

16
00:00:58,243 --> 00:00:59,393
before that.

17
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,804
The study has a part with
international benchmarking

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:05,979
so comparing the relative
position of the region

19
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:09,115
which is, we think, rather important
for smart specialization to know

20
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:11,521
where you are relative
to the rest of the world

21
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:15,333
to your competitors, and there
it's particularity important to look

22
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:19,099
at things like productivity
the importance of a sector in

23
00:01:19,224 --> 00:01:23,237
a region, how much is it driving
growth and economic wealth.

24
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,710


25
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:26,881
And on the other hand it has
a more detailed part on

26
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:31,209
the Ticino, economy itself,
which is not an international

27
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:34,000
comparison there, where
we look more at the detail

28
00:01:34,102 --> 00:01:37,940
where in Ticino, for example,
are the individual industries

29
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,681


30
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:43,561
located or are they more of
a clusters in one region, is it

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,498
a different activity, or activities
like trading and pharmaceuticals

32
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,579
and research and production
pharmaceuticals, are they in

33
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:55,060
the same spot, or in different spots
more of this kind of analysis.

34
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:59,025
Given that, what are
the most important findings?

35
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,342
You know? All of you know
that Ticino is doing quite well

36
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:08,231
as a Swiss region in international
comparison. or within the Swiss

37
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:11,455
framework it is not really
in the top position

38
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:15,033
but still doing quite well,
which is interesting

39
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:18,464
from our perspective is
that we have these three

40
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,408
pillars of our analysis.

41
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:23,399
We first looking at economic
performance what has been achieved

42
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,027
already, the second
looking at the current

43
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:31,501
attractiveness of a region, location
factors like taxation, accessibility

44
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:34,069
innovation activities
and things like that.

45
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,902
And the third pillar, trying to
analyze structure of the region

46
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,020
with the potential for future
growth, it's not a forecast

47
00:02:41,155 --> 00:02:43,968
of future growth, but what
structures are available

48
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:47,244
there to generate growth, their
productivity again and

49
00:02:47,343 --> 00:02:49,705
the productivity and
the measure of competitiveness

50
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:53,840
plays an important role, but also
in which sectors to reach this kind

51
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:56,523
of part active.

52
00:02:56,743 --> 00:03:00,080
And in these three pillars we
observed that Ticino is doing

53
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:02,009
quite well in all three of that.

54
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:05,097
There's not an outline,
one of them's neither to

55
00:03:05,248 --> 00:03:09,211
the positive nor to the negative
side, all three areas, what has been

56
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,853
achieved, how is the current
condition in the region

57
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:14,527
and what is the potential that is
attractive, for the future

58
00:03:14,618 --> 00:03:18,018
are looking better than
the European average

59
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,589
and to better actuate in
some other Swiss regions

60
00:03:20,707 --> 00:03:24,495
become very differently positioned
in these three indexes.

61
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:31,571
From the sectors which we identify
as interesting apart local finance

62
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:36,340
and tourism, there are four areas
which we thing it might be worth

63
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,907
to look at it more detail,
it might be a starting point

64
00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:41,899
for our discussion, but it doesn't
need to, it can also be something

65
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,962
different, but it's only only
hit the pharma industry

66
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:49,883
the pharmaceuticals, or life science
industry a bit broader, it is one of

67
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,209
the industries which shows
very strong growth in Ticino

68
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:57,352
in the last three years, actually
increasing the share in the economy

69
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:00,761
subsequently more than in other
regions, so there was an above

70
00:04:00,858 --> 00:04:03,721
average growth, it's supposed to
be growing everywhere

71
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:07,253
but in Ticino it was above average
and we see that dynamic

72
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,885
is a potential starting point
for further growth or at least

73
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:14,033
worth to look at the possibilities.

74
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:20,019
Then, the textile and the clothing
industry, the fashion industry

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,570
rather sad, it's an old strength
of Ticino, it has had some

76
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:27,664
difficult times, but actually
less than in other regions 

77
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:30,728
there's more substance still
here available in TIcino.

78
00:04:30,806 --> 00:04:34,044
And we thing that might be
an industry which has potential

79
00:04:34,182 --> 00:04:38,345
for a kinds of change if we find
good points for smart specialization

80
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,458
there, probably with new
technologies, like maybe

81
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,100
nano-technology or,
I don't know yet what.

82
00:04:44,222 --> 00:04:45,984
It could be

83
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:50,891
the reason we chose, is that
it's, first still rather important

84
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:54,012
compared to other regions, and
second that it's quite productive

85
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,267
in Ticino compared internationally,
it's the competitiveness of that

86
00:04:57,396 --> 00:05:00,396
industry, it's still rather high.

87
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:07,255
Then we look at the manufacturing
or the engineering industry

88
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:13,512
machinery, and electronics, that's
one part particularly if you observe

89
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:17,642
that the patents and innovation
activities are quite high

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,137
and also the sector is competitive
internationally, so that might be

91
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:27,737
a starting point, and then finally
ICT is also in effect, which

92
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,394
Ticino growth has gone quite well
in the recent, or the last ten years

93
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,460
which we particularly focus
on, and of course that is

94
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:40,554
growing any way the economy,
so that might be a potential

95
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,421
as an industry.

96
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,700
I think that are been most
important findings and

97
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:50,510
if you don't have any questions at
the moment, we might come back to

98
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:54,088
one as a detail in a life
period discussion.
