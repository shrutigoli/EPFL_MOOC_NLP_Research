1
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,361
Dialogue and interaction.

2
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:10,519
Is it really needed as
an individual element

3
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,974
in the strategy definition?

4
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,494
We think so, through the base of
evidence and the entrepreneurship

5
00:00:18,588 --> 00:00:23,988
resources, analysis, we gather tons
of information and we involve

6
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:27,710
a lot of different stakeholders
into the process.

7
00:00:28,212 --> 00:00:32,824
And this vast and complex
mattress has to be

8
00:00:32,973 --> 00:00:36,211
has to lead to clear decisions.

9
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:39,789
To clear choices
about priority areas.

10
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:45,791
To take care of this
it is not only appropriate

11
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:50,605
to define dialogue into action
as an individual step, but it's

12
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:53,065
actually essential to do that.

13
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:57,992
To demonstrate this necessity
but also to show how this

14
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:02,986
very contextual step of
the analysis might look like

15
00:01:03,107 --> 00:01:08,107
we conducted a kind of a live
experiment in the canton of Ticino.

16
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:13,439
We brought together a group
of people from Ticino, all of them

17
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:19,243
experts on the Ticino economy
and the Ticino innovation system

18
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:24,011
for a workshop which could be
part of a dialogue in an ideal

19
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:28,488
concession, it is a typical
setting to be discussed there.

20
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:33,717
The participants will introduce
themselves in a minute in the video.

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,937
But it is important to note that
they come from different parts 

22
00:01:38,027 --> 00:01:41,027
of the stakeholders in Ticino.

23
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:47,049
The group has been given the task
to identify possible priority areas

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,668
To use the information available to
define or to prepare for the choices

25
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:54,408
which need to be made.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,712
It has to be noted that this was not
a part of the real world designing

27
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:05,048
of the smart specialization strategy,
we just conducted this one workshop

28
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,978
as a kind of experiment of example.

29
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:13,953
Also, there's not a strategy defined
now based on this workshop

30
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:18,558
so you can't feed the results in
the real world strategy yet

31
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,711
it is an experiment which should
help us to understand how such

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,557
a process might work, and also
show a couple of the pitfalls

33
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:29,872
and the difficulties you will
encounter particularity in these 

34
00:02:29,986 --> 00:02:33,811
dialogue and interaction
fraction of the process.

35
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:38,183
The geography we discuss
in the workshop is the canton

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,112
Ticino, an Italian speaking
southern most canton

37
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,720
of Switzerland.

38
00:02:44,104 --> 00:02:50,304
It's in the Alps, so tourism is
one of the important and well known

39
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:54,394
industries there, but there's
also a strong industrial base.

40
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:59,769
This includes textiles, includes
life science and pharmaceutical

41
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:04,199
industry, as well as a number
of other activities.

42
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:08,996
we already saw quite some examples
throughout the course and of course

43
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,013
in the reading material

44
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:14,143
to learn more, about the canton.

45
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:19,888
But now, let's have a huge thanks
to the participants in the workshop

46
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:23,223
and to their willingness to
devote the time and their vast

47
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,768
expert knowledge

48
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,584
toward our course, providing
us with the second case study

49
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,027
of the course.

50
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:46,468
Hi, I'm Stefano Delissandri
form Marconi Technology.

It's a startup company doing
manufacturing and technology

52
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:54,934
with personalities.

53
00:03:55,044 --> 00:04:03,669
We have established two years ago
in Ticino and we also a company

54
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,423
shared by ATI venture.

55
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:10,951
Okay, my name is Rico Maggi
I'm a director of the institute

56
00:04:11,072 --> 00:04:12,559
for economic research of

57
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,630
the Universita della
Svizzera Italiana

58
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:18,453
mandate from the canton to
observe the Ticino economy

59
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:23,113
so we do yearly reports on
the competitiveness of the canton.

60
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:27,366
We did recently a study on
the future of the Ticino economy.

61
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:31,042
Siegfried Alberton, I'm a professor
of economics and management

62
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:36,833
of innovation in the University
for applied sciences, I'm also

63
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,047
responsible of competence
center, which deal with innovation 

64
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:48,619
and the partnership issues,
I'm a member of the Swiss team

65
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,530
The GEM, global
entrepreneurship monitor

66
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:55,795
I'm a member also of the CTI
and the leadership training

67
00:04:56,373 --> 00:05:01,536
courses and recently I've
participated in reviewing

68
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:05,183
of the law of economics in Ticino.

69
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:10,347
My name is Alcide Barberis,
since September I am

70
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:15,630
the director of the IGD foundation,
which has been created by

71
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,453
the canton of Ticino to coordinate
the innovation system

72
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:24,367
and Ticino is setting up at
the same time also coordinators

73
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,086
since May.

74
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:30,990
Of the promotion center startup
of the University, in SUPSI

75
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:34,010
here in Lugano, which as
the name suggests

76
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:38,118
is promoting the creation
of the startup company

77
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,962
and the launching of those startups.

78
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:45,102
As a background, I myself
am a startup founder

79
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:49,423
in the bio-technology sector,
in Zürich and as an education

80
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:53,185
I have a molecular biology degree
from the University of Zürich.

81
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:56,213
I'm Benedetto Lepori,
I'm a professor

82
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:58,019
at the Universita della
Svizzera Italiana

83
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,764
I'm a specialist of research and
science innovation policies.

84
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,838
And I'm also a head of UZI
and SUPSI research service

85
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:11,243
so I'm supposed to know
talking about the development

86
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:13,819
of research in the region.

87
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:18,714
My name is Pietro Casati,
founder and CEO of Dacsystems

88
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:25,619
a startup company active in
the innovation systems for

89
00:06:25,742 --> 00:06:29,442
monitoring the Antena
quality and radio

90
00:06:29,568 --> 00:06:31,993
we are inside of the Technoporum

91
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:37,929
and Dacsystem is one company
that had the CTI enabled.

92
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,019
I will launch the questions,
and what you see are the main

93
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:46,256
challenges for Ticino, and then
how we can meet the challenge.

94
00:06:46,624 --> 00:06:49,537
I think it's very important to us
from general orientation

95
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,297
oh what to do, certainly agree on,
let's say, there is pharma

96
00:06:55,406 --> 00:07:01,668
pharma-medic, there is a fashion
and more than textile and clothing

97
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,395
and there's certain
machinery, electronic.

98
00:07:04,544 --> 00:07:08,469
The interesting thing is that if we
talk now about the industry

99
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,180
the fact is that we have a very
heterogeneous reality in Ticino.

100
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:22,163
So we have no big reality of one
or the other subjects about

101
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:25,968
we have a huge heterogeneity,
and they, often very competitive

102
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:31,915
firms are doing business to
business, or they are, let's say

103
00:07:32,014 --> 00:07:36,389
delivering elements into other
industries being the pharmaceuticals

104
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:40,330
have to be in the hospitals, and
the health sector, albeit elsewhere.

105
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:45,911
and so overall yes, I do agree that
the performance is high in

106
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:50,822
the Ticino economy according to our
analysis, the picture of

107
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:56,508
the competitiveness is a bit less
bright, especially concerning

108
00:07:56,605 --> 00:08:01,505
productivity, innovation,
and investment

109
00:08:01,637 --> 00:08:05,949
and one of the key elements of
the competitiveness of the canton

110
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:10,369
is the relatively low nominal
salaries in Ticino, which gives

111
00:08:10,486 --> 00:08:16,348
a relatively high labor intensity
as compared to other sectors.

112
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,936
And if you want challenges from me

113
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,150
I can clearly write,
it's a small canton

114
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:25,696
and the one big challenge is
everything that is linked to

115
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,714
human resources and human
resource development

116
00:08:29,854 --> 00:08:35,654
and that is certainly something that
where Ticino, with all the political

117
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:40,247
development will encounter some
challenge for any kind of strategy

118
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:44,238
that we will want to invent,
because just with Ticinese

119
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:46,951
we will not go that far,
we won't even degrade 

120
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:53,240
that idea to put into the innovation
or eliminate a lower limit of

121
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,103
the number of Ticinese
or however this is defined

122
00:08:57,227 --> 00:09:03,302
and have to be active in a company,
to qualify for the subsides.

123
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:08,198
So overall Ticino is
a good location

124
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:13,125
but we need some priorities,
as you said and from the sheer

125
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:17,939
size also from the human resources
it's to obvious for me and also

126
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:21,890
also fro the altitude towards
innovation overall, it's clear

127
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:26,328
for me exactly how we should go
there, but I do not ignore that

128
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,894
we have enough all sectors,
a lot of small very innovative

129
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:35,009
companies who go well anyway.

130
00:09:35,696 --> 00:09:38,783
A little bit further, I think
this is the problem

131
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:44,568
here in Ticino, we have problems
on the productivity side and

132
00:09:45,148 --> 00:09:52,023
innovation side of the companies,
so we work a lot identifying

133
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:56,994
sectors , clusters, districts, and
everything, but I think the problem

134
00:09:57,119 --> 00:10:01,132
is not there, the problem is
what is behind there

135
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:05,998
which are the, so called today,
key-enabled technologies

136
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:10,203
we need to develop further
those kind of sectors.

137
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:16,779
So, biotech, new materials, micro
electronics, new manufacturing

138
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:25,162
systems, all is around the so called
"Industry 4.0", so Internet of

139
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,528
things, additive technologies,
big data cloud computing

140
00:10:28,668 --> 00:10:30,280
and whatever, you know.

141
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:36,273
This is, I think the main focus
for our future developments also

142
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,870
in the policy side.

143
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:44,389
When I started my
job in the late 90's

144
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:48,192
I will say, Ticino research was
on the edge of disappearing.

145
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:52,026
There were some more things
sitting around after twenty years

146
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:55,918
we have two higher education
institutions, we have some

147
00:10:56,024 --> 00:11:00,824
very strong areas, and some of them
are potential or already well

148
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:05,428
connected with the private economy,
with entrepreneurial activities

149
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:07,168


150
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:10,175
so we have ICT, we have a lot
of mechanics, and material science

151
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:15,691
for example, we now have a lot of
bio immunology clinical research etc.

152
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:20,912
so the development on this side is
impressive, and I feel without

153
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:24,092
being a specialist of
the entrepreneurial side

154
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,713
is that a lot of change in Ticino
economy, and that there is a lot of

155
00:11:27,825 --> 00:11:32,738
dynamic, new companies coming
in to add more interaction, etc.

156
00:11:33,239 --> 00:11:37,839
And I have the same feeling
around Ticino, it's an attractive

157
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,220
place for many reasons.

158
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,369
You say, okay, the universities
are there.

159
00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:48,047
We are supported by the SUPSI
university, to make a project

160
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,810
that we have done in the past,
in in the future

161
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:58,349
but from our point of view,
to invest more in data center

162
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,118
like Siegfried told, or
the nano-technology

163
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:06,065
on the new very futuristic
technology, like nano-cell

164
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:12,057
it could also be interesting for us
to propose to the market the newest

165
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:17,643
technology, because teal speed
of the market, it's very fast now.

166
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:22,450
You cannot think to study
a new technology one year

167
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:25,496
and then present, you need
to be faster for this reason

168
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:29,835
we need to find smarter
people in this region.

169
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:34,845
This is a good thing. I would like
to come back to the "Hard" stuff.

170
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,443
You know?

171
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:46,552
Because, since we discussed about
soft things such as social consensus

172
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:51,969
and everything, I think we are just
trying to stop those processes. 

173
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:58,235
We are looking for the next reason
to avoid change, so let's turn

174
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:04,122
sometimes also in the "Hard"
infrastructure, and try to develop

175
00:12:58,406 --> 00:13:01,406


176
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:08,726
more of those kinds of discussions
about technology, which kind of

177
00:13:08,814 --> 00:13:17,277
technology, industrial structure,
what kind of knowledge we have

178
00:13:17,384 --> 00:13:23,559
to develop more, so called,
"Mint"knowledge and capabilities

179
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,202
we have a lot there.

180
00:13:25,302 --> 00:13:29,727
So, let's try to discuss much
more on "Hard" stuff.

181
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,650
Yeah, I agree very much with that,
because I had a question in my

182
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:35,590
proposal which goes in
the same direction

183
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:39,864
I think we more or less agree
that there is a lot of innovative

184
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:42,976
resources and entrepreneur
resources available

185
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,770
but there seems to be a missing link
on the one hand to the society

186
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:50,626
maybe on the other hand we have
this cause more to the traditional

187
00:13:50,764 --> 00:13:53,764
industries in the region, and
probably you can put some

188
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,016
focus on the question, like
how can we link the available

189
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:01,762
entrepreneurial spirits to the old
industries and to the society

190
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,443
to recreate the structural change,
which is the ultimate goal of

191
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,493
smart specialization.

192
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:13,209
Of course, every entrepreneur
company is different.

193
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:20,969
We establish in canton Ticino,
and we find a lot of knowledge

194
00:14:21,103 --> 00:14:27,490
very tight cooperation
with Universities that

195
00:14:27,651 --> 00:14:37,076
is really good, and a very good
support from the whole environment.

196
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:47,869
The things that we are missing,
we need is the access to some district 

197
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,047
to some specialized area,
because we are also manufacturing

198
00:14:53,194 --> 00:15:03,957
ad we are creating some special
product that hey are not high

199
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:09,245
technology even if we have
several international patents

200
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,635
and some innovational work,
but it's a combination of different

201
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:18,894
skills, and Swiss accuracy, and
the Swiss skills are combined

202
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:27,652
with the knot of Italy districts
and capacity to find particular

203
00:15:27,795 --> 00:15:35,695
materials, so particular design
or a their product, that would be

204
00:15:35,787 --> 00:15:39,562
matched in Switzerland.

205
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:43,520
That is the mixing of
the technology of design

206
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:47,024
of a way to produce, and
a way to assembly and test.

207
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:51,121
Specially, the test assemble
would be done, and has been done

208
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,828
in Switzerland.

209
00:15:52,994 --> 00:16:00,294
The district, if we do not
have any district in this area

210
00:16:00,422 --> 00:16:08,872
we'll find the mechanic, the fashion,
the materials district, and also

211
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:12,218
the craftsmanship in another place.

212
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,429
Now I think, we are
back, now what?

213
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:20,331
The size of the region, it's
clear you need a very rich

214
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:26,383
and thick industrial reality, in
which you can then be anchored

215
00:16:26,531 --> 00:16:28,518
and you just go, and say okay.

216
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:30,273
I have heard "a here and there".

217
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:34,154
And this is the problem really
with the border, and being relatively

218
00:16:34,274 --> 00:16:36,061
far from the rest of Switzerland.

219
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,738
And the other is of course,
it's nice to hear all the praise

220
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,864
of the two Universities institutions

221
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:45,713
but again it's also an issue of
science, what do you think that

222
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:55,163
it has two things, one in St. Gallen
and one in Thun, apart from the main

223
00:16:55,274 --> 00:17:01,124
transit, and both of these are about
reconversions so St. Gallen is close

224
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:04,548
to textile, in Thun it's nano
technology, so you have

225
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:07,498
these much bigger realities

226
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:10,093
and you have a thicker industrial

227
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,210
eco-system, and that's
certainly a challenge.

228
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:19,216
I think the discussion is
interesting, questioning also

229
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,144
a bit the smart specialization
concept, see this because of course 

230
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:26,958
when you take a region like
Ticino, say, a regional

231
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,577
specialization strategy in a way,
makes limited sense exactly

232
00:17:31,685 --> 00:17:34,135
because you ware too small,
on the other hand

233
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:38,700
I think we all agree that there
are some ideas in this regional

234
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:42,491
concept that proximity ,
some regional belonging

235
00:17:42,622 --> 00:17:46,059
etc. evaluate the economies
demonstrated.

236
00:17:46,126 --> 00:17:49,126
The important question is,
how you put together this

237
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:53,154
openness that we all agree, such
a small region must be open.

238
00:17:53,278 --> 00:17:56,878
With the fact that the region keeps
some consistency, and of course

239
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:02,461
my answer would be that a regional
specialization strategy should look

240
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:05,673
for strategic alliances,
outside of the region.

241
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,917
Because if you just say we
are swimming in a very big sea

242
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,432
of networks, you get simply lost
because you are small.

243
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,423
As we are throwing now
towards the new things

244
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:22,704
on the table, I think one thing
we have at the moment totally

245
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,072
left out is service.

246
00:18:25,209 --> 00:18:29,497
So we are here, fascinated
by the industrial reality

247
00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:33,629
rightly so, because
Chino is underestimated

248
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:38,469
nevertheless Ticino has always
been for the last twenty, thirty

249
00:18:38,593 --> 00:18:41,468
years, service oriented economy.

250
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:45,619
And it could be the smart
bit of the smart

251
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:48,521
specialization strategies,
which is a concept that I've

252
00:18:48,581 --> 00:18:50,994
learned now, and
I'm very proud of it.

253
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:54,786
I think it could be the smart,
but we in our report talked about

254
00:18:54,909 --> 00:18:58,197
meta sectors, quite simply
with the idea that every

255
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:02,566
industrial activity should be
tightly linked to specialized

256
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:05,668
services in witch
Ticino is strong.

257
00:19:06,072 --> 00:19:10,159
We had the financial sector
orientated in one way

258
00:19:10,256 --> 00:19:13,406
it could be a part of a smart
strategy to re-orientate it

259
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:16,212
towards the integration,
with specific sectors

260
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:24,111
specific realities, the same region
reach, to put it this way of lawyers

261
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:29,180
right, some of them might become
useful, highly unlikely but-

262
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:31,733
He's an economist.

263
00:19:32,132 --> 00:19:40,182
But you never know, then the whole
consulting and the ICT departed

264
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,513
the, let's say, the service parts,
I think it could be a smart thing

265
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:49,037
to say:"Okay, we take this
sectors" identified but

266
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:52,574
thinking more in a transversal
way and say:

267
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:55,679
"It is linked to the quality of life,
to the sun-bell concept."

268
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:57,204
"To Switzerland. etc."

269
00:19:57,327 --> 00:20:00,327
and say:"Okay it could be
the place where we think more

270
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:06,765
about where are the services
that we would need to promote

271
00:20:06,818 --> 00:20:11,643
the industrial activities in
a way it should develop."

272
00:20:11,754 --> 00:20:15,329
So, I think the two issues,
the smart specialization strategies

273
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:18,600
to creating competences and
critical mass, and so on.

274
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:22,460
locally, and the new technologies,
the new way of communications 

275
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,814
opening up to
the rest of the  world.

276
00:20:24,948 --> 00:20:26,048
They go hand in hand.

277
00:20:26,176 --> 00:20:30,114
It's like you know, a machine
because you cannot have

278
00:20:30,236 --> 00:20:32,749
in Ticino a growing,
you cannot create

279
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,871
smart specialization
strategies without opening.

280
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:43,195
I think that Chino has did a lot
in the last fifteen, twenty years

281
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:47,802
in building up the so called
regional system of innovation

282
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,758
so we have a lot of
activities in the private sector

283
00:20:51,891 --> 00:20:57,441
in the public sector, in these
"Triple helix" approach

284
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:07,212
did really a lot, so we have some
seeds of these strategies

285
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,579
if you want, but we lack something.

286
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:15,022
Which is important and we
even talked too much about this.

287
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:21,132
That is the entrepreneurial culture
you know, transforming these seeds 

288
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:30,336
in new companies, in new startups or
other entrepreneurial activities. 

289
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:33,122
This is the issue.

290
00:21:33,254 --> 00:21:35,667
Now, and the next years,

291
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:38,961
because we built it up
out of many ingredients.

292
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:39,704
You know?

293
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:43,204
But now we have to transform
this in some entrepreneurial

294
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:48,522
activities, and then we'll
have some problems.

295
00:21:49,837 --> 00:21:52,387
I don't think we have to
mix up things.

296
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:56,524
I'm not saying that
the technology sectors

297
00:21:56,624 --> 00:22:00,099
are much more important
than the traditional.

298
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:04,130
When I said, enable technologies,
enable knowledge and everything

299
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,100
they are crossing.

300
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,511
We need new business models, in tourism,
in electronics, in manufacturing.

301
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:13,907
Everywhere, you know?

302
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:17,792
This kind of innovation, this is not
products and not only products

303
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:22,541
or processes, or pieces of,
we need those kind of things

304
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:25,665
crossing the sectors.

305
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:29,845
I think one other critical point,
not to repeat all the same

306
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:35,045
I think it's like a concept
of project.

307
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:40,329
So, I observe for a while that you
haven't nursed, you have public

308
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:45,960
ideas of how to promote things,
but it's very difficult in this

309
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:50,411
canton reality to talk about
projects so common efforts

310
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,539
with clear goals, and
different stakeholders

311
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:56,779
with a good management of project

312
00:22:57,492 --> 00:23:03,755
it's not the way of thinking here,
this I think he knows the challenge

313
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,820
better than anyone else nowadays.

314
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:12,756
"Okay, but let's define that within
three years, we want know whether

315
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:15,881
we do it or not" and if it's
working in this direction.

316
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,747
This idea of project, and
the management of

317
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,632
projects that we had, too much
in the world where everyone

318
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:28,606
has his or her own responsibilities,
the task, and it's very difficult to

319
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,485
it's rather based on
entrepreneurship, in the sense

320
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:37,034
of not having enough people
who feel like doing business

321
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:40,043
that I feel is a bit critical.

322
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:47,734
I got a lot out of the discussion
in two kinds of directions.

323
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:53,153
One is where, excuse me,
as a system approach

324
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:59,310
how is the innovative and
entrepreneurs system working

325
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:02,231
in Ticino, and I think
we saw a lot there

326
00:24:02,363 --> 00:24:06,975
that there are many good approaches
and a lot of development in the last

327
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:12,852
fifteen or twenty years, and there's
a lot of potential there, but it

328
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:19,949
seems that, you put it as seeds that
they are not ready to grow up yet.

329
00:24:20,112 --> 00:24:23,112
And we probably
need to grow it up.

330
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:28,888
I think that's one thing
I take out of the discussion

331
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:31,873
which is foremost smart
specialization, serves to

332
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:36,072
put it in the order, somewhere
on the bottom line, it's still not

333
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,854
a smart specialization strategy,
but they are areas which we could

334
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:41,726
look into more detail.

335
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:44,282
And the second thing I got
out of the discussion is more

336
00:24:44,437 --> 00:24:50,537
on the, let's say, project
or activities side, if you

337
00:24:50,671 --> 00:24:53,521
know the smart specialization
project it's not that the focus 

338
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,080
areas but it's more projects
in individual activities

339
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:00,582
supporting these focus areas.

340
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:04,403
So, like doing more for the human
capital attracting people back

341
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,560
to the region, linkage between
the universities and the firms

342
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:11,580
more, maybe it's only
an informational issue.

343
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:16,166
Be open to the outside world as well
form strategic partnerships.

344
00:25:16,664 --> 00:25:21,164
All these are individual measures
to improve the areas.

345
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:24,511
And as I put that we already see
that there's something missing

346
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:27,320
in between, where should we focus it?

347
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:30,431
And I thing it was very clear,
Ticino's a small region

348
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:34,107
and it can't be completely
self-sufficient, by itself

349
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:37,728
we need outside linkages,
still there is a local

350
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:40,859
or regional component
to the development.

351
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:46,495
And what I haven't really
got out of the discussion

352
00:25:46,627 --> 00:25:51,752
is which are the areas
it is worth focusing in?

353
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:57,324
Which are the entrepreneurial
approaches available 

354
00:25:57,713 --> 00:26:01,063
with the potential to
create a structure change

355
00:26:01,214 --> 00:26:05,626
which areas? Not sectors, we
discussed, mentioned a few sectors

356
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:11,238
but in more detail, where are, where
should we focus our activities on

357
00:26:11,345 --> 00:26:15,370
human capital building, attracting
people back, grow the seeds

358
00:26:15,483 --> 00:26:17,033
and so on, and so forth.

359
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,652
And also, I don't want to hear you
say that you don't want to get

360
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,883
this far, I would like to post
the end question to everybody.

361
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:28,760
Tell me that, two areas that you
think, Ticino and Ticino policy

362
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,601
and Ticino environment should

363
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:33,051
put a focus on in
the future to develop? 

364
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:36,478
Not on the sector level, but
a bit deeper than the sector level

365
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:39,353
like in tourism you, booking systems

366
00:26:39,476 --> 00:26:42,051
in pharmaceuticals,
new bio technology

367
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,897
in fashion new materials.

368
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:49,445
What areas do you think,
just tell me two of them

369
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:53,189
you think it might be
worth to put the focus in.

370
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,290
That would have been:"Here's
what we have, please work."

371
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,610
That is what consultants
always do, don't they?

372
00:27:04,547 --> 00:27:06,360
Just go back to the beginning, no?

373
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:12,402
My two areas are the key-enabled
technologies and as far as knowledge

374
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:15,491
competencies and everything
is concerned, the meat.

375
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:19,022
We need this, and this
is the crossing sector.

376
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,528
Never mind which kind of sector,
technological, traditional

377
00:27:23,646 --> 00:27:27,096
or everything, we need
those kind of things.

378
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,181
I would go back to services.

379
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:34,121
If you look, we are living in
a canton where young people

380
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:37,731
have parents who are either lawyers

381
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:42,050
if they want to go on,
or either lawyers or

382
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:46,027
they are "fiduciaire" or they are
very much in the service sector

383
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:47,653
aimed at the tourists.

384
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:53,522
And I think, to look for
a very similar way, to look for

385
00:27:53,663 --> 00:28:00,388
specific services that
support activities.

386
00:28:00,482 --> 00:28:05,157
So we have an University
with tourism, we have a lot of

387
00:28:05,273 --> 00:28:09,623
things going on now
around our master program

388
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:16,040
I think the idea of having, also,
new legal services probably that

389
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:28,189
can help for the new, let's say,
letting a company grow services

390
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:31,992
and so, traditional stuff, but more

391
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,623
tuned into the industrial
reality that we have.

392
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:42,869
And, probably also networking
and communications specialists.

393
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:47,170
Of course that's perfectly fair,
in the region like Ticino

394
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,009
must be opened and see
what happens, in a way

395
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:53,735
offering general services,
but if you think especially

396
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:57,088
of fabric investment,
and fabric investment in RND

397
00:28:57,212 --> 00:29:00,575
decides constraints on choices,
and these choices need

398
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:04,923
to be more or less aligned with what
they all set in the private economy 

399
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,220
of the, why is here, what
the economies know

400
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:11,017
that you have miss-alignments
in sectoral terms.

401
00:29:11,135 --> 00:29:15,860
And if I see from the competences,
which are developing in the public

402
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:20,020
RND, of course you can always
buy competences outside, but

403
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,850
there are at least two very big
clusters, one is around everything

404
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,535
which is around ICT and data,
and computation in this area

405
00:29:31,151 --> 00:29:34,151
where of course we have a big asset
having conventional super computer

406
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,929
center and we have all kinds of
competencies around that area

407
00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:44,658
and probably the other one is
around, you could call

408
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:50,154
"Pharma" but more, say,
Bio, we have a bio-medical

409
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:53,301
institute which is one of the top,
which is why, we now have

410
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:56,256
the Faculty of Bio-Medical science,
and we have some competencies

411
00:29:56,358 --> 00:29:58,208
with bio-materials so there must be

412
00:29:58,315 --> 00:30:01,540
a reflection also at
the terms of sectors

413
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:03,889
from the public policies,
without the clue

414
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:07,590
you have an office sector
which is not foreseen

415
00:30:07,695 --> 00:30:10,695
we should have lots because
of the multinational competency

416
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,536
if the company comes in Ticino
is so big that it changes completely

417
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,930
the size.

418
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,645
That's at least what I think.

419
00:30:19,794 --> 00:30:21,056
Okay!

420
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:25,541
Not to be fair,  i will give
my tow ideas as well.

421
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,564
I think.

422
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:34,470
They go in the same direction,
probably as what you said

423
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:40,211
because pharma and bio technology
would be one of my focus areas

424
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:43,334
as well, because there's a lot
of potential here, and there's a lot

425
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:46,431
of potential in Switzerland
to cooperate in that area

426
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:49,543
and it is an industry of the future,
so that's pretty straight forward.

427
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:53,380
And the other area I would
look in this combination

428
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:57,484
fashion competences
and ICT competence

429
00:30:57,633 --> 00:31:01,958
because I think that's an industry,
the fashion and all the background

430
00:31:02,048 --> 00:31:06,073
there of production. and also of
the selling, and stuff would be very

431
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,405
very much changed by the ICT
in the near future, and that's a big

432
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:14,698
chance for Ticino to grab
a big piece of that cake

433
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:19,130
because they have two competencies
in that direction, and I would have

434
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:21,926
that as one of the focus areas.

435
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,379
-Thanks.
-Thank you.
