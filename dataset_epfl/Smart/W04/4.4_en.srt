1
00:00:04,826 --> 00:00:07,018
Hello, and welcome everybody.

2
00:00:07,218 --> 00:00:08,843
In the last two weeks,

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:13,181
we discussed a lot the design
of a Smart Specialization Strategy

4
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,392
And how we can get operational with it.

5
00:00:15,643 --> 00:00:20,556
Also Smart Specialization
is a special strategic tool.

6
00:00:20,756 --> 00:00:24,343
Many of the issues we discussed are
relevant for any kind of

7
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,818
regional economic strategy.

8
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:30,631
For example, the strengths and
weaknesses that are summarized

9
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:33,681
in the smart analysis for a
region usually

10
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:37,706
should be the starting point for any
kind of regional economic strategy

11
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:40,906
and not only for Smart
Specialization Strategies.

12
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:46,493
But Smart Specialization is special
and has special properties,

13
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:50,456
which we might have forgotten a
little bit about in the last two weeks

14
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:54,806
with all that detailed discussion on
design and how to get operational.

15
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:58,006
Therefore, I think it is worth the
time to repeat

16
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:01,806
some of the most important
properties of Smart Specialization.

17
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:06,068
Again, keep in mind what we know
about operationality now.

18
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:12,216
The first point is the overall goal
of Smart Specialization.

19
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:17,141
It is to achieve structural change
in the economy.

20
00:01:17,966 --> 00:01:22,733
Smart Specialization has a lot to do
with innovation, with entrepreneurship,

21
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,933
with new developments, but it's not
the goal by itself

22
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,571
to have new developments, you always
have to keep in mind

23
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,771
that you want to achieve
structural change for your economy,

24
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,971
and not only to create new activities.

25
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,283
That might be part of
how to get operationally,

26
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:42,483
but the overall goal is
always the structural change.

27
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:48,206
One of the most important properties
of Smart Specialization is

28
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:51,118
that you have to make choices.

29
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:54,606
Smart Specialization forces
you to set your priorities.

30
00:01:54,806 --> 00:02:00,618
That is, because smart specialization
relies on achieving the scales

31
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,956
necessary to come
to structural change:

32
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:07,206
the scales in entrepreneurship,
the scales in innovation.

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,281
If you try to be best in class
in any kind of field,

34
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:15,631
in every possible area, then you'll
probably never achieve

35
00:02:15,831 --> 00:02:20,318
the necessary scales in any of these
to really arrive at structural change,

36
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:25,545
so you have to make your choices,
you have to focus on certain areas,

37
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:30,532
and rely on these areas for the
Smart Specialization Strategy.

38
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:34,534
Not making these choices
is also some kind of choice,

39
00:02:34,734 --> 00:02:38,109
to do everything, and that
won't be very fruitful.

40
00:02:38,309 --> 00:02:41,484
So, make your choices
and set your priorities.

41
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:46,869
It is important that you do your
choice on the right level.

42
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,069
It is not on an industry level,

43
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:54,825
for example, the tourism industry
or the investment goods industry,

44
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:58,025
are too broad for a Smart
Specialization Strategy.

45
00:02:58,225 --> 00:03:01,225
It's such a broad field that
you probably won't

46
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:04,425
arrive at the advantage of scale
in these fields,

47
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,287
and therefore not generate the
momentum to

48
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,762
really come to structural change.

49
00:03:09,962 --> 00:03:12,962
On the other hand, you should not
look at the project level,

50
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:15,700
this is too narrow to
really have the power,

51
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:19,937
even if you have scale within that
project, it's probably too narrow

52
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:23,349
to have the power to
achieve a structural change,

53
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,549
therefore, it is somewhere
in between.

54
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,749
Of course, an in-between
is not clearly defined,

55
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,180
and there's probably not
a right and a wrong,

56
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,517
but a continuum of better suited,
less suited priority areas,

57
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:42,680
but it is clear that it is somewhere
between the industry and project level.

58
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,880
If you take the above serious,

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,060
then the next property of Smart
Specialization is already clear.

60
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,972
But still it is very important
and I want to therefore point

61
00:03:57,172 --> 00:04:01,222
again to it: you need a sound base
of evidence to design

62
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:04,347
a Smart Specialization
Strategy successfully.

63
00:04:04,547 --> 00:04:08,844
If your choice is to not rely
on such a base of evidence,

64
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:13,544
then the chances that your choices
are not the best ones for your region

65
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:18,077
are much higher than when you
have such a good base of evidence.

66
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:22,327
Therefore, the analytical part of
designing such a strategy

67
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,527
is a crucial element of it.

68
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,727
But the base of evidence, the
economic structure,

69
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:31,927
the location factors, what is
available in the region,

70
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,502
is not all you need.

71
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:37,565
When you design a Smart
Specialization Strategy,

72
00:04:37,765 --> 00:04:40,765
it's not your task to find the new
innovation policy,

73
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:45,628
to do innovation yourself,
or even invent new technologies.

74
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:50,733
It is about combining existing
opportunities.

75
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,183
And to know the opportunities,

76
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:57,333
you not only need to base off
evidence, the economic side,

77
00:04:57,558 --> 00:05:01,370
but also you need to know
the entrepreneurial resources

78
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,095
available in your region.

79
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:07,320
They might be from the university
area, or innovation or research labs,

80
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:11,461
there might be startups or
entrepreneurs active in your region.

81
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:16,073
All these resources should be applied
in a Smart Specialization Strategy,

82
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:19,928
and the goal is to combine them
in such a way that

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,051
you achieve the scales necessary
to come

84
00:05:24,264 --> 00:05:26,964
to our overall goal
of structural change.

85
00:05:27,164 --> 00:05:31,468
Within a Smart Specialization
Strategy, you make choices.

86
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:35,381
Choices can be right or wrong,
there's always a risk.

87
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:38,581
Of course you should make
well-informed choices,

88
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,018
this is what the two above
properties are from,

89
00:05:41,218 --> 00:05:44,218
the base of evidence and the
entrepreneurial activities.

90
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,243
But still, you won't have all
information you might need

91
00:05:48,443 --> 00:05:51,056
for the best choice, for the
optimal choice.

92
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:53,968
And there will be wrong choices.

93
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:57,856
Therefore it is important that you
understand Smart Specialization,

94
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:01,056
not only as using
entrepreneurial activities,

95
00:06:01,256 --> 00:06:03,581
but as an entrepreneurial
process itself.

96
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:06,781
That's what we call the
entrepreneurial discovery process.

97
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:12,589
This also implies that priority areas
are not there forever.

98
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,789
In a certain time,
maybe five years, maybe ten years,

99
00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:19,806
but in a certain time, you should
define, within your strategy,

100
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,006
these priority areas either
should  be successful,

101
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:27,931
entrepreneurially successful,
and then have grown so much,

102
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:31,131
and led to structural change, that
they're not any more part

103
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:33,621
of a Smart Specialization,
but, if necessary,

104
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:36,821
might be supported
by other kinds of policies,

105
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,021
or, they haven't achieved that goal.

106
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,858
Then after a certain time it's not
worth following that path anymore,

107
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,696
and you should probably
discard them.

108
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:49,421
Finally, there's the question for
which region

109
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:52,409
smart Specialization Strategy
is appropriate.

110
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:55,871
It is very easy, because we
talk about entrepreneurship,

111
00:06:56,071 --> 00:06:59,159
and innovation, to think for a region
that's a high tech industry,

112
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:03,411
say, very good in ICT or in
internet of things,

113
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:07,491
To define a Smart
Specialization Strategy.

114
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,687
But for many other regions, it's not
that straightforward

115
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:13,887
because they do not have
the ability to be top in class

116
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:16,250
in these high tech areas.

117
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,637
Still, the thinking of Smart
Specialization,

118
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,487
the concept and the strategy
building,

119
00:07:21,687 --> 00:07:23,864
is valid for these kinds of regions
as well,

120
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:27,101
it's just about combining the
existing economic structure

121
00:07:27,326 --> 00:07:30,801
with applying the new technologies
to the existing industry,

122
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,798
the existing assets in the region,

123
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,410
which will lead to
successful priority areas.

124
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,610
Also, the overall goal
is structural change.

125
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,148
So is a Smart Specialization strategy
only good for regions

126
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,010
which really indeed need a
structural change?

127
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,466
No. Structural change is something
which happens always,

128
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,016
and even a successful region

129
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:56,403
can profit from more
structural change,

130
00:07:56,591 --> 00:08:00,416
towards more competitive, to higher
productive industries.

131
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:03,616
So the thinking of Smart
Specialization, the concept,

132
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,641
can help any kind of region,

133
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,866
regardless of their focus areas,

134
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,116
regardless of their economic
structure,

135
00:08:11,316 --> 00:08:13,453
and regardless of their
development stage.

136
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:18,539
It is a way to improve the economy,
regardless where you start from.

137
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:22,364
Now from these properties,

138
00:08:22,564 --> 00:08:25,564
what can we derive to the process

139
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:29,587
how to design a Smart Specialization
Strategy from  that?

140
00:08:29,787 --> 00:08:34,637
First of all, it should be a
structured process.

141
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:39,953
It has a lot of elements, a lot
of demanding elements actually,

142
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,690
and so if you don't
structure the process up ahead,

143
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,817
it will probably be very difficult
to reach the best solution.

144
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:53,488
Secondly, it involves many
people, many stakeholders.

145
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:56,688
We look at the economic structure,
we have the government,

146
00:08:56,888 --> 00:09:00,825
the people who define the Smart
Specialization Strategy,

147
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,900
you also need the entrepreneurial
resources,

148
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:06,700
so there are many people,
many stakeholders involved,

149
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,063
and the process should reflect that.
Involve the stakeholders,

150
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:12,875
give responsibility to them,

151
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:16,300
and make them part of your
Smart specialization Strategy.

152
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:22,460
Finally, the strategy
needs evidence and data.

153
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,509
We discussed that often enough.

154
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:28,434
Now as the process
has to be structured,

155
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,247
there are certain elements which,
in our opinion

156
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:34,968
are very important to be part
of such a structuring.

157
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:39,581
The first element of the five
we identified,

158
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:42,381
the first element is
to define the region.

159
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:46,568
It is that everybody knows for
which region, for which definition,

160
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,806
the strategy should work.

161
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,618
And it also creates commitment
towards this region,

162
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,942
and towards the strategy therefore.

163
00:09:54,142 --> 00:09:56,592
Then we have two analytical blocks.

164
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,792
The one is the base of evidence, the
economic structure,

165
00:09:59,992 --> 00:10:02,992
the assets we can build on,
the location quality,

166
00:10:03,192 --> 00:10:06,192
the competitiveness
of the industries.

167
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:09,392
On the other side we have the
entrepreneurial resources.

168
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:14,792
Entrepreneurs, startup companies,
Innovation, universities,

169
00:10:14,992 --> 00:10:16,929
all these kinds of players.

170
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:20,797
Both sides have to be analyzed,
detailed,

171
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:23,047
and put together for the strategy.

172
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:26,882
Then it is very important
to make choices,

173
00:10:27,082 --> 00:10:30,082
and this is by choosing
your priority areas.

174
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:34,932
There should be more than one, but
there should not be too many,

175
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:37,544
depending of course on
the size of the region,

176
00:10:37,744 --> 00:10:40,482
of the potential you have
to follow such a strategy,

177
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,932
there can be a few
more or a few less.

178
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:46,982
And finally, with the
thinking of entrepreneurship,

179
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:49,635
also for the
Smart Specialization Strategy,

180
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:52,347
not only applying it
in the strategy,

181
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:56,135
But also thinking of the whole
process as an entrepreneurial process.

182
00:10:56,335 --> 00:11:00,704
You must monitor,
evaluate, and, if necessary,

183
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:04,592
adapt your strategy. It's not
a one-off for all times,

184
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:07,792
but do that.
So these are the five steps.

185
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,507
Define your region,

186
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,225
analyze your economic structure,

187
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:16,938
assess the entrepreneurial activities
Available in your region,

188
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:19,375
choose priority areas,

189
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:23,963
and finally, Monitor and evaluate
the development of your strategy.

190
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:28,490
Now as the base of evidence is one
of the central elements

191
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,515
of designing a Smart
Specialization Strategy,

192
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:34,715
we want to have a look in a
bit more detail in this again.

193
00:11:34,915 --> 00:11:39,802
And we identified six steps
which might be useful

194
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:44,791
to generate or to achieve
that base of evidence.

195
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:47,991
The first step is the
economic performance,

196
00:11:48,191 --> 00:11:53,291
where does the region come from,
What has been achieved in history?

197
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,616
What are the starting
positions here?

198
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,816
Then, second, we will look where we
are at the moment.

199
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:03,478
What are our location qualities?

200
00:12:03,678 --> 00:12:06,481
For what kind of activities
is the region attractive?

201
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:09,681
For other kinds it might
be less attractive.

202
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:12,506
Third, we look at the
industry structure,

203
00:12:12,719 --> 00:12:16,081
in particular about the
competitiveness of these industries.

204
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:21,656
Can they compete on a global base,
or are they more local oriented?

205
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:23,849
What are their properties?

206
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:29,668
Now all these three steps are
usually done in a comparing mode.

207
00:12:29,868 --> 00:12:34,036
You look at your relative position
compared to other regions,

208
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:35,797
to other economies.

209
00:12:35,997 --> 00:12:40,970
Particularly with competition that
is just at the core of the concept.

210
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:44,170
But we do need a more detailed
analysis,

211
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,495
a step further into
details within the region,

212
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:51,831
and that is the fourth step here,
we really look into the region,

213
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:54,169
Where are the
industrial focus areas?

214
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,369
Specifically, in more detail, where
are clusters,

215
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,882
and what is the region's
innovation system,

216
00:13:00,082 --> 00:13:02,195
which we can build on?

217
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:05,395
Then in the next step
we broaden our view again.

218
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:09,132
We look at the global megatrends
and general purpose technologies.

219
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:13,495
These are development traits that are
the same for all types of regions.

220
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:16,145
The general purpose
technologies like ICT,

221
00:13:16,345 --> 00:13:18,495
or the digitization of the economy,

222
00:13:18,695 --> 00:13:23,779
or megatrends like aging, all
regions are hit by that,

223
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:26,979
or influenced by that,
not necessarily hit.

224
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,894
But every region is differently
exposed to these trends,

225
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:33,382
and can make different use of them.

226
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,582
So therefore, it's not only knowing
these trends,

227
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:41,062
but also analyzing them,
what do they mean for my region,

228
00:13:41,262 --> 00:13:44,262
given all the above
information we already have?

229
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:48,884
And finally, the sixth step, and
quite important,

230
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,559
is to bring all that
information together.

231
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:54,422
Many of these informations
influence each other,

232
00:13:54,622 --> 00:13:57,034
and we need to have a
complete overview of them,

233
00:13:57,234 --> 00:13:59,747
and that's what we do
with a SWOT analysis,

234
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:03,197
an analysis of strengths,
weaknesses, chances, and risks.

235
00:14:03,397 --> 00:14:08,190
Now that sounds like a very complicated
process, and indeed it is.

236
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,028
It is not easy to come to a
Smart Specialization Strategy,

237
00:14:12,228 --> 00:14:15,553
particularly not a good Smart
Specialization Strategy.

238
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,266
But don't worry too much.

239
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:23,558
One of the properties of Smart
Specialization is

240
00:14:23,758 --> 00:14:26,261
the entrepreneurial thinking.

241
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:31,777
Just try, make the best choices you can
given the information you have.

242
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:36,614
Follow them up, monitor them, and,
if necessary, adapt them.

243
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,089
And with that, it will work.

244
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:42,814
So, don't worry.
Think entrepreneurial.

245
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,852
Thank you.
