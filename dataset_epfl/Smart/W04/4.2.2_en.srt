1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome everybody.
Let's have a look at

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,910
monitoring and evaluation.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,350
Although it is not really
part of a strategy design

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,730
process and often happens
only after the strategy has to

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:25,120
be defined it is a crucial
element for a successful strategy.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,490
But often it's not really
taken seriously and that might

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,140
be due for two reasons.

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,190
The first I already
mentioned because it only starts

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,490
after the strategy is
defined, in some cases even after

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,030
the program has been finished,
but that, of course, is an error.

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,490
You should have evaluation
and monitoring right from the

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,850
beginning of the
definition of strategy.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll come back to that in a minute.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,190
Secondly, it is a very
challenging task and sometimes, it

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,060
seems to be too
challenging to really follow it up.

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,480
But as Roderic puts it very
nicely, it is not because the

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,000
application of the most
rigid and academically recognised

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,350
methods is not possible
that all attempts of assessment

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,580
should be abandoned.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,150
Clearly here it's stated
that we should assess even if we

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,630
do it not optimally.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,670
One of the big challenges
the identification of the

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,800
effects of a program or put
in other words, the causality

24
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,510
of these effects, and again
Roderick gives a hint to us

25
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,080
how we can solve at
least partly this problem.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,950
We must at least establish
ex ante clear benchmark and criteria

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,860
for success and for failure
at the various levels of the

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,820
strategy.

29
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,480
The definition of what is a
success and what is a failure

30
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,060
might help afterwards to
identify, not the causality

31
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,900
itself but the effect of the program.

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,960
Let's have a quick view on
a couple of fundamentals on

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,790
monitoring and evaluation.

34
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,440
What is the purpose of evaluation?

35
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,260
Actually we talked in
the last video a lot about

36
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,770
flexibility, and during the
complete online course, we

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,130
talk a lot about entrepreneurial
discovery and the entrepreneurial process.

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,430
But without information
both the flexibility and

39
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,940
entrepreneurial process won't work.

40
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,410
The monitoring and
evaluation is the source of the

41
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,950
information which we need to
really make these processes work.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,180
A second fundamental issue
is that it is part of building

43
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,070
this strategy or
designing the strategy to keep

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,790
monitoring and evaluation in mind.

45
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,580
That's what also
Roderick already told us.

46
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,040
You have to define
clearly the objectives of your

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,630
strategy: what do
you want to achieve?

48
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,000
What are the goals?

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,580
They must be explicitly clear.

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,580
And also already
through the strategy designing

51
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,060
process you should define
the metrics, how you will

52
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,280
measure success or
failure in your objectives.

53
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,360
That helps you to define
more clearly your strategy when

54
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,490
you have to think
about what the metrics are.

55
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,160
So you have to define the
objective of the program.

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,230
You have to define the
metrics how to measure the success

57
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,030
or failure of these
objectives, and last not least you

58
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,000
have to define the data
generation process: where do you

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,950
get the data from for the
metrics so that you have the

60
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,150
necessary data at the
end available when you do

61
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,140
evaluation and monitoring?

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,700
Evaluation and

63
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,520
monitoring have to be
flexible, that's the third

64
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,550
fundamental issue. The
strategy itself is a very

65
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,400
flexible tool, it can have
a lot of different ways how

66
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,700
the strategy might work,
you a lot of different areas

67
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,390
where it may apply to and
therefore also the evaluation

68
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,960
has to follow up that differences.

69
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,890
It's not a one size fits
all once more, but you have to

70
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,590
adapt the evaluation
process to your strategy.

71
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,670
There is a question often
raised if the evaluation is to

72
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,220
be quantitative or only qualitative.

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,080
But actually it's qualitative and
quantitative which you should follow.

74
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,240
Some things can only be
defined qualitatively or measured

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,420
or observed qualitatively,
but you also need quantitative

76
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,580
measures wherever possible
because it provides more information.

77
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,840
We already defined four
steps of monitoring or

78
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,000
evaluation when we
defined the process to build a

79
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,260
strategy, so that it's clear
right from the beginning on

80
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,340
which points you have to
take measurements and controls.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,540
Let's go through these four
in a bit more detail and look

82
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,170
for examples for each of them.

83
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,880
The first stage in the
monitoring process is what we call

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,310
the Strategic profile of
the region evaluation, here we

85
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,360
control particularly if the
priority areas chosen are the right ones.

86
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,950
Of course they are the
result from an extended analysis

87
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,000
of the base of evidence and
entrepreneurial resources but

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,960
still there might
be changes necessary.

89
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,400
It might be necessary that
changes are due to a changing

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,360
world, that's always
changing and it might be you need

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,870
new other priority areas.

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,580
It might also be due to
the results of the monitoring

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,850
evaluation of the other
stages which should then feed

94
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,890
back into the priority areas
and at some point might tell

95
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,190
that one or another priority
area should not be followed anymore.

96
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,440
There's also a nice
little test to the priority

97
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,120
areas which we like
to apply in this stage.

98
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,610
We call it the x test and
the ones of you who speak

99
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,410
German would know it from
the saying of x beliebig why we

100
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,920
call it the x test.

101
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,720
It takes your strategy,
your priority areas and the

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,080
reasoning behind them and
then replaces the name of your

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,360
region with another region.

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,110
And if you do that and the
strategy still sounds sensible

105
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,710
then it's probably not
define a precise enough for your

106
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,720
region but follows too
much the general trends.

107
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,540
In that part, this kind of
evaluation, of course, starts

108
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,010
immediately after defining
the priority areas but is a

109
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,000
continuous process.

110
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,750
The strategy actually is
never finished it's a rolling

111
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,370
process or rolling a
strategy and priority areas might

112
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,700
change at any point in time.

113
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,690
This notion of the rolling
strategy shows that this is

114
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,180
not really an evaluation or
an ex post evaluation but is a kind

115
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,010
of a rethinking of the
strategy and choices you did.

116
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,030
Therefore also the notion of
causality problems which we

117
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,110
discussed above is no issue
here, there is no causality

118
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,890
in that case but we just
evaluate if we had the right

119
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:45,510
process to come to the
same results of the strategic

120
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,600
process, not of the outcome
of strategy implementation.

121
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,190
The results of the strategy
implementation, a part of the

122
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,470
second stage of the
evaluation and monitoring process,

123
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,510
here we look at the classical
projects and activities evaluation.

124
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,660
This is something which is
very usual and there is a big

125
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,530
literature, we don't need
to discuss that a lot, there

126
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,560
are typically questions
asked like finances and

127
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,000
accounting all right in the
programs, what kind of

128
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,660
activities are there,
monitored activities achieved

129
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,630
through the programs,
like for example meetings or

130
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,300
contacts made,
webpages or information, tools

131
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,050
produced, things like that,
and also the output of the

132
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,930
program, so counting how
much contacts you reached, how

133
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,130
many meetings were held, how
many people you reached, or

134
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,060
with patents or
publications, they can give you

135
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,760
information on the outcomes.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,930
But, of course, this is not
the objective of the smart

137
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,660
specialisation strategy,
it's not meetings or webpages

138
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,860
or contacts which you
should count, we have other

139
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,370
objectives, but they
provide you good information on if

140
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,350
the projects and
activities work right.

141
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,170
The method here is often
self-reporting either by the

142
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,480
management of the program
or by the participants of the

143
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,150
programs themselves, and the
measurements can be defined

144
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,680
fairly easily because
this information is readily

145
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,880
available, and causality is
not a big issue because there's

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,460
a direct link to
between program and outcome so

147
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,000
causality is rather clear here.

148
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,000
But that's not the end, also
many evaluations of programs

149
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,810
and of strategies stop
at that point, this is not

150
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,360
specialisation strategy,
we have more to monitor.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,430
The third stage of the
monitoring process is

152
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,470
what we call the
critical mass evaluation.

153
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,160
As we recall by now very
well I'm sure, is that critical

154
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,690
mass is an aim of the smart
specialisation strategy, to

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,230
achieve structured change in
the economy in the end, and

156
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,910
we should try to measure
these steps to our overall

157
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,080
objective, the
critical mass generation.

158
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,470
Evaluating the critical mass
is much more difficult than

159
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,740
evaluation for
example of the project side.

160
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,290
While in a project, we have
a relatively clear linkage of

161
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,880
causality between outcome
and project imputs, it's much

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,340
weaker on the critical mass side.

163
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,030
But if you think about
critical mass as building up

164
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,070
capacity, we can also
find indicators which help us

165
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,020
measure that. Although the
causal link might be weaker,

166
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:55,040
we still see if the capacity
changes in the region or not.

167
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,660
Now how can we measure capacity?

168
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,790
That is not really
straightforward and it is not a

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,550
well-established way to
measure it, but there are a

170
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,310
couple of ideas
around how to do that.

171
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,790
But again depending on
your strategy and the focus of

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,820
your strategy, there might
be different ways you measure

173
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,260
the capacity change in your
region to be achieved by the

174
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,680
strategy but maybe the
examples I have gives you an idea

175
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,890
how that could be done.

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,690
One way of capacity is
building networks, the closer you've

177
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,690
worked together that is
well established higher your

178
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,490
output is particularly in
a knowledge economy or a

179
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,360
knowledge generation
process. You have actually

180
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,440
increasing economies of scale here.

181
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,940
And there are a couple of tools to
measure network and network development.

182
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:52,780
One example is you take
social platforms, business

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,240
platforms like LinkedIn
or Xing in Germany or other

184
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,560
platforms available around
the world and measure how many

185
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,430
people are taking part of
that program in particular, maybe

186
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,080
of the profession or in the
jobs which are interesting

187
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,680
for you as much smart specialisation
strategy is this increasing

188
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:15,600
how active are they on the
platforms and measurements

189
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,660
like that, that could
give you an indication if the

190
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,850
network capacity increases.

191
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,290
The generation of knowledge,
the reliability of knowledge

192
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:28,250
in the region is also a
fundamental issue of capacities.

193
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,190
And again we look here at
indicators or we can look here

194
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,480
at indicators depending on
your precise strategy which

195
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,840
are already well-known.
Patents can be such an

196
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,430
indicator, papers in
publications can be another one but

197
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,320
trademarks, new products
can be further indicators.

198
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,310
All the start-up companies
are a kind of a knowledge

199
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,670
generation and can be
counted in here as well.

200
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,620
A further issue increasing
the capacity in the region

201
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,030
might be through building
trust and then in the next step

202
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,740
forming cooperations.

203
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,940
And cooperations can be
quite well measured, there are

204
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,780
many different ways
to really look at them.

205
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,390
Again it could be
patents for example, co-patents

206
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,060
between two companies or
co-patents between an academic

207
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,840
institution and the
company might be measurement for

208
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,310
cooperations or
increased corporation.

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,340
Or you might look at the
subsidised project which is

210
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,270
often by definition involves
more than one player and if

211
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,110
they increase in size or in number.

212
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,230
And there are many other possibilities
(all of the above discussed ones)

213
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,540
for examples of the social networks
can also show up of cooperations.

214
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,750
You can also follow people
who do social networks when

215
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,940
they work for different
cooperations that could be

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,410
another issue increasing
the capacity in the region.

217
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,920
Now as these examples
already show, this is not the

218
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,390
measurement of the capacity
building or the measurement

219
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,520
of the critical in mass, this
is not a single number away

220
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,860
you can put everything in.

221
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,180
You need to understand
the system and then we

222
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,760
find the measures
which reflect that system.

223
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:30,270
Therefore it is not only an
evaluation ex ante but the

224
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,880
information you gather here
are also an important steering

225
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,910
instrument for the
implementation of your strategy and

226
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,660
actually even to go back to
the strategy itself that was

227
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,780
the first part of the
evaluation process there, strategic

228
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,000
profile of the region.

229
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,900
To do so, of course, you
need indicators which are timely

230
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,570
available, not with a long
delay only but the ones we

231
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,040
discussed in the last few
minutes are usually quite

232
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,180
quickly available and
so you can use them for

233
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:09,890
monitoring and evaluation just as
well as for steering your strategy.

234
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,680
With the fourth stage of
the monitoring process we are

235
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,310
actually getting close to
the core objective of this

236
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:20,100
smart specialisation strategy.

237
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,810
We want to achieve
structural change in the economy, we

238
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,860
want to improve the
development of the economy.

239
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,210
Now the objectives here are
rather clear and they clearly

240
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,090
relate to measurement as well.

241
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,540
For example, you want to
generate jobs or maybe not just

242
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,130
jobs but usually sustainable
jobs, jobs with a future and

243
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,650
well-paid jobs. At all
this can be measured easily.

244
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,160
Our objective is to
rise a new industry or to

245
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,650
re rise an old one.

246
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,550
Again this can be easily measured.

247
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,100
You might also aim the
shifting focus of an industry for

248
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,590
more domestic to an
international export

249
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,380
player or from a lower
part, technology part of the

250
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,600
industry to the high-tech part.

251
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,130
Again measurement is
straightforward here.

252
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:19,910
Ultimately we want to
increase the competitiveness,

253
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,400
the international
competitiveness of the industries in

254
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,400
the regions of the program and
again here are measurements available.

255
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,340
We discussed all these
kinds of measures when we

256
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:34,420
discussed the base of
evidence analysis and the same

257
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,680
information can be used again here.

258
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,000
But there is, of course, a
big but to it otherwise it

259
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,480
would be too easy, the
causality between the program

260
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,340
and the objectives or the
measurements are very weak if

261
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,790
there are hardly at all, it
can't prove the causality.

262
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,930
Still we should monitor and
evaluate that probably best

263
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,880
done in a benchmarking
setting that we at least allow for

264
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,930
common trends to be filtered
and for overall cyclical

265
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,280
effects to be filtered and
not put through the project

266
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,130
that allows us to
elevate the overall structural

267
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,140
change.

268
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,800
Now we went through the
four stages of the measurement

269
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,770
process individually and we
saw also they differ a lot

270
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,420
for each stage it is
possible to find the right

271
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,730
measurement and to do
monitoring and evaluation.

272
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,610
Of course in some cases we
need to be creative to find

273
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,840
the right measurements
and the measurement has been

274
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,230
adapted to the individual
strategy but it is possible to

275
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,000
monitor and evaluate all of this.

276
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,490
But there's a note of
cautionary necessary.

277
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,130
We get what we measure.

278
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,350
When we define a measurement
we give incentive to program

279
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,640
implementers to program managers and
to people participating in the program.

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,000
If they are evaluated for
their success or failure that

281
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,780
will be done by the
measurement not by the objectives.

282
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,190
And therefore they tend to
maximise the measurements and

283
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,050
at least possibly
ignore the objectives.

284
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,380
That means you need to
define the measurement very

285
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,540
carefully so that
measurement and objectives are showed

286
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,530
going in the same
direction and we have to define the

287
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:37,370
measurement completely,
meaning that all objective are

288
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,370
part of the measurement.

289
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,530
For example, if the
focus the measurement on only

290
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:47,510
projects and activities
evaluation like output of a

291
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,280
program or activity in
the program or the correct

292
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,280
accounting then the
program managers or the strategy

293
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,670
managers will focus on
that as well and not look that

294
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,810
much at the long-term
objective of the program which is

295
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,950
actually what is the
objective of smart specialisation is

296
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:11,170
not successful programs but
it's critical mass and then

297
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,900
structural change. And it
might be missed by defining too

298
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,570
much evaluation in the short term
and not enough in the long term.

299
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,920
That has to be carefully
defined but also completely

300
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,200
defined the measurement.
It's very important to take the

301
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,610
four steps of the
evaluation process seriously and not

302
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,660
stop after the
second or the third one.

303
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,660
Summing up on the
monitoring and evaluation process, we

304
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,520
looked at the four stages of
the process individually and

305
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,420
discussed them. Also they
differ from each other quite a

306
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,530
bit, in the methods, in the
metrics and in their causality

307
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:57,270
towards the program still
all of them are essential for

308
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,310
the smart specialisation strategy.

309
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,000
One thing we haven't
discussed yet is the timing between

310
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,950
them because that also
varies between the different

311
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,030
stages of the monitoring.
The first step to a strategic

312
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,670
profile actually takes
place already throughout the

313
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,510
definition of the strategy
and then continues through the

314
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,240
whole period the
strategy is evaluated.

315
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,560
So it's probably
appropriate to say after one year you

316
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,440
have the first answer first
evaluation result on the strategic profile.

317
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,930
For the project stage of
the evaluation it takes some

318
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,030
more time, project has to
be defined, implemented and

319
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,910
started before you
can start evaluating.

320
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,380
So after two to three years
you probably have first result.

321
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,240
But, of course, it doesn't
mean that you have to wait two

322
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,480
to three years to start to
monitoring and evaluation process.

323
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,530
Quite the opposite you
should plan right from the

324
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,140
beginning and start right
away with the strategy to

325
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,880
collect the necessary data.

326
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,090
But the first results, the
first judgement can probably

327
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,760
made of two or three years.

328
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,170
Even more time it takes
naturally to evaluate to new

329
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,750
activities and the
generation of critical mass or how we

330
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,700
put it the capacity
building in the region.

331
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,190
As many different
programs and activities a project

332
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,460
should contribute to that
it's probably fair to say after

333
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,800
three to five years you
might be able to see first

334
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,200
results not much earlier.

335
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,000
And then the overall
objective, the structural change

336
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,510
even takes more time five
to eight years, is probably

337
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,010
appropriate here to really
have first judgement on the

338
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,200
overall success of the strategy.

339
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:55,380
Now monitoring and
evaluation is crucial and also it only

340
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,820
takes place later on and
you only get on those, much

341
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,180
later after starting the
strategy you should think right

342
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,790
from the beginning and
you define your strategy.

343
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,920
For one reason that the
measurements fit the objectives

344
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,940
of the strategy perfectly
for the other reasons that you

345
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,000
gather the necessary data
to really do the evaluations

346
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,290
and define the data generation
process right from the beginning.

347
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,880
Therefore evaluation and
monitoring is one topic when

348
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,310
defining a strategy
also it's done on later.

349
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,640
Thank you very much
and see you again.
