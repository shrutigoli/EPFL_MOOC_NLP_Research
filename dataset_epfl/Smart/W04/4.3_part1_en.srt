00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:05,262
Hello. Welcome.

2
00:00:05,474 --> 00:00:06,474
I'm Kevin Morgan

3
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:08,011
from Cardiff University.

4
00:00:08,211 --> 00:00:10,411
I'm Professor of
Governance and Development

5
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:11,586
of the University,

6
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:13,461
as well as
the Dean of Engagement.

7
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:14,961
That means
I'm responsible

8
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:17,074
for the
University's relationships

9
00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:18,111
with government,

10
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,111
business,

11
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:20,286
and civil society,

12
00:00:20,323 --> 00:00:21,324
organizations

13
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,349
I say that

14
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:23,774
because
I'm trying to do

15
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:25,374
in my everyday life

16
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:27,174
what I'm talking about

17
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:28,199
this morning.

18
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:29,061
So, ah,

19
00:00:29,186 --> 00:00:29,824
this is what

20
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:30,899
I want to talk about:

21
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:32,799
I want to talk about
the Smart State

22
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:34,349
By which I mean

23
00:00:34,549 --> 00:00:35,574
Good government

24
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,936
or enlightened
public policy.

25
00:00:38,136 --> 00:00:39,611
And I wanted to do
three things:

26
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:40,636
I want to look at

27
00:00:40,836 --> 00:00:41,898
debates on the state.

28
00:00:42,098 --> 00:00:42,886
I want to look at

29
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,336
key aspects of
the smart state.

30
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:46,373
And I'll conclude

31
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:47,473
by looking at some

32
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:48,598
good examples

33
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,348
from regions
around Europe.

34
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:53,211
smart specialisation policy

35
00:00:54,123 --> 00:00:55,273
is the most ambitious

36
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,923
regional innovation policy

37
00:00:57,048 --> 00:00:57,873
ever introduced

38
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,211
anywhere in the world.

39
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:00,811
But it makes

40
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:03,311
two major presumptions

41
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:04,511
which are not often

42
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,723
explicitly made.

43
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:08,561
The first presumption

44
00:01:09,023 --> 00:01:10,886
is a political presumption.

45
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:12,336
And it presumes that

46
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:13,886
regional elites

47
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,573
really want to innovate.

48
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,373
But in actual fact

49
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,311
they may simply

50
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,011
want to retain control

51
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,723
or simply maintain

52
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,898
the status quo.

53
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,386
The second major presumption:

54
00:01:25,798 --> 00:01:27,211
Is that the state

55
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:29,673
and its public sector agencies

56
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,098
are really competent

57
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,922
to meet the challenge

58
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,535
of smart specialisation.

59
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:36,772
Both these presumptions

60
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:37,960
really need

61
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,210
to be scrutinized

62
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,660
very, very carefully.

63
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,047
My first theme is about

64
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:44,560
debates on the state

65
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,060
And

66
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,435
there's a certain state discourse

67
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,635
about the role of the state

68
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:52,085
in economic development.

69
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,610
It is almost impossible

70
00:01:54,684 --> 00:01:56,747
- as Will Hutton shows here -

71
00:01:56,796 --> 00:01:58,160
"It's almost impossible

72
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,010
to think straight about the state

73
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:01,522
without assuming that

74
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:02,822
we have to shrink it,

75
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:03,997
fragment it,

76
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,485
or privatise it."

77
00:02:05,947 --> 00:02:07,222
And this discourse

78
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,185
is especially prominent

79
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,772
in certain countries,

80
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:12,997
like the United States of America

81
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:14,360
or the United Kingdom,

82
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:15,285
for example.

83
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,710
But it is true in varying degrees

84
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,722
in many countries

85
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,097
around the world.

86
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:22,959
And we need to challenge

87
00:02:23,034 --> 00:02:25,060
this state discourse.

88
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,647
Where does it come from?

89
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,897
I think the state discourse

90
00:02:29,097 --> 00:02:30,622
was just critical of the state.

91
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:32,172
It takes a very negative

92
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:33,510
view of the state,

93
00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:35,535
really stems

94
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:36,922
from the dominance

95
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:38,335
of neoliberal ideology.

96
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:41,535
And while some of that ideology

97
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:42,922
is very crude,

98
00:02:43,472 --> 00:02:44,360
for example,

99
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,747
less State

100
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:47,298
equals more market,

101
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:48,335
for example.

102
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:49,397
That's very crude.

103
00:02:49,597 --> 00:02:51,722
I think there is a very serious

104
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,947
philosophy behind some

105
00:02:54,147 --> 00:02:56,260
of the neoliberal criticisms

106
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,422
of the state.

107
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:59,635
And these...theories

108
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,060
these critical theories

109
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:02,548
stem originally from

110
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,173
the work of Friedrich Hayek,

111
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,323
who was a very, very serious

112
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:08,285
...and sophisticated...

113
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:10,235
...economic theorist.

114
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,610
And these insights from Hayek's

115
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,835
that are used today

116
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,085
by neo-liberal critics of the State,

117
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,385
boiled down to two things.

118
00:03:18,585 --> 00:03:19,573
First of all,

119
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:20,973
they maintain

120
00:03:21,173 --> 00:03:23,048
that industrial policy

121
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:24,635
should largely by avoided.

122
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,747
Why?

123
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,760
Because industrial policy...

124
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,223
...encourages firms

125
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:31,348
to engage in rent seeking.

126
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:32,798
Or to seek

127
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:35,035
special privileges from the state.

128
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,898
For example, state subsidies.

129
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,348
When they should be seeking
to innovate.

130
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:41,735
Rather than to engage
in rent seeking.

131
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,473
And therefore
industrial policy

132
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,773
should be avoided

133
00:03:45,035 --> 00:03:46,973
and picking winners
should be avoided

134
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:48,373
Because the state

135
00:03:48,523 --> 00:03:50,273
creates perverse incentives

136
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:51,423
for firms.

137
00:03:51,885 --> 00:03:54,510
And the second...criticism

138
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,198
that stems from Hayek's work,
I think,

139
00:03:57,398 --> 00:04:00,648
is about the informational
capacity of the state.

140
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:03,198
The State can never be
a surrogate,

141
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:05,498
can never be a substitute,
in other words

142
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:07,085
for the decentralized

143
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:09,798
information processing capacity

144
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,698
of markets.

145
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:12,473
And therefore,

146
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:14,698
these two assumptions together

147
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:16,285
have boiled down

148
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:17,760
to a neoliberal critique

149
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,685
of the State

150
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,459
which often suggests
to policy makers

151
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,585
that the public sector is bad.

152
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:28,335
While the private sector is good.

153
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,535
And we need to get beyond

154
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,735
that simple binary antithesis.

155
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,948
In recent years,

156
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,973
there has been a number

157
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:40,135
...of interesting...critiques

158
00:04:40,335 --> 00:04:42,448
of this neoliberal criticism.

159
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,298
A very interesting one

160
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,435
comes from Mariana Mazzucato

161
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:49,548
who wrote a very stimulating book

162
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,623
called "The Entrepreneurial State".

163
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,210
In this book,

164
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:55,123
Mazzucato tries to change

165
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,735
the way we think

166
00:04:56,835 --> 00:04:58,760
and talk about the state.

167
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:00,748
To try to paint the state

168
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,185
in a positive light

169
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,710
rather than a purely negative light.

170
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:06,448
She shows that the state

171
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:07,973
can be innovative

172
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,248
and risk-taking.

173
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:11,448
And to prove her argument

174
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:12,898
she takes the example

175
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,460
of Apple's technologies.

176
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:15,935
And she shows how

177
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:17,223
all these technologies

178
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,248
in the iPhone, for example,

179
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,685
were all funded by the state

180
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:23,660
through federal grants.

181
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,860
This is a marvelously
stimulating book

182
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,298
But if I had a criticism
to make of it

183
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,285
it would be that she

184
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,498
underplays the creativity of Apple

185
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,860
Because any firm could have

186
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:37,473
developed those projects,

187
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,760
but only Apple did.

188
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,310
And it overplays the creativity

189
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:42,923
of the public sector.

190
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,623
She looks at very unique

191
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,485
public sector agencies,

192
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:48,760
like Darper, from the United States,

193
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:49,423
for example,

194
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:50,348
which I think

195
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,785
is the exception,

196
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:53,610
rather than the norm

197
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:55,885
of public sector agencies.

198
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:58,048
What about other positions?

199
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:00,460
The most important critique

200
00:06:00,498 --> 00:06:02,423
of the neoliberal position,

201
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,585
in my view,

202
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,623
is what I would call

203
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,110
the experimentalist approach

204
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:09,635
of people like Danny Rodrick

205
00:06:09,648 --> 00:06:11,193
and Charles Sabel.

206
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,068
What Rodrick does, for example,

207
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,868
he accepts the Hayek critique

208
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,280
that the State lacks information.

209
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,480
But he turns this criticism

210
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,005
on its head by saying

211
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:24,755
the private sector

212
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:24,768
also lacks information.
the private sector

213
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,743
also lacks information.

214
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:28,618
Both the public sector

215
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,155
and the private sector

216
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:31,968
lack information

217
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,280
when they are engaging

218
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:36,517
in experimenting
for new technologies,

219
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,780
for innovation.

220
00:06:37,868 --> 00:06:41,505
And the implication of this insight

221
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,493
is that both firms and states

222
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,068
need to collaborate,

223
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:47,530
to learn together,

224
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,368
in a trial and error process

225
00:06:49,568 --> 00:06:50,955
of experimentation.

226
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:53,693
The main aim of this process

227
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:54,830
of trial and error

228
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,005
is to try to secure,

229
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,830
or illicit information.

230
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,918
In other words,

231
00:06:59,943 --> 00:07:01,480
to find joint solutions

232
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,243
to common problems

233
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,868
and to evaluate outcomes

234
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,630
almost in real time.

235
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,480
And this process

236
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,593
is sometimes called

237
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,418
diagnostic monitoring.

238
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:15,429
This is the smart state thesis

239
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,717
which is is adopted in this MOOC.

240
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:18,993
And it is presumed

241
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,655
in the smart specialisation strategy

242
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,642
of the European Commission.

243
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,330
The smart state presumption

244
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,705
is based on, and is an example of,

245
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:29,743
what is sometimes called
is based on, and is an example of,

246
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:31,105
what is sometimes called

247
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,730
experimentalist governance.

248
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,968
Experimentalist governance

249
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,743
simply means a recursive process

250
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,893
of provisional goal-setting
and revision

251
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,218
based on learning from

252
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,755
the comparison of
alternative approaches.

253
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,317
This the definition that is

254
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,918
given to experimental governance

255
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,729
by Charles Sabel

256
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:52,317
and Johnathan Zeitlin.

257
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:53,168
For example,

258
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:54,193
at bottom,

259
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,493
it involves joint goal-setting

260
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,855
between central and local units

261
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,530
where local units

262
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,218
have the discretion

263
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,293
to meet the goals

264
00:08:03,493 --> 00:08:05,905
of a particular project in question.

265
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,668
And these projects,

266
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,280
are subject to a continuous process

267
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,118
of diagnostic monitoring.

268
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:14,268
But this is the important point.

269
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:16,368
The primary aim

270
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,330
of diagnostic monitoring

271
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,905
is to build problem-solving capacity,

272
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,943
not to police compliance.

273
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:26,068
In other words,

274
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,443
diagnostic monitoring

275
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,505
is a tool for learning

276
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,680
not control.

277
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,230
While experimentalist governance

278
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,093
is a very compelling principle,

279
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:37,968
it is very challenging

280
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,405
to do in practice

281
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:41,643
for a number of reasons.

282
00:08:41,843 --> 00:08:42,693
For example,

283
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:46,293
it presumes strong feedback.

284
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,443
In all evolutionary theories,

285
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,480
feedback

286
00:08:49,593 --> 00:08:51,893
plays an absolutely crucial role.

287
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,443
But in practice,

288
00:08:53,643 --> 00:08:57,518
feedback is stymied by many things.

289
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,505
Good feedback is stymied by fear,

290
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:04,155
by power, by hierarchy

291
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:07,355
I often say to my master students,

292
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,055
Good feedback is like gold dust,

293
00:09:10,104 --> 00:09:12,218
and just as difficult to get.

294
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,180
So we should never assume

295
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:16,780
that feedback is readily available.

296
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:18,217
Another barrier,

297
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,529
is the public sector culture

298
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,967
around failure.

299
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,942
Failure is not tolerated

300
00:09:25,992 --> 00:09:27,479
in the public sector.

301
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,054
The public sector is invited

302
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:31,654
to be more experimental,

303
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:32,892
more agile,

304
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,617
less risk-averse.

305
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,954
It is invited to be all these things

306
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:38,742
so long as the public sector

307
00:09:38,804 --> 00:09:40,367
does not make a mistake.

308
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,179
That would be comical

309
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,454
if was not also tragic.

310
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:46,379
You cannot experiment

311
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,354
without making mistakes.

312
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,879
Another barrier
to experimental governance

313
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,917
is the role of learning

314
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,317
in the public sector.

315
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:57,417
Learning is vital, of course,

316
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:00,079
but many public sector agencies

317
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:03,279
never give enough time or space

318
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:05,729
to monitoring, to evaluation,

319
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,042
and to revision.

320
00:10:07,242 --> 00:10:08,579
All of which are vital

321
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:11,067
to experimentalist governance.

322
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:14,829
Monitoring and evaluation,
for example,

323
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,579
have a low status

324
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:18,029
in the public sector.

325
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:21,104
We say they have
a Cinderella status about them.

326
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:22,967
And yet they are the keys

327
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,479
to feedback and learning.

328
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,592
Especially when innovation
is assuming

329
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,129
more and more importance

330
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:32,004
in European regional policy.

331
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,179
For example,

332
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,204
when European regional policy began

333
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:38,167
in the late 1980s

334
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:41,367
innovation-related investment

335
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:44,142
accounted for about 4%

336
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:47,079
of the entire programming period.

337
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,454
Just 4%.

338
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:50,442
If we think of the current

339
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,967
programming period

340
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,329
2014 to 2020,

341
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,217
innovation-related
investment measures

342
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,642
account for 45%

343
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,517
of the entire program.

344
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:02,704
In other words,

345
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:06,167
innovation is assuming
more and more importance,

346
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,829
and innovation means novelty.

347
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:10,217
And the public sector

348
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,979
finds it very difficult

349
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,354
to cope with novelty;

350
00:11:14,404 --> 00:11:15,729
because it likes to have

351
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:18,704
standardized procedures to audit.

352
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:21,904
So what I have done in this

353
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:22,954
opening theme

354
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,629
discussing debates about the State,

355
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,829
is to try to emphasize
both the opportunities

356
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,304
as well as the limits

357
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:32,117
of these debates.

358
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,767
And now I want to turn
to my second theme

359
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,767
which is about looking
at key aspects

360
00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:40,567
of what I've called the smart state.

361
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:43,467
The smart state, as I said earlier,

362
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,892
is simply a term that I use

363
00:11:46,092 --> 00:11:47,929
to convey good government

364
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:50,079
or enlightened public policies.

365
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,654
And it has a number of key aspects.

366
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:56,292
Quality of regional government
is one.

367
00:11:56,492 --> 00:11:59,092
Looking at
public procurement capacity

368
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,279
is another.

369
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:03,029
The entrepreneurial
discovery process

370
00:12:03,229 --> 00:12:04,079
is the heart

371
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:05,542
of smart specialisation

372
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:07,117
And that assumes

373
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:09,829
responsive and committed

374
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,817
regional political elites

375
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,004
Let us look at some
of these key aspects

376
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:16,242
in more detail.

377
00:12:16,754 --> 00:12:18,067
Quality of government

378
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:20,342
is a very important condition

379
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:23,154
of a smart specialisation strategy.

380
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:24,829
And yet the work

381
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:25,867
that has been done

382
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:27,279
by the European Commission

383
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:28,192
to look at

384
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,967
how regional government

385
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:29,979
differ throughout Europe,
how regional government

386
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,417
differ throughout Europe,

387
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,854
in terms of the quality
of government,

388
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:36,804
shows enormous variation

389
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:39,467
in the capacity of
regional governments

390
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,904
to deliver good services.

391
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,592
On this map, for example,

392
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:44,992
where we can see

393
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,517
the darker the colour

394
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,629
the less good

395
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,592
the regional government.

396
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:51,829
The lighter the colour

397
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:53,854
the better the quality
of government.

398
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,954
We can see that
poor governance

399
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:58,279
is often associated

400
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,842
with poor innovation

401
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,792
and poor economic growth.

402
00:13:02,117 --> 00:13:04,342
Poor governance also makes for

403
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:07,742
poor and unresponsive
public services.

404
00:13:07,942 --> 00:13:09,117
Thirdly,

405
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:10,167
we can say that

406
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,654
poor governance is also

407
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:13,942
both cause and consequence

408
00:13:13,967 --> 00:13:16,179
of fraud and corruption.

409
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,729
And putting all these
things together

410
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,179
we can say

411
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,829
as the European Commission

412
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,442
itself also says,

413
00:13:23,517 --> 00:13:25,442
That poor governments

414
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,117
compromises the impact

415
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,679
of cohesion policies

416
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,042
because it reduces

417
00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,579
the absorptive capacity,

418
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:32,642
that is to say,

419
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:34,679
the capacity of
a regional government

420
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:37,067
to absorb and deploy

421
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:40,267
regional policy funds effectively.

422
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,604
Let's look that

423
00:13:41,704 --> 00:13:42,954
in more detail.

424
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:45,967
This is the absorptive
capacity figure

425
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:48,254
that is used by
the European Commission.

426
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:49,617
We can see

427
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:51,579
along the horizontal axis

428
00:13:51,642 --> 00:13:52,754
at the bottom,

429
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:54,629
the absorption rate

430
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,167
of cohesion policy

431
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,754
for the funding program

432
00:13:57,817 --> 00:14:00,429
2007 to 2013.

433
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:02,642
Along the vertical axis

434
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,854
is the World Bank's

435
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:03,892
Government effectiveness index.
is the World Bank's

436
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:06,979
Government effectiveness index.

437
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,079
And putting these things together

438
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:11,129
there is a rough correlation

439
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:11,879
I would say,

440
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:14,442
between these two indicators.

441
00:14:14,642 --> 00:14:15,604
For example,

442
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,867
if we think of Romania

443
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:20,192
Romania has very weak

444
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,679
governance capacity.

445
00:14:21,717 --> 00:14:23,254
And it also has very weak

446
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:24,954
absorptive capacity

447
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:26,642
for cohesion policy.

448
00:14:26,842 --> 00:14:28,779
This relationship, of course,

449
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,192
doesn't always work;

450
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,567
because on the other side
we have Portugal.

451
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:33,767
Portugal,

452
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,817
which does not have great
Governance Capacity

453
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:36,829
but it does have a large
absorptive capacity
which does not have great
Governance Capacity

454
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:39,929
but it does have a large
absorptive capacity

455
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:41,604
for cohesion policy.

456
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,692
And that's partly because

457
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:45,204
the way in which

458
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,867
small countries

459
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,754
often are able

460
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:51,317
to design policies in a better way

461
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:52,842
than large countries.

462
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,354
If we move on
to the next section.

463
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,042
Public procurement

464
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,767
is a very important index

465
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:01,092
of the capacity

466
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:02,654
of regional government

467
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,667
to design and deploy

468
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:07,167
regional policy effectively.

469
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,317
Public procurement

470
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,092
has huge potential

471
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:13,729
to procure new policies,

472
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:15,329
to deliver new services,

473
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:16,567
for example,

474
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,492
but it is stymied in practice.

475
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:19,342
Why?

476
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,979
Because of a combination

477
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:22,479
of poor skills

478
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,604
and low political commitment.

479
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,804
Public procurement, I would say,

480
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:29,592
is the sleeping giant

481
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:33,254
of European regional policy.

482
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:35,854
It's sleeping because

483
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:37,092
regional governments

484
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:39,104
simply do not have the skill sets

485
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,154
to design and deploy

486
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:42,517
their power of purchase

487
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,167
in an effective way.

488
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:45,829
And this is a major problem

489
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:47,054
for regional policy;

490
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:48,642
because public procurement,

491
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:51,842
as this European Commission
guide suggests,

492
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:54,642
plays an enormously important role

493
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,017
in all economies

494
00:15:56,017 --> 00:15:57,567
throughout the European Union.

495
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:57,579
It accounts for nearly 20%
throughout the European Union.

496
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,692
It accounts for nearly 20%

497
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:02,417
of European GDP.

498
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:04,209
If we turn to

499
00:16:04,271 --> 00:16:06,846
to the entrepreneurial
discovery process

500
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,634
which is the core

501
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,534
of smart specialisation.

502
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,159
This is a process in which

503
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,521
the smart state

504
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,284
is supposed to identify

505
00:16:16,484 --> 00:16:19,259
new research and
innovation priorities

506
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:20,984
alongside firms

507
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,834
and universities

508
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:24,634
and other research institutes

509
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:25,821
for example.

510
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,396
But many regional governments

511
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,059
still cling to what is called

512
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:33,359
the "Linear Model of Innovation"

513
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,159
in the mistaken belief

514
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:37,584
that more science inputs

515
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:40,071
equal more innovation outputs.

516
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,771
That is what we call

517
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,909
the "Linear Model of Innovation".

518
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,659
And there is a very big
disconnect here,

519
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,146
a big contradiction here,

520
00:16:48,196 --> 00:16:50,109
between the academy,

521
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:51,059
for example,

522
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,484
where the linear model

523
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:53,884
was declared dead

524
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:55,084
over 20 years ago

525
00:16:55,134 --> 00:16:56,671
because it was ineffective .

526
00:16:57,034 --> 00:16:59,959
So while it was declared dead
in the academy

527
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,359
the linear model

528
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,746
seems to be alive and well

529
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,996
in the worlds of policy and practice

530
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:08,384
because governments simply continue

531
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:10,396
to invest in science

532
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:12,696
in the assumption

533
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:14,796
that it would automatically lead

534
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,521
to more innovation.

535
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,646
What can be done about
this problem?

536
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,896
A problem that I call,

537
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,334
"University Science Silos".

538
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:23,821
What can be done?

539
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,621
I'll show you what can be done later

540
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:27,971
in regional policy examples

541
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,096
where regions

542
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:31,834
are trying to encourage
their universities

543
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:33,446
to work hand-in-glove

544
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:34,921
with smart firms.

545
00:17:36,022 --> 00:17:37,872
A final dimension.

546
00:17:37,922 --> 00:17:39,197
A final aspect

547
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:40,672
of the smart state

548
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:43,397
is the idea that region elites

549
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,347
are really committed to innovation.

550
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,247
But as we know,

551
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:49,872
there are many
underperforming elites

552
00:17:49,934 --> 00:17:52,722
in regions throughout
the European union.

553
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,047
And underperforming regional elites

554
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,322
correlate strongly

555
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:58,372
with low quality of government

556
00:17:58,409 --> 00:17:59,909
and poor innovation.

557
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,167
What do we need to do about

558
00:18:02,217 --> 00:18:03,992
underperforming elites?

559
00:18:04,192 --> 00:18:06,180
We need to hold them to account

560
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,042
through both

561
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,817
bottom-up local pressure

562
00:18:09,017 --> 00:18:12,017
and top-down pressure

563
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:13,105
from above.

564
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:14,630
The bottom-up pressure

565
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,617
can come from

566
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,005
local civil society, for example.

567
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,117
One example of that,

568
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,255
would be the Integrity Pacts

569
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,455
being developed by
Transparency International

570
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:27,942
to hold public bodies to account

571
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,267
for the way they spend public money.

572
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:31,853
But pressure can also

573
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,453
be brought from the national

574
00:18:33,503 --> 00:18:34,991
and European levels

575
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,828
by new conditionalities

576
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,028
which are placed
on regional elites.

577
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,541
Like the ex-ante conditionality

578
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:44,078
in smart specialisation,
for example.

579
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,991
Which means that
smart specialisation strategies

580
00:18:47,053 --> 00:18:48,841
are a requirement

581
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,166
before you can expect

582
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,191
to win regional policy funds

583
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,366
It is a legal requirement

584
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,766
to have a
Smart Specialisation Strategy

585
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:58,816
in place.

586
00:18:59,016 --> 00:19:00,528
My final point

587
00:19:00,653 --> 00:19:02,853
about the smart state in Europe
is this:

588
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,053
Over the past 8 years

589
00:19:05,253 --> 00:19:06,666
the public sector

590
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,553
has been eviscerated .

591
00:19:08,753 --> 00:19:10,653
Really cut back deeply.

592
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:13,741
Because many governments
are still in thrall

593
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:16,428
to what I call a pre-keynesian creed

594
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,028
that aims to eliminate

595
00:19:18,078 --> 00:19:19,316
the budget deficit

596
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,703
and shrink the state.

597
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:22,603
A shrunken state

598
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:23,766
in my experience

599
00:19:23,853 --> 00:19:25,491
is a disempowered state;

600
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:27,241
that lacks the capacity

601
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,591
to offer smart state solution.

602
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:33,225
And the real problem is this:

603
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,975
The public sector

604
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,025
becoming more important,

605
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:38,900
not less important,

606
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,613
to innovation strategies

607
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,600
because innovation itself

608
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:43,163
now

609
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:44,413
is evolving

610
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,325
from a narrow conception

611
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:47,963
around science and technology

612
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,488
to a much wider conception

613
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,525
of societal innovation.

614
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,000
When we think of

615
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:56,375
innovation in key sectors

616
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:57,825
like healthcare

617
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,075
socialcare,

618
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,338
education

619
00:20:00,388 --> 00:20:01,225
energy,

620
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,263
transport,

621
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:05,025
agrifood or the built environment,

622
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,188
in all these sectors

623
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:08,863
the public sector

624
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:10,838
makes a major contribution

625
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:12,663
to smart, sustainable

626
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,138
and inclusive growth.

627
00:20:14,188 --> 00:20:16,363
These are sectors what I call

628
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,450
the societal challenge sectors

629
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,463
in which the State looms large

630
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,713
in every sector.

631
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:23,800
And therefore it is -

632
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,488
it is counterproductive

633
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:27,625
to assume that the public sector

634
00:20:27,663 --> 00:20:30,575
can be displaced from these sectors

635
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:32,838
when it plays such a major role.
