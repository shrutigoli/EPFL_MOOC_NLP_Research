1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:11,110
A smart specialization strategy
is underpinned by a principle of experimentation.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,760
And this experimental nature that we will
promptly address

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,460
has two strong implications in terms of operationalization:
flexibility

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,070
and evaluation and monitoring.
That's what we'll talk about now.

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,470
On what consists the decisions made
in the case of a smart specialization strategy?

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:32,960
Decisions on priority areas
and then decisions in each area.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
Basically, these are bets.
These are adventures.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,730
After an entrepreneurial discovery process
robust and transparent,

9
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,839
the decisions made always involve an element
of risk.

10
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:47,379
There is still a belief dimension
and even a certain amount of faith

11
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:51,969
when choices are made,
both in terms of priority areas and in terms

12
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,230
of project
within each field.

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,179
We can appreciate here the difference with
a horizontal policy

14
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,679
where the choices are not so risky.
The bets are not so risky.

15
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:06,159
A R&D tax credit is not a very risky decision.
We are pretty sure it will result in additional

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,979
R & D expenses
by companies.

17
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,510
In the case of a smart specialization strategy,
we undertake experiments and as all experiments

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,300
some can fail.
The development of a smart specialization

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,150
strategy,
is therefore a fragile construction.

20
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,760
And that's good.
If the choices were not risky,

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,950
that is to say that private investment profitability
was certain,

22
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,530
any policy would be superfluous.
So the risk of failure should not be eliminated

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,700
but the costs of possible failures should
be reduced.

24
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,580
And this determines
two principles, two imperatives:

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,740
the flexibility already mentioned
and the monitoring and evaluation.

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,230
Let's therefore look at
the operationalisation of the principle of

27
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,050
flexibility.
We have already spoken several times about

28
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,270
it,
especially as part of good design of a policy.

29
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,280
This principle enables to preserve the dynamism
of the strategy,

30
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
an ability to adjust and adapt to opportunities,
which can occur any time.

31
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,450
It also enables to reduce risks of distortion
often associated with policies that lead to

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,420
unlimited duration of
preferential interventions

33
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,470
in such and such technology area,
in favour of such and such project.

34
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,489
This flexibility goes both ways.
It first concerns the fact that preferential

35
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:18,340
support can
or has to stop at some point.

36
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,019
And there are three reasons for this.
What establishes public support

37
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:28,180
is the new nature of the activity.
It is the fact that it is "new" that creates

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,049
risks, uncertainties,
coordination difficulties.

39
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:34,269
So, whether the activity is a success or a
failure,

40
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,989
it doesn't matter from the flexibility point
of view.

41
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,629
What matters is that after four or five years,
it is no longer new

42
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,579
and should therefore no longer be eligible
for special

43
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,299
and non-neutral support.
Leaving the strategy after a certain period

44
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,300
does not mean that it is a failure,
just that business is now mature.

45
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,170
This does not mean that the activity is interrupted.
Participants in this activity will still fund

46
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,660
their R&D
with horizontal instruments.

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,109
Rodrik speaks of a “sunset clause for withdrawing
support”

48
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:04,560
after a certain period of time.
Second reason

49
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,659
the world changes and what appeared to be
an essential priority

50
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,379
can seem less relevant
several years later.

51
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,900
Finally,
third reason after a few years,

52
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,329
the results just are not up to standard. The
project has failed

53
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:20,340
and perhaps by extension,
the priority area itself seems less promising

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,769
than expected.
In the other direction, the flexibility concerns

55
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,799
the ability of the strategy
to continuously stimulate entrepreneurial

56
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:30,359
discoveries
and to be ready at every moment to assess

57
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,549
them,
select some of them and welcome them into

58
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,909
the strategy.
This ability to generate new options

59
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,469
obviously concerns the project level
within each domain but also the priority level

60
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:43,579
itself.
Here is the general principle of flexibility

61
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,019
which expresses the fact
that the smart specialization strategy is

62
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,529
a living document.
It would be quite irrational and absurd to

63
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:53,870
engrave it in marble
the first decisions and never to return to

64
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,269
them,
as if nothing could happen later.

65
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,569
The idea of ​​smart specialization strategy
is to hold this never-ending to-and-fro

66
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:06,709
between new activities which enter the strategy
and mature activities which come out.

67
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,329
From there,
the problem of operationalization arises

68
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:15,150
and the questions are very specific.
The dilemma of flexibility opposes the principles

69
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,620
we have just explained,
including the fact that an activity after

70
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,680
some time
is not new anymore,

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,400
to the entirely reasonable principle that
we need time

72
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,349
to form this new activity
and give it its development.

73
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,160
However,
this dilemma is probably not that bad,

74
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,680
if we understand the fact that stopping
a preferential intervention,

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,300
which has already been provided for five or
six years,

76
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,349
does not mean that the activity will stop.
This simply means

77
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:42,129
that other financing arrangements will be
better

78
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:46,810
adapted to the new phase of innovation.
The key point here is the complementarity

79
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:50,710
between smart specialization strategy
and horizontal instruments

80
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,010
which must take over
when activities mature.

81
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,280
But this principle of flexibility
will also give a central role

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,430
to evaluation and monitoring.
We'll come to it.

83
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,030
Just before
a note to the attention of European regions

84
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,370
who can find it difficult to conciliate
this flexibility and the apparent rigidity

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,150
of the operational program they have submitted
to the European Commission.

86
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,770
The regions are indeed linked
by what they have decided initially and by

87
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,169
the operational program
which determines

88
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:25,240
the outlines of what will be funded.
In this regard, potential areas of specialization

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,400
represent the essential constraint.
Can we change a strategy during the operational

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,310
program?
To address these somewhat technical problems

91
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,110
and that only interest the regions
of the European Union.

92
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,600
I refer you to a document annexed to this
module.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,199
Deciding to stop a domain,
some projects,

94
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,360
deciding to continue,
deciding to start and open a new field;

95
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,280
all this must be based on rigorous and continuous
evaluation mechanisms.

96
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,960
We will talk about it in the next video.
