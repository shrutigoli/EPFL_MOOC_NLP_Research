A smart specialization strategy is underpinned by a principle of experimentation.
And this experimental nature that we will promptly address has two strong implications in terms of operationalization: flexibility and evaluation and monitoring.
That's what we'll talk about now.
On what consists the decisions made in the case of a smart specialization strategy?
Decisions on priority areas and then decisions in each area.
Basically, these are bets.
These are adventures.
After an entrepreneurial discovery process robust and transparent, the decisions made always involve an element of risk.
There is still a belief dimension and even a certain amount of faith when choices are made, both in terms of priority areas and in terms of project within each field.
We can appreciate here the difference with a horizontal policy where the choices are not so risky.
The bets are not so risky.
A R&D tax credit is not a very risky decision.
We are pretty sure it will result in additional
R & D expenses by companies.
In the case of a smart specialization strategy, we undertake experiments and as all experiments some can fail.
The development of a smart specialization strategy, is therefore a fragile construction.
And that's good.
If the choices were not risky, that is to say that private investment profitability was certain, any policy would be superfluous.
So the risk of failure should not be eliminated but the costs of possible failures should be reduced.
And this determines two principles, two imperatives: the flexibility already mentioned and the monitoring and evaluation.
Let's therefore look at the operationalisation of the principle of flexibility.
We have already spoken several times about it, especially as part of good design of a policy.
This principle enables to preserve the dynamism of the strategy, an ability to adjust and adapt to opportunities, which can occur any time.
It also enables to reduce risks of distortion often associated with policies that lead to unlimited duration of preferential interventions in such and such technology area, in favour of such and such project.
This flexibility goes both ways.
It first concerns the fact that preferential support can or has to stop at some point.
And there are three reasons for this.
What establishes public support is the new nature of the activity.
It is the fact that it is "new" that creates risks, uncertainties, coordination difficulties.
So, whether the activity is a success or a failure, it doesn't matter from the flexibility point of view.
What matters is that after four or five years, it is no longer new and should therefore no longer be eligible for special and non-neutral support.
Leaving the strategy after a certain period does not mean that it is a failure, just that business is now mature.
This does not mean that the activity is interrupted.
Participants in this activity will still fund their R&D with horizontal instruments.
Rodrik speaks of a â€œsunset clause for withdrawing supportâ€� after a certain period of time.
Second reason the world changes and what appeared to be an essential priority can seem less relevant several years later.
Finally, third reason after a few years, the results just are not up to standard. The project has failed and perhaps by extension, the priority area itself seems less promising than expected.
In the other direction, the flexibility concerns the ability of the strategy to continuously stimulate entrepreneurial discoveries and to be ready at every moment to assess them, select some of them and welcome them into the strategy.
This ability to generate new options obviously concerns the project level within each domain but also the priority level itself.
Here is the general principle of flexibility which expresses the fact that the smart specialization strategy is a living document.
It would be quite irrational and absurd to engrave it in marble the first decisions and never to return to them, as if nothing could happen later.
The idea of â€‹â€‹smart specialization strategy is to hold this never-ending to-and-fro between new activities which enter the strategy and mature activities which come out.
From there, the problem of operationalization arises and the questions are very specific.
The dilemma of flexibility opposes the principles we have just explained, including the fact that an activity after some time is not new anymore, to the entirely reasonable principle that we need time to form this new activity and give it its development.
However, this dilemma is probably not that bad, if we understand the fact that stopping a preferential intervention, which has already been provided for five or six years, does not mean that the activity will stop.
This simply means that other financing arrangements will be better adapted to the new phase of innovation.
The key point here is the complementarity between smart specialization strategy and horizontal instruments which must take over when activities mature.
But this principle of flexibility will also give a central role to evaluation and monitoring.
We'll come to it.
Just before a note to the attention of European regions who can find it difficult to conciliate this flexibility and the apparent rigidity of the operational program they have submitted to the European Commission.
The regions are indeed linked by what they have decided initially and by the operational program which determines the outlines of what will be funded.
In this regard, potential areas of specialization represent the essential constraint.
Can we change a strategy during the operational program?
To address these somewhat technical problems and that only interest the regions of the European Union.
I refer you to a document annexed to this module.
Deciding to stop a domain, some projects, deciding to continue, deciding to start and open a new field; all this must be based on rigorous and continuous evaluation mechanisms.
We will talk about it in the next video.
