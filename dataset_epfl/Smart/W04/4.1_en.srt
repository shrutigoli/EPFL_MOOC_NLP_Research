1
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:11,610
The aim of this module is to go a little deeper
into the strategy operationalisation.

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,490
Last week focused on how
entrepreneurial discovery can be organised

3
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,490
in terms of
priorities or strategic areas.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,199
This module will now focus on the second stage
of entrepreneurial discovery which lies within

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,660
each
priority area.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,849
As we have already said,
the entrepreneurial discovery does not stop

7
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,190
when priorities
are established, but it concerns the exploration

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,829
of every area
on the basis of coordinated research and innovation

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,079
investments as well as
the development of specific infrastructures

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,860
in order to
facilitate this coordination.

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,890
All of this without
losing sight of the ultimate aim that from

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,719
each priority area
a transformative activity is constituted which

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,879
will take off
and reach a certain critical mass to lead

14
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,510
to
a structural change.

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:08,020
What are the precise objectives
of this second stage of entrepreneurial discovery?

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,800
In each priority area it is a case of learning
about

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,570
the effective potentials and opportunities
with the aim

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,300
to develop a new transformative activity.

19
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,550
It is also about improving coordination amongst
resources and involved parties with the aim

20
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,960
to produce
the first effects of critical mass agglomeration,

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,180
of synergy.

22
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,440
It is also about building the additional capabilities
and fill a few gaps, overcoming a few weaknesses

23
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,190
in the knowledge base,
in the service infrastructure, or in the coordination

24
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,540
tools.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,530
Finally the connection between the considered
priority area

26
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,600
and the extra-regional resources and skills
must be ensured

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,360
by supporting new links and partnerships with
other regions.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,260
As we have already seen an important condition
for these

29
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,770
coordination and agglomeration efforts to
be productive

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,360
is that the chosen priority areas are not
too large.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,360
In an overly large area,
the projects and other initiatives will inevitably

32
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,280
be
scattered, with little hope of synergy and

33
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
agglomeration.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,220
In a more narrow area, for example the area
of

35
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,280
flexible technology in the shoe industry,
which we have

36
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,950
seen in the Northern Portugal case, we can
expect a better return of the strategy in

37
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,820
terms of
the scale of agglomeration and spill overs,

38
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,090
which is a very important goal.

39
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,310
Let's continue with an example: the Basque
Country.

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,440
This example will be explored further in the
fifth week,

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,590
as this region will be the object of an entire
case study.

42
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,050
In the smart specialisation strategy of the
Basque

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,250
Country, there are seven priority areas which
have been

44
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,360
selected, including advanced production
and industry 4.0 technologies.

45
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,680
Here we are not interested in the reasons
for choosing

46
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,280
these priority areas, but in what happens
once the

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,600
choice has been made.

48
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,920
The first thing to remember is on an organisational
level, the creation of a steering committee

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,130
which includes public and private actors.

50
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,110
With this committee, a space for decision
and initiative is

51
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,190
created to identify key problems to be resolved,
to choose relevant plans.

52
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,540
We will then examine this in the case of the
Basque

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,290
Country and this priority strategy.

54
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,980
We will also identify current projects, relevant
entrepreneurial activities for the considered

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,980
strategic area.

56
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,819
This committee should also instill a dynamic,
an effervescence so that all of those involved

57
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:40,190
in the area
come together and propose initiatives.

58
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,980
In order for the effects of synergy and agglomeration
to be generated and a truly new activity to

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,349
take off,
to form a certain critical mass.

60
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,480
Here is a list of the identified projects.

61
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,660
This list is quite heterogeneous.

62
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,489
It includes projects of research, platform
and

63
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:05,910
infrastructure development, training and education
initiatives, liaison projects with other priorities

64
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:10,290
of the energetic-environmental strategy, as
well as

65
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:13,560
initiatives looking towards the international
market.

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,530
If we do a little bit of sorting, we can identify
the

67
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,900
following mechanisms which can be implemented
in

68
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,689
any smart specialisation strategy.

69
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:27,409
Firstly, any action or initiative needs leaders.

70
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:30,830
These potential leaders must be discovered
and supported

71
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,499
so that they take control of these different
initiatives.

72
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:36,819
It can be a case of, as in the Basque Country,
a

73
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,770
university who leads training initiatives,
a

74
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,510
professional association, or the management
structure of a

75
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,069
cluster, or even a specific company, or a
motivated entrepreneur.

76
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,729
The second mechanism, the call for projects
for

77
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,370
the development or the demonstration of such
and such

78
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,710
critical technological feature, is a well-known
mechanism.

79
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,569
Mobilising public financing, criteria for
this

80
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:02,590
have already been looked at in the second
week.

81
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,969
This public financing is particularly necessary
when

82
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:09,029
it involves undertaking a collective action
which involves

83
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:11,409
several different parties with the aim to
integrate

84
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,330
and combine separate knowledge.

85
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:17,319
We cannot lose sight of the fact
that we are in an entrepreneurial discovery

86
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,740
logic, the second stage, therefore that
the companies which are helped must accept

87
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,610
the diffusion of
information relating to these projects.

88
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,759
The third mechanism is the development of
research and

89
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,620
innovation infrastructures to facilitate the
provision

90
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,909
of necessary complementary capabilities for
innovation,

91
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:37,150
as well as coordination between projects.

92
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,020
We have already highlighted that a rich innovation
ecosystem

93
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,490
should provide these capabilities that the
majority

94
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,469
of businesses cannot produce internally, specialised
services,

95
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:50,689
basic research, test systems, etc.

96
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,059
The fashionable term here is "platform".

97
00:05:53,059 --> 00:05:55,610
We can think of platforms centered on a general
objective

98
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,580
technology, such as information
technologies, which can

99
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,240
serve several priority areas.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,930
We can also think of platforms to produce
synergies between different priorities, rearranging

101
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,930
platforms.

102
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,139
This is the case in the Basque Country in
terms of advanced

103
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,699
energy production and advanced environment
production areas.

104
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,559
The article by Finnish colleagues from the
Universities

105
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:22,839
of Aalto and Lahti which is referenced in
this module shows

106
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,069
that in Finland there is a tool systematically
deployed

107
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:32,849
within the smart specialisation
strategies in the majority of Finnish regions.

108
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:35,669
These coordination initiatives go beyond the
region

109
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:41,270
to facilitate the links between regional projects
and some external resources.

110
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,509
This is the case in the Basque Country with
multiple

111
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:45,819
international partnerships who have found
a new

112
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:51,310
purpose within the smart specialisation strategy.

113
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,830
The fourth mechanism is a fundamental action
which

114
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,909
concerns the development of new skills and
the necessary

115
00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:00,550
specialised knowledge for the growth of the
selected area.

116
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,219
These actions concern training and education.

117
00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:06,399
This is the case in the Basque Country.

118
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,249
Neglecting these specific investments is an
error

119
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:14,520
that we mentioned during the last module in
the second week.

120
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,039
Of course, part of the solution to this adjustment
problem

121
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,550
in terms of human capital comes from the exterior,
the call for engineers, for scientists from

122
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,699
outside the region.

123
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,629
But when a priority strategic area has been
identified,

124
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,020
the specialised human capital that corresponds
to this area

125
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,710
becomes a really fundamental asset for the
region.

126
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:39,699
It therefore makes sense that the region gets
involved

127
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,599
in activities in favour of its endogenous
development.

128
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,629
Let's move on to the fifth mechanism: it is
definitely

129
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:52,330
also important to mobilise the cluster(s)
which are concerned in each priority area

130
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,869
in order for it to
lead coherent actions relating to the smart

131
00:07:55,869 --> 00:07:59,080
specialisation strategy, so that their objectives
are

132
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,729
aligned with these priorities.

133
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,830
A cluster can be a useful tool in the service
of a

134
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,149
strategy's objectives, but it has to be mobilised.

135
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:11,189
We could say the same thing for regional localisation
or

136
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:17,960
attraction policies which should be harmonised,
in line with the smart specialisation strategy.

137
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,149
Finally, the universities in each region can
represent

138
00:08:22,149 --> 00:08:27,199
a formidable tool in the service of the smart
specialisation strategy, in terms of research

139
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,240
of course, but also of coordination, infrastructure,
and also obviously training.

140
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,740
Therefore it is necessary that universities
get involved

141
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,149
in priority areas and become main parties
within

142
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,120
each of these areas.

143
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,290
Here is the list of mechanisms to use in
order to put initiatives and actions in place

144
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,589
that can be
financed within a priority area in

145
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,670
the smart specialisation strategy.

146
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,900
That is how we go from, as in the Basque Country
case,

147
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,250
identifying a priority area to the more concrete
stage of entrepreneurial discovery

148
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,300
with a large number of projects, activities,
infrastructures development.

149
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,740
In the end, we aim for the development of
new

150
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,029
activities characterized by a certain critical
mass and

151
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:21,180
effects of agglomeration and spill overs.

152
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,870
We have just tackled the operationalisation
of a

153
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,910
critical stage in the process of entrepreneurial
discovery.

154
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,600
The stage that allows us to learn specifically
about

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,720
the opportunities and the potentialities
within a specific strategic area.

156
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,420
The example of the advanced
production technologies area in the Basque

157
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,449
Country's
strategy is interesting.

158
00:09:40,449 --> 00:09:42,310
But it is only one example.

159
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:45,970
The list of mechanisms that we have commented
on is only one list.

160
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,699
Every priority strategic area is different,
and we must therefore

161
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:52,870
think about mechanisms adapted to these specificities.

162
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,870
Depending on the existing structures: are
there

163
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,970
clusters?

164
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,130
Are there big companies?

165
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,240
A technological
university?

166
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,140
Depending on the potential
leaders, the entrepreneurial dynamism already

167
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:08,430
present,
potential gaps and weaknesses, we must

168
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,560
focus on one mechanism rather than another.

169
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,350
What will be pertinent in one area will not
necessarily

170
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,589
be in another.

171
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,370
It is simply important not
to lose sight of the ultimate aim, which is

172
