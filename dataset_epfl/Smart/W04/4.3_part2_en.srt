1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,584
So what I have tried to do so far,
Is to look at debates on the state.

2
00:00:08,796 --> 00:00:11,796
Secondly, I've looked at key aspects
of the smart state.

3
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:14,996
And now finally I want to
turn my attention

4
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:18,196
to some good examples of regions

5
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:20,834
which are trying to do
innovative things

6
00:00:21,034 --> 00:00:23,771
through smart state policies.

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:27,931
I've been working for many years
with regional governments

8
00:00:28,131 --> 00:00:31,431
and regional development agents
throughout the European Union,

9
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,269
and I've identified a number of
good practices over the years.

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,794
For twenty years, I've been working
in the Basque country,

11
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,706
which has been one of the pioneers

12
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,906
of regional innovation policy
in the European Union.

13
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,693
And it's developed, in my view,

14
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:53,893
one of the best Smart Specialization
Strategies in the European Union.

15
00:00:54,093 --> 00:00:57,093
And these good practice
examples include

16
00:00:57,293 --> 00:01:02,380
the policy continuity which has been
established in the Basque country.

17
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,093
For over thirty years, the
Basque government

18
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:12,643
has committed to spending on
research, design, and development.

19
00:01:12,843 --> 00:01:15,843
And that has created an
R&D infrastructure

20
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:19,618
which allows firms to
engage with that infrastructure,

21
00:01:19,818 --> 00:01:24,405
and to use it as a platform
for their own R&D investments.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,657
A second example from the Basque
country would be policy novelty.

23
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,370
Not only have they had
policy continuity,

24
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,256
but they've introduced new
aspects to their policy mix.

25
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:41,456
For example, like
cluster associations.

26
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:44,956
Now they're introducing
entrepreneurial discovery processes.

27
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:48,956
And in these entrepreneurial
discovery processes and spaces,

28
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:53,519
businesses and technology centers,
and regional government

29
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:57,856
work hand in glove. And the key
aspect of the Basque strategy

30
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:03,244
that I think merits attention is the
idea of distributed leadership.

31
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:06,444
That is to say, at the
beginning of the strategy,

32
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,644
the Basque government
will play  a strong, forceful role

33
00:02:09,844 --> 00:02:12,719
by establishing the
rules of the game.

34
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:15,919
Once it's established that,
the rules of the game,

35
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:20,694
it will step back and allow businesses,
universities, and research centers

36
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,894
to come forward and take the lead.

37
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:28,844
That's a very important example of
a Smart Specialization Strategy

38
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,856
which is a regional strategy rather
than a governmental strategy

39
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:38,419
my second example comes from
South Moravia in the Czech Republic.

40
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,656
When I've worked in South Moravia,

41
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:45,856
I've worked with a JIC, which is
the regional innovation agency.

42
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:49,056
And when I've asked them
to sum up, to distill,

43
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:52,794
the lessons of their success,
this is what they've said to me:

44
00:02:52,994 --> 00:02:55,606
they've emphasized, first of all,

45
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:59,194
the role of strong, stable
political commitments

46
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:01,794
to regional innovation policy,

47
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:04,994
just as we saw in the case
of the Basque country.

48
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,981
Stable political commitment,
they say, is a must.

49
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:14,682
Secondly, keeping a
strategic focus on results.

50
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:19,607
Knowing what we want to do first,
because the money comes second,

51
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:22,807
they emphasize.
Whereas many regions,

52
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:26,007
the first priority is
securing the money,

53
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:30,204
sometimes when they don't have ideas
what to do with the money.

54
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:33,917
Thirdly, the need to get the
best people on board

55
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:37,117
in these new innovation networks,

56
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,667
because without the
best people on board,

57
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,667
you don't get the
trust in the process.

58
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,104
And trust, as we know,
is a unique asset

59
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:51,664
in development, because
trust has  value but no price.

60
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,623
You can't buy trust.
You can only earn it,

61
00:03:55,823 --> 00:04:00,296
by discharging your
obligations to your partners.

62
00:04:00,496 --> 00:04:03,833
What the Americans call,
"Walking the talk".

63
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:07,033
Another example of
their success, they say,

64
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:10,233
is being constantly in the field,

65
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:13,433
being exposed to
new actors, to new ideas.

66
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:17,746
And feeding back, that word again,
feedback.

67
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:21,083
Honest, rapid, real-time feedback,

68
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:24,558
to keep the policy fresh. And new.

69
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:26,346
And relevant.

70
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:29,546
Another example from them,
from South Moravia, would be,

71
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:32,746
the need for robust
government structures

72
00:04:32,946 --> 00:04:35,946
to protect the space around
new policy initiatives.

73
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:39,883
To give it the oxygen it
needs to develop.

74
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:44,021
And then finally, being close
to state of the art research.

75
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:48,346
The South Moravians have
always been close to these projects.

76
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:51,896
Projects called,
"Creative Regional Advantage"

77
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:55,683
the Smart Specialization
platform in Seville.

78
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:58,346
And our own project, "Smart Spec",

79
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:00,896
a project led by Cardiff University,

80
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:04,096
and funded by the
FP7 European program.

81
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:09,158
All these things are
examples of good practice

82
00:05:09,358 --> 00:05:11,846
from South Moravia.
And in my view,

83
00:05:12,033 --> 00:05:15,558
they all constitute key aspects
of the Smart State.

84
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,671
My final example comes
from my own country, Wales,

85
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,171
where there's been a major change

86
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:25,371
in regional innovation
policy over the years.

87
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,571
We used to have a
top-down and state-led

88
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:32,758
regional innovation policy,
which led to some big disasters.

89
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,496
Like our Technium network,
for example,

90
00:05:35,696 --> 00:05:38,696
which we described looking back as a
"cathedral in the desert"

91
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:44,096
because it created large technology
centers which were underutilized.

92
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:47,296
Learning from that example,

93
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,496
the Welsh government now
tries to build an ecosystem

94
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:56,071
of innovation, in which firms,
government, and universities

95
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,896
work closely together.

96
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:01,096
That's sometimes
referred to as the triple helix

97
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,408
in regional innovation
policy studies.

98
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,083
And two examples from Wales:

99
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,283
First of all, from my own university,
Cardiff University,

100
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:11,946
where we're trying to build
a new innovation campus,

101
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:15,896
where the accent is on
translational research,

102
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,008
research which is close to market.

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:21,208
And there, we are working with IQE,

104
00:06:21,408 --> 00:06:24,958
a world leader in compound
semiconductor technology,

105
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,158
which makes the smart,
energy efficient chips

106
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,358
which go into all of our
smartphones, for example.

107
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,871
Working with partners like IQE
gives us what we'd never had before:

108
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:39,071
which is to say,
a demand-side partner

109
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:43,546
that could help us to valorize, or
commercialize, our knowledge.

110
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,470
A second example from Wales would be
Swansea University's work

111
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,308
in the Specific Project,
which is about

112
00:06:51,508 --> 00:06:54,870
creating a renewable energy
ecosystem

113
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,420
where, once again, firms are
working closely with a university,

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,620
particularly with its
Materials Science center,

115
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,820
a world-class center
of Materials Science.

116
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,233
Both in Cardiff and in Swansea,

117
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:13,808
we see that these partnerships both
aim to integrate demand and supply,

118
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:17,008
And they are the keys to
the valorization of knowledge,

119
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,508
which help us to
overcome the problems

120
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:24,720
of the university science silo,
which I identified earlier on.

121
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,783
These three examples from the Basque
country, South Moravia, Wales,

122
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,595
are just three examples
of where the regional state

123
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:35,183
is trying to act in new ways.

124
00:07:35,383 --> 00:07:39,620
To try to act as an animateur
and a curator of innovation.

125
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,820
And these are examples
of the regional state

126
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,158
playing a more catalytic role in
the smart specialization process,

127
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:51,208
by building organizational
capacity in the public sector,

128
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:56,258
by using its convening power to
broker new networks in the region,

129
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:59,458
and by using its curating capacity

130
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:02,658
to foster translocal networks
and value chains,

131
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,250
like the Vanguard initiative
in the European Union,

132
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:11,862
which is an attempt for regions and
firms to work across different regions

133
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:16,587
to develop new technologies in
advanced manufacturing, for example,

134
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:21,900
in 3D printing. It's a good
example of regions coming together,

135
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,425
to work across borders.

136
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:29,800
To sum up, smart state bodies are valued
for their competence in the network,

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,887
not for their status in the hierarchy,
as used to be the case in the past.

138
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:41,677
And now these smart state bodies are
learning to deploy their soft powers.

139
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:46,090
Powers like their curating capacity,
like their convening power.

140
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:51,027
To deploy these soft powers
in concert with hard powers,

141
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:54,415
like tax, regulation,
and procurement,

142
00:08:54,627 --> 00:08:57,815
and these are the secret
ingredients, I think,

143
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:00,690
of the smart state in action.

144
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,752
So what I've tried to
do in this session,

145
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:06,590
I've tried to do three things:

146
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,790
I've tried to look at new debates
on the role of the state,

147
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,990
in economic development
and innovation.

148
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,765
Secondly, I've tried to look at
key aspects of the smart state.

149
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:22,752
And thirdly, I've tried to
look at good practice examples

150
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:25,515
from regions around
the European Union,

151
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:29,252
particularly the Basque country,
South Moravia, and Wales.

152
00:09:29,452 --> 00:09:32,452
And in this final slide,
I simply want to sum up

153
00:09:32,652 --> 00:09:35,652
by emphasizing three key points.

154
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:38,852
Firstly, smart states can
make a big difference

155
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:41,027
to innovation and development,

156
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,902
if they have the
institutional capacity

157
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:46,890
and the political
leadership to do so.

158
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,090
I believe this is a point that's
been recognized throughout

159
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,852
the history of political economy,

160
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:55,915
from the days of Adam Smith's
"Wealth of Nations" onwards:

161
00:09:56,115 --> 00:09:59,115
The leading role of
enlightened government.

162
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,502
The second point I want to emphasize

163
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,815
is that while smart specialization
presupposes a smart state,

164
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:11,977
a smart state is far from
being the norm today,

165
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:15,802
in the European public sector
because it's stymied

166
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,315
by the lack of monitoring
and evaluation mechanisms,

167
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:22,515
the lack of feedback, the low
priority attached to learning,

168
00:10:22,715 --> 00:10:25,715
and above all,
by the fear of failure.

169
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:27,852
And my final point is this:

170
00:10:28,052 --> 00:10:30,752
shrinking the state
is counterproductive,

171
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:33,952
because a smart public
sector is a key actor

172
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:38,802
in this era of place based innovation
and societal challenges.

173
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:43,565
Challenges like healthcare.
Like the built environment.

174
00:10:43,765 --> 00:10:46,765
Like renewable energy,
sustainable mobility.

175
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:49,965
In all these sectors,
these societal challenge sectors,

176
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:53,165
the state looms large,

177
00:10:53,365 --> 00:10:56,127
especially in our lagging regions.

178
00:10:56,327 --> 00:10:59,327
Thank you.
