1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,010
In this module
it is about highlighting

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,010
what distinguishes
a smart specialization strategy

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,590
as an innovation policy
compared to more traditional policies,

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,680
the so-called horizontal or sector-neutral
policies.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,900
What distinguishes a smart specialization
policy

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,900
is its complexity
and the fact that it can't offer

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,040
a single, standard solution
because it must take into account the specificities

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,270
of the priority areas which are selected.
I like to say it is "haute couture"

9
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,190
rather than "ready-to-wear".
So it is expensive

10
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,820
and difficult to implement.
This complexity and specificity

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,720
involve a number of constraints and challenges
in terms of policy design

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,900
which I'll talk about now.
For decades

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,310
we've been searching for good policies
to stimulate structural change

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,680
that is to say, the transformation of structures
of an economy in a positive direction ;

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,220
diversification, modernization
emergence of new industries.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,970
Until recently
preferred policies, particularly in Europe

17
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,320
were called horizontal policies
that is to say policies

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,490
which focus on general conditions
and generic factors of innovation.

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,049
For instance:
public research infrastructure

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,079
or the financing of start-ups.
Problems that affect all businesses

21
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,479
like R & D costs
or intellectual property.

22
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,039
It is also about indirect policies
as those about training or immigration

23
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,509
The instruments of such policy are classical
:

24
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,139
R & D grant, tax credit,
refundable loan

25
00:01:32,139 --> 00:01:37,689
but also organizations and platforms
that address generic problems.

26
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:42,459
All companies are involved
whatever their sector of activity.

27
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:45,600
These policies thus avoid
preferential interventions,

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,289
the targeting of such and such technology
area.

29
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:53,119
This is why they are called
sector-neutral policies

30
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,560
There certainly were exceptions :
cluster policies

31
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,279
in favor of the new LÃ¤nder
just after the reunification of Germany

32
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:04,310
or competitiveness poles in France.
But horizontal policies

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,999
dominate the landscape in Europe
and beyond for decades.

34
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:12,580
This is a commendable policy,
it helps improve key elements

35
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,660
of the innovation system
and minimizes the risks of distortion

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,220
inherants to any policy
which selects projects

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,640
by sectors or technologies.
And such a policy can lead

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,920
to structural change
through well known mechanisms,

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,790
spotted for example by my colleagues
Ron Boschma and Koen Frenken.

40
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,810
The ability of companies to diversify,
the dynamics leading

41
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,390
to the creation of new companies,
networking and mobility of people,

42
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,780
particularly from the outside of a region.
These horizontal policies

43
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,100
have worked rather well
particularly in the case of the most advanced

44
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,680
regional or national economies.
In these ones

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,220
the positive structural change
can be stimulated through the only virtues

46
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,500
of horizontal policies
and companies respond positively

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,280
to the incentives produced
by the proper functioning of the framework

48
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,170
conditions.
However, these policies have not allowed

49
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,270
the least developed regions and countries
to progress much.

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,170
Why did this not work too well
in a number of regions

51
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:13,000
whereas important resources
were allocated in

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,990
the framework of the cohesion policies
dedicated to R & D and innovation?

53
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,330
That is the question that must be asked.
Innovation in most cases

54
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,570
not only requires
that the general conditions of the economy

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,760
work well.
To get the basic right </ i>.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,940
Innovation not only requires
that public research infrastructures

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,280
be funded and developed.
But it also requires specific capacities

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,660
and resources:
research, services, skills

59
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,520
platforms, suppliers.
It therefore demands a critical size

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,810
so that these different resources
can be mobilized.

61
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,210
It demands scale and
agglomeration effects, relational density.

62
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,730
Innovation is therefore based
on rich and sufficient in size

63
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,900
local innovation systems.
And these systems are specific

64
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,819
to each sector or each technology.
In the more developed regions,

65
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:04,790
these specific capabilities
are provided thanks to the wealth

66
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,010
of ecosystem of innovation.
Large companies, top universities,

67
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,740
other public or private actors
provide these capacities

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,350
in the form of spillovers
of their own research activities,

69
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,190
training, technological diffusion.
These spillovers represent

70
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,410
these complementary capacities
of which SMEs can benefit

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,340
even if they have not contributed to their
production.

72
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,210
In other regions
as Suzan Berger explains

73
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,660
in her beautiful book "Making in America",
the sources of these capabilities have dried

74
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,720
or have never existed.
Gaping holes exist in ecosystems

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,580
"SMEs are home alone," she says
speaking of many

76
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,470
regions of her country.
They are isolated and without

77
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,020
these complementary capacities
so important for innovation.

78
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,740
Even startups with generous fundings
and an excellent innovative idea

79
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,630
cannot do everything at home
and require these additional capacities.

80
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,740
Suppliers, skilled workers
engineers, expertise:

81
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,540
the ecosystem is too poor
to provide all that.

82
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,150
Some local ecosystems have degraded
because those providing complementary capacities

83
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,790
no longer do.
A consequence of offshoring

84
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,930
and of the new governance logics
of large companies.

85
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,350
Other ecosystems have not degraded
but have remained very poor.

86
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,540
This poverty of the ecosystems
is a problem for the less developed regions

87
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,100
that can't solve a policy
limited to horizontal measures.

88
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,810
But it is also a problem
in the case of advanced regions

89
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,940
where very often there is only a small number
of ecosystems capable of functioning properly.

90
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,710
In the greater part of an economy
of an advanced region,

91
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,230
firms are also "home alone".
This analysis suggests

92
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,520
that in many areas
policies must break

93
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,460
the dogma of neutrality
and horizontality

94
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,360
because structural changes
will not emerge spontaneously

95
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,640
from a "simple" improvement
of framework conditions.

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,230
The government must do more
that is to say support

97
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,120
the formation of local innovation systems
which are specific for each field

98
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
or each sector
and which is not only reduced

99
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,419
to public research
but include all additional capacities.

100
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:09,110
But we are left now
in another part of the policies space.

101
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,900
We left the sector-neutral
policies part

102
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,639
to join the part of the policies
that attach to provide specific capacities

103
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,889
to serve specific activities.
As Haussman

104
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,699
and Rodrik say,
this move is inevitable. They write:

105
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,580
"It is an illusion to believe </ i>
that the Government could disengage </ i>

106
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,210
from specific policies </ i>
and limit itself to neutral policies; </ i>

107
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,610
an illusion which is produced </ i>
by the misunderstanding of the specificity

108
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,850
</ i>
and the complexity of input factors </ i>

109
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:41,490
and required capacities for innovation "</ i>.
The problem is the difficulty of this policy.

110
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,340
Each sector, each domain is specific
and it is therefore about very expensive policies

111
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,010
in terms of implementation, coordination
provision of specific capabilities.

112
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,320
Support the development
of biotech applications

113
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,040
applied to fisheries and marine resource management
involves providing different capacities

114
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,889
from those required
for the development of advanced

115
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,960
manufacturing technologies
in the case of the food industry.

116
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,669
Very different from those that allow
the development of energetic efficiency solutions

117
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:13,199
in the automotive field.
We could of course use

118
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,740
the same instruments
as the horizontal policy

119
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,650
while targeting beneficiaries.
Research tax credit

120
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,320
only for green technologies
and R & D grants

121
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,449
only for food companies
which adopt information technologies.

122
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,600
However, this type of targeting
is practically very difficult

123
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,699
and poses almost insoluble problems
of definition of industries borders.

124
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,169
Who is in? Who's out?
Who does what ? It's very complicated.

125
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,270
So a non-neutral policy
will rather seek to provide

126
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,370
specific complementary capabilities
that only interest companies

127
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,110
that are really engaged in a certain area.
Such policy oriented

128
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,389
towards the formation of complementary capabilities
and the concentration of resources

129
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,351
in specific areas
must take into account this specificity

130
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,729
and this complexity.
And this has a cost

131
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,960
This is the cost of "haute couture"
compared to the "ready-to-wear".

132
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,350
R&D tax credit
is a "ready-to-wear" instrument.

133
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,910
Of course it is expensive
in terms of tax loss

134
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,580
but the implementation is relatively easy.
On the other side,

135
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,960
providing specific capacities
in such and such technological area

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,139
is much more expensive and difficult:
"haute couture"!

137
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,540
Numerous economists are skeptical
about the ability of a government

138
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,130
to master such complexity
which requires a detailed understanding

139
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,009
of needs in such areas
and complementarities

140
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,850
between different types of investment.
A famous development economist

141
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,110
Matsuyama said for example
that one thing is to develop a theory

142
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,270
of economic coordination mechanisms,
another is to develop useful tools

143
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:43,630
to build a policy
aiming to address these problems effectively.

144
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,020
This skepticism is justified.
A minimalist solution

145
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,740
is to recognize that the Government
cannot do everything

146
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,510
and meet all the specific needs
and attempt to solve

147
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,700
all the coordination problems
in all the parts of its economy.

148
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,440
It must make choices.
It is not that choices are desirable,

149
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,270
they are simply unavoidable
as Haussman and Rodrik say.

150
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,290
And we have already said it,
we join the first argument

151
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,490
in favor of a certain specialization:
"a region should not be doing a little bit

152
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,120
of everything".
This was an argument

153
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,060
of scale, of critical mass.
The argument of political feasibility

154
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,290
related to the limited capacity of the Government
is added.

155
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,230
However,
choosing between different areas

156
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,460
to conduct preferential actions
faces a second wave of skepticism.

157
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,740
Well formulated for example
by Anne Krueger.

158
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,950
it's a long quote
that concludes with "allocating resources

159
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,480
preferentially
so that some kinds of activities

160
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,890
will benefit from excellent infrastructures
and others won't;

161
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,120
this appears as a distortion. "
These different types of skepticism

162
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,350
are certainly justified
and we can share the opinion of those economists.

163
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,670
But where most economists
decide to give up

164
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,510
and return to the space
of neutral policies

165
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,670
where there is no choice to make
between areas, sectors,

166
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,910
the approach of smart specialization
does not give up the non-neutral policies

167
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,330
but open a new perspective.
Certainly there are potential risks

168
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,860
but the question is not to know whether
we will do this policy

169
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,820
but rather how to do it
to minimize the risks.

170
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,550
Skepticism must be our motivation
to be closely interested

171
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,170
in the design of the policy
that is to say to the operating modes

172
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,320
that will help minimize
the issues raised

173
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,089
by a non-neutral policy
aiming to identify strategic areas

174
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,290
to carry on preferential actions.
In the policy space -

175
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,120
we are therefore in the part
of non-neutral policies -

176
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,870
and we can identify different logics
on the basis of "how to choose".

177
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,300
Who's deciding ? What level of aggregation?
In the previous module

178
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,600
we show
that the principle of self discovery is crucial

179
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,830
to avoid falling into the trap of the Government
who knows everything

180
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:44,709
and thus protects itself from unexpected
learning and the potential of surprise

181
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,010
that conceals entrepreneurial discovery.
We are not coming back to it

182
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:51,300
only to say that this opposition
between two ways of solving

183
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,899
the information problem
structures the space of non-neutral policies.

184
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,990
There is a long history of policies
establishing priorities in a top down way

185
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,710
by an omniscient government
which asks a bureaucratic committee to decide.

186
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,940
The methods of choice
can be very sophisticated.

187
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,029
However, they remain marked
by the technocratic illusion

188
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:10,770
that we can know everything ex ante.
The alternative

189
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:14,529
is therefore the principle of self discovery.
This subspace

190
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:17,700
is not only occupied
by the smart specialization strategy

191
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,140
but other approaches
claim such logic.

192
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,330
They also recognize the importance
of strategic choices

193
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,540
but these must be informed
by the entrepreneurial discovery process.

194
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,990
This is the case of development policies
by Haussman and Rodrik.

195
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,430
We can thus discern
a familiarity of goals

196
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,800
and approaches between these approaches
which certainly have different objectives

197
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,350
but try to reconcile the fact
of being forced to choose, to specialize,

198
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,770
and the fact of promoting
an entrepreneurial dynamic.

199
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,060
As such, the smart specialization strategy
finds its place in what is called

200
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,029
new industrial policies :
non-neutral policies

201
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,320
where the design of the policy is central
to minimize the risks

202
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,870
linked to any policy action
aiming for preferential interventions

203
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,000
in areas defined as strategic.
