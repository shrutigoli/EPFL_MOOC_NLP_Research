1
00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:10,040
For a long time, there is a debate
to know whether the regions have an interest

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,690
to specialize
or rather to diversify.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,980
There are positive arguments on both sides
and the empirical literature

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,840
could never produce a final findings on this
issue.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,710
The reason is probably
that both logics are important

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,140
and must be reconciled.
This reconciliation is at the heart of the

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,410
concept
of smart specialization strategy.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,439
We can see in fact
that a smart specialization strategy

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,129
does not really push
to specialization in the classical sense.

10
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,170
When we see this pattern
we realize that the objective

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,170
is the generation of new options
and new opportunities

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,960
to diversify and transform structures.
However we also know

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,090
that for these options to be viable and effective
we must concentrate resources,

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,569
form capacities.
In short, one must "specialize"

15
00:00:54,569 --> 00:00:59,819
in new activities that have been selected.
Thus, the smart specialization strategy

16
00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:04,350
reconciles diversification and specialization.
We specialize in activities

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,640
that diversify structures.
This is a first proposition,

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,530
the diversification is favorable to innovation
and to structural change

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,810
when it is accompanied by the formation
of new critical masses

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,250
and is therefore not synonymous with scattering
and dispersion of projects and capacities.

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,460
A close proposition
is that variety is especially favorable

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,219
for innovation and development
when that variety is technologically connected

23
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,770
to existing structures.
Looking back at all the cases

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,789
of spontaneous dynamic of entrepreneurial
discovery

25
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:41,219
and structural changes
that we had seen during the first week,

26
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,590
most have basically the same structure
which is the development of a new activity

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,539
connected to an industry or two existing industries.
Thus the Lyon technical fabrics

28
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:58,200
come from the silk manufacturers and chemists.
The plastic molds of Marinia Grande,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,399
come from glass molding factories.
The development of nanotechnologies

30
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,060
is associated with the paper & pulp industry
in Finland.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,120
And even the eyewear cluster of Morez
comes from a nail factory.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,420
Diversification refers here
to economies of scope,

33
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,690
that is to say the possibility of redeploying
production tools

34
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,080
to target a new market.
Whilst transition and modernization

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,620
rather refer to spillovers,
that is to say to the integration of new technologies

36
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,780
in a traditional sector
which allows to develop a new activity.

37
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,250
All these cases illustrate
that the entrepreneurial discovery

38
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,959
and the process of structural change
often follow a logic of related varieties.

39
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,610
This concept was formulated by Koen Frenken
and his co-authors to attempt to gather

40
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,459
the arguments in favor of specialization
and the arguments in favor of diversity.

41
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,920
The process of structural change,
the most logical, the most common

42
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,370
is that of related diversification
and regions diversify

43
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,019
by plugging in to new industries
which are connected to local industries.

44
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:06,019
We go in the Lyon region,
from the silk and chemistry sectors to polymers

45
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:13,080
and technical fabrics, pharmacy,
equipment for extreme sports etc.

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,700
Of course, there are very important external
inputs

47
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,250
but this branching process
from local industries is central.

48
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,350
This logic is more likely to happen
than that of an unrelated diversification.

49
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,959
The smart specialization strategy
is essentially governed

50
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,370
by this principle of related varieties
this exploration of possibles adjacents

51
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,599
as Ricardo Hausmann says.
It's time to finish now

52
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:42,450
by situating our interpretation
of the concept of "specialization"

53
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,810
compared to more standard interpretations.
Specialization?

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,140
What does that mean
in the term "smart specialization"?

55
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,319
Most of the time
specialization refers to a relative measure:

56
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,959
if the share of this industry in the regional
economy

57
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,360
is stronger than the share of the same industry
in the national economy,

58
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,160
then the region is qualified a "specialized"
in this industry.

59
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,340
In some areas of economic life
relative measures can constitute

60
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,569
a good point of comparison.
For example in the health sector

61
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:13,760
or education.
But in the field of R & D and innovation,

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,230
what matters the most
are absolute values.

63
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:19,810
That's critical mass,
agglomeration of resources and

64
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:23,380
the assembling of capacities
that make the difference.

65
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,740
Relative performances
are not necessarily the panacea

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,860
because as already said
there are indivisibilities,

67
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,400
agglomeration and
critical mass effects.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,850
Take the example of Upper Austria,
the region of Linz.

69
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,800
A region of strong industrial tradition
in the fields of mechanics and machines

70
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,270
and that happens to be in a strong relationship
with much larger neighbours

71
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,060
as Bavaria or Baden-Würtemberg.
One of my students, Monica Coffano,

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,970
calculated the relative ​​and absolute
values of the specialization of Upper Austria

73
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,740
in electro-mechanics and optical fields
on the base of patent data.

74
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,060
From a "relative specialisation" point of
view

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,410
we see that Upper Austria
is highly specialized

76
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,039
in electro-mechanics and optical.
These are all the small yellow bars

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
which extend to the right
and show that this region

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,979
is specialized in these areas
relatively to other Austrian regions.

79
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,660
And besides, the fact that the yellow bars
are larger

80
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,229
than the other coloured bars
shows that this relative specialization

81
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:28,900
is often higher
than the other regions taken as a comparison

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,500
like Baden-Würtemberg
Bavaria, Flanders, Piedmont.

83
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,750
So a large specialization
in some electro-technical fields

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,960
which would place it at first European rank
ahead of Bavaria or Baden-Würtemberg.

85
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,800
But when we go to absolute measures
still on patent data,

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,370
this region, without wanting to offend it,
becomes a dwarf against giants

87
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,990
such as Bavaria.
And from R&D efficiency,

88
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,919
and innovation point of view,
from creativity point of view

89
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,341
it is this second measure that counts
because it captures critical mass

90
00:06:05,341 --> 00:06:10,750
and agglomeration effects.
Thus, the fact that a region

91
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,960
has a smart specialization strategy
should not be understood

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,780
as an indication that this region
is specialized in the considered field,

93
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,069
in a passive sense
relative to other regions.

94
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:23,850
But we must understand that it involves
building capacities,

95
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,470
skills and other factors
to develop a transformative activity.

96
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,580
This does not mean
that there will be no effect

97
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,849
of this strategy on relative specializations.
There will probably be some without doubt,

98
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,669
logically,
but only in the long term

99
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,470
and this is not the most important.
This module has proposed an overview

100
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,000
of the relationships between diversification
and specialization

101
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,020
and has positioned the concept
of smart specialization strategy within this

102
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,340
framework.
We made 3 propositions.

103
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,440
First, the diversification is favorable to
innovation

104
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,870
and structural change,
when accompanied by the formation of new critical

105
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,199
masses
and is not synonymous with scattering

106
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,750
and dispersion of projects and capacities.
Secondly,

107
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,729
the variety is especially favorable to innovation
and development,

108
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:09,380
when that variety is connected
to existing structures.

109
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,919
Finally, the measures of specialization in
relative terms

110
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,300
will not allow to capture
a smart specialization dynamics.

111
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,551
We will offer other methods of measurement
during the next week.
