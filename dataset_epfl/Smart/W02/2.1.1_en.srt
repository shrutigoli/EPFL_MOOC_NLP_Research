1
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:13,070
In this module, we will ask what is the relevance
of smart specialization strategy

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,250
In the age of global value chains or GVCs.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,590
We show that this relevance is not challenged.

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,210
Building local capacities and the development
of transformation activities

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,750
are a key asset for the management of the
future, particularly in front of hazards

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,369
and risks caused by certain forms of governance
of global value chains.

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,710
Let's allow the economists of international
trade,

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,150
who question the need to train local industries
in the second age of globalization, speak

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,150
first.

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:45,940
Keith Maskus, which incidentally is also
an excellent economist of innovation

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,970
tells us: "It is not clear whether in today's
economy increasingly

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,409
dominated by global production chains,
it makes any sense to even try to encourage

13
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:57,909
the establishment of local industries
in particular areas."

14
00:00:57,909 --> 00:00:59,790
A stone in our garden!

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,900
The most extreme version of this contestation
is provided

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,610
by Charles Baldwin.

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,720
Baldwin theorizes the coming of a new phase
of globalization

18
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,120
which he calls the "second unbundling".

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,280
Thanks to new information and communication
technology,

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,630
production stages, once assembled on the same
site,

21
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,390
can be decoupled within regional areas.

22
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,970
The competition now takes place at the production
stage

23
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,940
rather than at the sector.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,100
What matters to a region is not to create
a complete industry,

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,000
but that companies take position at a particular
stage of production

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,130
and thanks to this positioning, progress,
learn and acquire

27
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,260
new skills fast.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,020
Baldwin concludes that there is no reason
to spend 30 years of effort

29
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,620
on the establishment of a new industry, like
South Korea did

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,440
with the automotive industry.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,280
"Joining a global value chain could create
advanced manufacturing activity

32
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,480
in a developing nation in a matter of months.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
"he wrote.

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,909
But what Baldwin said is easily digestible
by the theory of smart specialisation.

35
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:12,840
The industrialization or economic diversification,
is probably less "lumpy".

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,310
That is to say: it is less compact and less
indivisible than yesterday,

37
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,930
and therefore, industrial policy or “smart
specialization”

38
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,849
should not necessarily aim to create a complete
industry.

39
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:29,819
That is why - you recognize this diagram that
we saw during the first week -

40
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,370
smart specialization is not aimed at sectoral
specialization,

41
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,799
a sector that we would take 20 years to build.

42
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:43,290
But the goal is the development of new activities,
or specialties, located at a finer level of

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,530
aggregation.

44
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,690
Ultimately, no one discusses the value of
forming local capacity,

45
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,819
not to cover an entire industry, but to be
in a better position

46
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,249
in front of global value chains at a particular
stage of production.

47
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:00,640
We see it very well by comparing what happened
in two regions specialized in the production

48
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
of shoes.

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's start with the Sinos Valley, in Brazil.

50
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,230
In this region lived a set of small shoes
companies

51
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,200
for the domestic market.

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,519
These companies will transform when US buyers
push for high-volume production,

53
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,730
leading to business growth and stimulates
their evolution

54
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,519
in terms of quality standards and process
innovation.

55
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,669
However, these companies will never go very
high in the value chain,

56
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,059
the logistics and the design remaining the
privilege of US buyers.

57
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:40,989
And the danger of this situation is evident
when Chinese producers barge in and offer

58
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,290
products
that are cheaper than Brazilian products on

59
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,780
the US market.

60
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,430
The Brazilian cluster is swept aside.

61
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,069
This means that the positioning in a global
value chain

62
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,590
is in no way a guarantee to evolve and transform.

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,650
There are of course more positive cases
but the main lesson is that the ability to

64
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:08,389
learn and develop new skills
thanks to the membership of a global value

65
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:11,030
chain
depends on how the latter is governed by the

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,409
final purchaser.

67
00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:17,489
It can also depend on strategic actions,
on an innovation policy conducted to ensure

68
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:19,440
the development of capacities.

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,199
And it is Baldwin himself who wonders
if the Brazilian Government should not have

70
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:30,660
encouraged and helped shoe production
businesses to diversify, to go up market.

71
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,920
We find here the idea of ​​smart specialization.

72
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:40,430
The smart specialization which, in the same
industry, gave much more positive results,

73
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,740
is the case of Portugal.

74
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:50,509
From the 2000s, the Portuguese shoe industry
is strongly affected by competition

75
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,379
from low-cost countries like China.

76
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:57,409
I owe this story to Jose Caldeira, an expert
on innovation

77
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,009
in the manufacturing industry in Portugal.

78
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:04,930
In Portugal, there are resources to be mobilized
to launch a collective action

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,840
in the field of modernization of the sector.

80
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,270
The technological University of Porto,
companies specializing in production technologies,

81
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,689
and software development companies.

82
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:23,460
Finally, some major shoe industry brands,
well positioned in terms of design and marketing.

83
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:29,840
In this context, a vast operation of entrepreneurial
discovery is coordinated

84
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,259
and supported by the public agency for innovation.

85
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:38,240
This is to develop advanced production technologies,
to establish flexible production

86
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,490
which will effectively produce small series
of differentiated products

87
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,389
and of high intensity design.

88
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:51,409
The promises of this new field are very big,
so much so that we quickly tip over to the

89
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,930
growth of a new speciality,
at the intersection of the shoe industry and

90
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,370
advanced
production technologies, which will lead to

91
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,410
a major structural transformation.

92
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,889
Undoubtedly, the process of entrepreneurial
discovery,

93
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,310
you recognize that diagram that we saw during
the 1st week,

94
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,620
this process was not carried out to the letter,
but the spirit is there:

95
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,110
a strategic area is identified,
coordinated projects are stimulated,

96
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,750
so that a transformative new activity emerges
and grows.

97
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,389
This is an almost ideal case as we discern
well the process by which

98
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,909
the Government led to the opening and exploring
of a new area,

99
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,539
by supporting the development and integration
of local capacities,

100
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,759
to facilitate the transition to a new specialty.

101
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:44,919
We also see how smart specialization is a
response

102
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:48,949
to a potential crisis caused by unbridled
competition on costs.

103
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,879
Thanks to this smart specialization, part
of the shoe industry

104
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,590
in northern Portugal generated new competitive
advantages

105
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:02,379
based on design and flexible production
which ranks it today in the 1st rank in Europe.

106
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,400
So there is nothing embarrassing in Baldwin's
words,

107
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,530
and other economists of international trade.

108
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,919
From the moment we also recognize the end
of sectoral strategies,

109
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,550
based on this notion of lesser compactness
or lesser indivisibility

110
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:24,409
of industrialization and diversification process,
and the need to build local capacities at

111
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,110
a finer level of aggregation,
to develop transformative activities that

112
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,349
will,
ultimately, allow companies to be better positioned.

113
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:37,389
The smart specialization strategy is a way
to regain control,

114
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:39,030
against the global value chains.
