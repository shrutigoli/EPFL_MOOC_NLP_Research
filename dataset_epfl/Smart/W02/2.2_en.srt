1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,790
In this module,
we wish to challenge a misconception,

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,309
which is quite persistent.

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:14,519
This idea would be that smart specialization
strategy,

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,980
is good for the richest and strongest regions.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,099
Not at all.

6
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:23,490
Although these regions, will use it profitably,
especially to correct their weaknesses,

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,820
the logic of the smart specialization strategy
is also required in the case of least developed

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,099
regions
or transition regions.

9
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,710
We know where this error comes from.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,530
The neoclassical microeconomics of knowledge
of Ken Arrow until Partha Dasgupta,

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,230
an elegant and even fascinating theory
which explains that

12
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,010
knowledge does not need to be produced more
than once

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,649
since this piece of knowledge can be reused
indefinitely

14
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,100
and never be degraded by this use.

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,360
Unlike a physical good.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,640
By going a little fast, we can then say that
some large research and innovation centres

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,410
will suffice
to produce the most sophisticated knowledge

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,690
which would then be used everywhere.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,770
It is more reasonable
for regions non-selected as hyper centres

20
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,130
to abandon the economy of knowledge and innovation
to indulge in other activities of production

21
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,740
and services.

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,470
In this perspective,
why would Galicia do biotechnologies?

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,470
And why do we develop research
in Information Technology in Crete

24
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:33,830
while global hubs, Silicon Valley or Zürich
or a few others exist to do so

25
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,750
probably more effectively?

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,160
In these conditions,
no need for smart specialization

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,770
for most areas.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,959
But if this theory is based on a relevant
argument-

29
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,920
"Knowledge is not destroyed by use"-
it leads to false prescriptions.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,720
Certainly a piece of knowledge
does not need to be produced more than once.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,100
The problem is that there is
An infinite number of knowledge pieces to

32
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,440
produce
which will have a particular value in socio-economic,

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:06,630
sectoral, geographical, climatic contexts,
which are specific.

34
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,220
It is in front of this huge number
of potentially achievable knowledge

35
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,600
and that will never be produced by Silicon
Valley

36
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,940
that the smart specialization strategy of
a region

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,210
makes sense because this region is probably
well placed

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,970
to produce some of this knowledge.

39
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,430
The essential point is that,
as Manuel Trajtenberg says regarding innovation:

40
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,560
"There is not only one game in town".

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,710
There are different orders in innovation.

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:38,200
We can radically invent at the technological
frontier

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,600
and commercialize radically new technologies,
methods and products.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,920
But we can also innovate in other ways.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,100
Generate “innovational complementarities”
to transform traditional sectors,

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:58,740
Diversify and conquer a new market,
and by adapting and transforming capabilities,

47
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,230
innovate in this way.

48
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,400
These types of innovation are less bright
than breakthrough innovation

49
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,750
but they will be the key mechanism
of economic growth in many regions.

50
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,510
It is still Trajtenberg who writes:
"Innovation should be widely distributed

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,319
over the whole spectrum of economic activities,
that is across sectors

52
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:20,810
(not just high tech)
and types of innovations

53
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,380
(not just formal
research and development)."

54
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,120
The theory behind this idea:
"There is not only one game in town"

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,690
is closely associated with the concept of
general purpose technology

56
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,400
that economists like Bresnahan and Trajtenberg
developed.

57
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,700
General purpose technologies, such as steam
engine,

58
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,910
the dynamo and the computer, today the information
technology

59
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,520
or biotechnologies give a role to play
to all regions, not just to the leader.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,430
Indeed, a specificity of general purpose technologies
is horizontal and intersectoral diffusion

61
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,140
thanks to the development of applications
specific to different sectors

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,000
and the complementarity between fundamental
invention

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,810
of these technologies and application development
in user sectors.

64
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,459
The characteristic of a general objective
technology

65
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,600
is to be relevant for the whole economy
thanks to the multiple applications that are

66
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
developed.

67
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,620
We will say that it generates externalities
or spillovers

68
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,770
in the form of multiple applications
that enable innovation in many sectors.

69
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,110
In economics, we will say that the fundamental
inventions

70
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,260
of a general purpose technology
extend the frontiers of invention possibilities

71
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,380
for the whole economy
whereas the development of applications

72
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,950
changes the production function of particular
sectors .

73
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,620
Trajtenberg, again, writes:
"Although mostly dealing with local industries,

74
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,440
these innovations based on the co-invention
of applications of a general purpose technology

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,070
will ultimately impact the productivity
of a wide range of sectors in the local economy."

76
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,550
And when things evolve favorably,
there is therefore a general dynamics of the

77
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,290
general purpose technology
which can be spatially distributed

78
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,960
between regions specialized in fundamental
inventions

79
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,730
and regions specialized in the development
of applications.

80
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:15,300
Here is an example of spatial distribution
of the dynamic of a general purpose technology.

81
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,870
It is limited to one country only, but of
course, in reality,

82
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,210
this spatial distribution will usually be
global.

83
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,340
On the map, whilst radical inventions are
made,

84
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,350
for example in Helsinki, in the field
of information and communication technologies

85
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,470
the co-invention of applications will happen
:

86
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,380
in Oulu, in the field
of green information technology applied to

87
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,070
the mining sector,
in northern Finland,

88
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,870
For the forest and pulp and paper industry,
and on the coast, finally,

89
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,740
For what concerns the management of marine
resources.

90
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,120
And so Finland
is full with high-tech

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,860
but high-tech connected to local industries.

92
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,419
This framework suggests that every region
has a role to play

93
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:03,770
in the knowledge economy, the leaders and
the followers.

94
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,449
A critic of the smart specialization strategy
can then be formulated.

95
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,540
But you lock the followers
in a position that they can never leave.

96
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,540
They will forever remain followers
waiting for fundamental inventions from outside

97
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,510
to develop their own applications.

98
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,740
The answer is that
thanks to the smart specialization strategy,

99
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,910
we go at least from a position of "bad follower"
to a position of "good follower."

100
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,510
A region capable of co-inventing applications
to transform its structures.

101
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,520
That is to say capable of absorbing
the externalities produced by fundamental

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
inventions.

103
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,010
For this, we must form local capacities
and these clusters of competences.

104
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,889
We have already seen many examples in this
course.

105
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,740
Biotechnologies for marine resources,
the information technologies for tourism and

106
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,770
cultural heritage conservation,
nanotechnologies for the food industry.

107
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,509
Admittedly, smart specialization doesn't have
any magical properties

108
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,919
that would transform Galicia or Crete
into a new Silicon Valley or a new Zürich!

109
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,320
But the smart specialization strategy
allows at least a less advanced region

110
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,550
to position itself as a "good follower"
that is to say a region capable of allocating

111
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,830
resources
for research and innovation,

112
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,050
to realize at hom,
the potential for innovation offered

113
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,199
by radical inventions produced elsewhere.

114
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,229
A "good follower" and the firms that make
up

115
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:32,810
the considered innovation system
are capable to define a competition area

116
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,240
in which participants, some other regions,
are relatively equals in terms of capacity

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,150
and resources,
and are capable to create a viable market

118
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,550
niche
that will not be rapidly destroyed by the

119
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,950
entry of external competitors.

120
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:52,050
The regions concerned by this market niche
will compete of course

121
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,270
but they should also exploit the potential
of cooperation

122
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,940
and circulation of skills and knowledge.

123
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,509
Can a good follower become a leader?

124
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:02,509
Certainly yes.

125
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,740
But not a leader in the invention of a general
purpose technology,

126
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,039
rather in an application associated to a particular
sector.

127
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,009
Finally, a "good follower" creates "co-specialized"
assets

128
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,800
that is to say that the regions
with a smart specialization strategy

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,680
and the human capabilities that are formed
on site

130
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,500
mutually need each other.

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,040
This reduces, remember,
the famous "Midwest syndrome" risk -

132
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,630
young graduates who leave the region,
as we saw during the first week.

133
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,899
Here's a final example of a set of regions
characterized by an important fishing and

134
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,079
exploitation of marine resources sector.

135
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:43,829
There is a potential for innovation to achieve
for each of them

136
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:49,529
and a transformative activity to develop
on the basis of information and communication

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:53,220
technologies
to modernize their industry.

138
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,149
These areas are certainly in competition
in some markets,

139
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,490
but the similarity and specificity of their
strategic area

140
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,959
also draws a space for cooperation and circulation
of knowledge and skills,

141
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,889
a space that can allow each of these regions
to progress faster towards the desired structural

142
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,679
change.

143
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,050
So there is an important relation
between smart specialization strategy

144
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,139
as a dynamic that aims to build innovation
capacities

145
00:09:21,139 --> 00:09:26,230
to change the structures and the opportunities
offered by general purpose technologies

146
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,009
in every region.

147
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:32,290
Other dynamics of innovation are possible
to guide smart specialization

148
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,009
but the dynamics of the general purpose technology
is certainly central

149
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,110
because it provides opportunities to all.
