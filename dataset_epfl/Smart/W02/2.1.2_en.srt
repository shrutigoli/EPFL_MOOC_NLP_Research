1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,880
We've just said that, in the second age of
globalization,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,630
it still seemed relevant to build local capacities
for the development of new transformative

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,150
activities.
Let's now spend five minutes on this notion

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,420
of "local".
We talked of scale,

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,269
critical mass, innovation system, agglomeration.
We have not yet said that these structures

6
00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:27,329
also have to be
physically located on a certain territory.

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:30,070
There are a lot of agglomeration phenomena
on the net.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,930
And it is even fairly easy to build. But this
is not enough.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,820
A critical mass can be virtual
and many relationships between agents can

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,290
be remotely established indeed.
Why is it then recommended to have localized

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,160
capabilities
on a territory

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,230
and linked by some
physical proximity?

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,330
The general idea is that the co-location of
firms,

14
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,420
research partners, skilled workers
and other resources, constitute

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,460
an important engine for innovation.
So there is

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,080
an economic gain to encourage the formation
of local innovation capacities.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,110
We can, following the economist Marianne Feldmann,
give a critical explanation.

18
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,929
Spatial proximity
enhances the flow of knowledge,

19
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:14,499
information, new ideas and facilitates
cognitive interactions.

20
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:17,840
The key explanation is that the knowledge
needed for innovation,

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,549
as well as for relationships between partners,
have an important tacit dimension.

22
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,200
We cannot write everything
and codify everything,

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,329
so that everything could be done remotely.
We must meet and talk to understand each other

24
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:34,030
and for knowledge to combine and integrate.
Physical proximity allows all of this

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,299
much better than the virtual worlds. It facilitates
communication,

26
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:41,270
increases unforeseen and surprising encounters
probabilities

27
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,950
that can lead to new ideas
and also the opportunity to build social relationships,

28
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,740
themselves conducive to the circulation of
ideas.

29
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,179
Let's also observe the nature of the connections
between a company

30
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:56,340
and additional capacities, research,
services, training or users

31
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,109
which are needed to innovate.
The company can obviously establish distance

32
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:02,420
relationships
but physical proximity

33
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,329
offers opportunities for observation,
interaction and mutual learning.

34
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,090
From this explanation,
it appears that the innovative performances

35
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,890
not only result of the individual effort
but also the quality of the immediate environment,

36
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,920
characterized by a certain density of relationships
and physical proximity

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,030
to certain key institutions.
We also observe that this effect of physical

38
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,260
proximity
on the quality of interactions between agents

39
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,150
is even stronger when companies belong to
the same industry

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,390
or related industries.
Finally, it should be noted that the co-location

41
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,459
of capabilities
and people has dynamic virtues,

42
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,140
which allow the growth and enrichment of the
agglomeration

43
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,500
of resources.
A territory can evolve, grow, diversify

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,890
thanks to different types of virtuous circles
arising from this physical proximity.

45
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,540
For example, it is more interesting to settle
somewhere

46
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,780
when the density of connections increases.
This produces a classic phenomenon

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,590
of self-reinforcing and tipping point.
The more firms there are,

48
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,420
the more possibilities of connections,
of recombinations and surprising encounters.

49
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,110
In addition, the increasing number of firms
on a site

50
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,260
strengthens factor markets - skilled workers,
specialized services -

51
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,310
as well as research infrastructures.
In other words, the fact that businesses are

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,989
located somewhere
will increase the attraction of this "somewhere"

53
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,080
and the likelihood
that others come too.

54
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,709
The works of Brian Arthur
that analyze the effects of positive feedback

55
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,620
on location
were pioneers in this field by highlighting

56
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,459
the strength
and the persisting influence of small events

57
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,769
or historical accidents
that arise very early in history

58
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,819
and influence the final result in terms of
agglomeration

59
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,099
and relational density.
But if a simple increase of the number of

60
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:43,450
firms has virtuous properties
of self-reinforcing, other factors are also

61
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,950
important
to magnify the effects of physical proximity.

62
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,870
Some economists - Agrawal and Cockburn
in particular -

63
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,930
identify empirically dynamic elements
creating virtuous circles

64
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,760
within the local innovation system.
These are important results that we should

65
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,849
know before designing
a smart specialization strategy

66
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,079
and initiate policies
to promote the growth of a new business

67
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,480
in a certain area of ​​specialization.
We can first mention the virtuous role of

68
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,840
large enterprises
who do R & D

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,450
in a particular area of ​​specialization
and create many positive externalities

70
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,750
in favour of the other actors operating in
the same field.

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,550
They strengthen for example the research of
local Universities,

72
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,250
facilitate the growth of factor markets
and improvemarkets for technologies,

73
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,300
thanks to the relationships they have with
small businesses.

74
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,139
This is the theory of Anchor Tenant.
A powerful research university in certain

75
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,810
areas
is also a key factor in the agglomeration

76
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,250
dynamic
and spatial concentration.

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,030
It enables the advancement of knowledge in
these fields,

78
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,199
the training of the people
who will then be innovators in the private

79
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,830
sector,
the undertaking of problem-solving activities

80
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,500
in collaboration with the industry
and finally, the creation of new firms.

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,940
Firms of different sizes are also an important
asset

82
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,020
for the dynamic agglomeration.
Large firms, we have just said it,

83
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,030
produce externalities that benefit the immediate
environment.

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,460
They also create spin-offs
which, as a rule, are installed nearby.

85
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,340
Symmetrically, small firms produce external
effects,

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,850
by attracting specialized services
that they cannot internalize.

87
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,389
Both externalities, spin-offs of large firms
and third party services attracted by small

88
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,139
ones,
complement each other and create a virtuous

89
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,980
spiral of agglomeration
and strengthening of the relational density.

90
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,560
The agglomeration of diverse institutions
(enterprises, research, finance, services)

91
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,229
can create forms of learning,
Based on synergy and hybridization

92
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:37,620
thanks to institutional mobility of people,
Which is made easy by physical proximity.

93
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,900
Finally,
a site, a territory

94
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,539
has memory.
The mobility of economic agents, the fact

95
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:47,860
that they leave a territory
does not necessarily mean a net loss of knowledge.

96
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,320
Those who are going keep their social relationships
with those who remain and therefore continue

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,400
to collaborate.
They leave but are not forgotten.

98
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,810
We thus reach
the idea of rich and dynamic innovation local

99
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,830
system.
A system characterized by significant agglomeration

100
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,789
effects,
capable to provide all the additional resources

101
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:08,699
and likely to grow
by attracting new resources

102
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,840
thanks to the increase of the value to be
localized there.

103
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,259
A system we can leave
but that has memory.

104
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,319
The ultimate project of a smart specialization
strategy

105
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,180
is to generate this dynamic,
in a small number of strategic areas.

106
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,270
The idea of smart specialization, which highlights
the importance of building local capacities,

107
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,210
recognizes this economic value of physical
proximity

108
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,910
and territorial roots.
But beware!

109
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,169
This does not mean that the process must be
closed

110
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,759
and that the ambition of the strategy
is autarky. In fact, it is just the opposite

111
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,220
for it is by having strong local capabilities
that we will be able to take advantage of

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,620
external resources
which are still essential. In other words,

113
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,800
the problem is not so much for a peripheral
region to choose

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,080
between a strategy
of building local critical mass and local

115
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,100
interactions
and a connection strategy to the outside because

116
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,259
the two go together.
We must constitute

117
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,030
strong local capabilities
through smart specialization strategy

118
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,520
to be able to benefit more from global interactions.
It is therefore clear that the smart specialization

119
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,020
strategy,
the goal of building local capacities in some

120
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,740
areas,
should not be an excuse to ignore or snub

121
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,229
the global value chains,
the international investments realized on

122
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,300
its territory
and the external resources to the region.

123
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,759
The way a strategy must be lean on these elements
of globalization

124
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,780
is part of the operationalization of the concept.
Again, the aim is not autarky or isolation

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,919
towards the outside
nor towards international assets placed in

126
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,840
its territory.
On the contrary.

127
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,720
only a rich and strong local system
will benefit from these external elements.

128
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,259
Thank you!
