In this module, we will ask what is the relevance of smart specialization strategy
In the age of global value chains or GVCs.
We show that this relevance is not challenged.
Building local capacities and the development of transformation activities are a key asset for the management of the future, particularly in front of hazards and risks caused by certain forms of governance of global value chains.
Let's allow the economists of international trade, who question the need to train local industries in the second age of globalization, speak first.
Keith Maskus, which incidentally is also an excellent economist of innovation tells us: "It is not clear whether in today's economy increasingly dominated by global production chains, it makes any sense to even try to encourage the establishment of local industries in particular areas."
A stone in our garden!
The most extreme version of this contestation is provided by Charles Baldwin.
Baldwin theorizes the coming of a new phase of globalization which he calls the "second unbundling".
Thanks to new information and communication technology, production stages, once assembled on the same site, can be decoupled within regional areas.
The competition now takes place at the production stage rather than at the sector.
What matters to a region is not to create a complete industry, but that companies take position at a particular stage of production and thanks to this positioning, progress, learn and acquire new skills fast.
Baldwin concludes that there is no reason to spend 30 years of effort on the establishment of a new industry, like
South Korea did with the automotive industry.
"Joining a global value chain could create advanced manufacturing activity in a developing nation in a matter of months.
"he wrote.
But what Baldwin said is easily digestible by the theory of smart specialisation.
The industrialization or economic diversification, is probably less "lumpy".
That is to say: it is less compact and less indivisible than yesterday, and therefore, industrial policy or â€œsmart specializationâ€� should not necessarily aim to create a complete industry.
That is why - you recognize this diagram that we saw during the first week - smart specialization is not aimed at sectoral specialization, a sector that we would take 20 years to build.
But the goal is the development of new activities, or specialties, located at a finer level of aggregation.
Ultimately, no one discusses the value of forming local capacity, not to cover an entire industry, but to be in a better position in front of global value chains at a particular stage of production.
We see it very well by comparing what happened in two regions specialized in the production of shoes.
Let's start with the Sinos Valley, in Brazil.
In this region lived a set of small shoes companies for the domestic market.
These companies will transform when US buyers push for high-volume production, leading to business growth and stimulates their evolution in terms of quality standards and process innovation.
However, these companies will never go very high in the value chain, the logistics and the design remaining the privilege of US buyers.
And the danger of this situation is evident when Chinese producers barge in and offer products that are cheaper than Brazilian products on the US market.
The Brazilian cluster is swept aside.
This means that the positioning in a global value chain is in no way a guarantee to evolve and transform.
There are of course more positive cases but the main lesson is that the ability to learn and develop new skills thanks to the membership of a global value chain depends on how the latter is governed by the final purchaser.
It can also depend on strategic actions, on an innovation policy conducted to ensure the development of capacities.
And it is Baldwin himself who wonders if the Brazilian Government should not have encouraged and helped shoe production businesses to diversify, to go up market.
We find here the idea of â€‹â€‹smart specialization.
The smart specialization which, in the same industry, gave much more positive results, is the case of Portugal.
From the 2000s, the Portuguese shoe industry is strongly affected by competition from low-cost countries like China.
I owe this story to Jose Caldeira, an expert on innovation in the manufacturing industry in Portugal.
In Portugal, there are resources to be mobilized to launch a collective action in the field of modernization of the sector.
The technological University of Porto, companies specializing in production technologies, and software development companies.
Finally, some major shoe industry brands, well positioned in terms of design and marketing.
In this context, a vast operation of entrepreneurial discovery is coordinated and supported by the public agency for innovation.
This is to develop advanced production technologies, to establish flexible production which will effectively produce small series of differentiated products and of high intensity design.
The promises of this new field are very big, so much so that we quickly tip over to the growth of a new speciality, at the intersection of the shoe industry and advanced production technologies, which will lead to a major structural transformation.
Undoubtedly, the process of entrepreneurial discovery, you recognize that diagram that we saw during the 1st week, this process was not carried out to the letter, but the spirit is there: a strategic area is identified, coordinated projects are stimulated, so that a transformative new activity emerges and grows.
This is an almost ideal case as we discern well the process by which the Government led to the opening and exploring of a new area, by supporting the development and integration of local capacities, to facilitate the transition to a new specialty.
We also see how smart specialization is a response to a potential crisis caused by unbridled competition on costs.
Thanks to this smart specialization, part of the shoe industry in northern Portugal generated new competitive advantages based on design and flexible production which ranks it today in the 1st rank in Europe.
So there is nothing embarrassing in Baldwin's words, and other economists of international trade.
From the moment we also recognize the end of sectoral strategies, based on this notion of lesser compactness or lesser indivisibility of industrialization and diversification process, and the need to build local capacities at a finer level of aggregation, to develop transformative activities that will, ultimately, allow companies to be better positioned.
The smart specialization strategy is a way to regain control, against the global value chains.
