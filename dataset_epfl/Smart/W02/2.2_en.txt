In this module, we wish to challenge a misconception, which is quite persistent.
This idea would be that smart specialization strategy, is good for the richest and strongest regions.
Not at all.
Although these regions, will use it profitably, especially to correct their weaknesses, the logic of the smart specialization strategy is also required in the case of least developed regions or transition regions.
We know where this error comes from.
The neoclassical microeconomics of knowledge of Ken Arrow until Partha Dasgupta, an elegant and even fascinating theory which explains that knowledge does not need to be produced more than once since this piece of knowledge can be reused indefinitely and never be degraded by this use.
Unlike a physical good.
By going a little fast, we can then say that some large research and innovation centres will suffice to produce the most sophisticated knowledge which would then be used everywhere.
It is more reasonable for regions non-selected as hyper centres to abandon the economy of knowledge and innovation to indulge in other activities of production and services.
In this perspective, why would Galicia do biotechnologies?
And why do we develop research in Information Technology in Crete while global hubs, Silicon Valley or ZÃ¼rich or a few others exist to do so probably more effectively?
In these conditions, no need for smart specialization for most areas.
But if this theory is based on a relevant argument-
"Knowledge is not destroyed by use"- it leads to false prescriptions.
Certainly a piece of knowledge does not need to be produced more than once.
The problem is that there is
An infinite number of knowledge pieces to produce which will have a particular value in socio-economic, sectoral, geographical, climatic contexts, which are specific.
It is in front of this huge number of potentially achievable knowledge and that will never be produced by Silicon
Valley that the smart specialization strategy of a region makes sense because this region is probably well placed to produce some of this knowledge.
The essential point is that, as Manuel Trajtenberg says regarding innovation:
"There is not only one game in town".
There are different orders in innovation.
We can radically invent at the technological frontier and commercialize radically new technologies, methods and products.
But we can also innovate in other ways.
Generate â€œinnovational complementaritiesâ€� to transform traditional sectors,
Diversify and conquer a new market, and by adapting and transforming capabilities, innovate in this way.
These types of innovation are less bright than breakthrough innovation but they will be the key mechanism of economic growth in many regions.
It is still Trajtenberg who writes:
"Innovation should be widely distributed over the whole spectrum of economic activities, that is across sectors and types of innovations
(not just formal research and development)."
The theory behind this idea:
"There is not only one game in town" is closely associated with the concept of general purpose technology that economists like Bresnahan and Trajtenberg developed.
General purpose technologies, such as steam engine, the dynamo and the computer, today the information technology or biotechnologies give a role to play to all regions, not just to the leader.
Indeed, a specificity of general purpose technologies is horizontal and intersectoral diffusion thanks to the development of applications specific to different sectors and the complementarity between fundamental invention of these technologies and application development in user sectors.
The characteristic of a general objective technology is to be relevant for the whole economy thanks to the multiple applications that are developed.
We will say that it generates externalities or spillovers in the form of multiple applications that enable innovation in many sectors.
In economics, we will say that the fundamental inventions of a general purpose technology extend the frontiers of invention possibilities for the whole economy whereas the development of applications changes the production function of particular sectors .
Trajtenberg, again, writes:
"Although mostly dealing with local industries, these innovations based on the co-invention of applications of a general purpose technology will ultimately impact the productivity of a wide range of sectors in the local economy."
And when things evolve favorably, there is therefore a general dynamics of the general purpose technology which can be spatially distributed between regions specialized in fundamental inventions and regions specialized in the development of applications.
Here is an example of spatial distribution of the dynamic of a general purpose technology.
It is limited to one country only, but of course, in reality, this spatial distribution will usually be global.
On the map, whilst radical inventions are made, for example in Helsinki, in the field of information and communication technologies the co-invention of applications will happen in Oulu, in the field of green information technology applied to the mining sector, in northern Finland,
For the forest and pulp and paper industry, and on the coast, finally,
For what concerns the management of marine resources.
And so Finland is full with high-tech but high-tech connected to local industries.
This framework suggests that every region has a role to play in the knowledge economy, the leaders and the followers.
A critic of the smart specialization strategy can then be formulated.
But you lock the followers in a position that they can never leave.
They will forever remain followers waiting for fundamental inventions from outside to develop their own applications.
The answer is that thanks to the smart specialization strategy, we go at least from a position of "bad follower" to a position of "good follower."
A region capable of co-inventing applications to transform its structures.
That is to say capable of absorbing the externalities produced by fundamental inventions.
For this, we must form local capacities and these clusters of competences.
We have already seen many examples in this course.
Biotechnologies for marine resources, the information technologies for tourism and cultural heritage conservation, nanotechnologies for the food industry.
Admittedly, smart specialization doesn't have any magical properties that would transform Galicia or Crete into a new Silicon Valley or a new ZÃ¼rich!
But the smart specialization strategy allows at least a less advanced region to position itself as a "good follower" that is to say a region capable of allocating resources for research and innovation, to realize at hom, the potential for innovation offered by radical inventions produced elsewhere.
A "good follower" and the firms that make up the considered innovation system are capable to define a competition area in which participants, some other regions, are relatively equals in terms of capacity and resources, and are capable to create a viable market niche that will not be rapidly destroyed by the entry of external competitors.
The regions concerned by this market niche will compete of course but they should also exploit the potential of cooperation and circulation of skills and knowledge.
Can a good follower become a leader?
Certainly yes.
But not a leader in the invention of a general purpose technology, rather in an application associated to a particular sector.
Finally, a "good follower" creates "co-specialized" assets that is to say that the regions with a smart specialization strategy and the human capabilities that are formed on site mutually need each other.
This reduces, remember, the famous "Midwest syndrome" risk - young graduates who leave the region, as we saw during the first week.
Here's a final example of a set of regions characterized by an important fishing and exploitation of marine resources sector.
There is a potential for innovation to achieve for each of them and a transformative activity to develop on the basis of information and communication technologies to modernize their industry.
These areas are certainly in competition in some markets, but the similarity and specificity of their strategic area also draws a space for cooperation and circulation of knowledge and skills, a space that can allow each of these regions to progress faster towards the desired structural change.
So there is an important relation between smart specialization strategy as a dynamic that aims to build innovation capacities to change the structures and the opportunities offered by general purpose technologies in every region.
Other dynamics of innovation are possible to guide smart specialization but the dynamics of the general purpose technology is certainly central because it provides opportunities to all.
