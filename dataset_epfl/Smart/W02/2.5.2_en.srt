1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:09,020
When we have to make strategic choices
aimed at the preferential development of new

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,780
activities
and that therefore involve targeted interventions

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,950
towards certain areas or certain firms,
we risk making mistakes.

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,620
Some choices may seem irrelevant afterwards
whilst decisions not to engage in such area

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:25,650
could later appear as erroneous.
And that's one of the advantages of a horizontal

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,560
policy
to avoid these mistakes since the programs

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,210
and instruments
are available for all.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,090
In this second part, we recall the five types
of errors

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,140
commonly made
and we identify

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,000
the design elements that help to minimize
these errors

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,350
or to reduce their costs.
First is the error of the omniscient planner.

12
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,100
We've already talked about it.
This error is based on the belief that we

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,400
can accumulate
in advance,

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,600
all the knowledge and information that will
allow

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,690
to design a complete plan
and then stimulate

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,239
enterprises to execute it.
But, we have said it,

17
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,850
the knowledge that the Government can hold
in advance

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,070
is very limited,
even after ordering sophisticated statistics,

19
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,520
simply
because the most important knowledge will

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,619
be discovered
as the process goes.

21
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:16,490
The only medicine against this error,
is the application of a principle of

22
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,619
entrepreneurial discovery.
We do not know ex ante what to do.

23
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,840
We must find out.
This was module 3 of this week and we will

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,170
come back to it
in the weeks devoted to the operationalization

25
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,170
of the strategy.
The second error

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,369
is the choice made at the sectoral level.
(Tourism, textile, food, pharmacy).

27
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:41,420
Conducting a sectoral prioritization
within an innovation policy

28
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,079
does not make any sense.
The problem is not to help all the firms

29
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,819
simply because they belong to such sector
but to help those who are engaged in a project,

30
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,149
in the development of a new activity.
The sectoral level

31
00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:57,969
is also not adapted, as was already said,
to the new phase of globalization called the

32
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:01,149
"second unbundling".
The level of prioritization

33
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:05,499
must be located at a finer granularity,
the activity or specialty.

34
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:09,410
We do not help the fisheries sector
but the biotechnology development activity

35
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,620
for the management of marine resources.
We do not help the wood and forest industry

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,940
but the development of a bio-economy
applied to wood and forest.

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,810
Thus, the distortions are reduced
because public action is located in the area

38
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,800
of an ​​innovation policy
and not in the area of a sectoral sector.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,820
In addition,
this level of activity,

40
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,870
is the right level
at which a region can discern opportunities

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,320
for itself,
that it could not see at sectoral level.

42
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,870
Finally, it allows to have an inclusive strategy,
as we will see later.

43
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,110
At this finer level,
priorities can be distributed through a relatively

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,760
large number
of sectors or cross-cutting areas.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,060
Third mistake: the choices made for ever.
On the basis of comparative advantages, as

46
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,540
with Ricardo,
Portugal produces wine and Great Britain,

47
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,810
the textile.
And everyone sinks in,

48
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,160
we could even say mires in its specialization
because the comparative advantages and disadvantages

49
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,260
at the origin of the initial specializations
are self-perpetuating.

50
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,780
This error is serious enough and there are
many reasons

51
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,360
for this problem.
Some priorities may become irrelevant.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,370
So we must stop them.
Any activity without exception

53
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,750
after a certain time is no longer new.
An activity that has become mature

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,070
no longer needs to be supported preferentially
because other funding mechanisms are better

55
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,980
suited
to an activity that has reached maturity.

56
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Parallel to this process of maturation of
some areas

57
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,360
new opportunities can appear
and thus new priorities must be established.

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,440
Finally, some projects in each priority area
can fail.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,069
They must be stopped.
The main lesson of this set of observations

60
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,040
is that
the smart specialization strategy is a living

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,930
document.
It would be absurd

62
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,870
and not "smart" to have priorities established
for ever

63
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,580
and to declare that the strategy is definitely
completed

64
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,730
by refusing for example to incorporate new
options

65
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,819
and opportunities later.
The principle of flexibility is essential

66
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:05,110
but who says flexibility also says monitoring
and evaluation.

67
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,540
The implementation of these principles will
be addressed

68
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,260
during the fourth week.
The fourth error, like the following one actually,

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,770
is not specific to a non-neutral policy aimed
at preferential actions.

70
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,489
It is also made within
horizontal policies.

71
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:21,489
Indeed, it is not enough to provide generous
fundings

72
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,949
to R & D projects or platforms
in each priority area,

73
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:27,669
because what needs to be increased concerns
all the factors

74
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:33,699
that enter a process of research and innovation.
But, the supply of human capital (R & D engineers)

75
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:37,389
is fixed, at least in the short term.
It cannot instantly adjust

76
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,800
to an increase in demand for human capital
that would be consecutive

77
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,310
to the aditional funding.
Let's look at this diagram.

78
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,659
With a supply of human capital that takes
time to adapt,

79
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:50,490
the increase of the demand in human capital
will translate into higher wages

80
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,199
without significant increase in R & D volumes.
The demand curve

81
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,129
moves upwards
thanks to R & D grants.

82
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:05,130
But the supply of scientists and engineers
is fixed.

83
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,879
From then on, subsidies are dissipated
in a rise of wages

84
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,409
without resulting in an increase in volume
of R&D and innovation activities.

85
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:20,740
Of course, the problem of supply adjustment
can be solved in part by immigration

86
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,569
and the call for engineers and scientists
from other regions.

87
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,289
But when a new priority area has been identified,
it is also coherent to anticipate

88
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,520
the development of appropriate training
in the region itself.

89
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,710
The last error, finally, concerns the fact
of financing projects,

90
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,930
activities that would have existed anyway,
that is to say, even in the absence of public

91
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,809
funding.
If public funding is given for a project that

92
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:46,520
would
have been executed by the firm anyway,

93
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,599
there will be no aditionality effect.
It is a simple transfer of resources from

94
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,199
public
to private.

95
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,389
It is inefficient for this reason,
even if the project is successful.

96
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,630
It is often a difficult thing to understand.
How to fix this error? What project to finance?

97
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,710
The theoretical answer, e.g. Trajtenberg
or Wallsten and Stiglitz,

98
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:09,080
tells us that only the projects or activities
that are characterized

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,099
by a negative correlation between private
profitability

100
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,800
and social profitability
should be financed.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
This logic is illustrated in this figure by
Stiglitz

102
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,469
and Wallsten.
The vertical axis

103
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:24,669
is the social return of the projects;
what it brings back to society as a whole.

104
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,059
And the horizontal axis
is the private return;

105
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,969
what this brings back to those who undertake
this project.

106
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,279
The projects in zone C
are projects whose private profitability

107
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,259
is important. They therefore do not need public
funding

108
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:40,779
to be undertaken.
Public funding of C

109
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:43,809
would therefore consist of a simple transfer
of resources

110
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:46,689
from the private to the public without allocative
effect.

111
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,469
Bad decision!
It is therefore better to fund type B projects.

112
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:53,409
However, there is a public funding opportunity
cost

113
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,879
and we cannot fund everything simply because
these type B projects

114
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,150
have a low private profitability.
Projects in zone A

115
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,240
have a low level of private profitability
and their anticipated social return

116
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,860
is inferior to the cost of public funding.
So, indeed,

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,539
without public funding, they will not be undertaken
but would that penalize society? Probably

118
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,710
not.
Finally, public funding will

119
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,129
be efficient in the case of projects
in zone B since they are low private return

120
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:22,240
projects
but which expected social return

121
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,039
exceeds the cost of public funding.
In practice, of course,

122
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,789
it is difficult to identify projects of zone
B.

123
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:32,460
But we can nevertheless believe that entrepreneurial
discovery projects,

124
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,059
that combine and integrate fragmented knowledge
to explore a new field

125
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:40,779
and that will ensure a wide and fast distribution
of information on these findings,

126
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,469
these projects belong to zone B
and must be financed by the Government.

127
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:50,729
These are the five elements of a good design
for a non-neutral policy that involves making

128
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:54,059
choices
and allocate resources preferentially.

129
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,159
This good design
obviously requires a skillful and competent

130
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:00,129
Government.
We can ask ourselves if,

131
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,909
in many areas, this requirement is realistic.
We will discuss

132
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,619
during the fourth week by inviting a specialist
in this matter

133
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:12,090
our colleague and friend, Kevin Morgan,
from the University of Cardiff.

134
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,249
I hope you enjoyed this module
on the place of smart specialization strategies

135
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:22,189
in the space of innovation policies.
A place that smart specialization strategy

136
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:25,250
does not occupy alone. Other policies are
like it.

137
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,469
In terms of a logic of non-neutral resource
allocation,

138
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:31,749
enabling strategic choices
through preferential actions.

139
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,539
But this place also implies fundamentally
taking care

140
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,100
of the design of the policy,
to minimize possible errors.

141
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,320
After a week full of theories and concepts
of all kinds,

142
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,130
let's now see the practice
and operationalization of our approach,

143
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,060
which will be developed next week.
Thank you!
