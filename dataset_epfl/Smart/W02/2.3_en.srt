1
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,790
In this module, we talk about entrepreneurial
discovery

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,860
and show that it is an essential principle
that will help us change paradigm

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,000
in terms of innovation policy.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,980
This is what allows a region and its government
to identify and initiate large strategic actions

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,450
without falling into a mode of central planning.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,910
We'll talk about the theoretical basis of
this concept,

7
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,750
on one side Hayek and Sabel
on the fact that the State cannot know everything

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,360
and that the discovery process is an essential
aspect;

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,820
on the other hand, Hirshleifer and Kirzner,
for who discovery

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,740
has a fundamental informational dimension,
unlike innovation;

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,500
and also Haussmann and Rodrik who helped popularize
the theme

12
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,420
in their work in development economics.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,800
A smart specialization strategy
seeks to identify strategic areas

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,290
in which capacities are built
for the development of new transformative

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,740
activities.

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,180
So there is a problem of information and knowledge.

17
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,210
How to identify these areas
and learn about the probability of success

18
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,360
within each of them?

19
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,330
There are two solutions:
the omniscient State,

20
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,540
the big planner who believes he has the ability
to accumulate enough information

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,010
and "ex ante" knowledge
to determine strategic priorities,

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:35,060
to develop a plan and then create incentives
for companies to execute the plan.

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,140
This is what Sabel calls "the principal-agent
governance."

24
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,240
The alternative works on the assumption that
the state does not know,

25
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,700
or not enough.

26
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,450
The knowledge about future activities
which are susceptible of transforming a sector,

27
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:53,780
of modernizing, diversifying it,
is not obvious, not trivial.

28
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,250
It is only very partially in books
or in consulting firms.

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,250
It is dispersed and divided, it can be hidden,
it often results from the combination and

30
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,060
integration
of dispersed and fragmented knowledge.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,880
And above all, it cannot be fully produced
and known "ex ante".

32
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,879
A large fraction of this knowledge is unknown
and will gradually be discovered

33
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,329
according to the actual process of exploration
of selected areas.

34
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:20,440
It was Charles Sabel who wrote it.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,840
"What happens when we assume that there are
no principals,

36
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,900
no omniscient State,
with robust and panoramic knowledge needed

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,169
for a directive role?"

38
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,950
Any systematic information produced "ex ante"
is obviously useful, we will see it in the

39
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,309
3rd week,
but will still be insufficient.

40
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:42,409
There is a discovery process to carry out
and

41
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,760
who can do it if not the innovation actors
themselves

42
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,239
the entrepreneurs, the researchers, the leading
users

43
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:50,799
perhaps even citizens?

44
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:56,459
The main difference between the two solutions
opposes an information research mechanism

45
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,219
based on the assumption that we can know everything
before,

46
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,780
and that our decisions will therefore be fully
informed;

47
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,989
and a discovery mechanism,
according to which we do not know a lot before,

48
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:09,040
at least not enough
and that a fundamental element of surprise

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,019
accompanies the discovery mechanism.

50
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:18,010
We could retake and detail many methods
which aimed to identify strategic industries,

51
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,379
key sectors, technological complexity levels
that industries should get over.

52
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:28,129
All these methods, particularly popular in
the 60-80-90's,

53
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:34,099
are more sophisticated than each other
and are alike in that they leave no room

54
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:37,279
to entrepreneurial discovery and to that element
of surprise.

55
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,189
These methods basically rest on a form of
illusion.

56
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,879
The illusion that it is possible to know everything
in order to plan everything

57
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,129
in a centralized and scientifical way.

58
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,730
The production of "ex ante" information is
obviously useful but

59
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,930
we must make the difference between an approach
aimed at a supposedly complete "ex ante" information

60
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,030
to achieve a central plan, which does not
seem relevant to us,

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,879
and an "ex ante" information of a stylised
facts type,

62
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,339
like those written here,
or knowledge of the existing structures and

63
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:11,229
resources,
what we will see in the third week,

64
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:14,519
of which we recognize the incompleteness and
which we will use

65
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,790
as a guide for entrepreneurial discovery.

66
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,460
This fundamental principle of
incompleteness of "ex ante" information to

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,710
decide priorities,
logically and inevitably, leads

68
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,450
into the principle of entrepreneurial discovery
or "self-discovery".

69
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,900
We can ask ourselves: what are we trying to
discover?

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,140
The information that has to be discovered
in order to create a smart specialization

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,650
strategy,
is structured by the objective of the considered

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,650
policy.

73
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,900
In our case, it is a compound element
which answers two questions.

74
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,240
Is this area strategic?

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,670
The answer is given by the probability Pa.

76
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,860
Can this strategic area be successfully exploited?

77
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,870
The answer is given by the Pap probability.

78
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,420
The Pap discovery is on the early phases
of development of the new activity,

79
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,730
on the ability of actors to coordinate
and to form a critical mass for the development

80
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,060
of this activity.

81
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,050
We must understand that the answer to the
second question,

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,530
on ?ap involves concrete investments
in exploratory projects, platforms, networks.

83
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,700
This is to explore the strategic area
and learn about the possibilities of development

84
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,990
in this area,
the formation of a critical mass and the potentials

85
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,520
for structural transformations.

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,230
And it is probably at this level
that the discovery of new knowledge,

87
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,330
along the process,
and the surprise element that accompanies

88
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,860
it will be the most marked.

89
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,870
The social value of the entrepreneurial discovery
process

90
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,050
is this informational value that allows the
State

91
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,570
to answer the two questions listed
and therefore to make decisions at both levels.

92
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,440
What strategic area?

93
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,540
What chances of success in each area?

94
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,930
The entrepreneurial discovery process
also informs companies

95
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,300
on opportunities in such and such field.

96
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,850
Entrepreneurial discovery
is basically the mechanism

97
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,161
which enables to solve the information problems
in away that avoids falling into a central

98
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:16,580
planning mode
or a "principal-agent" mode of governance.

99
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:22,840
The companies, rather large, can internalize
the entrepreneurial discovery process.

100
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,730
They seek new strategic areas,
then explore them concretely.

101
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,060
Let's give two examples, taken at random.

102
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,450
Toshiba
identifies a new strategic area

103
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,210
and develops exploratory research projects.

104
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,550
This is the conversion of some of these establishments
to develop "clean factory farms"

105
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,170
in order to produce vegetables and fruits
in perfectly free of germs environments.

106
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,240
Schindler, a leading company in the field
of elevators

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,490
and other escalators
explores a new strategic area,

108
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,210
that of the "transit management".

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,170
This is not about further improving the lift
but to develop the concept of integrated and

110
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,590
intelligent mobility
that combines access, support, communication,

111
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,210
transport and security.

112
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,110
Although it is more difficult, a group of
SMEs,

113
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,750
can also internalize
a process of entrepreneurial discovery,

114
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,250
especially if the collective action which
is engaged

115
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,310
is coordinated and supported by an industrial
association

116
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,900
or a technology centre.

117
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,800
The difference between an entrepreneurial
discovery process

118
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,389
internalized by a firm
and an entrepreneurial discovery process

119
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,610
as a basis for a public policy
is that in the first case,

120
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,940
the social value of the process will be lower.

121
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,229
Typically, the company will disclose
information on Pa, probably not on Pap.

122
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,080
.
Toshiba, Schindler announce in the press

123
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,360
their new strategic area
but these announcements are logically rather

124
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,840
superficial
in terms of information on the content of

125
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,970
projects.

126
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:01,150
When the entrepreneurial discovery process
is supported by an innovation policy,

127
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,900
it is critical that the informational value
is the strongest possible.

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,570
And so,
subsidized companies under this policy

129
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:13,050
must agree to comply
to these information disclosure rules.

130
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,630
What are the obstacles and barriers
that can hinder a policy aiming to stimulate

131
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,870
the entrepreneurial discovery process?

132
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,850
Specifically, the potentially high informational
value of the process

133
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,080
poses complicated problems that are well known.

134
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,060
The social return,
because of a so high informational value,

135
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
is higher than the private return.

136
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,029
Because of such information externalities,
companies will tend to invest too little in

137
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,339
this process
since it is supposed to inform others.

138
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,509
This externality must therefore be corrected
without reducing the informational value of

139
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,990
the process
since that is its "raison d'être".

140
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,899
Only a subsidy mechanism, unlike a patent,
can solve this problem.

141
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,410
On the other hand, the production of information
on PAP

142
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,449
involves solving coordination problems
when the area to explore

143
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:08,559
requires assembling varied skills and knowledge
that are not all available in the region

144
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,339
and that may be held by very different organizations.

145
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:14,949
Here, as we have already seen in the first
week,

146
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,170
having identified rather narrow strategic
areas

147
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,620
and stimulated a coordinated project portfolio
can help solve these problems of coordination.

148
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,260
Regions must take this principle of entrepreneurial
discovery as an opportunity,

149
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,510
not as a constraint.

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,290
John Enos, a distinguished Oxford economist,
did not say something else when he wrote

151
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:41,959
already in the 80s : "countries and regions
should put more efforts into choosing,

152
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:45,640
in detail and for the future,
the direction of research and development

153
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,360
- on what products,
what processes, into what markets".

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,819
He added that an essential reason for this
is that, by doing so, we gain knowledge

155
00:09:55,819 --> 00:10:00,420
and accumulate experience
which will be of great value for the following

156
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,709
stages of innovation.

157
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:06,879
But what Enos said is only true
if there is indeed discovery, learning, surprise.

158
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,730
It would be less true in the case of omniscient
planner

159
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:12,740
which precisely seeks to avoid any surprises.

160
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,699
That is what is meant.

161
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,439
In our view, the principle of entrepreneurial
discovery

162
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,439
is fundamental.

163
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:23,410
It enables to change of policy paradigm
and not fall into a centralized planning mode

164
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,420
based on the belief
of a possibility of complete "ex ante" information

165
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,420
to decide.

166
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,779
During the third week,
we will look at the operational content of

167
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,519
this process.
