1
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,132
Without doubt, Crete has
a long tradition in the design

2
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:22,668
and development 
of  place-based innovation policies. 

3
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:25,515
It's experience dates back 
in the middle of nineties,

4
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:28,355
where a number of science, 
technology and innovation programs

5
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:30,921
were launched to support 
the scaling up  

6
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,522
of successful bottom up
innovation engines. 

7
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:37,060
It's worth knowing that 
the existence of the strong research

8
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,711
 community of the island, 
played an important role

9
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,833
in shaping the regional innovation
landscape of Crete.

10
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:45,841
In the same spirit, Crete was one 
of the first Greek regions

11
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:48,351
which embraced the rational 
of smart specialisation

12
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,763
in incorporating it's principles

13
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:52,725
in the regional 
innovation ecosystem.

14
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:55,518
Today, smart specialisation 
strategies are regarded

15
00:00:55,718 --> 00:00:58,886
as the corner stone of the regional
development plan of the island,

16
00:00:59,086 --> 00:01:02,614
and to lift regional planning
to a more sophisticated

17
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:05,300
and tailor-made model of innovation
policy making.

18
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,502
The application 
of RIS3 strategies

19
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,603
provides an important 
opportunity for Crete,

20
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,956
to mobilize and combine it's micro
and commercial level capabilities

21
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:15,870
with the objective to create 
new trajectories of growth.

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,919
Despite the uneven impact
of the Greek economic crisis,

23
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,201
it's true that Cretan policy makers 

24
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,948
have started making sense
of the RIS3 potential.

25
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:28,187
The design of smart specialization
has been already finished.

26
00:01:28,426 --> 00:01:31,044
And the implementation phase 
has just started raising

27
00:01:31,237 --> 00:01:34,765
important number of interesting 
challenges and opportunities.

28
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,727
To discuss all these interesting
aspects we have invited

29
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:41,112
a mixture of experts, including
policy makers, academics, 

30
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,815
and representatives from the local
innovation 

31
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:46,082
and entrepreneurial community
of the island,

32
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:49,054
providing their smart specialization
experiences 

33
00:01:49,254 --> 00:01:50,460
from different perspectives.

34
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,423
Our Cretan experts help us
understand how Crete

35
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:57,353
links its' resources 
and capabilities with RIS3 potential.

36
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:59,832
They indicate various challenges
and discuss

37
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,555
how a series 
of practical problems related 

38
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,776
to the entrepreneurial 
(INAUDIBLE)  discovery 

39
00:02:04,976 --> 00:02:09,352
the national and (INAUDIBLE) 
Cretan (INAUDIBLE) have been overcome, 

40
00:02:09,552 --> 00:02:14,311
and third, actually increasing
opportunity for the island.

41
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:16,327
Let's start the discussion program.

42
00:02:24,517 --> 00:02:27,362
Prof. Nektarios Tavernarakis
Chairman of the Board

43
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,029
at the Foundation for Research
and Technology. 

44
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:34,323
And professor in a Medical School
of the University of Crete.

45
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:37,605
So I would like to ask you
Prof. Tavernarakis,

46
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:40,795
what is the role of FORTH 
in generating and promoting

47
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:44,155
innovation in the region of Crete?

48
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,426
The Foundation for Research
and Technology

49
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:49,836
is a research center conducting 
research

50
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:53,284
in various fields of science,
including physics, 

51
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:57,480
biology, mathematics, 
computer science, 

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,551
humanities and also chemistry.

53
00:03:01,624 --> 00:03:04,624
The overriding criteria in all
these schools is always

54
00:03:04,824 --> 00:03:07,461
scientific and research
excellence. 

55
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,730
Four of the institutes 
of the Foundation for Research

56
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,805
and Technology are situated
here in Heraklion.

57
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:20,312
And the effort is always to connect
our research efforts with

58
00:03:20,512 --> 00:03:24,114
the local society in the region
of Crete.

59
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:28,434
And exploit research findings

60
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:34,009
and intellectual property 
to the benefit of the local economy,

61
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,404
and the culture of the island.

62
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:41,659
So (INAUDIBLE) Forth is a key institution
here in Crete. 

63
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,253
How it's activities can contribute
to the development

64
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,873
of the smart specialization
strategies in the region of Crete?

65
00:03:50,794 --> 00:03:53,596
Many of the research activities
of the Foundation

66
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:56,836
for Research and Technology 
are well-poised to contribute

67
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:01,577
decisively to the smart 
specialization strategies.

68
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:08,101
One example that has actually
been a prominent one,

69
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,785
is the use of laser technology

70
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:17,168
to clean Cultural Heritage items,
monuments, 

71
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:21,632
not just here in Crete, 
but also throughout Greece, 

72
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,669
and in other areas 
of the world, actually.

73
00:04:24,869 --> 00:04:28,175
Another one has to do with
Archaeogenetics,

74
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:32,327
the analysis of ancient DNA,
as we call it, 

75
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,700
which allows us to peer back in time

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,306
and identify characteristics 
of the local population,

77
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:46,865
but also for plants and animals

78
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,423
analyzed by diversity
of different eras. 

79
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,554
And this, of course, again links
to the very rich

80
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,899
Cultural Heritage
of the region of Crete.

81
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:09,403
Dr. Dimitros Kafetzopoulos

82
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,547
Research Director at Institute
of Molecular Biology & Biotechnology,

83
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:18,602
at the Foundation for Research
and Technology.

84
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,787
So Mr. Kafetzopoulos, 
I'm glad to ask you 

85
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,578
how is research linked with 
the local entrepreneurial resources

86
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,277
for the purpose of the history
in the region of Crete?

87
00:05:28,477 --> 00:05:31,765
Crete is the region of Greece
that has the highest

88
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:34,265
per capita research expenditure.

89
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,060
That means that there are a lot
of strong institutes,

90
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,668
universities and research 
infrastructures in this region.

91
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:46,447
And there have been over the years
several collaborations

92
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:49,844
with the industry 
and the entrepreneurial sector

93
00:05:50,044 --> 00:05:51,735
for the development of technologies

94
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,192
and implementations 
of various projects. 

95
00:05:54,392 --> 00:06:01,637
The problem in 
all this effort is that

96
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,529
these have always been short-term
and rather limited activity,

97
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,736
that it was more or less
occasional. 

98
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:17,347
With the development 
of the RIS3 framework, 

99
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:22,945
what we are expecting to have
is a more focused, 

100
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:28,386
and a long-term development 
of these collaborations.

101
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,186
Okay. Do you have any particular 
examples to share with us?

102
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:36,324
One example is the collaboration
of research institutes

103
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,337
with the food industry. 

104
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:45,888
In one case, local meat industry,
Crete firms,

105
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:51,752
collaborates with our institute,
in order to develop technologies

106
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:55,616
for quantifying and monitoring

107
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,780
the content of foods 
in various liquids. 

108
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,033
And the second example is 
the collaboration with

109
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:06,131
the wine industry, where 
methods are developed

110
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:09,622
to monitor the aging of wine
in the bottle.

111
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:13,341
And last, but not least,
I have in mind

112
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:16,781
new activity that has started
in our institute

113
00:07:17,027 --> 00:07:20,935
for the study of ancient DNA
that would give us the opportunity

114
00:07:21,162 --> 00:07:25,248
to combine the findings 
of our modern research

115
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:28,881
related to human genetics,
to the wealth

116
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:33,410
of theological science
that exist in Crete. 

117
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:38,504
This kind of activity will end up
with new information

118
00:07:38,704 --> 00:07:43,421
that would allow us to reconstitute
our ancestors.

119
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,874
And in that sense, we expect
to contribute

120
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:55,055
to the Cultural Heritage activities
of the smart specialization. 

121
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:06,099
Mrs. Maria Kassotaki
Director of the Managing Authority

122
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:11,236
of the Region of Crete.
With 30 years experience

123
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:15,206
in regional development
and managing European funds. 

124
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,396
I would like to ask you whether
the EU relations 

125
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:22,915
for the new program period 2014
to 2020, facilitate or strangle

126
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:26,371
the implementation of the regional
innovation strategy of Crete?

127
00:08:26,771 --> 00:08:30,478
The regulations of the new program
fail to introduce

128
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:34,040
a number of rules
which pose limitations

129
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,355
and influence the flexibility
of implementing

130
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:40,543
regional innovation strategies.

131
00:08:41,206 --> 00:08:46,008
To be more specific,
I would like to refer as an example

132
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,895
the state aid rules
applied on innovation actions.

133
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:56,660
The state aid rules define 
the content of the call for tenders

134
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,264
and therefore influence 
the attractiveness

135
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:04,924
of the beneficiaries,
but also the difficulty

136
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:07,531
of it's implementation. 

137
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:10,627
I would like to refer as 
a second problem

138
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:14,950
the legal and institutional
framework

139
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,974
that is necessary for implementing
innovation actions

140
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:22,519
that implement 
the regional strategy. 

141
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:27,430
A set of institutional
and legal arrangements

142
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:31,149
must be happened in order
to be able

143
00:09:31,382 --> 00:09:36,658
to get the authority to proceed
with these actions.

144
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:41,289
As a third problem, 
I would like to refer

145
00:09:41,797 --> 00:09:45,096
the so-called conditionalities. 

146
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:50,883
In my country there are
some small delays, particularly

147
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:54,193
 in the case of the conditionalities 
concerning ICTs.

148
00:09:54,393 --> 00:10:01,563
So, all those actions
that are included

149
00:10:01,784 --> 00:10:03,657
in the regional innovation strategy

150
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:06,450
and concern the application
of ICTs

151
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:11,278
in different sectors may have
a shorter (INAUDIBLE).

152
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:16,016
As a fourth problem, 
and this is the last one,

153
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,033
that I would like to refer is the
fiscal situation of my country.

154
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,656
It is a difficult
economic situation

155
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:26,256
and of course, when that occurs
face a lot of problems.

156
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,647
Okay. So you have mentioned
four main obstacles. 

157
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,379
So I would like to ask you,
how have you

158
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:36,599
managed to overcome 
such obstacles, such challenges?

159
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,391
We defined two pilot actions,
so one concerns

160
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:44,772
diving tourism,
innovative diving tourism.

161
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:49,171
And the second concerns
the application of ICTs

162
00:10:50,361 --> 00:10:54,232
in the sector
tourism and culture. 

163
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:57,435
In cooperation with the Commission
and national authorities,

164
00:10:57,635 --> 00:11:06,308
we tried to exclude 
all ICT actions that are included

165
00:11:06,525 --> 00:11:10,104
from the general positionality
of ICTs in Greece.

166
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:14,546
The second was to define
very precisely

167
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:17,694
the actions that we are going to

168
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:24,302
the actions that are going 
to define us to buy the problem.

169
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:28,612
The last thing is try to find
all those

170
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,714
possibilities that exist
in our country

171
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:36,243
in order to facilitate
the entrepreneurs to participate. 

172
00:11:37,422 --> 00:11:39,217
Fantastic.
Thanks very much for your time.

173
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,209
-For your effort.
-Thanks a lot. 

174
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,471
Mr. Artemis Saitakis
Director of the Science

175
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:52,698
and Technology Park of Crete.

176
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,894
The first question is what
methodical steps

177
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:58,688
have been followed by the region

178
00:11:58,888 --> 00:12:01,153
to set the strategic priorities
of the island?

179
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,486
For the preparation of 
the regional innovation strategy,

180
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:05,331
the Government of Crete
established 

181
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,637
the Regional Innovation Council
in 2011,

182
00:12:07,837 --> 00:12:10,514
consists of the experts 
and representatives

183
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:12,034
of regional stakeholders.

184
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:15,933
It started it's activities by
the creation of 11 working groups

185
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:20,506
in the priority areas of the region,
all proposed by it's members.

186
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:24,659
After 3 years of work, 
the groups prepared and submitted

187
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,448
reports on the current situation
of innovation

188
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:28,948
capabilities of the region.

189
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:33,942
As well as proposals in 
the priority areas of the new strategy.

190
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,242
Following the preparation
of the strategy,

191
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,810
the regional government put in place

192
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,008
an inclusive and transparent
consultation process

193
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:44,534
where the regional stakeholders
expressed their opinion

194
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:46,418
and submitted comments.

195
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:49,588
How do these priorities
reflect on 

196
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,953
island's capabilities
and resources?

197
00:12:52,153 --> 00:12:55,014
The areas where Crete has 
comparative advantages

198
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:58,423
is a result of an analysis of
the regional competitiveness,

199
00:12:58,623 --> 00:12:59,960
strengths and capabilities,

200
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,744
and it's research and scientific
potential.

201
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:06,762
Four of my sectors 
have been selected

202
00:13:06,962 --> 00:13:08,973
as the strategic priorities. 

203
00:13:09,173 --> 00:13:13,383
Agro-food, culture tourism, environment
and knowledge. 

204
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:17,274
Each sector has been selected
following an extensive analysis

205
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:19,749
of capabilities, competencies
and  challenges. 

206
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:23,071
Is there any particular example
that you can share with us?

207
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,737
Two examples are the wines
of Crete cluster

208
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:27,707
and the marine technology sector. 

209
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:30,769
The wine cluster of Crete was
established in 2006,

210
00:13:30,969 --> 00:13:33,715
and is very active in 
the promotion of the Cretan wines.

211
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:37,516
The cluster cooperates closely
with academia

212
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,339
which has already developed
new products and services.

213
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:43,110
The marine technology sector 
cooperates

214
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,809
with academic institutions
and the tourism industry.

215
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,484
Main activities are the promotion
of the blue economy

216
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:52,390
and the development of high
value-added tourism

217
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,605
like the diving tourism.

218
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:58,325
It is expected to upgrade
the tourism project to the island,

219
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:01,710
develop new activities, as well as
the creation of - 

220
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,618
Dr. Maria Makridaki
Technology Transfer Consultant

221
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:16,739
at the Technology Transfer Office
of the Foundation

222
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,775
for Research and Technology.

223
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:20,161
Maria, I would like to ask you

224
00:14:20,405 --> 00:14:24,573
if there are any initiatives or tools
available to support

225
00:14:24,773 --> 00:14:26,779
smart specialization practices
in the region of Crete?

226
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:30,557
The Foundation for Research
and Technology-Hellas (FORTH)

227
00:14:30,757 --> 00:14:33,132
has been an enthusiastic supporter
of RIS3.

228
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,889
Crete is privileged to have
an excellent talent 

229
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:37,634
research and educational
ecosystem,

230
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:41,358
but there is no interaction 
with the enterprises of Crete.

231
00:14:41,558 --> 00:14:44,700
On the contrary, 
the invent here, exploit elsewhere

232
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,105
phenomenon is illustrated 
on a large extent in Crete.

233
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,962
FORTH has recognized that the RIS3

234
00:14:51,162 --> 00:14:53,052
is an excellent opportunity
to support

235
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,059
industry-academic collaboration.

236
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,980
Based on those observations,
the Cretan Innovation Initiative,

237
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,686
CRINI project was introduced. 

238
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:04,372
The basic idea is that 
the seven research

239
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,840
educational institutes of Crete
will collaborate

240
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,934
in an inclusive and holistic way

241
00:15:10,134 --> 00:15:13,864
in order to serve the R&D needs
of the Cretan enterprises.

242
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:17,493
The main idea behind the project
is to create synergies

243
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:20,768
between the research and the 
entrepreneurial ecosystem of Crete.

244
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:25,374
That will support local enterprises 
and young entrepreneurs,

245
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:28,411
and create a novel brand name
for the region of Crete,

246
00:15:28,611 --> 00:15:32,372
that will eventually attract 
high tech companies and investors.

247
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:36,448
Thus creating new conditions for 
this economic development of Crete. 

248
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:39,426
How is CRINI Project 
expected to affect

249
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:42,406
the RIS3 processes in 
the region of Crete?

250
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,498
FORTH, by introducing
the CRINI Project

251
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:49,340
managed to motivate all 
the other institutes to work together

252
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:52,227
in order to support
RIS3 implementation in Crete. 

253
00:15:52,427 --> 00:15:54,728
The CRINI Project is expected
to become

254
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:57,842
the bridge between the research
and entrepreneurial communities

255
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,566
of Crete that will facilitate
the launch of new R&D projects

256
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:04,395
on the strategic areas
indicated by RIS3.

257
00:16:04,595 --> 00:16:07,906
The CRINI Project will also have
a very important role

258
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:10,447
in the entrepreneurial discovery
process

259
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:13,243
since one of it's main activities 
is to map

260
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:16,689
all the research potential
and mature research results

261
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:19,161
that could serve the needs 
of local enterprises

262
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,561
on the thematical priorities
set by RIS3.

263
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:32,054
We are with Mr Stavros Arnaoutakis 

264
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,453
Regional Governor of Crete.

265
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,467
Thank you for accepting us today.

266
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:37,732
Mr Arnaoutakis,

267
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:40,305
Smart specialisation 
is integral part of Crete's 

268
00:16:40,495 --> 00:16:42,708
development regional planning.

269
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,070
I would like to ask you

270
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,492
what actions did you take

271
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:47,186
during the planning process

272
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:48,810
and what are your expectations

273
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,055
for the years to come

274
00:16:50,148 --> 00:16:51,736
concerning the implementation

275
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,908
and the results of smart specialisation 

276
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,156
in the Region of Crete?

277
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,931
The Region of Crete had developed

278
00:16:58,114 --> 00:16:59,327
in the past

279
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,447
significant activity for  research

280
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,835
and innovation.

281
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:06,302
Back in 2012 we had established

282
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,320
the innovation council

283
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:11,880
with prominent scientists
and entrepreneurs 

284
00:17:12,057 --> 00:17:13,570
from the island of Crete.

285
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,555
We have already started 

286
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,333
and we will have completed 
until July 2017

287
00:17:21,982 --> 00:17:23,531
a cycle of cooperation 

288
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:28,700
between research institutions 
and entrepreneurs

289
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:32,375
and we have already proceeded 
with actions

290
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,524
concerning tourism, energy

291
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,087
environment and culture.

292
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,973
Do you believe that 

293
00:17:38,196 --> 00:17:39,946
 smart specialisation helps us 

294
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,909
leave behind operating models
 like "business as users"

295
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:43,894
and to move on

296
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:46,131
with more targeted 
and specially designed

297
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:48,050
regional development strategies?

298
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,559
Early indications show that

299
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:54,991
public administration's
modus operandi

300
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,479
is changing.

301
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:00,915
Research and educational
institutions

302
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,009
come together with

303
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:03,984
the island's entrepreneurs.

304
00:18:04,638 --> 00:18:06,863
What we need to see

305
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:09,134
is the national policy.

306
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:13,674
We need help from the E.U.

307
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,744
and the central government

308
00:18:16,955 --> 00:18:19,942
in order to change 

309
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,936
the development model of our island.

310
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:26,879
We believe that the Region of Crete
 is able

311
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,982
together with the entrepreneurs

312
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:33,188
and the island's top scientists

313
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,158
to change our development model.
