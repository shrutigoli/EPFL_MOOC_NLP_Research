1
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:18,395
Forest Based Bioeconomy is the
specialisation of the highest

2
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,895
priority in Värmland.

3
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:26,233
The vision is that we show the way
with bio-based invasions from the

4
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,192
forest to a fossil free and
sustainable society.

5
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:36,409
We want to make more of our long
fibre raw material from the forest

6
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:41,634
and also increase the value added from
 the side streams in the industry.

7
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:46,911
The Forest Based Bioeconomy, I think
we have great challenges and

8
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:48,641
opportunities for this.

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:52,387
We have really good raw material,
we have the infrastructure,

10
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,325
we have our mills, we have the
pulp mills, the paper mills 

11
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:57,062
but also the saw mills.

12
00:00:57,723 --> 00:00:59,273
We also have a lot of waste streams

13
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:04,518
from these that are not
totally utilised today,

14
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:06,339
you can still do more things

15
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:10,611
and maybe create higher value and
products from these so we can

16
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:15,565
increase what we can use from the
Forest Based Economy even further.

17
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,642
One example is that maybe we can
use the side streams from our

18
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:23,269
paper mills to actually make a
bio-based plastic that you can

19
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:26,819
incorporate into your packaging
material and by those means

20
00:01:26,862 --> 00:01:30,312
reduce the carbon dioxide
of the package. 

21
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:36,907
Forest Based Bioeconomy for me is
how we can use the forest to

22
00:01:36,974 --> 00:01:39,449
mitigate the climate change.

23
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:44,508
The forest is a fantastic
sustainable material

24
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:48,869
and the fact is that everything
you can do from oil,

25
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:52,719
you can actually also do from
the forest so you can produce

26
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,427
all kinds of materials and fuels

27
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,172
and products from the wood

28
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:05,438
and that is how we are going to
enter the future and how we

29
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:08,050
can create the fossil free society

30
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:14,187
and I feel very happy that we
are actually in the front line

31
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,742
in this transformation.

32
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:19,991
In Värmland, we have a lot
of important assets

33
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:22,700
actually enabling us to
be a front runner in the

34
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,543
Forest Based Bioeconomy.

35
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:27,139
First of all, of course,
we have the forest.

36
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:30,666
Värmland is covered 70% by forest

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,685
and we have been using wood in
the industry for hundreds of years.

38
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:39,692
The development over the past
century has led to that we in

39
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:43,665
Värmland today has a vibrant
business ecosystem related

40
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:44,886
to the forest industry. 

41
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,066
We also have research
related to the industry

42
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:54,444
and an infrastructure consisting of
innovation platforms and test beds.

43
00:02:55,246 --> 00:02:59,096
No where else in the world is there
so much competence and experience

44
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:01,888
gathered around pulp
and paper technology

45
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:06,867
and this ecosystem actually
contains all the assets that

46
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:11,412
are needed to create the
Forest Based Bioeconomy.

47
00:03:11,447 --> 00:03:13,897
Pro2BE was formed very timely

48
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,424
by outside and internal forces.

49
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:24,966
We had the small specialisation
process driven by Region Värmland.

50
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:30,830
We also had processes within
universities to develop strong

51
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:32,877
and excellent research groups.

52
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:40,243
We saw, and the outside forces also
saw how this could come together

53
00:03:40,314 --> 00:03:41,251
in the research group. 

54
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:47,379
Pro2BE which could help to advance
the Forest Based Bioeconomy.

55
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:52,752
The uniqueness comes from our
history where we have together

56
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,532
developed some specialties

57
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:59,451
which are very competitive and
useful for a forest based industry

58
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:04,032
but it also stems from the fact
that together, we for instance, 

59
00:04:04,052 --> 00:04:08,027
Region Värmland, the Cluster
Organisation Paper Province

60
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:17,019
and internally we have developed
a way to put out the research

61
00:04:17,063 --> 00:04:22,138
in to use in society nowadays. 

62
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:26,569
Mostly we deal with
renewable materials

63
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:31,148
and we put them into used
products, we also find ways to 

64
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:34,866
handle these renewable
materials in processes

65
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,855
but it's not only that, many of our
researchers consider systems and

66
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:47,940
systemic effects on how to
utilise the materials in a more 

67
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:54,525
energy wise manner or a
materials conserving manner

68
00:04:55,371 --> 00:05:01,221
also considering carbon dioxide
outlet, to minimize that

69
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:05,943
as means to consider the
global challenges.

70
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:12,520
We also have researchers that
considers food spoilage,

71
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:18,763
which is, of course, one of the very
important questions for humankind

72
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:27,944
and, in addition, this influences
our undergraduate education as well

73
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,504
and of course we don't only educate,
for instance, PHD students

74
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:36,748
and researchers, we also have
undergraduate education

75
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:42,235
and we think that our students bring
this with them when they find their

76
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,071
future employers.

77
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:48,299
I represent a research group called
Packaging for Sustainable Development

78
00:05:48,675 --> 00:05:52,100
that is a part of Pro2BE at
Karlstads university

79
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:56,159
and we want to contribute with
knowledge about how packaging

80
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,090
can prevent food from being
wasted and therefore reduce

81
00:06:00,117 --> 00:06:03,117
the total environmental impact
in the food supply chain.

82
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:07,269
What we have done is to
investigate how packaging

83
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,331
influences consumer behavior

84
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:12,879
and especially when developing
functions that help the consumer

85
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:13,738
to waste less.

86
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:16,188
If we only use milk for coffee, 

87
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:20,965
3 deciliter milk is perhaps enough
and not buy one liter of milk.

88
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:24,926
and another function could be that
the packaging is resealable so that

89
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,192
the food lasts for a longer time.

90
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:31,295
In our region, Värmland, we have
several large companies that

91
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:35,018
are producing paper and paper
board that is used for packaging

92
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,449
so we have done projects together with
some of these like BillerudKorsnäs

93
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:44,898
and today we are also collaborating
in a national project with companies

94
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:46,831
from the entire supply chain

95
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,777
to really try to find new
innovative solutions for

96
00:06:50,825 --> 00:06:53,175
packaging that reduces food waste.

97
00:06:53,752 --> 00:06:57,814
That's a really tall order to make
a transition from a fossil base

98
00:06:57,843 --> 00:06:59,730
to a bio based economy

99
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:02,193
and here at our research centre,

100
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:07,038
which is called Centre for Regional
Studies, CRS at Karlstad University,

101
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,401
we are involved in a number of
different projects in relation to a

102
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:12,387
Forestry Based Bioeconomy.

103
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:17,096
To make this transition, we need
to generate new knowledge and

104
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:20,058
new knowledge needs to be
generated in new ways.

105
00:07:20,285 --> 00:07:22,772
There is no single discipline
in the university

106
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:25,287
that can contribute the
the knowledge needed. 

107
00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,972


108
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,969
We need to collaborate with
the different actors.

109
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:30,235
We need to cross-disciplinary research.

110
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,399
We need transdisciplinary research.

111
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:36,453
Which means that we involve
non academic actors in the research

112
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,594
and that can be public organizations,
firms, cluster organizations,

113
00:07:41,673 --> 00:07:47,148
civil society and civil society can
be NGOs of different types but

114
00:07:47,191 --> 00:07:51,728
also individuals such as patients,
clients, the local population.

115
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,096
What we need is a regional
innovation system that moves

116
00:07:55,152 --> 00:07:57,652
from Triple Helix to Quadruple Helix

117
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,411
and this is also called for in the
EU Bioeconomist Strategy.

118
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,929
But how do we do it?

119
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,367
What is Quadruple Helix?

120
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:06,987
What is the Fourth Helix?

121
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,460
This is the sort of research that
we are involved in the

122
00:08:10,505 --> 00:08:12,855
Bioeconomy research at CRS

123
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:17,441
Well one of the biggest challenges,
with the transition to sustainable

124
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:22,528
Bioeconomy is that the increase
of need and use of Biomass.

125
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:27,826
So how can we balance different
types of needs and use of Biomass?

126
00:08:27,929 --> 00:08:32,104
For example, in the Forestry Based
Bioeconomy, the forest industry,

127
00:08:32,146 --> 00:08:36,059
of course needs the Biomass for its
production but the same Biomass

128
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:38,984
can also be used by tourists
and for leisure.

129
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,943
It's also an attractive
living environment.

130
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:46,718
People like painters and artists,
writers are inspired by the forest

131
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:50,991
So we need to find methods to
balance the different types of view

132
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,638
of the forest in a sustainable way.

133
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:57,506
Perhaps different types of
eco-systems services could

134
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:00,771
be a way of addressing and
balancing these challenges.

135
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,345
In terms of opportunities, the great
opportunity, with the transition to

136
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:08,879
a Forestry Based Bioeconomy
is the circular economy.

137
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:12,679
Which means that you have
a resource sufficient economy.

138
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:17,204
You use every bit of the tree, all
the way from the felling of the tree

139
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,858
to the product in a mill,

140
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,708
but not only that, you also make
use of all the waste streams

141
00:09:22,773 --> 00:09:24,961
to become input in another industry

142
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:26,907
and totally different lines of
industry.

143
00:09:26,936 --> 00:09:30,536
For example, plastic replacement
or textiles.

144
00:09:30,646 --> 00:09:34,696
Our centres view on Biobased Economy
starts out from 2 premises.

145
00:09:34,748 --> 00:09:37,548
The first one being service
innovation where we do

146
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:38,910
a lot of research on

147
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,235
and service innovation from our
perspective means that we are

148
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,535
focusing on how customers are
perceiving what is being innovated.

149
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,860
So we are starting our innovation
processes from what types of

150
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,378
values that the customers
are interested in

151
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,765
and thereby restructuring the
innovation processes and projects.

152
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:03,901
The other premise that we are
interested in and I think is

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,961
important from this point
 of view is servicilisation.

154
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:12,425
Servicilisation means that companies
are moving from the traditional

155
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,487
manufacturing industries
that they have been into.

156
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:24,238
To moving into a more consumer or
customer or societal organisation

157
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:28,526
focusing on the values that those
entities are interested in.

158
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,417
In the process of forming this
strategy, we were encouraged by

159
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,925
the S3 Platform in Seville

160
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:38,981
to integrate the gender
perspective in the strategy.

161
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:44,540
So we formed a process with a
gender expert that gave us input

162
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:49,020
and feedback in 2 steps in the
work of forming this strategy.

163
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:54,756
So I believe we now are the first
region in Europe having this gender

164
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,242
perspective on Smart Specialisation. 

165
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,062
Within gender and Smart
Specialisation, we have an

166
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:04,952
interactive research approach,
which means that we actually work

167
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,839
hands on with the companies

168
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:12,462
from different branches like
manufacturing, digital communication

169
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,555
and Forest Based Economy.

170
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:20,542
and this kind of work is the way
to drive innovation including

171
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:24,289
different branches and also
opening up through gender 

172
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:25,409
as a tool.

173
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:31,151
Challenges and opportunities within
the forest based industry and other

174
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,201
branches that are male coded

175
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:38,549
concerning gender is not just due to
the number of men and women

176
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:41,159
working within the company.

177
00:11:41,232 --> 00:11:47,432
It's all about developing the
company culture and the core valued

178
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,869
within the company

179
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,695
to drive innovation, to drive
social sustainability

180
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:58,112
and also to foremost drive
the business development

181
00:11:58,224 --> 00:11:59,737
into the future.

182
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,778
For BillerudKorsnäs, it's very
important that the region has

183
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,307
Forest Bio-Based Economy on top of
its agenda because that creates a

184
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:10,598
a good opportunity to actually
collaborate even further

185
00:12:10,662 --> 00:12:14,587
with other companies within
the forest based industry

186
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,479
but also with the consultants
and academics.

187
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:20,690
A close collaboration with Karlstas
University for BillerudKorsnä

188
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,501
is of course important,

189
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,041
If it means that we have access
to all the research that is done.

190
00:12:26,072 --> 00:12:29,259
For example, in material development
and in service solutions

191
00:12:29,685 --> 00:12:33,472
but the main thing, of course,
is as a recruitment base.

192
00:12:33,737 --> 00:12:37,375
To have a local university where
you have well educated people

193
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:41,629
and give us the opportunity to
actually show the student of today

194
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,650
and tomorrow that we have great
opportunities for fun jobs

195
00:12:45,694 --> 00:12:46,644
in the region.

196
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:49,109
I think that is one major thing

197
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,720
and that all fun jobs are actually
in Stockholm.

198
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:57,489
My role in Paper Province is to make
sure that good business ideas in

199
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:00,905
the Forest Based Bioeconomy
reaches the market

200
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:05,952
and expands from the very early
phase, the scouting of good business

201
00:13:05,988 --> 00:13:09,138
ideas in research and in companies

202
00:13:09,216 --> 00:13:12,841
and also around the skilled
personnel within the branch

203
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,187
to setting up teams and also
helping in initial sales and

204
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,131
funding of these companies.

205
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,262
We have developed an acceleration
program that is named BioExpress

206
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:27,725
that is used to kick start companies

207
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:31,118
within mature branches as the
forest industry.

208
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,122
The basic idea of this kick start
program is to very rapidly come

209
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,928
and find the first customers

210
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,716
and it's based on 3 main things.

211
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,369
The first principle is that the
inventor doesn't need to be

212
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:48,382
the entrepreneur so they can
leave an idea and let it be 

213
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,823
commercialised in this program.

214
00:13:53,127 --> 00:13:58,715
The second one is that we actively
man the teams to be able to create

215
00:13:58,748 --> 00:14:00,060
a successful company

216
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:04,171
and in this creation of the team,
we combine young entrepreneurs

217
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:07,114
from the business school with
an interest in the forest industry

218
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:12,375
together with senior competence
from the industry within sales

219
00:14:12,865 --> 00:14:16,853
or industrialists or the technicians
if that is needed.

220
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:21,354
And the third thing is that we
actively also use the complete

221
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:24,377
branch network to find
the first customers,

222
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:26,584
to build the first machines
and so on.

223
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:30,467
It is to wrap it in a secure way
to reach the market.

224
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,563
With use of the strong networks here,

225
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,700
we can reach results after 3 months
that would take 5 - 10 years

226
00:14:37,728 --> 00:14:42,341
to reach in metropolitan areas like
Stockholm that doesn't have that

227
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:46,832
branch, deep branch contact and
the experience of doing business.

228
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:52,195
so it's very, very effective to use
business contacts that exist

229
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:56,839
through the world from Värmland
to very fast goods market.
