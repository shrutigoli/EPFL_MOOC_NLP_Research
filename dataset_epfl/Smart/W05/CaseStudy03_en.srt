1
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,176
Why start
this last week

2
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:09,423
by the European experience
 of smart specialisation ?

3
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:11,151
We could almost say

4
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:12,401
"honor to whom honor is due".

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,001
It is indeed within the European Union

6
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:16,913
that the concept has been developed

7
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:19,024
and that a significant implementation
of this policy

8
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,924
at a regional level
was carried out.

9
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:25,036
This is why it would be
almost impossible

10
00:00:25,236 --> 00:00:28,124
to give a course on 
smart specialization strategies

11
00:00:28,324 --> 00:00:30,175
without evoking the European experience.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,728
It is hence in Europe

13
00:00:31,928 --> 00:00:35,118
and more precisely in one
of these committees of experts

14
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:36,903
that the European Commission
likes,

15
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:39,047
the "Knowledge for Growth" committee,

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,822
that the first article on 
this concept has been written

17
00:00:42,022 --> 00:00:45,022
by myself, 
Paul David, Bronwyn Hall.

18
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:47,067
We must also mention Bart van Ark

19
00:00:47,267 --> 00:00:49,842
with whom I wrote
the first briefing on this subject

20
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:52,366
in the same committee in 2008. 

21
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,982
And it is also in Europe within 
the regional policy framework

22
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:58,733
that the concept has been
systematically applied.

23
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:01,784
So much so that, 
as Walter Deffaa,

24
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:05,382
the Director of Regional Policy
during this entire period, has observed,

25
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:09,528
we count today 120 national 
and regional strategies

26
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:12,809
over the entirety of the
European Union

27
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,157
and its neighbouring countries. 

28
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,376
This map shows us 
this incredible phenomenon

29
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,006
of an academic concept

30
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:23,164
having experienced a significant diffusion
in only a few years.

31
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,074
Today, it is more than 40 billion Euros

32
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:30,198
that are directly allocated
to R&D and innovation activities

33
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:33,063
through national and regional 
smart specialisation

34
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:35,015
strategies.

35
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:37,585
Indirectly,
the priorities of S3

36
00:01:37,785 --> 00:01:39,970
enable to mobilize over 250 billion

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,965
for the economic transformation
of the regions.

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,652
We must understand that when
the first article was written

39
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:48,669
there was no significant 
application or

40
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,225
implementation 
objective in Europe.

41
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:51,552
Absolutely none.

42
00:01:51,752 --> 00:01:54,156
At the end of our service
in the experts committee

43
00:01:54,356 --> 00:01:56,175
we all returned to
our studies. 

44
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:59,968
But then a surprising 
phenomenon occurred. 

45
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:04,082
It was during the preparation
of the new budgetary period

46
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,403
of 2014-2020.

47
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:08,759
A favourable time 
for new ideas. 

48
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,005
Moreover, the cohesion policy

49
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:13,296
which manages the allocation
of structural funds

50
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,242
put in place a
new mechanism:

51
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:17,780
the ex-ante conditionality

52
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,383
which aimed to help the regions

53
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,304
better spending the money received

54
00:02:21,504 --> 00:02:24,081
by asking them to comply
to different principles

55
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,732
aimed at optimizing 
public spending.

56
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:30,626
The principle of a smart
specialisation strategy

57
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,566
became one of its conditionalities.

58
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,544
The one which will determine
the funding

59
00:02:35,744 --> 00:02:38,081
to R&D 
and new technologies. 

60
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,783
Thus, each region
is somehow obliged

61
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:42,929
to design and implement
a smart specialisation strategy.

62
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,482
This has led
to the incredible spread

63
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:48,992
of smart specialisation 
ideas and practices. 

64
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:51,404
But why this idea
and not another?

65
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,227
There are many other good
ideas floating around

66
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:55,779
academic circles. 

67
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,095
Let's stay humble 

68
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,913
regarding the success of the concept
and its incredible impact:

69
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,102
without the principle
of ex-ante conditionality

70
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:04,933
if, for example, the strategy

71
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:07,040
had remained as a
simple recommendation

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,032
and not as an obligation

73
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:11,232
the story would have naturally
been very different. 

74
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,331
So many brilliant academic ideas

75
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:15,091
in the field of public policies

76
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,640
never crossed this invisible line

77
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,482
which separates the world of ideas 
from the world of practices.

78
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:22,215
This one crossed the line.

79
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:24,078
Perhaps thanks to its intrinsic qualities

80
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:25,672
but also assuredly

81
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,398
because of this new principle 
of ex-ante conditionality

82
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:31,289
which has structured cohesion policies

83
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:33,035
since 2014.

84
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:35,823
Beyond the mobilisation
of the European Commission

85
00:03:36,023 --> 00:03:39,702
as well as that of the
European Investment Bank,

86
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:42,966
interest and political support
of many institutions 

87
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:44,162
have played a major role.

88
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:46,964
Thus, the EU Council
of course

89
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:48,883
as this quotation proves it.

90
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,285
But also the commitment
of some members of the European Parliament.

91
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,359
I am thinking of  
Lambert Van Nistelrooij for example.

92
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,514
Also, regional coalitions

93
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,376
such as the Vanguard Initiative

94
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,587
that reflects the strong 
political support

95
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,256
of certain regional 
governments:

96
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:05,412
Catalonia, Scotland
Lombardy, Wallonia

97
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:08,163
Auvergne Rhone Alpes,
and many others.

98
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,880
These champions of smart
specialisation strategy

99
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,961
have incessantly defended the concept

100
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:14,976
and actively participated
to its spread

101
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:17,045
in the political circles 
in Brussels

102
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:19,919
as well as in the national
and regional capitals. 

103
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:23,036
Another decisive factor
in the spreading of the concept 

104
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:24,508
and its operationalization

105
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:27,943
was the development
of a technical assistance platform

106
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,262
hosted by the European Institute
of Seville

107
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,484
who played
and continues to play a key role

108
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,810
in the field of operational research,

109
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,790
indicators and 
technical assistance.

110
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,187
This platform has 
sparked decisive advances

111
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,186
in many areas.

112
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,920
The platform has also played a key role

113
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,989
in the creation
of a community of practices

114
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,763
made up of hundreds
of policy makers

115
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,366
of different EU countries

116
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:52,235
and of which a large portion
attends this course. 

117
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,762
At the end of these first years,

118
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:56,962
even if the impact assessment
has not yet been made, 

119
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:57,915
it's a little too early,

120
00:04:58,115 --> 00:04:59,571
the European Parliament's opinions

121
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:02,615
based on studies,
interviews and visits

122
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,093
have been very positive. 

123
00:05:05,118 --> 00:05:07,096
These opinions are close to
what we can read

124
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,121
in the first partial evaluations

125
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,783
such as those of Henning Kroll
of the ISI in Karlsruhe.

126
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,921
On this table we see that the

127
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,162
smart specialisation strategy

128
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,847
has enabled the regions to acquire

129
00:05:19,047 --> 00:05:20,861
a better knowledge
of their potential

130
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:22,183
and their opportunities

131
00:05:22,383 --> 00:05:25,092
which shows that a 
precondition of the process

132
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,599
of entrepreneurial discovery

133
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,161
was perfectly fulfilled
in most cases.

134
00:05:30,148 --> 00:05:31,297
What about the impact

135
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,497
on the coordination of R&D 
and innovation activities

136
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:35,969
at European level ?

137
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,184
The European Parliament hopes

138
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:39,451
for a decrease in project

139
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,637
and infrastructure 
duplications.

140
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,866
Duplications are
a source of waste

141
00:05:44,066 --> 00:05:44,964
and of critical mass failure

142
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:46,206
as we've previously seen.

143
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:48,347
But let's not be too ambitious

144
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,273
and imagine that a central planner

145
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:54,991
could organise the regional smart
specialisation strategies

146
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,564
so as to avoid duplication.

147
00:05:58,727 --> 00:05:59,637
If at least

148
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:02,175
the processes of 
entrepreneurial discoveries

149
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,358
are correctly developed 

150
00:06:03,558 --> 00:06:06,304
especially at the right 
level of granularity,

151
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:09,879
the diversity of fields,
projects and specialisations

152
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,871
should flourish in Europe. 

153
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,040
It is a soft coordination

154
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,310
adapted to the complexity of a system

155
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,052
such as that of the EU

156
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,906
which brings several hundreds 
of regions together.

157
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,305
In this respect,

158
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:23,680
the smart specialisation
approach

159
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,392
occupies an intermediate place,

160
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:26,898
as a form of coordination,

161
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:30,770
in between what we might call
the Gosplan on one hand

162
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:32,212
and the magical chaos of the market

163
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,256
on the other.

164
00:06:34,456 --> 00:06:37,575
A soft coordination
means that each region

165
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:38,983
will certainly share

166
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,092
one or two priority areas
with others

167
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,239
even if choices are made
at the right level of granularity.

168
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,835
It is inevitable

169
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,943
because the space of
opportunities and market niches

170
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:49,852
is not infinite,

171
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,198
which is a good thing,

172
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,251
because these similarities 
offer learning 

173
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,067
and collaboration opportunities.

174
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,526
In this case

175
00:06:57,726 --> 00:06:59,381
coordination and pooling

176
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,300
of certain resources
and infrastructures

177
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,467
as well as the circulation of knowledge

178
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,216
are recommended, as we've previously seen

179
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:06,789
in the case of maritime regions

180
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,595
in module 2.2.

181
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:12,277
A few thoughts to conclude.

182
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,808
The history of operationalization

183
00:07:15,008 --> 00:07:16,416
and the implementation of the concept

184
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,380
in the EU regions

185
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,634
is the story 
of an obvious tension

186
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:22,062
between on one hand

187
00:07:22,262 --> 00:07:25,146
the time which would have been necessary
to test this concept

188
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:28,066
and the regions' capacity to implement it

189
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:30,001
thanks to some pilot studies

190
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,618
and, on the other hand

191
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,142
the urgency of 2014.

192
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:34,833
An understandable emergency.

193
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:36,657
Would it have been wiser 
to wait until 2021?

194
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,347
That is to say the following
planification period

195
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,507
to operate 
a significant implementation?

196
00:07:41,707 --> 00:07:44,071
But this tension has
enabled the practice

197
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,960
to take a lead on the theory.

198
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,094
The consequence was that

199
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:50,442
during the first years

200
00:07:50,642 --> 00:07:52,078
there was a lack of a strong concept.

201
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:54,776
One could say a "tight" concept

202
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:57,068
as a reference and coordination point

203
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,798
between the different stakeholders:

204
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:01,801
the Commission, the
national and regional instances,

205
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,078
the researchers, and the business sector.

206
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,119
And so each party understood
what they could

207
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:05,935
or what suited them. 

208
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,789
On the other hand, 
the positive perspective

209
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,685
was that the concept itself, 
its content and its scope

210
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,091
have all continued to develop

211
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,550
and to grow thanks
to intensive interactions

212
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,885
between practice and theory.

213
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,786
Is this a case of
"lost in translation",

214
00:08:20,986 --> 00:08:22,969
as the anglo-saxons would call it?

215
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,293
This would mean that

216
00:08:24,493 --> 00:08:26,628
if the key concepts are frequently

217
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,436
mentioned in speeches and programmes

218
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:30,784
the spirit is not necessarily respected.

219
00:08:31,984 --> 00:08:33,283
Sincerely, I do not think so.

220
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:36,290
The rather radical novelty
of the proposed approach

221
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,413
is gradually accepted

222
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,052
by the regions.

223
00:08:40,252 --> 00:08:42,071
We will see it in the following sequences

224
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,618
devoted to the study 
of regional cases

225
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:47,944
in the regions of the Basque Country,
the Värmland

226
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,068
and Crete.

227
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:51,637
The story is far from being finished.

228
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,780
The different reports of the Parliament

229
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,202
recommend to the Regions

230
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:56,888
to re-examine their priorities

231
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,225
and to redefine them when 
they are too large

232
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:00,240
or too vague.

233
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,389
The principles of flexibility

234
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,905
and continuous entrepreneurial discovery

235
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:06,387
must be applied

236
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,178
and the strategy must 
therefore benefit

237
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:10,678
from an uninterrupted support
and a permanent animation.

238
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:14,741
Finally, the monitoring
and evaluation operations

239
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:18,309
must now be 
seriously implemented.

240
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:20,152
In conclusion,

241
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,928
although we know that 
ideas are not eternal

242
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:26,214
and that new ones often come
to replace the old ones

243
00:09:26,414 --> 00:09:28,317
especially in the case
of political changes

244
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,846
it would be absurd not to prolong

245
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,950
the experience of smart specialisation 
strategies one way or another.

246
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,650
It would be absurd

247
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,353
because the regions learned a lot

248
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,599
regarding the best 
practices and procedures

249
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,989
and are now much more capable

250
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,035
of effectively and efficiently 

251
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,085
designing and deploying

252
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:50,553
their smart specialisation
strategies.

253
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,814
Thanks in advance to those who 
followed the story closely

254
00:09:54,014 --> 00:09:55,260
and who would like to 

255
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,052
share their experience and opinion

256
00:09:58,277 --> 00:09:59,982
on our forums.
