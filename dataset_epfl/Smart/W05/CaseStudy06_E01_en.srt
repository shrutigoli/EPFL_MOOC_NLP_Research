1
00:00:24,587 --> 00:00:29,700
Värmland is a region in Sweden
 with a population of 276,000

2
00:00:29,913 --> 00:00:32,799
and a land area slightly smaller
than that of Israel.

3
00:00:34,046 --> 00:00:37,021
If you compare Värmland 
with Europe as a whole,

4
00:00:37,236 --> 00:00:40,086
it's scarcely populated 
rural region.

5
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:43,068
The employment rate 
is relatively high 

6
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:45,686
when considered in 
the European perspective. 

7
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:47,682
The labor market 
is gender segregated

8
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:52,525
with women often active in the areas
of health and social care.

9
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:55,350
while men are most active 
in the areas of manufacturing, 

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:57,959
extraction and IT.

11
00:00:58,193 --> 00:01:01,106
It is estimated that a large share
of the work force

12
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:05,381
is dependent on the region's
Forest based bioeconomy.

13
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:09,074
Värmland is a region that 
is dependent on exports

14
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:12,531
with Norway and  Germany
being important customers.

15
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:17,665
Regarding GDP, Värmland
is very close to  EU mean.

16
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:20,730
The level of higher education
is above average 

17
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:23,360
when compared to other
to other European regions

18
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:27,445
And the level of education
is generally higher.

19
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,983
On the European innovation 
scoreboard

20
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:33,400
in a range of four categories
Värmland is placed

21
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:37,372
in the second highest category
strong innovators

22
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:45,995
One milestone for Värmland was that
we participated in the project.

23
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,444
It was in the period 
of 2005 and 2007.

24
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:54,720
This was about how our universities
comely cooperate with the regions

25
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:59,531
We got a number of recommendations
from these expert groups 

26
00:01:59,748 --> 00:02:00,898
from university

27
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:05,251
For instance, they said that
we should form a contract

28
00:02:05,434 --> 00:02:08,146
on Research between
Karistad  University 

29
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:12,217
and legion of Värmland
and we should also focus more

30
00:02:12,421 --> 00:02:15,083
on strengthening the links 

31
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:19,361
between the clusters 
and the researchers

32
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:24,278
So when we started the process
of forming the Värmland region

33
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:27,914
research and innovation strategy
for small specialization

34
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,995
we for instance had two generations 

35
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:34,416
of such research agreement
with the university

36
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,584
We have the cluster strategy 
in place and also,

37
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:38,814
an entrepreneur strategy

38
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:42,741
I think we had 3 to 4 worsens 
of the regional 

39
00:02:42,923 --> 00:02:45,748
development programs as an 
experience base.

40
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,989
So we both had the policy side
in place and we also 

41
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,313
had the culture
and how we cooperate in Värmland.

42
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:56,033
So I think the
 Sedea recommendations

43
00:02:56,266 --> 00:02:57,941
were very much in line

44
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:02,543
that we got them out in 2006, 
there were very much in line

45
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,784
with what later became
smart specializations 

46
00:03:05,992 --> 00:03:08,942
So we were quite well prepared
well enough for forming 

47
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:10,888
this strategy when we took off.

48
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,921
When forming the Värmland list 3,
we started off making some analysis.

49
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:20,990
The first thing was to put together 
or compile what we already knew

50
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,188
from all the reports.

51
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,631
The second thing was to make 
a statistical analysis

52
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:30,921
of the strongest branches, 
industrial branches in Värmland

53
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:36,104
and then the most central thing 
was to make a quality analysis 

54
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,886
of the strongest branches

55
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,676
and connect them to the 
research areas and get to know

56
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:42,679
how strong they were.

57
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:46,394
So we mainly seen
on international perspective,

58
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:50,035
so it was a kind
of a bench marking for us.

59
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:54,438
Next phase in the work was forming
working groups around

60
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:59,711
these identified strongest areas,
than the most promising areas

61
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:04,644
We involved in total 60 persons 
with equal distribution between 

62
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:08,869
the researchers, public sectors 
and industry people.

63
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:12,145
These groups contributed 
to the analysis,

64
00:04:12,304 --> 00:04:15,879
especially the researchers
with their global perspective

65
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:19,533
on research and on related branches

66
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,694
Each of the group made 
a SWAT analysis

67
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,634
for their own strong area

68
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:28,159
They formed a vision and 
formulated the most valuable assets

69
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:32,312
that already existed in the region
to build up on.

70
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,341
They also formulated which were
 the most critical actions 

71
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,253
that should be taken in order 
to move in the direction

72
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,767
towards the vision 
which was formulated.

73
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:46,823
In this stage we had five,
 a branch elated 

74
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:50,838
smart specialization 
and one horizontal as well.

75
00:04:51,035 --> 00:04:55,361
After that the Värmland risk free
document was put together 

76
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:58,977
and anchored by the different actors
and stakeholders in the region.

77
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:02,152
The cooperation with 
Region Värmland,

78
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,669
 I mean, it's been on going 
for quite some time,

79
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:08,448
but it took a new step 
in the common development

80
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,582
based on an OSD review.

81
00:05:10,806 --> 00:05:12,656
We have a mutual understanding,

82
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,425
a mutual strategy which 
we both benefit from.

83
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,712
The corporation with Region Värmland
took a really big step in a

84
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:26,218
in an common lateral return,
common agreement 

85
00:05:26,423 --> 00:05:29,148
between 2010 and 2014

86
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,554
where we invested together 
in a term professional-ship program.

87
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,868
The term professorships 
were build up

88
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:40,234
in the connections between 
the development 

89
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,077
in the industry, the public sector

90
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:44,879
and also the civic society 
in Värmland,

91
00:05:45,064 --> 00:05:49,751
but also to relate
to the Karistad University strategy.

92
00:05:49,956 --> 00:05:53,457
I find that researchers 
get involved quite easily 

93
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,370
since they have been involved since 
a long time ago

94
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:00,968
We have had this cooperation 
Karistad University 

95
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,474
region of Värmland
for many years now

96
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,375
and the previous program referred
to as  term 

97
00:06:06,526 --> 00:06:10,063
professorship program,
there you could see that a lot of 

98
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:12,627
these established context were made

99
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:17,556
that we now can easily build upon
and also the researcher

100
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,541
was involved when the strategy
was formulated

101
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:22,889
and also when the agreement
was formulated

102
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,304
because when the agreement 
was formulated

103
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:29,646
they were asked to give suggestions
for what kind of project

104
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:33,462
would be important
 for the development in Värmland,

105
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,640
both for the research and both 
for the regional development 

106
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,092
related to smart 
specializations strategy.

107
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,970
The next step now in 
the corporation in Region Värmland

108
00:06:42,156 --> 00:06:46,368
is built on the innovation strategy 
called the Smart

109
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,917
Specialization Strategy in Värmland

110
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:54,471
where we have been able 
to integrate the university strategy

111
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,268
into the smart specialization
strategy 

112
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,959
and form the new agreement 
between the two parties 

113
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,240
based on that.

114
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:05,002
So we foresee that this 
is a very important step

115
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,276
for both Värmland 
but also for the University 

116
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,084
in reaching the strategies 
that we have set up. 

117
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:13,771
If we compare with previous
agreements that Karistad University

118
00:07:13,948 --> 00:07:17,298
and Region Värmland has have
like the term professorship program,

119
00:07:17,501 --> 00:07:19,851
the new thing with the academy
for smart specialization ,

120
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:24,177
is that it has  higher ambitions
for creating a platform

121
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,743
between the projects
that are currently on going 

122
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:30,259
from the agreement.

123
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:34,172
Like in the term 
professorship program, you could 

124
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:39,084
see that it was more of 
separate projects within the areas,

125
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:43,255
and now the ambitions is to create
energies between the projects

126
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:46,641
and to also build in 
a support function

127
00:07:46,806 --> 00:07:50,481
for future development to take place
for future projects to happen.

128
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:54,791
Smart specialization,
as I understand it is about 

129
00:07:54,985 --> 00:08:00,973
smart ways of using and operating
on assets and resources

130
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,715
in the region.

131
00:08:02,929 --> 00:08:05,104
Its about innovative ways 
of creating value 

132
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,157
for different stakeholders, users,
customers, companies

133
00:08:09,345 --> 00:08:12,083
and also for citizens 
in young world.

134
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:15,409
The corporation  has actually 
been branded as the Academy 

135
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:19,402
of Smart Specialization
and for us its something unique 

136
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:23,710
to have that kind of brand 
of a, such an important agreement.

137
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:25,636
So we are glad with that.

138
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,720
This is step by step or interactive
way of working 

139
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:33,895
in the working groups resulted 
in the common understanding

140
00:08:34,035 --> 00:08:38,423
of the situation, the challenges, 
the opportunities,  et cetera.

141
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:43,798
The participants could also  anchor
the work in progress back home

142
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:47,013
in their own organizations,
at Karistad University 

143
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,803
or in the cluster organizations
with the industry.

144
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:53,756
Inspired by the Germany region,
the lowest Saxony, 

145
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:56,343
we use the triangle model 

146
00:08:56,548 --> 00:09:00,511
with the other industrial branches 
at the base of the triangle, 

147
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:04,741
the research areas on the other, 
on one of the sides of the triangle,

148
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:08,246
and on the other side, 
more market or demand side aspects.

149
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:13,039
If we could find strengths 
on all three sides of the triangle 

150
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:16,024
for a specialization, 
this was a good candidate

151
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:19,134
for a Värmland specialization. 

152
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:22,412
This was also ground 
for the priority 

153
00:09:22,616 --> 00:09:27,816
between the vice specializations 
where the Forest-based Bioeconomy 

154
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:30,995
came out as the strongest 
specialization 

155
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,118
and the one with 
the highest priority. 

156
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:37,544
So a knowledge triangle 
is a way of explaining 

157
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,251
that it's important 
to build strong linkages 

158
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:44,282
between education, 
and innovation and research. 

159
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,534
So the academic 
for smart specialization

160
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:49,797
is trying to establish these 
knowledge triangles 

161
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:54,543
by making things happen 
by creating meeting places, 

162
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:58,032
by organizing activities 
for making 

163
00:09:58,237 --> 00:10:01,250
these entrepreneurial discovery 
processes happen, 

164
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:07,594
and by organizing experience 
exchange between the projects

165
00:10:08,368 --> 00:10:11,368
and between the specializations 
that we have. 

166
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:15,486
Our specializations says not only 
what we are good at

167
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:18,559
but also what we are good for. 

168
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:21,591
They should create value 
for customers, citizens, 

169
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,571
or sometimes patience as well. 

170
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,955
It should be reasons for researchers
 to participate

171
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:32,269
and it should create values 
for companies involved in this. 

172
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:36,718
Smart specializations should also 
be a part of the solution 

173
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,473
of societal challenges. 

174
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,012
So there are Academy 
for Smart Specialization.

175
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:47,912
is organized, it's not a legal body
and it's not a specific institution

176
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,618
You find somewhere 
that you can go to and visit, 

177
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:56,635
it's actually a platform for 
cooperation  and connecting people,

178
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,641
and we have a working group
consisting of representatives 

179
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,304
from both the organization; 
Karlstad University

180
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,472
 and Region Värmland, that is 
following ideas and initiatives 

181
00:11:08,703 --> 00:11:12,565
from an early stage 
into development of projects, 

182
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:16,604
concrete projects, where you have 
your own co-finding in the project

183
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,449
but we also have the working group

184
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,167
helping with finding 
external funding. 

185
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:25,803
And the we have 
a stirring committee, 

186
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,850
consisting of the senior management
from both organizations 

187
00:11:30,094 --> 00:11:33,806
and they draw up the strategic lines
for the cooperation

188
00:11:34,011 --> 00:11:36,998
for future development, 
and take the strategic decisions

189
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:41,396
and make sure that we're in line
with the budget decided. 

190
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,702
And then we also have intentions
of establishing 

191
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,947
more support functions 
for the academy 

192
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,474
like supporting outcomes 
from the projects,

193
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:57,915
that they are involved in,
educational programs. 

194
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,530
So the academy is built for everyone
that is interested 

195
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:04,141
in finding possibilities 
for cooperation, 

196
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,453
and that of course have 
their own time and funding 

197
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:11,784
for supporting projects 
that we would like to create,

198
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,659
and it's for researches 
that cost the university,

199
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:17,335
it's for the cluster organizations
to be part of, 

200
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:22,194
it's for industry, public sector, 
for civic society.

201
00:12:22,455 --> 00:12:25,817
If you have business angels, 
they can also participate,

202
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,469
and of course, 
it's for the students.

203
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:31,903
The expectation for the Academy 
for Smart Specialization 

204
00:12:32,102 --> 00:12:35,889
is that it's going to be a tool
for transformation and renewal

205
00:12:36,045 --> 00:12:39,257
of public and private sectors 
in Värmland, as well as,

206
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:42,137
for the research and education 
of Karlstad University.

207
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:46,475
I think the more important factors 
to be able to succeed 

208
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:50,807
in this kind of cooperation is that 
you have a mutual understanding,

209
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:54,590
it must be a win-win solution
for all parties involved. 

210
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,889
Both the region of Värmland, 
Karlstad University, 

211
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,333
but also for the business sector
as such, the public sector 

212
00:13:01,553 --> 00:13:02,891
and the civic society. 

213
00:13:03,084 --> 00:13:06,234
We need to understand that we do 
have different targets, 

214
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,716
different missions, but if we can
combine those 

215
00:13:09,926 --> 00:13:12,526
into a common strategy 
and common goal, 

216
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:15,443
then I think we all will succeed. 

217
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:17,654
Collaboration is very important. 

218
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:20,786
It is emphasized in 
the University's Strategic Plan 

219
00:13:20,979 --> 00:13:25,216
and collaboration is about 
taking your responsibility, 

220
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:28,721
where we contribute 
with our different resources.

221
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:33,528
And collaboration need 
to be a win-win situation

222
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,192
and the outcome, 
the value is different

223
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,578
 for different stakeholder. 

224
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:39,684
For the university, it could be 
access to data

225
00:13:39,913 --> 00:13:41,788
 for the scholars, 
or the researchers. 

226
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,861
But it could also be that we get 
partners for key funding 

227
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:50,063
which we need in many 
of our research applications. 

228
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:53,069
And for a company, it could mean 
knowledge they need 

229
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,330
for their product development 
or it could be that

230
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:59,762
they get in contact with people
that they might employ.
