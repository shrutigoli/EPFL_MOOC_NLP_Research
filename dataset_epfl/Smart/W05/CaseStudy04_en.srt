1
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,369
First, according to the ranking on
Regional Institution of Quality 

2
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:27,495
published by the European Commission,
the Basque Country stands out

3
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,789
positively and ranks first among
all Spanish regions.

4
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:36,612
It's important, not only having the
competence to apply policies,

5
00:00:36,856 --> 00:00:41,143
but the capability to make good
use of these competencies.

6
00:00:42,254 --> 00:00:47,641
Third, noting where almost all
analyst and government were against

7
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:52,361
active initial policies, the Basque
government developed plans

8
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:55,403
and programs with clear
prioritisations.

9
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:55,413
In some of these programs,
for instance, the one launched to
and programs with clear
prioritisations.

10
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,677
In some of these programs,
for instance, the one launched to

11
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,933
bolster the economy, the Basque
Country was a real

12
00:01:01,988 --> 00:01:03,501
pioneer in the world.

13
00:01:03,545 --> 00:01:08,251
In some of the programs for instance
in the support for the STI

14
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:08,282
infrastructure, Basque policies differ
totally from other Spanish regions.
In some of the programs for instance
in the support for the STI

15
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:13,776
infrastructure, Basque policies differ
totally from other Spanish regions.

16
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:19,702
Not only the amount of resources
but also in their composition.

17
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:25,030
Unlike other Spanish regions where
STI policies were read but the

18
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:29,098
Department of Education, in the
Basque Country the STI policies

19
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:33,281
was written by the Industry
Department with a philosophy

20
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:35,427
of public private partnership.

21
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:40,712
Finally, Basque Provincial Councils
have much more power than the

22
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:41,912
Spanish regions.

23
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:45,524
For instance, taxes collected by
provincial councils are not

24
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,834
by the Basque government

25
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,998
and even if the Basque government
holds the main competence and

26
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:53,034
industrial and R&D policies.

27
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:58,054
Provincial councils have their own
programs and are launching their

28
00:01:58,096 --> 00:02:00,471
S3 strategies even more.

29
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:07,051
Capital city councils and counties
such as Bilbao Arrigorriaga

30
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:10,278
are working on S3 principles

31
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:27,365
In terms of performance the
Basque Country's one of the most

32
00:02:27,383 --> 00:02:31,258
comprehensive regions, not only
in Spain but also in Europe.

33
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:37,116
So we can see in this graph, GDP per
capita has been constantly rising,

34
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:42,047
reaching levels well above European
averages and even the average in

35
00:02:42,086 --> 00:02:47,099
Germany which is one of the most
competitive countries in Europe.

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,470
This is probably due to the secure
structure of the Basque country

37
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:56,706
in which manufacturing has a
large weight in the economy.

38
00:02:56,757 --> 00:03:03,120
This work has been decreasing
since around 30% in the year 2000

39
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:08,612
to around 20% in the year 2015

40
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:15,524
but still it concentrates a large
part of what is produced

41
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:15,553
in the Basque Country.
but still it concentrates a large
part of what is produced

42
00:03:15,553 --> 00:03:17,211
in the Basque Country.

43
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,399
It's also due to the outward orientation
of the economy because around 35%

44
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:25,831
of what is produced in the
Basque Country is exported

45
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:32,614
elsewhere in the world and about 30%
is sold to other regions in Spain.

46
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:40,496
But one of the reasons as well is
the innovation in the Basque Country.

47
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:46,946
In this other graph we can see that
the expenditure on R&D with respect

48
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:53,255
to GDP has also been growing
systematically despite the crisis

49
00:03:54,624 --> 00:04:00,574
reaching levels which are about 2%
of GDP, which is about the average

50
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,079
in Europe, not as much as what
happens in Germany for instance

51
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:08,772
but it is still constitutes a large
proportion of the GDP.

52
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:13,344
That has made the Basque Country to
be considered a strong innovator in

53
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:17,657
Europe according to the
Regional Innovation Scoreboard

54
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:23,160
and also a Region of Excellence
because instead of what happens in

55
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,159
Spain which is a moderate innovator

56
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:28,418
the Basque Country is a strong
innovator, the only

57
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:32,073
region in Spain according to the
last Regional Innovation Scoreboard.

58
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:36,963
That does not mean that the crisis
has not had its toll on the economy

59
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,732
and in society in the Basque Country.

60
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:42,175
as illustrated by this other graph

61
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:47,113
in which we can see the unemployment
rate and how it has been growing

62
00:04:47,137 --> 00:04:50,037
not as much as it's been happening
in Spain since the beginning of the

63
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:57,084
crisis but from the lowest rate
of 3.3% in the year 2007

64
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:01,494
to around 16% in the year 2014.

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,025
Much higher than the level seen
in Europe.

66
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:11,136
Also something to be considered is
what we have observed and we have

67
00:05:11,205 --> 00:05:15,655
called the Innovation Paradox
because we observed in the past that

68
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:20,777
despite the high levels of input in
terms of innovation must measure

69
00:05:20,803 --> 00:05:26,116
for instance by the percentage of
R&D that expenditure  was attributed

70
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:32,194
to GDP and the good outcomes in
terms of GDP per capita.

71
00:05:32,572 --> 00:05:37,772
The outcomes in terms of innovation
measured for instance with patents

72
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:40,413
and per capita were not so high.

73
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:43,608
That might be because the
outcomes of innovation have

74
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:44,850
not been measured correctly.

75
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:49,701
We all know that patents might not
be a good measure for innovation

76
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:53,078
but it might be pointing out to
something that is in the economy.

77
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:17,683
The Basque RIS3 is the science,
technology and innovation plan 2020.

78
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:20,614
This strategy was developed
in 2 phases.

79
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:25,600
The first phase was developed in 2013

80
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:29,011
and delivered by the Economic
Development and Competitiveness

81
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:30,899
Department of the Basque Government

82
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:34,648
with the support of Orkestra, the
Basque Institute of Competitiveness.

83
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:39,199
In this period it was clear that the
side of developing and leaving a

84
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,805
strategy more than a plan

85
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:45,835
and we developed an analysis

86
00:06:45,885 --> 00:06:50,936
to identify the main vertical
priorities for the Basque Economy.

87
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,652
For this we take into
account 3 criteria.

88
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:57,086
The business capabilities
in the territory,

89
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:00,322
the scientific and
technological capabilities

90
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,356
and also the market and the
social needs

91
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,137
and the result was  the
identification of 3 main priorities

92
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:12,517
which were advanced manufacturing,
energy and BioScience health.

93
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:18,042
After the development of these
analyses our dialogue with other

94
00:07:18,078 --> 00:07:21,078
departments in the government started

95
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:25,089
and in this dialogue, it was clear
that it was critical for the

96
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:28,186
involvement and collaboration of
other departments of the government

97
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:30,415
to the development of this strategy.

98
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,362
And that's why the leadership in the
second phase of the development of

99
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,839
this strategy was assumed by the
Presidency of the Basque Government.

100
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:47,549
So during 2014, the Presidency of
the Basque Country with the support

101
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:54,371
of DEUSTO started developing a
plan, a plan for the development

102
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:57,418
of the RIS3 strategy in the
Basque Country.

103
00:07:57,446 --> 00:08:01,146
For that the Basque Science,
Technology and Innovation Council

104
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:06,108
created an operational team in which
the different departments of the

105
00:08:06,148 --> 00:08:11,548
Basque Country with other institutions
were developing this plan.

106
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:17,102
Regarding the participation of the
Quadruple Helix on the development

107
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:18,466
of the plan,

108
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,836
the process was not widely open

109
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,212
but there were several mechanisms
to consult and incorporate the

110
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,534
the influence of the  Triple Helix
agents, mainly firms, knowledge

111
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:38,282
institutions and also all the
governmental entities.

112
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,912
So during this open process,
all the opportunity niches were

113
00:08:44,963 --> 00:08:49,988
identified and were incorporated
into the strategy which were

114
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:57,240
food, urban habitats ecosystems
and cultural and creative industries

115
00:08:57,582 --> 00:09:03,982
So in general, there is a recognition,
that the strategy, the RIS3 strategy

116
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:08,413
of the Basque Country has made
sense, this is our continuation of

117
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,300
previous strategies and also there
is a good balance amongst the

118
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,910
short term and long term needs

119
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:19,822
and one of the critical issues to
underline is that even in this

120
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:24,636
second period the focus was in
developing a plan, this was really

121
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,348
at the end a living plan because what
was published at the end of 2014

122
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:34,401
was changed in 2015 with a new annex

123
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:39,830
taking into account the changes and
new ideas that come from the

124
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:43,502
implementation phases in 2015.

125
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:47,317
So this is really a living strategy
and now it's in the

126
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:52,243
implementation phase which is being
a very participatory process for the

127
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:55,838
identification of focuses of the
priorities in the Basque Country.

128
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:16,859
One of the most interesting thing
for me about the Basque RIS3 story

129
00:10:16,895 --> 00:10:20,908
is the changes that it has provoked
in regional government as we've

130
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:24,346
moved from the planning phase or
design phase of the RIS3 through to

131
00:10:24,384 --> 00:10:25,859
the implementation phase.

132
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:32,306
The RIS3 itself took the shape of
the 2020 Science, Technology and

133
00:10:32,358 --> 00:10:35,783
Innovation plan which was
approved at the end of 2014

134
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:40,183
and after that we moved into a
process more of implementation.

135
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:44,695
The RIS3 plan itself setup what can
be referred to as the Basque RIS3

136
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:49,569
governance house which identified a
series of institutions and processes

137
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:52,936
or organs and processes that
were designed to help guide the

138
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,647
implementation of the RIS3.

139
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:58,047
Within this I think we can
point to 2 really significant

140
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,007
types of changes in terms
of the governance.

141
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,980
One in terms of governance, within
government and also in terms of

142
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:05,068
governance beyond government.

143
00:11:05,117 --> 00:11:08,305
Thinking first of all in terms of
governance within government,

144
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:13,749
the RIS3 governance house or the
design of the government

145
00:11:13,789 --> 00:11:16,876
structure of the RIS3 set up a
couple of new really important,

146
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,662
quite important institutions.

147
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,470
On the one hand there was a new
advisory group which was designed

148
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:26,589
initially to advise the Basque Science,
Technology and Innovation Council.

149
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,425
However in practice it's really been
advising the president and the

150
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:31,201
council of ministers directly.

151
00:11:31,268 --> 00:11:33,956
What was interesting about this
group was that is was set up

152
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:39,383
with an explicit aim to bring people
from a range of different disciplines

153
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,762
and a range of different places,
and not the usual suspects,

154
00:11:42,793 --> 00:11:44,206
kind of fresh ideas.

155
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:47,109
People who could take a look at what
was happening from the outside

156
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:49,380
and provide insight and ideas

157
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:52,101
And it's really, I think, worked
quite well in terms of providing

158
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,925
a sounding board for the
council of ministers

159
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,010
and the President in terms of
the top leadership of the strategy.

160
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:02,999
The other key development in terms
of within government was the

161
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,573
establishment of an
interdepartmental committee.

162
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,700
This was a relatively new
arrangement because when

163
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:13,880
the RIS3 was initially started
working on the design phase.

164
00:12:14,144 --> 00:12:16,382
It was very much the domain
of one department,

165
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,815
the competitiveness department.

166
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:21,752
However that changed to become under
control of the presidency department

167
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,767
and therefore there was acknowledged
the need to look at the different

168
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:30,884
departments that were involved in,
that could play a role in RIS3.

169
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:34,672
So an interdepartmental committee
was created that brought together

170
00:12:34,744 --> 00:12:36,381
all of the relevant departments.

171
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,459
Competitiveness, education, health,
environment, finance etc.

172
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:45,684
This committee has been really quite
important because it brings together

173
00:12:45,716 --> 00:12:48,916
the vice ministers and the heads
of departments from within those

174
00:12:48,951 --> 00:12:52,339
departments who are working
day to day on policy issues.

175
00:12:52,383 --> 00:12:55,463
So it's been an important step in
improving the policy coordination

176
00:12:55,463 --> 00:12:55,470
as the RIS3 has started to be
implemented and we see departments
So it's been an important step in
improving the policy coordination

177
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,326
as the RIS3 has started to be
implemented and we see departments

178
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:01,065
that previously weren't used to
working together are now working

179
00:13:01,095 --> 00:13:04,583
together over certain issues and
certain aspects of policy instruments.

180
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,142
So within government we see 2 really
important differences in governance

181
00:13:09,177 --> 00:13:11,240
that has been provoked
by the RIS3 process.

182
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:15,452
But looking beyond government
we can also see important changes.

183
00:13:15,475 --> 00:13:18,362
At the bottom of the governance
house diagram you can see this

184
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:22,170
notion of live processes for the
engagement of different actors

185
00:13:22,852 --> 00:13:26,602
and this is the idea that from the
ground, the RIS3 governance needs

186
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:30,795
to involve, not just government but
also business, clusters, universities

187
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,478
and to lesser extent, I think in the
Basque Case Civil Society.

188
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:38,467
One of the aspects that perhaps
hasn't been integrated yet

189
00:13:38,491 --> 00:13:39,854
to such a great extent.

190
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:41,989
The way this has been
operationalised in the

191
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:44,849
implementation has been through
the creation of spaces

192
00:13:45,252 --> 00:13:46,952
which is setup as steering groups.

193
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:50,386
One steering groups of each of the
3 priorities and one steering group

194
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,144
for each of the 4 opportunity niches

195
00:13:52,177 --> 00:13:55,715
These steering groups bring together
the key players that are involved in

196
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,914
the business, in the technology,
in the research and in government

197
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:02,007
in different departments within
each of those priorities

198
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:05,480
and they're designed in the sense to
support the entrepreneur or the

199
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:08,952
discovery process in the sense that
the priorities themselves  can be

200
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:11,704
refined and can evolve over time

201
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:13,852
with the input for these
different agents.

202
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:18,987
So we can start to see a
change in the governance from

203
00:14:20,117 --> 00:14:21,692
below starting as well.

204
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:25,157
These groups work to certain
guidelines that were established

205
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,589
by the interdepartmental committee

206
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:30,406
so there are rules of the game in
terms of which actors are involved

207
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,628
in terms of the types of activities
and the types of decisions that the

208
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,603
steering groups are working on

209
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:38,827
and however there is also a lot of
flexibility they're designed to

210
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:42,836
be flexible so that each priority
can take its own path and that's

211
00:14:42,855 --> 00:14:46,030
very important because advanced
manufacturing, for example, with all

212
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:50,357
its different sub-sectors and
technologies is quite a different

213
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:54,274
priority to energy and also the
opportunity niches which were in

214
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:57,175
a far earlier stage of development
again require something slightly

215
00:14:57,204 --> 00:15:00,929
different in terms of the process to
more established priorities.

216
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:03,811
So that flexibility again has been
quite an important aspect to this

217
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:04,886
governance from below.

218
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:11,189
Overall if we look at this group of
changes both within and beyond

219
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:12,665
government in terms of governance

220
00:15:12,672 --> 00:15:17,910
I think we can summarise them in
terms of a move towards a more

221
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:22,932
distributed leadership when it
comes to territorial strategy.

222
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:26,100
We've moved in a sense from a
situation where leadership was very

223
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,408
much from government and
also very much from within one

224
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,078
department in government towards a
situation where different

225
00:15:31,076 --> 00:15:34,064
departments of government are taking
responsibility for different aspects

226
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,134
of the strategy and where we're
starting to distribute leadership

227
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:37,141
with the strategy also amongst
businesses, clusters, research
of the strategy and where we're
starting to distribute leadership

228
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:41,134
with the strategy also amongst
businesses, clusters, research

229
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,589
institutions etc that engage from
the bottom up.

230
00:15:58,084 --> 00:16:02,809
The Basque energy industry is made
up of around 350 companies

231
00:16:03,138 --> 00:16:09,251
with a very highly specialised focus
in energy sector activities.

232
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:15,816
The overall turnover of the sector
counts to over €47 billion.

233
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:23,771
Nearly €15 billion sourced locally
and provides over 21 000 jobs

234
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:25,074
in the Basque Country.

235
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:29,781
This industry is backed by
a very robust technological

236
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,610
and innovation infrastructure

237
00:16:32,055 --> 00:16:33,880
made up of technology call centres,

238
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,237
universities and the R&D
units of the companies

239
00:16:38,528 --> 00:16:42,516
that have a very consolidated presence
in the different energy fields.

240
00:16:42,812 --> 00:16:48,299
The Basque energy companies invest
every year around €400 million in

241
00:16:48,324 --> 00:16:49,699
research and development

242
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:55,489
of which 55% is spent within
the Basque Country.

243
00:16:56,689 --> 00:17:00,601
The choice of energy is one
of the priorities of the regional

244
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:03,039
innovation as marked as
specialisation strategy of the

245
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,795
Basque Country of the RIS3
of the Basque government.

246
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:11,301
It's in fact based of the key role
the energy sector is playing in the

247
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,402
Basque economy.

248
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:19,643
For emphasizing this, the competitive
advantage of this priority as

249
00:17:19,661 --> 00:17:23,599
specific a strategy on technological
and industrial development

250
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:28,509
called EnergiBasque have been setup
with the ambitious vision of turning

251
00:17:28,542 --> 00:17:32,842
the Basque Country an international
knowledge poll and the reference

252
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:35,856
regarding the industrial and
technological development

253
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,314
of specific energy technologies.

254
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:45,369
It's clear that Smart Specialisation
strategies implies identifying the

255
00:17:45,403 --> 00:17:49,641
characteristics of a specific
territory and exclusive assets

256
00:17:49,671 --> 00:17:53,571
of each region and putting in place
mechanisms to enhance them.

257
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:58,417
The definition of a Smart
Specialisation strategy implies

258
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:03,495
identifying the characteristics of
the specific assets of each region

259
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:08,245
and putting in place the right
mechanisms to enhance them.

260
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,572
But it is also very important to
bring together all the participants

261
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:17,317
and stake holders around the
shared vision of this strategy

262
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,666
that can make RIS3 a territorial
strategy rather that just a

263
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,152
government strategy.

264
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,256
For building this shared vision,
the Basque government has created

265
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:31,397
a public private collaborative
process and space,

266
00:18:31,781 --> 00:18:35,731
the so called,  steering groups
for each RIS3 priority

267
00:18:36,168 --> 00:18:38,743
and the Basque government has
delegated in the Basque energy

268
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,765
cluster the leading role
in the energy priority.

269
00:18:43,729 --> 00:18:46,729
The Basque Energy Cluster is
an industry driven cluster.

270
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:52,120
It was created in 1997 as a
non-profit organisation and

271
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,372
integrates presently around
180 companies, members,

272
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:01,915
including leading international
companies, highly competitive SME's

273
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,555
but also research and technology
centres, universities and the public

274
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:10,494
bodies involved in the energy
and technology developments.

275
00:19:12,102 --> 00:19:17,252
The organisers of priorities of those
7 market areas and 2 key enabling

276
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:22,077
technologies has allowed to
identify synergies between them

277
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:27,191
showing the possibility of aligning
efforts and resources and combining

278
00:19:27,315 --> 00:19:31,453
technological solutions from
those several sectors.

279
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:37,035
As a consequence, we are aiming
to convert this new approach,

280
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:41,902
this 3 new value change into a
real global value change aiming

281
00:19:41,967 --> 00:19:45,767
at opening opportunities and
complementary resources for

282
00:19:45,804 --> 00:19:49,804
our companies, not only at
regional level but also globally.

283
00:19:50,004 --> 00:19:55,929
So this is the reason why we are
being very active in different

284
00:19:55,998 --> 00:20:00,073
European initiatives such as the
Vanguard Initiative network

285
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:03,273
where the Basque Country is
co-leading, together with Scotland,

286
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:07,603
the pilot action called advance
manufacturing for energy related

287
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:09,379
applications in harsh environments

288
00:20:09,418 --> 00:20:14,268
and we are also participating in
some different platforms and

289
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:16,543
networks, Europe-wide.

290
00:20:17,053 --> 00:20:21,353
The Basque Energy Cluster is also
leading European strategy cluster

291
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:26,664
partnerships on the Smart
Specialisation investment platforms

292
00:20:26,687 --> 00:20:31,350
such as the offshore energy and
smart grids areas in which we are

293
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,277
closely collaborating with the
commissions Smart Specialisation

294
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,754
platform on energy.

295
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:45,074
All this interregional cooperation
efforts are aimed to leave an

296
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:49,440
outward looking dimension to our
regional innovation as Smart

297
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:50,822
Specialisation strategy.

298
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,487
So 4 years ago, we started with a
specialisation strategy working

299
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:12,857
together with Orkestra,
trying to find the main strategic

300
00:21:12,908 --> 00:21:14,445
areas in the Basque Country.

301
00:21:14,552 --> 00:21:18,827
Considering our knowledge,
specialities and all together

302
00:21:18,899 --> 00:21:20,936
with the industry strength.

303
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:24,774
Quantifying 3 main areas which
are advanced manufacturing,

304
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:27,128
related to our capabilities here.

305
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:33,648
For instance, aeronautics,
train industry, at the same time,

306
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:36,444
automation and of course,
machine tooling.

307
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:42,977
The other area is energy focused on
renewable energies and on batteries,

308
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,913
on our capabilities there

309
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,366
and the third one is biosciences

310
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:49,560
but mainly focused on health.

311
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:54,133
Not only with pharma but with
medical devices at the same time.

312
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:58,097
Together with the 3 main areas,
we're working with some niches.

313
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,415
For instance, the food industry
where we have capabilities from

314
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:04,764
the knowledge point of view but
also strong capabilities from the

315
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,267
industry point of view.

316
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:11,524
Then when we're finished with the
strategy definition, we started

317
00:22:11,612 --> 00:22:14,112
trying to implement the strategy

318
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:19,599
and implementation has gone with some
pilot groups on each of the areas.

319
00:22:19,716 --> 00:22:23,916
And at the same time, with the
capabilities and all the work in

320
00:22:23,936 --> 00:22:27,336
the pilot groups, we have been
working in Europe, of course,

321
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,188
with some other regions.

322
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:33,169
For instance, with the Vanguard
Initiative, we are some of the

323
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:37,233
founders of the Vanguard Initiative
and we are leading, together with

324
00:22:37,275 --> 00:22:43,375
Scotland, a project with
manufacturing for the energy

325
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:47,077
industry, renewable energy industry
for harsh environments.

326
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,034
So this is one of our work in Europe.

327
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,825
The other one, for instance, is
with KIC Initiatives.

328
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:58,503
One in advanced manufacturing and
the other one in the food industry.

329
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:03,153
The food industry has just been
approved last month so we are

330
00:23:03,199 --> 00:23:07,912
trying to work there and, of course,
our companies, our research centres

331
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:14,134
and universities are working very
hard in the Horizon 2020 strategy.

332
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:18,647
So this is the main areas now that
we are working and we hope that

333
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:23,967
the next step will be trying to
analyse what we are doing and

334
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:28,849
trying to focus on the evaluation,
the monitoring of all the strategies

335
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:31,881
and all the pilot groups,
resources and so on.

336
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:51,081
Monitoring and evaluation has always
been one of the pending issues in

337
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:54,109
regional innovation policy in
the Basque Country.

338
00:23:54,714 --> 00:23:58,802
This is one of the weaknesses that
have been highlighted by the

339
00:23:58,827 --> 00:24:01,827
peer reviews that have been
conducted in the last year

340
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,594
for some probably by the OECD in 2011

341
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:09,134
and by the experienced Smart
Specialisation strategy,

342
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:12,128
Kevin Morgan in 2013.

343
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:17,637
Kevin Morgan even highlighted that
the government didn't invest much

344
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:19,750
in monitoring and evaluation.

345
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:23,354
However, I have to say, that
there has always been an

346
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,517
evaluation exercise put in
place in the Basque Country.

347
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:33,075
Since then, monitoring and
evaluation has improved quite a lot

348
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:36,426
and what is regarded as Smart
Specialisation strategies,

349
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:42,599
a more holistic framework has been
designed around what is the

350
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:48,099
STI plan 2020 which is an explicit
document that reflects the

351
00:24:48,142 --> 00:24:50,842
Smart Specialisation strategy in
the Basque Country.

352
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:55,416
Innobasque, which is the real
innovation agency here is in

353
00:24:55,441 --> 00:24:59,966
charge of putting in place this
monitoring and evaluation system

354
00:25:00,226 --> 00:25:04,051
and the system has been
built around 3 main axes.

355
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:09,402
The first point is about monitoring
the strategic objectives of the

356
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:12,261
strategy which is mainly conducted

357
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:19,039
by a set of indicators or a
scoreboard and is done every year.

358
00:25:19,746 --> 00:25:27,033
The second axes is about monitoring
and evaluating the contribution of

359
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,774
the Basque Science, Technology
and Innovation network which

360
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,844
are the main scientific and
technology actors within

361
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:40,431
the Basque system and innovation
policy instruments to this strategy.

362
00:25:40,693 --> 00:25:45,655
How do we measure or how do
we evaluate this contribution

363
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:53,660
is a very, very complex issue and
it has been taken separately.

364
00:25:53,722 --> 00:25:57,697
First of all with regards to the
Basque STI Network,

365
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:03,189
only has been a process in which
it is has been set a scoreboard for

366
00:26:03,334 --> 00:26:07,684
every specific type of actor
according to their mission

367
00:26:07,884 --> 00:26:12,196
and they are going to be monitoring
and evaluating according to that

368
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:15,976
scoreboard that also sets goals.

369
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:21,651
With regards to instruments, it has
also been put in place a process

370
00:26:21,676 --> 00:26:25,938
for gathering data about the
impacts of specific industries,

371
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:30,914
especially on firms and also
on other (INAUDIBLE) sectors

372
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:37,349
and finally, the third line
of action is about how to

373
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:41,460
monitor and evaluate the whole
system and it's based on a

374
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:43,959
comparative assessment of the system.

375
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:50,414
This assessment is built by
different exercises and for

376
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:55,405
example like I mentioned that one of
the exercises that is put in place

377
00:26:55,428 --> 00:27:01,378
is for example about evaluating or
calculating the impact of innovation

378
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:04,944
expenditure on the
Basque productivity.

379
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:09,935
But another very different exercise
with a different methodology is also

380
00:27:10,012 --> 00:27:13,450
been implemented and tries to
measure the perception of the

381
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:16,956
Basque actors about the
real innovation system.

382
00:27:18,376 --> 00:27:23,476
Finally and with regards to the
thematic priorities, it has also

383
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:29,952
been a process of design of a
tailored monitoring system

384
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:34,552
for each of the priorities and
currently for some poll there

385
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:38,240
has been conversations about how
to monitor their activity and the

386
00:27:38,272 --> 00:27:43,122
projects that are coming out from
each of the priorities for example

387
00:27:43,443 --> 00:27:46,130
for the advanced
manufacturing priority.

388
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:53,796
Finally, I think it's also important
to highlight that despite all the

389
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:58,796
advancements, there are some
pending issues in the Basque region

390
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,796
for monitoring and evaluation.

391
00:28:00,938 --> 00:28:05,188
First of all, it's important to
raise the awareness for

392
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,688
monitoring and evaluation
amongst all the actors

393
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:14,155
and this also implies moving from
an accountability approach to a

394
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:19,831
more learning approach of the
evaluation and try to embetter all

395
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:23,895
the resource of these
evaluation exercises into

396
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,598
the policy making process.

397
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,167
In addition, I think one of the key
challenges here is moving on

398
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:34,754
also from individual instrument
evaluation to a policy mix

399
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,012
approach in which we can evaluate
the interactions on complementary

400
00:28:39,087 --> 00:28:41,499
between different or amongst
different instruments.

401
00:28:42,032 --> 00:28:47,719
And finally, I think we should also
move from a traditional governance

402
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:54,676
of the evaluation process
towards a more innovative one

403
00:28:54,994 --> 00:29:00,319
and that means also a (INAUDIBLE)
of the entrepreneurial

404
00:29:00,353 --> 00:29:02,603
process into the evaluation.

405
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:05,992
That means sharing the evaluation,
or sharing the ownership of the

406
00:29:06,057 --> 00:29:10,245
evaluation with all the actors that
participates in this entrepreneurial

407
00:29:11,056 --> 00:29:12,444
discovery process.
