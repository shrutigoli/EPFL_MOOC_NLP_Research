00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:07,511
Welcome to Week 5

2
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:10,141
of Cellullar Mechanisms
of Brain Function.

3
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:12,528
We've now learned quite a bit

4
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:17,048
about excitatory glutamatergic synapses
in the mammalian brain.

5
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,529
Glutamatergic synapses 
account for about 80% of the synapses

6
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:26,449
and they provide an absolutely 
fundamental role in brain function.

7
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:31,774
Most neurons are electrically silent 
and they need some excitatory drive

8
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:34,114
in order to drive action potential firing

9
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:38,114
and create processing 
and signals across the brain.

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,510
But if there were only 
glutamatergic excitation

11
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,820
in the neuronal networks of the brain,

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,670
then there would be explosive activity

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,500
and all the cells would be
continuously active.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,489
And there's, therefore, 
a need for inhibition

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,998
to balance the excitation.

16
00:00:56,248 --> 00:01:00,049
And it's that inhibition that we're going
to be considering this week.

17
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:03,763
Most of the inhibition 
in the mammalian brain

18
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:08,283
comes about through the neurotransmitter 
gamma-Aminobutyric acid,

19
00:01:08,683 --> 00:01:10,933
known as GABA for short.

20
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:16,354
Most of the neurons in the brain 
are glutamatergic neurons

21
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:18,224
when they fire action potentials.

22
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:20,634
That action potential 
propagates down the axon

23
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:25,004
and from presynaptic specializations,
glutamate is released,

24
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,674
and that glutamate 
has an excitatory effect

25
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:29,714
on the postsynaptic cells.

26
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,254
It tries to increase the amount 
of action potential firing

27
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,204
of the postsynaptic cell.

28
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:38,512
For a GABAergic neuron,

29
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:42,232
the action potential again
propagates down the axon,

30
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,722
but at the presynaptic specialization,

31
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:47,942
the neurotransmitter 
that's released is called GABA

32
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:53,062
and that GABA has an inhibitory influence
upon the postsynaptic neurons.

33
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:55,782
It tries to prevent 
the postsynaptic neuron

34
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,052
from firing action potentials.

35
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:02,157
And in the same way that there are 
many types of excitatory neurons

36
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:05,227
there are also many types
of GABAergic neurons.

37
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:08,757
The synapses that are formed
by these GABAergic neurons

38
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:11,067
can have very high specificity.

39
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:14,847
They can target specific compartments
like distal dendrites,

40
00:02:14,847 --> 00:02:17,317
the axon initial segment, 
the soma,

41
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:21,227
and those synapses are created
at very specific locations

42
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:24,037
and presumably have
very specific functions.

43
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,697
During the course 
of the videos of this week,

44
00:02:27,697 --> 00:02:31,347
we'll consider some of the specificity
and general features

45
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,877
of GABAergic synaptic transmission.

46
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:37,807
Let's consider how 
a GABAergic synapse

47
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:39,627
is put together.

48
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:44,864
We have the axon 
and presynaptic boutons,

49
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,774
that contain synaptic vesicles,

50
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:50,744
just like before 
for the glutamatergic vesicles.

51
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,680
But the synaptic vesicles 
now need to be packaged

52
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,659
with a different neurotransmitter.

53
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,939
Before we were putting glutamate inside
these synaptic vesicles

54
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:05,299
and now we need to put
the neurotransmitter GABA

55
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,809
inside these vesicles.

56
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,857
Interestingly, the neurotransmitter GABA

57
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:14,267
is synthesized in a single enzymatic step 
from glutamate

58
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:18,367
so the main excitatory 
neurotransmitter Glutamate,

59
00:03:18,537 --> 00:03:23,367
also an amino acid and 
present in the cytosol of all cells,

60
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:28,880
is treated by a specific enzyme
Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase,

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,990
or GAD for short, and that removes 
this CO2 group from Glutamate

62
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,010
and creates the neurotransmitter GABA.

63
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:42,987
This enzyme GAD is present in the cytosol

64
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:46,017
even of the presynaptic boutons

65
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:50,547
and so GABA is produced 
right at the place where it's needed

66
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:54,547
and even some of the GAD enzyme
seems to be present

67
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:57,687
directly on the synaptic 
vesicle membrane.

68
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:03,087
So, there's a local production
of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA

69
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:04,897
right where we need it.

70
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:10,067
That GABA is then packaged 
into synaptic vesicles

71
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:12,887
through a protein, 
the vesicular GABA transporter

72
00:04:12,887 --> 00:04:16,897
or VGAT that's present on the
synaptic vesicle membrane

73
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:20,567
it utilizes a proton,
an electrical gradient,

74
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:24,888
across the synaptic vesicle membrane
and from that energy

75
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:28,638
it sucks GABA inside the synaptic vesicle

76
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,788
and concentrates it 
to a concentration

77
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:33,808
of, probably, 
around 100 millimolar.

78
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,377
The action potential then can 
invade the nerve terminal,

79
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:44,037
just as in a glutamatergic synapse,
that drives calcium influx

80
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,980
and we have the standard exocytotic
release machinery that then drives

81
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,180
vesicle fusion and release of the GABA
into the synaptic cleft.

82
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,669
Then it diffuses some nanometers
and binds to specific receptors

83
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,219
that are present in the 
postsynaptic specialization.

84
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:07,323
Similar to the way that we had
ligand-gated ion channels

85
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:09,593
for glutamatergic synapses,

86
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:13,809
the fast inhibition that occurs
at GABAergic synapses

87
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:18,909
is also mediated directly by
ligand-gated ion channels.

88
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:23,269
So there are GABA binding ion channels

89
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,519
and the GABA acts directly on that protein

90
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,809
increases the open probability

91
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:33,359
and for a GABA receptor 
that causes an outward current.

92
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:36,483
So, the electrical current flow 
is outwards,

93
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:41,623
and that causes negative charge 
inside the postsynaptic cell,

94
00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:44,023
and that then is hyperpolarizing,

95
00:05:44,023 --> 00:05:49,383
it's a outward postsynaptic current 
that inhibits the postsynaptic neuron.

96
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,893
That's how inhibition works.

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,510
Let's look in a bit more detail 
to the ionic conductance

98
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,740
that's mediated by GABA binding 
to its ligand-gated ion channel.

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,460
The GABA-A receptor, 
as it's called,

100
00:06:07,997 --> 00:06:14,047
is the site where GABA released directly
from the presynaptic specialization,

101
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:18,922
binds to the protein, 
increases the open probability

102
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:23,052
and the GABA-A receptor
is permeable to anions,

103
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:27,546
and in particular, 
chloride is its major permeability.

104
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:30,526
So GABA opens a chloride conductance

105
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:34,066
which is formed by the GABA-A receptor.

106
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,066
This, of course, is a fast action of GABA,

107
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:40,976
it's a direct action 
on a ligand-gated ion channel,

108
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:44,816
so those conductances open
with millisecond timing

109
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:49,156
and mediates fast inhibition
in the mammalian nervous system.

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,950
Why is a chloride conductance inhibitory?

111
00:06:54,997 --> 00:07:01,037
We know that the chloride concentrations
are distributed in an uneven way

112
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,897
across the plasma membrane.

113
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:07,547
Intracellularly, we have 
around 5 millimolar of chloride

114
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:12,557
and extracellularly we have 
around 120 millimolar of chloride.

115
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:17,170
So, there's a strong gradient 
that wants to put chloride into cells

116
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,430
if you open a chloride 
selective conductance.

117
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:26,222
We can look at the Nernst equation
and drive quantitatively

118
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,992
what the reversal potential
for chloride is.

119
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:33,272
We take our equilibrium 
potential equation,

120
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:37,142
we put in our numbers for 5 millimolar
intracellular chloride,

121
00:07:37,142 --> 00:07:40,272
120 millimolar extracellular chloride,

122
00:07:40,272 --> 00:07:45,532
we multiply by 61.5 times the log 10,

123
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,536
the base 10 logarithm 
of these numbers,

124
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:53,706
and that gives us a chloride 
reversal potential of -85 millivolts.

125
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,807
That means that, if GABA acts 
to open the GABA receptor

126
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:03,127
and it's a chloride channel that tries
to bring the membrane potential

127
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:07,187
of the postsynaptic cell
to -85 millivolts.

128
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:09,732
That's hyperpolarized,

129
00:08:09,732 --> 00:08:13,212
compared to the normal resting 
membrane potential of neurons

130
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:15,642
and it's certainly hyperpolarized

131
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:18,092
compared to the action 
potential threshold

132
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:21,022
that sits at around -45 millivolts.

133
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:24,552
So, chloride conductances are inhibitory

134
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:28,302
because the reversal potential 
for chloride is extremely negative

135
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:31,332
and well below action potential threshold

136
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:36,632
So, GABA prevents action potential firing
of the postsynaptic cell.

137
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:40,488
The reason it does that 
is because of the chloride concentrations,

138
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:45,348
the way they're distributed comparing
the inside and the outside of cells.

139
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:50,702
A key question that determines 
the inhibitory properties

140
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:55,682
of the GABA neurotransmitter, 
is the chloride concentrations.

141
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:59,296
So, this is of course very interesting 
to find out how chloride

142
00:08:59,296 --> 00:09:02,906
is distributed and controlled in neurons.

143
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:07,786
One reason that we have 
low cytosolic chloride concentrations

144
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:11,156
is because there are leak 
chloride channels

145
00:09:11,156 --> 00:09:13,466
that are present on all cell membranes.

146
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:16,746
So, there's a permanent
chloride conductance

147
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:19,736
that's open on cell membranes.

148
00:09:19,736 --> 00:09:22,996
And simply by the fact 
that the resting membrane potential

149
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,736
is sitting at around -70 millivolts,

150
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:28,956
that will then contribute
to distributing chloride

151
00:09:28,956 --> 00:09:32,956
at around the equilibrium 
potential of -70 millivolts.

152
00:09:32,956 --> 00:09:37,826
So, having negative potentials 
drives chloride out of cells

153
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:41,526
and gives us negative reversal potentials.

154
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,535
But the actual reversal potential for GABA

155
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:47,655
is more negative than 
the resting membrane potential

156
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,885
of most neurons.

157
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:53,365
So, we also need an active process 
that keeps chloride concentration low.

158
00:09:54,465 --> 00:09:58,135
If we now look at the soma of a cell,

159
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:01,248
sitting on its plasma membrane

160
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:03,648
are specific transport proteins,

161
00:10:03,648 --> 00:10:07,898
these are 12 transmembrane proteins,

162
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,528
so they have multiple regions 
across the plasma membrane

163
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,910
and these are transporters,

164
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,660
so they have multiple binding sites
and a slow transport rate

165
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,240
but they take chloride out of the cell.

166
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,770
So, that's how chloride
concentrations are low.

167
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,773
This is the so-called transporter, 
called KCC2,

168
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:31,736
that's neuron-specific 
so it's only expressed in neurons

169
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,260
and it drives
low chloride concentrations

170
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,900
in neurons in particular.

171
00:10:36,155 --> 00:10:40,305
The chloride is, in fact, 
cotransported by potassium

172
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,305
so there's a one to one stoichiometry
of potassium and chloride

173
00:10:44,305 --> 00:10:48,145
that transport together
through the KCC2 protein

174
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:52,305
and it's that potassium 
that drives the extrusion of chloride.

175
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:56,485
We'll remember that there's a high 
concentration of potassium inside cells,

176
00:10:56,485 --> 00:10:58,715
a low concentration of potassium outside,

177
00:10:58,715 --> 00:11:01,855
so there's a strong gradient 
for potassium to leave

178
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:07,795
and that's what provides the energy 
to suck the chloride out of neurons

179
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:12,555
and keep chloride concentrations low 
inside the cytosol of neurons.

180
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,785
And it's that low chloride 
concentration inside neurons

181
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,005
that's absolutely critical for making

182
00:11:18,005 --> 00:11:20,995
that hyperpolarized reversal 
potential of GABA

183
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:24,525
that makes GABA 
an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

184
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:30,255
Interestingly, it turns out that GABA
isn't always inhibitory.

185
00:11:30,255 --> 00:11:33,335
In fact, during very early development,

186
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,255
chloride concentrations 
are radically different

187
00:11:36,255 --> 00:11:38,545
from how they are in the adult brain.

188
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:44,344
At very early postnatal stages 
of rodents

189
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:48,384
that would then correspond 
to early stages

190
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:50,844
of development for human babies

191
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:55,274
that would be still in the gestation 
period for a human baby,

192
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:59,714
but rodents are born 
less developed than humans,

193
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:04,433
so, in the rodent postnatal day 0,

194
00:12:05,443 --> 00:12:10,283
there are high chloride concentrations
inside the cytosol of neurons,

195
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:14,753
the chloride concentration is thought
to be somewhere around

196
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:17,493
30 millimolar intracellularly,

197
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:21,574
and a high concentration 
of chloride intracellularly

198
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,844
where we leave 
extracellular chloride to be---

199
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,934
it's normal around 120 millimolar,

200
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:32,164
means that the reversal potential 
for chloride is quite depolarized

201
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:35,874
compared to the adult condition of -80.

202
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,593
So, here at around birth for a rodent, 
the chloride reversal potential

203
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,083
might be sitting at around -40 millivolts.

204
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:47,173
That means that when GABA is released
and activates a GABA-A receptor

205
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:53,533
chloride actually leaves the cell 
causing depolarization

206
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,313
of the membrane potential.

207
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:58,848
So, if we have a typical neuron 
at rest here

208
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:00,908
at around -65 millivolts

209
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,140
opening of a GABA conductance 
at early postnatal days

210
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,960
causes depolarization 
and might contribute

211
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,760
to exciting the postsynaptic neuron.

212
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:16,883
The reason that chloride concentrations
are high during early development,

213
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:21,213
is that the expression 
of this transport protein, KCC2,

214
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:24,603
is extremely low 
at early stages of development,

215
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:29,043
so the ability to suck chloride out 
of the cell hasn't developed yet.

216
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:31,983
So we end up with high chloride
concentrations that give rise

217
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,983
to depolarized chloride
reversal potentials

218
00:13:34,983 --> 00:13:37,483
and the excitatory action of GABA.

219
00:13:38,103 --> 00:13:43,333
During these first postnatal days, 
the expression of KCC2

220
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,973
ramps up dramatically

221
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:49,073
and that then sucks chloride out 
from the cytosol of the cell,

222
00:13:49,073 --> 00:13:51,513
the chloride concentration goes down,

223
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,453
and now, when we open
the GABA-A conductance,

224
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:57,943
chloride wants to enter the cell
and hyperpolarize it

225
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:01,913
and that's where we get 
the hyperpolarizing action of GABA,

226
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:06,023
that in the mature state, 
brings us to around -80 millivolts

227
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:07,723
as the reversal potential.

228
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:11,530
It's interesting to note 
that chloride concentrations

229
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,690
obviously make a big difference 
to GABA receptor function.

230
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,690
Early in development, GABA seems 
to have an excitatory role

231
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,510
it's really only at very,
very early postnatal stages.

232
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:26,862
Already in the rodent, 
one week after birth,

233
00:14:27,212 --> 00:14:30,052
it's clear that GABA 
has an inhibitory function.

234
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,312
In addition to developmental
changes of chloride,

235
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:37,522
there are also thought to be differences
in chloride concentrations

236
00:14:37,522 --> 00:14:40,199
in different compartments of neurons.

237
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,979
So the KCC2 expression 
turns out to be different

238
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:46,969
in dendritic and axonal membranes.

239
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,489
So it may be, 
that chloride concentrations

240
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,689
might also differ
in different neuronal compartments,

241
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:56,359
and that provides additional complexity
to thinking about how

242
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,709
GABAergic inhibition might work.

243
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:01,844
It's now fun to compare what we know

244
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:05,244
about the glutamatergic 
and the GABAergic synapses.

245
00:15:05,244 --> 00:15:08,234
Because they have a great deal
of interesting similarities

246
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:10,794
and parallels in the way 
that they're set up.

247
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,564
At the glutamatergic synapse,

248
00:15:13,564 --> 00:15:17,154
we obviously want to put glutamate
inside the synaptic vesicles.

249
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:19,654
and that glutamate is packaged

250
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,514
by a specific vesicular 
glutamate transporter

251
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:26,684
that's present here, 
that puts glutamate in the vesicles.

252
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:31,301
In the GABAergic synapse, 
we need one additional step,

253
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:34,561
we need an enzyme 
that makes the GABA

254
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:38,121
and then we have a different protein,
the vesicular GABA transporter

255
00:15:38,121 --> 00:15:41,271
that puts GABA inside 
the synaptic vesicles.

256
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:44,631
Action potentials, 
neurotransmitter release machinery

257
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:47,931
are similar at glutamatergic
and GABAergic synapses

258
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,181
and postsynaptically, of course, 
we have different receptors.

259
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:54,121
But the fast excitatory and the 
fast inhibitory neurotransmission,

260
00:15:56,721 --> 00:15:59,321
both work the ligand-gated ion channels

261
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:03,261
so the neurotransmitter directly
binds to an ion channel,

262
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,961
opens a conductance,

263
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,701
for glutamate it's AMPA and NMDA,

264
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,911
and that has a reversal potential
of around 0 millivolts,

265
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:13,741
so it's excitatory and depolarizing.

266
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:16,471
For GABA we have the GABA-A receptor,

267
00:16:16,471 --> 00:16:21,071
it's a chloride conductance and that 
tries to bring us to around -80 millivolts

268
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:23,981
so that's an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

269
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:29,409
These ligand-gated ion channels
are concentrated immediately next

270
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:31,549
to the presynaptic specialization.

271
00:16:32,215 --> 00:16:36,875
The way that they're concentrated there 
is by having binding proteins here

272
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:40,595
that associate tightly 
with the ligand-gated ion channels

273
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:44,565
and hold them tightly in place 
right there in apposition

274
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:46,275
to the presynaptic terminal.

275
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:49,765
The ligand-gated receptors are otherwise

276
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:52,965
present in low concentrations
extrasynaptically

277
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:55,595
where they can diffuse 
in the plasma membrane,

278
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:58,855
but when they encounter one 
of these PSD95 molecules

279
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:02,255
and other molecules 
in the postsynaptic density

280
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,545
they get fixed there, held in place,

281
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:09,165
and that concentrates the ion channels
right next to the release site,

282
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,705
where they need to be.

283
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:13,933
The same situation is true 
for the GABA-A receptors.

284
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,223
They're also present extrasynaptically,

285
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,533
they diffuse around 
on the plasma membrane

286
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:23,983
and they get held in place in aposition
to the presynaptic specialization

287
00:17:23,983 --> 00:17:28,323
also by a scaffolding protein 
that binds to the receptors

288
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:29,613
and that's called Gephyrin.

289
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:34,543
So PSD95 and Gephyrin 
seem to play equivalent functions

290
00:17:34,543 --> 00:17:38,193
at glutamatergic and GABAergic
synapses respectively.

291
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,089
For the glutamatergic synapses

292
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:43,739
we noted that there was
an interesting structural feature

293
00:17:43,739 --> 00:17:49,059
the spine, that tends to be 
where glutamatergic synapses are made.

294
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,239
So these spines can grow 
to specific locations

295
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,709
and the fact that they can grow 
and appear and disappear,

296
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,279
appears to make them 
very suitable for plastic changes

297
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,279
and might be involved in the rewiring
of the brain during learning

298
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,049
and the storage of memories.

299
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:10,952
GABAergic synapses on the other hand
are typically made directly

300
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:16,272
on the dendritic shaft or even directly
on the soma of the cell,

301
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:20,072
body of the neuron 
or on the axon initial segment.

302
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:23,782
So the GABAergic synapses are placed
in slightly different locations

303
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:26,062
to where the glutamatergic synapses are,

304
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:30,792
although there can be GABAergic synapses
present on some spines,

305
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,172
and it may be that 
that provides a specific regulation

306
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:37,602
at the level of individual synapses 
where we might be able to turn

307
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:40,774
on or off the function 
of a glutamatergic synapse

308
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:46,314
by putting a GABAergic synapse right 
here on the spine of a glutamate synapse.

309
00:18:46,314 --> 00:18:50,884
Spines always have a glutamatergic input
and a small fraction of them

310
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,714
also have an inhibitory input,

311
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,294
but most of the GABAergic synapses 
are directly on dendrites

312
00:18:56,294 --> 00:18:58,084
or on the cell body.

313
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:03,520
In addition to the fast action of GABA 
on GABA-A receptors,

314
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,230
and that's a ligand-gated ion channel
that mediates fast GABAergic receptors,

315
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,220
there's also a metabotropic receptor,

316
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,760
a 7-transmembrane receptor that works

317
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,080
via G-proteins that then activate

318
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,050
a potassium conductance.

319
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,890
So this is a slower way of signaling,

320
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:26,780
so we have to imagine now that we have

321
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:30,800
our presynaptic specialization 
that releases GABA

322
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,040
and postsynapticaly, 
immediately in apposition to this,

323
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:40,231
we have our chloride channels 
that bring chloride into the cell

324
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:44,021
when the GABA binds here, 
and that's a fast IPSP,

325
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:48,491
where if we have an action potential 
we get a rapid inhibition

326
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:52,011
through this chloride influx 
into the postsynaptic cell.

327
00:19:52,371 --> 00:19:54,461
The GABA can then diffuse 
some distance,

328
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:57,911
and at some distance 
to the actual synapse,

329
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,181
so at extrasynaptic locations,

330
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:04,911
there are these GABA-B receptors

331
00:20:05,211 --> 00:20:08,801
and these GABA-B receptors 
work via G-proteins

332
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:11,981
and they activate 
a potassium conductance,

333
00:20:11,981 --> 00:20:16,201
a so-called G-protein inward 
rectifying potassium conductance,

334
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,621
a GIRK channel.

335
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:21,711
That can give rise to much slower
postsynaptic potentials

336
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:25,701
that are delayed by perhaps 
50 milliseconds

337
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:28,791
before they become activated 
and they can also last

338
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:32,051
much longer periods of time, 
several hundred milliseconds,

339
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:35,101
and the delay is in part
because the GABA has to diffuse

340
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,851
and also because there are multiple steps
before we can activate

341
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,701
this potassium conductance.

342
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:45,571
So there's a slow inhibitory postsynaptic
potential that's mediated by potassium

343
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:48,951
and there's a fast IPSP 
that's a GABA-A receptor

344
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,981
and that's the chloride conductance.

345
00:20:52,087 --> 00:20:56,987
In addition to this postsynaptic action
on potassium conductances

346
00:20:56,987 --> 00:21:00,997
there's also an action of GABA-B 
on calcium conductances

347
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:05,187
so the GABA-B receptors 
inhibit calcium influx

348
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:08,767
that has effects postsynaptically
on excitability,

349
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:12,767
but perhaps more prominently 
there are also GABA-B receptors

350
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:16,177
present on presynaptic specializations,

351
00:21:16,767 --> 00:21:19,767
on the nerve terminals themselves

352
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:24,887
there are GABA-B receptors 
again acting through G-proteins

353
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:28,167
and here they also act upon
calcium channels,

354
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,347
but now they play 
a very important function

355
00:21:30,347 --> 00:21:33,557
because the calcium channels here
are responsible directly

356
00:21:33,557 --> 00:21:35,277
for neurotransmitter release,

357
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,777
and GABA-B inhibiting the calcium channels

358
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:41,007
then reduces neurotransmitter
release directly

359
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:44,477
and most forms of presynaptic boutons

360
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,867
have GABA-B receptors present on them

361
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:49,987
whether it’s a glutamatergic synapse 
or a GABAergic synapse

362
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:54,227
or any other type of synapse, 
typically GABA-B receptors are present

363
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:58,327
and if you activate GABA-B, 
you inhibit neurotransmitter release

364
00:21:58,327 --> 00:22:02,377
and that's another major way 
in which GABA is inhibitory.

365
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:07,427
It has a presynaptic inhibitory action 
where it reduces neurotransmitter release

366
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,507
through inhibiting calcium channels

367
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:12,597
and in addition 
to the fast GABA-A conductance

368
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,327
there's also a slow GABA-B conductance,

369
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:18,447
this slow potassium-mediated conductance

370
00:22:18,447 --> 00:22:21,507
that gives rise to slow IPSPs.

371
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:26,447
Finally it's worth pointing out 
that although GABA is by far

372
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:29,097
the most important 
inhibitory neurotransmitter

373
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,547
in the main brain,

374
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:33,657
if we go to spinal cord 
or the brainstem,

375
00:22:33,657 --> 00:22:36,217
then GABA has a less prominent role

376
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:41,397
and glycine instead takes over 
as the major inhibitory neurotransmitter.

377
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,340
Glycine works in almost the identical way 
as GABA does at the GABA-A receptor.

378
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,380
So there are glycinergic 
presynaptic specializations,

379
00:22:52,965 --> 00:22:56,595
glycine is packaged 
into neurotransmitter vesicles

380
00:22:56,595 --> 00:23:02,115
and in fact it's the same vesicular GABA
transporter that also packages glycine

381
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:06,079
and postsynaptically 
we have glycine receptors,

382
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,319
that again, are chloride channels
that bring chloride

383
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:14,859
in through the action of glycine acting 
on direct ligand-gated ion channels.

384
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:18,566
So the glycine receptor 
is very similar to the GABA-A receptor

385
00:23:18,566 --> 00:23:23,506
and glycine plays an almost identical role
in the spinal cord and brainstem

386
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,796
as GABA does in the main brain.

387
00:23:26,302 --> 00:23:31,462
So in this video, we've got 
an overview of GABAergic inhibition.

388
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:35,562
GABA is the main inhibitory 
neurotransmitter of the brain.

389
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:38,872
It accounts for about 20% of the synapses

390
00:23:38,872 --> 00:23:41,252
and the other 80% of the synapses

391
00:23:41,252 --> 00:23:45,112
are largely excitatory 
glutamatergic synapses.

392
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:51,477
GABA exerts its inhibitory action 
upon two types of receptors:

393
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:56,108
GABA-A receptors that are present 
in the postsynaptic specialization

394
00:23:56,108 --> 00:24:00,238
they're held in place by gephyrin 
that concentrates GABA-A receptors

395
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:04,598
and GABA acts on these 
GABA-A receptors to open directly

396
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:08,550
a ligand-gated ion channel, 
it's a chloride conductance

397
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,784
and the reversal potential for chloride
makes this inhibitory.

398
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,624
Chloride has a reversal potential
at around -80 millivolts

399
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:20,954
so the action of GABA is to try to bring 
the postsynaptic membrane

400
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:23,167
to around -80 millivolts.

401
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:26,740
That's clearly hyperpolarized
to action potential threshold

402
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,394
so GABA has a fast inhibitory action
through the GABA-A receptor.

403
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:35,881
GABA also acts upon 
metabotropic receptors,

404
00:24:35,881 --> 00:24:37,451
GABA-B receptors,

405
00:24:37,451 --> 00:24:41,781
and there it drives slow 
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials

406
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:45,181
through G-proteins that activate 
potassium channels,

407
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,271
the GIRK ion channels,

408
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,871
and it presynaptically inhibits
neurotransmitter release

409
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:54,521
by inhibiting calcium channels 
that directly are involved

410
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,771
in driving neurotransmitter release.

411
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:00,749
So GABA inhibits 
at multiple levels in the brain

412
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,559
and forms a very important counteraction

413
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,389
to the excitatory mechanisms of the 
glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

414
00:25:08,988 --> 00:25:11,238
Over the next videos of this week,

415
00:25:11,238 --> 00:25:14,768
we'll explore GABAergic inhibition
in more detail.
