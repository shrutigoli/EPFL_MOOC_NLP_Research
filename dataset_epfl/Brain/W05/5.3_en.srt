1
00:00:05,748 --> 00:00:09,906
Neuropharmacology is
a very important field of neuroscience.

2
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:12,626
It forms the basis
of the pharmaceutical industry

3
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:15,195
and our hopes for treating brain diseases.

4
00:00:15,677 --> 00:00:17,938
There are many compounds
that act specifically

5
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:19,864
at different receptors in the brain.

6
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:24,653
So for AMPA receptors
we have CNQX and NBQX

7
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:29,200
for NMDA receptors 
we have APV and MK-801,

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,842
and for the GABA-A receptor
we have antagonists

9
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:34,502
like picrotoxin, bicuculline
and gabazine.

10
00:00:35,593 --> 00:00:38,914
These antagonists have 
highly specific actions

11
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,534
and are extremely useful
in the experimental setting,

12
00:00:41,534 --> 00:00:44,453
but therapeutically, 
they've not proven to be useful.

13
00:00:45,403 --> 00:00:48,366
In this video we're going to look
at benzodiazepines

14
00:00:48,366 --> 00:00:51,756
that have turned out to have
interesting therapeutic potential

15
00:00:51,756 --> 00:00:53,546
and have been extensively used.

16
00:00:54,217 --> 00:00:59,737
Benzodiazepines were first developed
in the '60s, and were marketed as Valium,

17
00:00:59,737 --> 00:01:04,305
also known as diazepam,
and since then many benzodiazepines

18
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:06,660
have been developed 
with higher specificities

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,737
and better therapeutic outcome.

20
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,024
It's interesting to look
at the benzodiazepines,

21
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:17,193
because they have an extremely specific
mechanism of action and a lot

22
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:20,929
is known about how they function
at the molecular level.

23
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:23,268
That's what we'll explore in this video.

24
00:01:24,372 --> 00:01:27,990
Let's begin by taking a closer look
at the GABA(A) receptor.

25
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,712
The GABA(A) receptor is 
a pentameric structure,

26
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:34,725
made out of five different subunits,

27
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:38,408
each of which is an individual protein
that comes together

28
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:43,381
to form the ligand-gated GABA(A) receptor
with the chloride channel down the middle.

29
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:49,071
Each subunit is encoded
by a single protein and there are

30
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:53,065
a number of different genes
that code for those subunits.

31
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,329
They can be divided
into different families.

32
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:02,125
There's an alpha, beta, gamma, 
rho, delta, pi, epsilon, theta —

33
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:05,224
types of GABA(A) receptor genes,

34
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:08,493
and in general
for most GABA(A) receptors,

35
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:14,023
they're composed of two alpha subunits,
two beta subunits and a gamma subunit.

36
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:16,964
The gamma subunit 
can also be one of these rho

37
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:18,688
or other ones in grey.

38
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,766
The GABA binding site 
turns out to be somewhere

39
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:27,064
between the alpha and the beta subunit.

40
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,580
So in fact, there are 
two GABA binding sites

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,503
between each of the alpha 
and beta subunits.

42
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:37,084
The benzodiazepine binding site,
however, is at a different location

43
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:40,624
and sits between the alpha
and the gamma subunits.

44
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:45,784
In fact, you need to have a gamma-2
or a gamma-3 subunit present

45
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:49,804
in the GABA receptor
in order for the benzodiazepines to bind.

46
00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:54,685
In terms of the amino acid structure
of the GABA(A) receptor,

47
00:02:55,245 --> 00:03:01,199
they form a large N-terminal region

48
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,033
where the GABA binding site is encoded

49
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,147
and also there's 
a benzodiazepine binding site.

50
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:12,734
We have four transmembrane alpha helices —

51
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,771
one, two, three and four —

52
00:03:15,771 --> 00:03:20,558
and this one here turns out
to be the pore-forming region

53
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:24,125
which then hosts the chloride ion channel.

54
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:28,170
The GABA and the benzodiazepine
binding sites are sitting here

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,300
on the N-terminal which is
on the outside of the cell.

56
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:37,479
The benzodiazepenes don't in themselves
activate the GABA-A receptors,

57
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,153
so they bind to the GABA-A receptor
but it's at a different site

58
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:44,153
where GABA activates the ion channel.

59
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:48,446
What the benzodiazepines do
is that they increase the affinity

60
00:03:48,446 --> 00:03:51,207
of the GABA-A receptor for GABA.

61
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:55,341
So GABA binds more tightly to it
in the presence of benzodiazepines.

62
00:03:56,527 --> 00:04:01,190
If we think about the electrophysiology,
functionally relevant

63
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,909
in terms of the IPSCs mediated
by synaptic transmissions —

64
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,549
that's inhibitory postsynaptic currents —

65
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,325
then we'll see 
that under control conditions

66
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,129
the IPSC has a certain amplitude
and a certain duration.

67
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:20,031
If you then apply benzodiazepine,
that then doesn't change the amplitude

68
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:24,235
of the IPSC, but it prolongs
the duration of the IPSC.

69
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:28,115
So there's a total charge transfer
that's mediated in the presence

70
00:04:28,115 --> 00:04:29,954
of benzodiazepines that's larger,

71
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:32,644
and so it potentiates the GABA-A currents

72
00:04:32,644 --> 00:04:35,476
and potentiates 
the inhibition in the brain.

73
00:04:35,944 --> 00:04:38,763
So benzodiazepines have 
an interesting action.

74
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:43,395
They don't in themselves cause inhibition,
but they only potentiate

75
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:47,400
the effect of GABA
when it's normally released in the brain.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,315
So they only act
when they GABA's been released

77
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:53,297
at the right time
and the right place in the brain.

78
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:57,275
So it's a highly specific potentiation
of GABAergic inhibition

79
00:04:57,275 --> 00:04:59,191
that the benzodiazepines mediate.

80
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:05,897
There's further specificity
as to which type of GABA-A receptors

81
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:07,903
the benzodiazepines act upon.

82
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,806
It turns out that GABA-A receptors
need to contain

83
00:05:11,806 --> 00:05:15,471
alpha-1, -2, -3, or alpha-5 subunits

84
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,823
and if instead they have
an alpha-4 or alpha-6 subunit,

85
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,403
then the benzodiazepines
don't have any effect.

86
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:26,426
Now as the molecular biologist
were beginning to clone and sequence

87
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,135
the different GABA receptor
alpha subunits,

88
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:33,336
they found that there was in general
very high homology,

89
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:37,169
so that the amino acid sequences
of the different alpha subunits

90
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:41,257
were very similar, but there were 
of course also many differences.

91
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:46,652
Here in one particular sequence,
alignment of the different subunits,

92
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:51,708
we see that the four 
that bind benzodiazepines

93
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,844
have a histidine at this position —

94
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:59,154
101 for the alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits,

95
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:03,208
so these are the numbers 
counting from the N-terminal,

96
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,956
the amino acids, so we have
the different amino acids here,

97
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:09,504
and at position 101
in both alpha-1 and alpha-2

98
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:10,713
we have a histidine.

99
00:06:11,445 --> 00:06:15,067
Alpha-4 and alpha-6
in this equivalent position

100
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,601
have an arginine that's present.

101
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:21,733
So there's a difference
in the amino acid structure

102
00:06:21,733 --> 00:06:26,486
of the receptors that bind benzodiazepines
and the ones that don't.

103
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,843
There are of course other differences
in the amino acid sequences

104
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:33,913
of the GABA-A receptors,
but you can at least test

105
00:06:33,913 --> 00:06:37,524
to see whether this makes the difference
for benzodiazepine binding.

106
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:42,036
So we can take the alpha-1
or the alpha-2 subunits

107
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,555
and change this histidine to an arginine

108
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:48,361
and now see: Does that make a difference
to the benzodiazepine effect?

109
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,530
The molecular biologists
have figured out

110
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,073
how to make changes
to the amino acid sequence

111
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:58,620
of GABA-A receptors
and they've also figured out

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,993
how to express them
in heterologous systems

113
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:05,544
and so here we're expressing
wild type GABA, alpha-1 subunit

114
00:07:05,544 --> 00:07:07,549
together with a beta and a gamma subunit,

115
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:10,808
express them, apply GABA, and we see

116
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:13,875
a nice GABA-mediated chloride current.

117
00:07:14,607 --> 00:07:19,597
In the presence of diazepam —
that's the benzodiazepine valium —

118
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:23,587
we apply that at one micromolar
and now when GABA is applied

119
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:26,259
the GABA-mediated currents 
are much larger.

120
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,190
That's the potentiating effect
of benzodiazepines upon the GABA-A receptor.

121
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:36,449
Now, in the mutants
where we take the histidine

122
00:07:36,449 --> 00:07:39,197
at position 101 and change it
to an arginine —

123
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:43,149
that's what's typically present
in the alpha-4 and alpha-6 subunits —

124
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,109
these are the ones
that are insensitive to diazepam —

125
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:50,654
now we change just this
one amino acid in the alpha-1 subunit

126
00:07:50,654 --> 00:07:55,819
and now when you apply diazepam
there's no potentiation

127
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:57,490
of the GABAergic currents.

128
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,849
It's the same in the presence
of diazepam as it is without diazepam

129
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:05,166
when this point mutation
has been carried out.

130
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:09,606
So it turns out that this histidine
in position 101 is essential

131
00:08:09,606 --> 00:08:13,171
for the diazepam,
in order to mediate its effect

132
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,162
at potentiating the GABA-A receptor.

133
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:20,031
Interestingly, this point mutation
makes no difference

134
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:24,268
to the currents evoked by GABA
in the absence of diazepam.

135
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:29,840
So in many respects,
this point-mutated GABA alpha-1 receptor

136
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,826
is identical to the wild type,

137
00:08:31,826 --> 00:08:36,222
except in the presence
of the exogenous agent diazepam

138
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:38,823
or other benzodiazepines.

139
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:43,556
This then allows us to do
very interesting genetic testing

140
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:46,836
to see which subunits
mediate which actions

141
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,877
of the benzodiazepines.

142
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:52,686
So in the mouse genome, 
we can also go and make

143
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:56,233
exactly the same mutations
to the GABA-A receptors.

144
00:08:56,233 --> 00:09:00,599
We can change — in the alpha-1 
or the alpha-2 subunits —

145
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:03,866
we can take that histidine at position 101

146
00:09:03,866 --> 00:09:07,711
and change it to an arginine
and then we'll make GABA receptors

147
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,958
for these specific subunits
that are insensitive to diazepam.

148
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,900
What's good about doing this
at the genome level in mice

149
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,999
is that we can then see:
What are the behavioral effects

150
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:21,288
of applying the drug —
the benzodiazepine —

151
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:24,175
to an animal, in terms
of the behavioral change

152
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,932
that diazepam makes.

153
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:30,167
We're interested in two different effects
of the benzodiazepines.

154
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,952
One is the sedative action,
and that's what we'll look at first.

155
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:39,607
If you take a wild type mouse
and you put it inside an arena,

156
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:43,334
you can then track the position
of that mouse as it runs around.

157
00:09:43,942 --> 00:09:45,144
You can see where it goes

158
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:47,873
and you can quantify
the distance that it moves.

159
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:52,493
If you then give that same mouse
some diazepam

160
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:56,572
at a relatively high concentration —
30 mg/kg — that has

161
00:09:56,572 --> 00:09:58,421
a sedative action on the mouse.

162
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:01,780
The mouse might go to sleep,
or it will just relax

163
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,689
and do nothing, perhaps staying
in this corner of the cage.

164
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:11,960
If you now take a different mouse
where you've made the genetic mutation

165
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,035
so that the alpha-1 subunit
is no longer sensitive to diazepam,

166
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:20,893
then the basal condition,

167
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:25,389
where there's no benzodiazepines present,
the animal is just like wild type,

168
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,331
the GABA alpha-1 subunit behaves

169
00:10:28,331 --> 00:10:31,143
just like the normal alpha-1 subunit

170
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,757
in the absence of diazepam,
and so the mouse runs around,

171
00:10:34,757 --> 00:10:36,031
explores its environment.

172
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:40,748
You give it the large dose of diazepam
and in the point-mutant mouse

173
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,893
for the alpha-1 subunit, it has no effect.

174
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,586
The sedative effect of diazepam is gone.

175
00:10:46,586 --> 00:10:51,437
So apparently, sedation
is mediated by the alpha-1 subunit

176
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:52,908
of the GABA-A receptor.

177
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:58,237
You can test the specificity
for it acting on the alpha-1 subunit

178
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:01,614
by doing the same mutation
in the alpha-2 subunit.

179
00:11:01,614 --> 00:11:03,710
So now we take a point-mutant mouse,

180
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,355
it has the histidine replaced
by an arginine in position 101

181
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:12,937
for the alpha-2 GABA-A receptor,
we give the diazepam,

182
00:11:12,937 --> 00:11:15,204
and the sedative action still works.

183
00:11:15,204 --> 00:11:18,557
So sedation doesn't work
via the alpha-2 subunit,

184
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:22,217
but it's specifically mediated
by the alpha-1 subunit

185
00:11:22,217 --> 00:11:25,884
of the GABA-A receptor —
a remarkable specificity.

186
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:30,486
The other interesting action
of the benzodiazepines

187
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:34,284
is anxiolysis, a reduction in anxiety.

188
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:40,703
This we can also monitor in mice
by thinking about their overall behavior

189
00:11:40,703 --> 00:11:43,147
and what they're afraid of.

190
00:11:43,147 --> 00:11:47,201
Mice are worried
about large, open, light spaces.

191
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:51,018
They're nocturnal animals and they 
prefer to move around in the dark.

192
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:54,839
So experimentally in the lab,
we can design behavioral arenas

193
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,802
that have a dark area
and a light area.

194
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,150
If you put the mouse in this arena,

195
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,748
it will tend to run around
in the dark area.

196
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:06,630
Every now and then,
it might poke into the light area,

197
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:11,896
but it's afraid, it's anxious, and it 
will rapidly return to the dark area.

198
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:17,432
If you give these mice a small dose
of diazepam, then they'll relax,

199
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:21,034
and their fears will be reduced;
they're less anxious.

200
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,982
They'll then go and explore
the light area

201
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:27,893
to a much greater extent
than under the control conditions.

202
00:12:27,893 --> 00:12:30,463
That's the anxiolytic effect of diazepam,

203
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:35,842
here occurring at much lower doses
than the high concentrations for sedation.

204
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:40,130
We can then do the same 
two point mutations as before

205
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,562
and study the effects of diazepam.

206
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:46,302
In the alpha-1 point mutation,
the diazepam still works.

207
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:50,005
It has the anxiolytic effect,
and the mouse will explore the light area.

208
00:12:50,514 --> 00:12:52,355
But in the alpha-2 point mutation

209
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:56,123
the diazepam fails
to have the anxiolytic effect.

210
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:02,602
The point mutation here means
that the diazepam can't act

211
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:05,315
upon the alpha-2 subunit
and the fact that there's then

212
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:11,315
no anxiolytic relief from diazepam
means that anxiolysis

213
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:14,439
is being mediated by the alpha-2 receptor,

214
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:16,236
at least in mice.

215
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:21,326
So we've seen that benzodiazepines
act in a highly specific way

216
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,597
upon some some subtypes
of GABA-A receptors.

217
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:28,669
It turns out that the sedative action
of benzodiazepines

218
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:33,159
is mediated by the alpha-1 receptor
and the anxiolytic effect

219
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:37,271
of benzodiazepines is activated
via the alpha-2 receptor.

220
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,506
That, of course, is an analysis
that's been done in mice,

221
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:46,386
and it's unclear to what extent that 
will carry over into the human situation,

222
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:49,430
but it has of course inspired
the pharmaceutical industry

223
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,664
to go and make agents
that are specifically acting

224
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:56,658
at alpha-1 and alpha-2 subunits,
and of course, it's probably also

225
00:13:56,658 --> 00:14:00,619
interesting to explore the other subunits
of the GABA receptors that may have

226
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:02,161
different therapeutic actions.
