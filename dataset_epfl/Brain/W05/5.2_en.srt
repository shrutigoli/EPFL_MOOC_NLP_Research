1
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:10,656
In the last video, we saw that GABA
is a main inhibiting neurotransmitter

2
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:12,685
of the mammalian brain.

3
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,992
GABA acts via two distinct mechanisms.

4
00:00:15,992 --> 00:00:20,232
At the synapse. GABA
activates GABA-A receptors,

5
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:23,669
ligand gated ion channels
permeable to choride,

6
00:00:23,669 --> 00:00:26,849
and here it drives a hyperpolarization.

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,391
GABA also acts extra-synaptically
upon GABA-B receptors.

8
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:39,463
Here the GABA-B receptor
is a seven transmembrane protein.

9
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:43,769
It's metabotropic, it activates G proteins,

10
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:47,307
and downstream of that it activates
a Potassium conductance,

11
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,809
also causing hyperpolarization.

12
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:54,754
There are two distinct mechanisms
for GABA inhibition,

13
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:57,587
and in this video
we're going to take a closer look

14
00:00:57,587 --> 00:01:00,926
at the GABA-A mediated inhibition.

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,576
The GABA-A conductance
is a chloride conductance.

16
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,882
Chloride reverses at around -18 mV,

17
00:01:09,882 --> 00:01:13,835
so typically, when a pre-synaptic
GABAergic neuron

18
00:01:13,835 --> 00:01:17,330
fires an action potential,
it propagates down its axon,

19
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,506
releases GABA,
it acts upon GABA-A receptors

20
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:24,778
and causes a hyperpolarization
in the post-synaptic neuron.

21
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:31,312
That's the fast hyperpolarizing action
of the GABA-A receptor.

22
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:34,898
In this lesson we're going
to look in more detail

23
00:01:34,898 --> 00:01:39,047
at the fast inhibition
mediated by GABA-A conductances

24
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,602
and see a little bit more about
the specific details of how it works.

25
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:47,845
The GABA-A receptor is a chloride channel.

26
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,444
GABA binding to the GABA receptor

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:54,006
increases the open probability
of the receptor,

28
00:01:54,006 --> 00:02:02,416
so in the absence of GABA,
if we are recording with an electrode

29
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:07,513
looking at the single channel,
then the openings and closings

30
00:02:07,513 --> 00:02:10,752
of this receptor, it'll be closed.

31
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:16,988
If then you add GABA
to the recording pipette,

32
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:19,391
you'll see that the open probability

33
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:24,049
increases and we have
single channel currents

34
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:29,566
that come with a conductance
of something like 10 to 30 pS.

35
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:35,168
So GABA increases the open probability
of the GABA-A receptor.

36
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,496
It's of course also interesting to note

37
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:41,189
what the time course of activation
of the GABA currents are,

38
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:45,808
and in particular, when we're thinking
of synaptic release of GABA,

39
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:48,834
we're thinking about brief pulses of GABA

40
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,769
that may well reach
1 millimolar concentrations.

41
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:57,997
So, in the same way that we thought
about analyzing the AMPA receptors,

42
00:02:57,997 --> 00:03:04,364
we can also record the currents
evoked by brief GABA applications

43
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,516
onto patches of membrane
containing the GABA receptor.

44
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:11,834
And so, we can have
a laminar flow electrode

45
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:18,150
which has either no GABA
or contains maybe one millimolar GABA.

46
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,049
We mount this onto a piezo device

47
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:26,207
and we can then give brief one millisecond
pulses of GABA to our patch of membrane

48
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,137
containing GABA-A receptors.

49
00:03:28,137 --> 00:03:31,631
We can then measure the resulting
current under voltage climb,

50
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,587
so we keep the membrane potential clamped,

51
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:38,445
and so we measure the current
flowing through the GABA receptor.

52
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,010
Here you can see
a typical recording like this.

53
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:45,988
One millisecond pulse of GABA
almost immediately activates

54
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:52,191
the GABA conductance.
Increased open probability chloride flux,

55
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:56,401
and we get an outward current.
The GABA disappears.

56
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:00,154
It's only a one millisecond pulse,
but the current remains on

57
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:02,790
for some ten to 20 milliseconds.

58
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:06,189
That's the duration
of the GABAergic conductance

59
00:04:06,189 --> 00:04:10,280
that's mediated by a single
one millisecond pulse of GABA.

60
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:15,584
So it's a fast conductance
that's mediated by the GABA-A receptor,

61
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:19,505
but it's interesting to note
that this is still much slower

62
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:23,712
than the AMPA currents
that are mediated by glutamate

63
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:27,859
at glutamatergic synapses,
so if you do the equivalent experiment

64
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:30,770
and last week this is what we looked at,

65
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,122
one millisecond pulse of glutamate

66
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:39,614
activate an AMPA conductance
and that lasts maybe only two ms.

67
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:44,139
The GABAergic conductance here
is five to ten times lower

68
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:48,863
than the AMPA conductance
of the glutamatergic synapses.

69
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,419
So GABAergic inhibition is fast,

70
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:54,783
but it's much slower
than the AMPA mediated excitation.

71
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,198
Let's see how those conductances, then,

72
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,503
are reflected in post-synaptic
membrane potential changes.

73
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:08,472
So the GABA currents
are chloride currents.

74
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:11,298
They therefore reverse
at the chloride reversal potential,

75
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:13,527
something like -75 mV.

76
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:16,408
The GABA conductance is basically linear,

77
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:19,363
so we can draw a linear
current-voltage relationship

78
00:05:19,363 --> 00:05:22,358
so this is a current
evoked by a GABA pulse

79
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,888
and this is a membrane potential
of which that current is being recorded.

80
00:05:26,716 --> 00:05:31,255
The equivalent AMPA current
would look something like this,

81
00:05:31,255 --> 00:05:36,261
wherein a pulse of glutamate
will cause a current

82
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,813
and here it reverses close to zero mV.

83
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:41,989
For GABA, it reverses close to -75 mV

84
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:45,495
and the interesting range
of membrane potentials, physiologically,

85
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:49,246
is something around -75 to -40 mV.

86
00:05:49,246 --> 00:05:52,261
That's where the membrane potential
of a neuron typically is.

87
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,773
Here we have
an outward current for GABA

88
00:05:54,773 --> 00:05:57,171
and we have inward currents for AMPA

89
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:59,164
so inhibition and excitation.

90
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,114
If you now think
about the synaptic situation,

91
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:11,690
we might imagine having a tight small cell
that we can consider as iso-potential.

92
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:15,519
We have a GABAergic synapse
that's made here.

93
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:20,015
An action potential invades,
releases GABA,

94
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:22,289
and activates the GABA-A currents

95
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,209
and we then measure here
in the Voltage clamp mode

96
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,101
we measure the current
flowing through the GABA receptor.

97
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,934
The action potential
causes release of GABA

98
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:37,047
and we can then see
the synaptic conductances

99
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,723
here at different membrane potentials.

100
00:06:39,723 --> 00:06:44,400
At -100 mV we have an inward current.

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,555
At -75 mV no current flow,

102
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,926
and at positive potentials to the red,

103
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:53,561
to the reversal potential there of -50 mV

104
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:55,497
we have an outward current,

105
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:59,358
and it's linear and symmetrical
around the reversal potential

106
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,349
with the time course of around ten ms

107
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:04,761
just as we saw for the isolated receptor

108
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:07,511
with a one ms pulse of GABA.

109
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,508
So that's the synaptic GABA conductance

110
00:07:10,508 --> 00:07:12,632
that tries to bring the membrane potential

111
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:17,828
to around -75 mV
and has a time course of 10-20 ms.

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,485
If we now think about this situation
in current clamp mode,

113
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,928
where we're now measuring
the membrane potential

114
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:28,430
and we let the membrane
potential swing freely

115
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,348
depending upon the conductances
that are activated,

116
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:34,176
we see that there's an inhibitory
post-synaptic potential

117
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:37,059
that has a time course
of a little bit longer

118
00:07:37,059 --> 00:07:40,559
than the GABA conductance,
the GABA currents themselves.

119
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,568
And that's because, of course,
we have the membrane time constants

120
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,392
that we need to discharge the capacitor

121
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:48,541
after we've charged with our currents,

122
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,133
we need to think about this
and additional filtering

123
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,798
because of the capacitance of real cells.

124
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:58,681
Now, in this case,

125
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,938
when we're thinking
about the GABAergic conductance

126
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:06,809
I've indicated that we're adding
100 pA to the current

127
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:09,546
of the cell that we're recording from.

128
00:08:09,716 --> 00:08:14,511
So at resting membrane potentials,
maybe we're sitting close

129
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:18,293
to the reversal potential for chloride
at -75 mV,

130
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:23,052
so as we stimulate an action potential
in the pre-synaptic cell,

131
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:26,582
and the post-synaptic cell is at -75 mV,

132
00:08:26,582 --> 00:08:28,570
we're not going to see a response.

133
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,109
We're here at the reversal potential,
there's no current flow,

134
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,682
and so there's no change
in membrane potential.

135
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,753
We need to depolarize the cell
in order to see the inhibitory

136
00:08:37,753 --> 00:08:39,103
post-synaptic potentials.

137
00:08:39,212 --> 00:08:42,548
We can do that by injecting
100 pA of current,

138
00:08:42,548 --> 00:08:45,608
so here if we inject 100 pA of current

139
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:50,222
we'll charge the membrane
of the post-synaptic cell.

140
00:08:50,222 --> 00:08:53,793
Maybe we depolarize it to -50 mV

141
00:08:53,793 --> 00:08:55,493
and now, when we stimulate

142
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,745
an action potential 
in the pre-synaptic cell,

143
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:02,559
we get the hyperpolarizing
inhibitory post-synaptic potential

144
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,675
that lasts some tenths of milliseconds.

145
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:11,119
Now, it's interesting
to note that even though

146
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:14,743
the membrane potential
of cells is often close

147
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,496
to the chloride reversal potential

148
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:20,438
and therefore you actually don't record
an inhibitory post-synaptic potential

149
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:22,264
when GABA is released,

150
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:25,768
there is nonetheless an impact
upon the integration

151
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:28,100
of the post-synaptic cell
in terms of, say,

152
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,606
how excitatory conductances
are integrated in that neuron.

153
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:36,421
That comes about because there's a change
in the overall membrane resistance.

154
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:40,655
I'll illustrate that
with a simple example here.

155
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:45,701
We can imagine for example
a glutamatergic excitatory conductance

156
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:49,167
coming into the dendrites of a cell.

157
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:52,983
That then causes current flow
into the dendrite

158
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,978
that'll then go towards the soma,

159
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:59,575
so there'll be conductances from glutamate

160
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:04,306
that mediate current chart flow
via the AMPA and NMDA receptors

161
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:09,242
that contribute to changing
the membrane potential of the soma.

162
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:14,415
At the soma we can imagine
that there are GABAergic synapses

163
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:16,600
that are present here,
a chloride conductance

164
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,549
that maybe is reversing
at exactly the same

165
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:23,701
as the membrane potential of that cell.

166
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,852
Nonetheless, activating
this GABA conductance

167
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:29,549
will change the impact of that glutamate.

168
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:31,633
Why is that?

169
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:35,851
Let's think about the electrical
equivalent of the cell soma.

170
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:41,413
We have current coming
into the soma from the dendrites.

171
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,361
That'll contribute
to charging the membrane,

172
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,421
the capacitance of the cell,

173
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,497
and also, of course, some of that current

174
00:10:49,497 --> 00:10:52,711
will flow across the leak conductances

175
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,791
that are present in the plasma membrane.

176
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:57,655
That current, of course, in the end

177
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:00,394
goes out into the extracellular space

178
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:03,891
where there's zero mV potential
by definition.

179
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:07,195
So we have a capacitor of the soma,

180
00:11:07,195 --> 00:11:10,874
and we have resistance of the soma.

181
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:14,527
What we can do
with the GABAergic conducting send

182
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:19,048
is to add on an additional
conducting pathway here

183
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:23,264
so the GABAergic conductor here
can then be added

184
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:27,578
and it changes the total
resistance of the soma.

185
00:11:27,918 --> 00:11:31,291
By changing the so-called
input resistance of the soma,

186
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,499
that then changes
the integrative properties

187
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:38,228
of how currents flowing into that soma
affect membrane potential.

188
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,412
We can think about
the equations that govern

189
00:11:42,412 --> 00:11:44,870
the membrane potential changes here

190
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,536
that we've already dealt with
in our previous weeks of study,

191
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:53,120
so the potential here across the cell

192
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,359
is equal to the current
flow times the resistance,

193
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:01,029
and then we have the time course
for those changes

194
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,037
that are the charging
of the capacitor here

195
00:12:05,037 --> 00:12:10,679
and the membrane time constant is equal
to the resistance times the capacitance.

196
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,739
That's the exponential
charging function here.

197
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,267
So if we have a square current pulse
flowing into the cell soma,

198
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:24,092
that causes a change
of membrane potential,

199
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:27,332
a charging of the capacitor.
You turn the current off

200
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:30,349
and the capacitor discharges,

201
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:31,734
so this is the Current

202
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,550
and this is the Voltage.

203
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,986
Now, let's imagine that we put
the GABAergic inhibition on.

204
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:44,147
The change here is a decrease
in the membrane resistance.

205
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:49,673
We've added more conductance
to the membrane of the soma.

206
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:54,555
It's reversing the same as the resting
membrane potential of the cell,

207
00:12:54,555 --> 00:12:56,841
so we can simply just
think of it as a change

208
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:58,823
in the resistance of the membrane.

209
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:01,723
So we decrease
the resistance of that membrane.

210
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:04,775
That has two impacts,
if we look at this equation here.

211
00:13:04,775 --> 00:13:07,283
The first is that the steady-state voltage

212
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:09,061
is going to become less
because that depends

213
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:11,300
upon the input resistance of the cell,

214
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:14,710
and the other impact
is that the membrane time constant

215
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,981
is going to change,
it's going to decrease,

216
00:13:16,981 --> 00:13:20,224
so we've got a decrease
in the membrane time constant,

217
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:23,986
and if we now look at how
the membrane potential would change,

218
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:27,459
it's faster,

219
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:29,798
so the overall time constant here

220
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:32,465
is faster than it was, but also,

221
00:13:32,465 --> 00:13:35,749
the overall change
in membrane potential is smaller.

222
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,409
So by activating a GABAergic conductance,

223
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:43,606
even if it's at the same
membrane potential

224
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,488
as the actual cell
that we're recording from,

225
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:51,519
and there's no inhibitory
post-synaptic potential per se,

226
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,559
that'll still cause an inhibitiion
of excitatory glutamatergic inputs

227
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:56,802
coming in,

228
00:13:56,802 --> 00:14:00,595
so here we thought about
steady state injections of currents,

229
00:14:00,732 --> 00:14:02,681
but we'll have the same situation

230
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,443
if we think about
glutamatergic inputs coming in,

231
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:08,496
brief currents, where if we have

232
00:14:08,496 --> 00:14:12,969
at resting conditions
an EPSP that looks like this,

233
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:15,408
then we turn on
the GABAergic conductance

234
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:19,780
and the EPSP gets smaller,
and also a bit faster,

235
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,608
because we've changed
the membrane time constant

236
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:25,703
and the input resistance of the cell soma.

237
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:31,673
So shunting inhibition is another
important form of inhibition

238
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:36,726
in addition to the hyperpolarizing inhibition
mediated by charge

239
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:41,660
flowing through the GABA receptor.
Now, GABAergic synapses are made

240
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,254
on a large variety
of subcellular compartments.

241
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:51,942
GABAergic inhibition can occur here
on the distal dendrites,

242
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:56,906
so we have GABAergic input right here
in the distal dendritic operizations,

243
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:59,480
and presumably, a GABAergic input here

244
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,788
will have a large effect upon the nearby

245
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,282
excitatory synapses coming in here,

246
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:10,137
but might not affect GABAergic synapses
occurring on other dendritic branches.

247
00:15:10,137 --> 00:15:12,277
There might be specific inhibition

248
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:15,764
that's localized
to individual dendritic arborizations.

249
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:21,133
So there could be a high degree
of spatial specificity

250
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:24,354
as to where the GABAergic
inhibition might function.

251
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:28,236
There are also GABAergic
inhibitory synapses

252
00:15:28,236 --> 00:15:32,058
all over the basal
and more proximal dendrites,

253
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:35,112
and interestingly, there are also
GABAergic synapses

254
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:37,751
that are directly placed on the soma,

255
00:15:37,751 --> 00:15:39,577
and that's something
that you won't find usually

256
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:44,066
for excited glutamatergic synapses
that are sitting on the dendrites,

257
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,540
but not on the soma,

258
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,785
so GABAergic inhibition is different

259
00:15:47,785 --> 00:15:50,259
and prominent on the cell bodies,

260
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:53,377
where it could affect the input resistance

261
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,946
and the integration
of the synaptic current

262
00:15:55,946 --> 00:15:57,894
flowing in from the dendrites

263
00:15:57,894 --> 00:15:59,701
in this divisive way,

264
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:02,691
by changing the input resistance
of the cell soma.

265
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,701
Interestingly, there are
also GABAergic synapses

266
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:10,878
directly on the axon initial segment.

267
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:13,655
Again, there are no
excitatory synapses in this area,

268
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:16,090
but inhibitory synapses are prominent

269
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:21,877
here at this site, where action potentials
are initiated in most cells.

270
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:26,897
In GABAergic inhibition, then might not
affect dendritic integration at all,

271
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:29,444
but might simply form an editing function

272
00:16:29,444 --> 00:16:33,363
where it decides whether a cell
can output an action potential or not,

273
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:36,125
independent of what synaptic computations

274
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,531
are occurring in the rest of the cell.

275
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,553
Then, finally, in the spinal cord, but not
anywhere else in the mammalian brain,

276
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:47,247
there are also GABA-A
synapses directly here

277
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,357
on the pre-synaptic specializations,

278
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,707
and that only occurs in the spinal cord,

279
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,948
but these synapses at other locations

280
00:16:54,948 --> 00:16:57,332
occur throughout the mammalian brain,

281
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:01,156
and each one probably performs
a slightly different function.

282
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:05,334
So in this video we've seen
that the GABA-A conductance

283
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:10,127
lasts some 10 to 20 ms
and has a reversal potential

284
00:17:10,127 --> 00:17:13,236
somewhere around -75 mV,

285
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:16,356
depending upon
the local chloride concentrations.

286
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:22,861
The GABA-A conductance can mediate
inhibition in two slightly different ways,

287
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:26,300
both of which, of course,
depend upon the chloride conductance

288
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,318
mediated by the ligand gated
GABA-A receptor.

289
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:33,814
The first one is
hyperpolarizing inhibition.

290
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:37,130
This occurs when the membrane potential
is depolarized

291
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:39,904
relative to the chloride
reversal potential,

292
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,318
and that's simply a movement
then of chloride ions

293
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,017
in negative charge inside the cell,

294
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,320
causing a change in membrane potential.

295
00:17:47,923 --> 00:17:51,396
The other sort of inhibition
relies upon a conductance,

296
00:17:51,396 --> 00:17:54,802
on a change
in the input resistance of a cell,

297
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:57,938
so even if the membrane potential
is actually sitting

298
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:02,419
at the same equilibrium
potential as chloride,

299
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,538
there can still be a significant impact
upon the integration

300
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:10,808
of excitatory inputs
that ligend gated a chloride conductance

301
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:13,412
will decrease the input
resistance of the soma

302
00:18:13,412 --> 00:18:16,974
and the excitatory synaptic input
that arrives at the soma

303
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:19,959
then causes a smaller change
in membrane potential

304
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:23,756
if the GABA-A conductance is open.

305
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:28,282
So there are multiple different ways
in which GABA can cause inhibition,

306
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:30,172
and furthermore, it's complicated

307
00:18:30,172 --> 00:18:33,909
by the spatial distribution
of the GABA-A input

308
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:36,284
that'll presumably
have many different effects

309
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:41,259
depending upon where exactly
the GABAergic synapses are activated.

310
00:18:41,682 --> 00:18:45,496
We'll learn more about
the sub-cellular targeting

311
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:48,139
of GABA synapses
in subsequent videos.
