1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:07,683
Last week we considered the importance

2
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:12,716
of glutamatergic excitatory 
long-range projections.

3
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:15,875
We thought a little bit about
how sensory information

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,319
came from the periphery
and reached the neocortex

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,367
where it's believed that
sensory percepts are generated.

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,814
The transmission of information
turned out to depend upon

7
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:27,579
glutamatergic synapses,

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,390
and different brain areas 
were linked together

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,362
by long-range axonal projections.

10
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:35,297
So for example, there was an axon

11
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:38,090
that went from the skin 
to the brainstem

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,083
and would signal touch.

13
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:43,122
And there was another 
set of cells in the retina

14
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:45,741
that send long-range 
axonal projections

15
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,120
that release glutamate 
in the thalamus.

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,070
to signal sensory information.

17
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,602
And so you can imagine an easy scenario

18
00:00:54,602 --> 00:00:58,032
where excitatory volleys 
of action potentials,

19
00:00:58,032 --> 00:01:03,022
and sequential brain areas
become activated, fire action potentials

20
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:07,232
in the downstream neurons,
that then travel down axons

21
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:10,203
and then release glutamate upon
another downstream target.

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:14,084
And that's easy to see 
how sequential steps of excitation

23
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:17,544
are useful for propagating 
sensory information.

24
00:01:17,594 --> 00:01:21,475
It turns out that long-range 
GABAergic projections

25
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:23,228
are equally important in the brain,

26
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:26,344
and that's what we'll study in today's video.

27
00:01:27,184 --> 00:01:29,984
So some parts of the brain 
like the neocortex

28
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:33,014
only have local GABAergic neurons,

29
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:35,486
ones that have a short axon

30
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:38,556
stretching maybe for 
a few hundred microns,

31
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,406
at least, predominantly.

32
00:01:40,406 --> 00:01:45,117
However, other brain regions
that also have GABAergic neurons in them

33
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:49,745
send long-range axonal projections
out of that brain area,

34
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:53,683
and they then inhibit 
other nuclei in the brain,

35
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:56,013
and that's what we'll be studying today,

36
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:59,569
the long-range GABAergic 
projection neurons.

37
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:02,410
We're going to focus on three examples

38
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,309
of GABAergic projection neurons

39
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,723
that are present 
in the mammalian brain.

40
00:02:07,213 --> 00:02:11,288
We'll discuss the neurons
in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus.

41
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:15,430
They provide an interesting 
feedback inhibition to the main thalamus

42
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,313
and presumably are involved
in filtering sensory signals

43
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,974
getting to the cortex.

44
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:25,112
We'll also discuss striatal 
projection neurons,

45
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,032
part of the basal ganglia,
that are thought to be involved

46
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:30,684
in goal-directed motor control.

47
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:34,513
And finally, we'll discuss 
the GABAergic Purkinje cells

48
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:37,156
the sole output of the cerebellum

49
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:41,399
and how that's involved
in sensory motor tuning.

50
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:45,516
We'll begin by thinking about
the reticular nucleus of the thalamus.

51
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:48,615
And we'll consider it in the context
of a sensory system

52
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,392
that we've already discussed.

53
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:53,009
The one that brings tactile information

54
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:56,201
from the whisker hairs 
on the snout of a rodent,

55
00:02:56,201 --> 00:03:00,038
and bring it through to the
somatosensory barrel cortex.

56
00:03:00,488 --> 00:03:03,434
So the signalling pathway 
begins at the periphery,

57
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:07,470
we have whisker hairs
that are embedded inside follicles,

58
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:11,538
movement of one of these whiskers,
activating mechano-gated ion channels

59
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:14,360
causing an action potential
to propagate down

60
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,863
the sensory neurons
of the trigeminal nerve.

61
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:22,898
They release glutamate in the brainstem,
in the principal trigeminal nucleus,

62
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:25,676
some of these neurons
will fire an action potential,

63
00:03:25,676 --> 00:03:29,940
that again, propagates down the axon
and releases glutamate now

64
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,778
in the thalamus.

65
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,996
Some of the thalamic neurons then, 
will sense that glutamate,

66
00:03:34,996 --> 00:03:37,199
depolarize and then in turn,
fire an action potential

67
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,500
that then conveys the sensory information
to the primary somatosensory cortex.

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,610
This is where we have 
this nice organization

69
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,616
of these dark stained structures here
that correspond in a one to one mapping

70
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:53,461
with the layout of the whiskers
on the face of the animal.

71
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:58,250
Now if we zoom in on this area
in a little bit closer detail--

72
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,200
and that's what we see here,

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,650
we see again, the thalamic nucleus here,

74
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,503
the so called ventral posterior 
medial nucleus of the thalamus

75
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:10,325
that sends the axons up here,

76
00:04:10,325 --> 00:04:14,955
and they then, innovate 
individual layers for barrels.

77
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:21,554
On their way, these thalamic neurons 
send off collaterals.

78
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:25,266
So the axon branches here,
in a specific region here,

79
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:30,277
a new area for us 
called the nucleus reticularis.

80
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:34,063
And here, this is full 
of GABAergic neurons

81
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:38,232
and these GABAergic neurons
cause a feedback inhibition

82
00:04:38,232 --> 00:04:39,859
upon the thalamus.

83
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,601
Let's take a closer look 
at how that works.

84
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,578
We imagine the ventral 
posterior nucleus here,

85
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,178
shaded in red.

86
00:04:49,628 --> 00:04:54,855
It contains a highly organized 
somatotopic map of the whiskers

87
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:57,333
so in the same way 
that the neocortex

88
00:04:57,333 --> 00:05:00,565
has a map of the whiskers
that is anatomically identifiable,

89
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:03,490
the ventral posterior medial nucleus 
of the thalamus

90
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,234
also has an anatomically 
identifiable whisker map.

91
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:11,122
And so for example, our C2
whisker representation here,

92
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:14,467
is found in the thalamus 
in the form of a C2 barreloid.

93
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:18,081
So the deflection of the C2 whisker
causes some neurons here

94
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:21,648
in the ventral posterior nucleus
to fire action potentials.

95
00:05:21,648 --> 00:05:26,120
That action potential propagates down
the axon of the thalamocortical neuron

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,205
towards the primary somatosensory cortex.

97
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:32,758
And that's where sensory percepts 
are thought to be generated.

98
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:35,483
On the way, it sends off 
axonal collaterals

99
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:40,617
that also release glutamate, but now,
onto the GABAergic neurons

100
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:43,756
that are present inside 
the nucleus reticularis.

101
00:05:43,756 --> 00:05:48,479
So an NRT neuron here
will receive a glutamatergic input

102
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,181
when a VPM cell fires.

103
00:05:51,931 --> 00:05:56,206
If sufficient amount of excitation
comes from the VPM

104
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,587
the nuclear reticularis neurons,
or at least some of them,

105
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:00,852
will fire action potentials in turn.

106
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:05,410
That then means that the axon
of the nucleus reticularis neurons

107
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,703
becomes relevant,

108
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:10,229
and the axon comes back 
and in part, will innervate

109
00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:13,533
exactly the area from where
it received excitation.

110
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,550
And so there's a feedback inhibition

111
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,431
right onto the cells
that initially were excited.

112
00:06:18,431 --> 00:06:22,129
And so in the VPM, 
from this action potential,

113
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,181
we'll see a hyperpolarizing IPSP.

114
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:30,217
And it's a fast GABA(A) mediate
inhibitory postsynaptic potential.

115
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,946
And so if we now, 
imagine what's happening,

116
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:35,312
in general at the VPM

117
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:39,805
in terms of a deflection here
that a whisker sensory input

118
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:44,847
that causes a depolarization 
action potential firing in the VPM cell.

119
00:06:44,847 --> 00:06:47,486
And then, we'll have 
the nucleus reticularis

120
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:49,900
that then in turn, 
provides feedback inhibition

121
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,361
so we'll get an inhibitory 
postsynaptic potential here

122
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:58,417
from the VPM in terms of 
the membrane potential fluctuations.

123
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:02,073
And what this inhibitory 
postsynaptic potential does

124
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:04,788
is that it prevents 
action potential firing

125
00:07:04,788 --> 00:07:07,033
outside a very narrow time window.

126
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:09,848
This IPSP very rapidly comes back

127
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:12,741
and inhibits the main 
thalamic projection neurons.

128
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,473
And that means that the timing
of the action potentials

129
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:17,157
coming out of the thalamus,

130
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:20,513
have to occur with
exquisite millisecond precision,

131
00:07:20,513 --> 00:07:23,151
presumably providing 
important temporal information

132
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,461
for the primary 
somatosensory neocortex.

133
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:29,336
If this neuron was 
depolarizing more slowly,

134
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,888
and was trying to get to threshold,

135
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:33,070
it simply wouldn't make it.

136
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,912
because the IPSP would 
come in and curtail it.

137
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:38,387
And so only neurons 
that are strongly excited

138
00:07:38,387 --> 00:07:40,183
fire action potentials.

139
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:43,468
And so there's a selection
for the most active cells,

140
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:46,410
to propagate action potentials 
to the cortex,

141
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,481
and the ones that are less active,
will be inhibited by

142
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,687
the rapid GABAergic feedback inhibition.

143
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:56,595
In addition, the GABAergic neurons 
that are in the reticular nucleus

144
00:07:56,595 --> 00:07:58,905
don't just provide feedback inhibition

145
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:02,225
on to the location of where
the excitation came from,

146
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:04,188
but much more broadly.

147
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:09,146
And so there's a surround inhibition
that will then inhibit neurons

148
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:12,346
both sitting nearby in
other whisker representations

149
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:14,573
but even in different thalamic nuclei.

150
00:08:14,573 --> 00:08:17,149
And so there's 
a competition as it were,

151
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:20,098
for the flow of sensory 
information to the cortex

152
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:23,527
that in part is regulated 
by the nucleus reticularis.

153
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:27,379
The second long-range 
GABAergic projection

154
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:31,623
that we should consider,
is from the basal ganglia.

155
00:08:32,123 --> 00:08:36,168
In particular, we'll consider 
the striatum and substantia nigra

156
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:39,916
which are important components 
of the so called basal ganglia,

157
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:42,953
an interconnected set of brain nuclei.

158
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:45,474
And first, just to locate ourselves,

159
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,655
where we are on the brain,

160
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:49,886
we're going to look at the same slide
as we were looking at before,

161
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:52,090
where we have the somatosensory thalamus,

162
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,796
we have the GABAergic reticular neurons,

163
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:57,928
we have the primary 
somatosensory cortex,

164
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,546
and of course, we have here,

165
00:08:59,546 --> 00:09:03,194
our axons that go
from thalamus to cortex.

166
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:07,524
In between, is a large area 
of the brain here

167
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,244
called the striatum.

168
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:15,555
And the striatum is full mainly
of GABAergic projection neurons.

169
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:19,907
These GABAergic projection neurons
receive the inputs--

170
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,067
the excitatory inputs,

171
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:25,537
from the cortex and also 
from higher thalamic areas.

172
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:29,036
So they won't get it from 
the VPM nucleus of the thalamus,

173
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,287
but from second order 
thalamic nuclei,

174
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:36,973
that also provide excitation
onto these striatal projection neurons.

175
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:39,611
And so there are two major 
excitatory inputs

176
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:42,526
that arrive onto these 
striatal projection neurons.

177
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:46,659
The striatal projection neurons
then project out of here--

178
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:49,069
by definition it's a projection neuron,

179
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:50,649
and they're GABAergic.

180
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:53,089
And this red blob here 
is suppose to indicate

181
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,791
this area of the striatum
that sends the axons

182
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,597
out of the striatum

183
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,170
and innervate an area of the brain 
called the substantia nigra.

184
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,713
And in particular,
they inhibit neurons

185
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:07,317
in the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

186
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:13,568
The substantia nigra pars reticulata
also has GABAergic neurons in it

187
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:16,279
and they're also GABAergic 
projection neurons.

188
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:18,030
In fact, these neurons 
are tonicaly active,

189
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,334
so at rest, these cells here,

190
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:23,107
are firing action potentials 
at a high rate,

191
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:26,285
and they're inhibiting 
brain stem motor areas,

192
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:30,105
and so they prevent 
the animal from moving.

193
00:10:30,395 --> 00:10:33,523
If neurons in the striatum 
become active,

194
00:10:33,523 --> 00:10:35,387
these striatal projection neurons

195
00:10:35,387 --> 00:10:39,162
will inhibit the substantia 
nigra pars reticulata

196
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,867
and then will allow these 
motor nuclei to become active

197
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,226
and drive movement.

198
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:47,129
And so there is a so-called
direct projection

199
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,603
of these GABAergic neurons
that inhibit substantia nigra

200
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:54,273
and that in turn disinhibits 
motor neurons function

201
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,998
and that then allows
goal-directed behavior.

202
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,455
The striatal projection neurons

203
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:02,621
received one further
very interesting input

204
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:07,129
and that's the dopaminergic input
also from the substantia nigra,

205
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:09,000
but from a different part
of the substantia nigra

206
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,333
called substantia nigra pars compacta.

207
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:15,095
That's where the dopaminergic neurons
of the midbrain are,

208
00:11:15,095 --> 00:11:18,290
and by far, the largest 
majority of the axons--

209
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,871
the dopaminergic axons,

210
00:11:19,871 --> 00:11:24,461
from the substantia nigra compacta
innervate the striatum.

211
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:28,305
So this is a hot spot
for dopamine in the brain.

212
00:11:29,375 --> 00:11:32,411
And that dopamine
is a very interesting signal

213
00:11:32,411 --> 00:11:35,525
it's involved in reward signaling,

214
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:38,182
and motivating goal-directed behavior.

215
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:40,603
And indeed, the major
function supposedly,

216
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:45,592
of the basal ganglia is to control
goal-directed behavior.

217
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:49,382
The dopaminergic innervation
of the striatum

218
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:52,870
occurs with volume transmission,

219
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,071
so the swellings along 
the dopaminergic axons

220
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:59,033
don't have tight 
postsynaptic appositions,

221
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:02,895
but rather they release dopamine
into the extracellular space,

222
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:06,447
the dopamine diffuses
into the extracellular space,

223
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:09,716
and it targets two major 
sources of receptors,

224
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:15,236
D1 receptors and D2 receptors.

225
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:18,366
And these it turns out,
are expressed

226
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,062
on different types of neurons.

227
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:25,466
So there are two different 
GABAergic striatal projection neurons,

228
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,703
ones that express the D1 receptors,

229
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:30,708
and these indeed turn out to be
the so called direct path

230
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,471
that inhibits the substantia 
nigra pars reticulata,

231
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:38,928
and form the “go”-pathway
that tries to drive action.

232
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:42,445
The D2 spiny projection neurons,

233
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,230
the ones that express 
the D2 receptors,

234
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,237
form the so called indirect path,

235
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:50,630
where they inhibit 
the globus pallidus,

236
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,750
and the globus pallidus 
then in turn,

237
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,660
inhibits the substantia
nigra pars reticulata.

238
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,238
And so here we've got 
two negative signs,

239
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,410
here we have just one negative sign,

240
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,481
and so this is a pathway
that prevents movement,

241
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,155
a so called “no-go” pathway,

242
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:07,565
and so we have two different pathways,

243
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:11,191
a D1 direct projection
from the striatal projection neurons

244
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,071
that enhances action,

245
00:13:13,071 --> 00:13:16,686
and we have a D2 pathway
that tries to prevent

246
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,571
movement of the animal.

247
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,515
And what's interesting about the way
that the dopamine signal works,

248
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,243
upon the D1 and D2 receptors,

249
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:29,000
is that it has different forms
of synaptic plasticity.

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,869
And so of course, the main inputs

251
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:33,030
that these striatal 
projection neurons get,

252
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,285
are glutamatergic inputs
from the thalamus and cortex,

253
00:13:36,285 --> 00:13:41,141
that's true of both the D1 and the D2
spiny projection neurons.

254
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,227
But the plasticity that occurs
at these synapses

255
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:49,980
is quite different comparing
the D1 and the D2 expressing cells.

256
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,625
Dopamine is released 
as a reward signal.

257
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,513
So when the animal
is expecting reward,

258
00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:00,455
then dopamine is released
into the striatum

259
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:02,947
and it is thought to act
as a reinforcement signal

260
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:06,203
that's useful for learning
and synaptic plasticity.

261
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:10,102
It tries to encourage the animal
to do what it's doing

262
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:12,485
because of this reward
that's expected.

263
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,044
And that then 
enhances plasticity here

264
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,434
in the D1 “go” pathway,

265
00:14:17,434 --> 00:14:19,274
and it seems to have 
the opposite effect

266
00:14:19,274 --> 00:14:21,289
on the D2 no-go pathway.

267
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:25,618
And so there's an interesting way,
in which dopamine seems to be involved

268
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:29,190
as a reward signal in terms 
of learning and synaptic plasticity

269
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,880
and seems to be one
that enhances

270
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,829
the goal-directed actions of an animal

271
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:36,394
that lead to reward.

272
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:39,540
Obviously, a very interesting 
and useful learning signal.

273
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,638
The other reason
to be interested in dopamine,

274
00:14:42,638 --> 00:14:46,120
is that it has an important 
and major role in brain diseases.

275
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,969
And in particular,
in Parkinson's disease

276
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:52,828
it seems to be the degeneration
of the dopaminergic neurons

277
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:57,479
that seem to be the major cause
of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

278
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,455
And the major symptoms
of Parkinson's disease

279
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:03,850
are things like bradykinesia,
slowness of movement,

280
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,903
and that might then be,
because of a deficit here

281
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:10,152
in the D1 “go” pathway

282
00:15:10,152 --> 00:15:13,654
where there's sort of a lack
of self-motivated,

283
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:16,386
goal-directed movements

284
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:20,090
and that lack of dopamine
might then be one of the causes

285
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,555
of why bradykinesia
comes about in Parkinson's disease,

286
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,035
where the dopamine signal is missing.

287
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:32,203
The third long-range projection neuron
that we'll think about,

288
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:35,877
are the Purkinje cells
of the cerebellum.

289
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:39,273
And the cerebellum,
this area here shaded in red,

290
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,794
in Latin cerebellum means "little brain",

291
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:44,310
and in some respects,
it really is a bit

292
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,942
like a miniaturized version
of the big, main brain.

293
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,575
And so the cortex
sitting around here,

294
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:55,255
has projection neurons
that are glutamatergic

295
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:59,508
and they then project and excite,
deep brain areas.

296
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:02,805
In the cerebellum,
there's also a cortical structure,

297
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,268
the cerebellar cortex,

298
00:16:04,268 --> 00:16:06,476
that's where the 
Purkinje cells are located

299
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:07,986
and these are GABAergic neurons

300
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:11,338
and they inhibit
the deep cerebellar nuclei.

301
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:14,685
And so that's interesting
that we have the main, big brain

302
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,355
that has the cortex
and cortical projection neurons

303
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:19,448
that use glutamate
to excite other areas,

304
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:21,928
and we have the little brain,
the cerebellum

305
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:24,069
that uses GABA

306
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:26,277
in terms of the GABAergic 
projection neurons

307
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,888
that leaves this and inhibit 
deep cerebellar nuceli.

308
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,473
And the cerebellum is thought 
to be involved

309
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:34,048
in sensory motor learning,

310
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:36,410
and also higher cognitive functions.

311
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,376
It receives sensory information

312
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,647
both from descending
and ascending pathways,

313
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:46,302
and it uses that sensory information
to fine tune motor output.

314
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:51,222
The cerebellar Purkinje cells
are among the most beautiful

315
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:53,503
of the neurons in 
the mammalian brain.

316
00:16:54,353 --> 00:16:58,046
They have these elaborate
dendritic arborizations here,

317
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:01,472
you see in this drawing
from over 100 years ago,

318
00:17:01,472 --> 00:17:06,489
by one the heroes of neuroanatomy,
Santiago Ramon y Cajal,

319
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,600
who used at that time,
a new staining procedure

320
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,934
invented by Golgi,

321
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:14,916
and he studied many of the cell types
of the mammalian brain

322
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,574
in exquisite detail,
and indeed predicted

323
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,996
many of the circuit wiring 
diagrams of the brain

324
00:17:19,996 --> 00:17:21,898
about how information would flow

325
00:17:21,898 --> 00:17:24,056
from one brain area to another.

326
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:28,077
And here, he's drawn two
Purkinje cells next to each other

327
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:31,016
with that elaborate 
dendritic arborizations

328
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,843
so these are the largest dendrites

329
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,670
that are present
in the mammalian brain.

330
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,498
Here's a descending axon

331
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,999
from where it will project
to the deep cerebellar nucei,

332
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:41,574
and release GABA,

333
00:17:41,574 --> 00:17:43,699
and inhibit those deep 
cerebellar nucei.

334
00:17:43,699 --> 00:17:48,324
And these Purkinje cells
seem to be useful integrators

335
00:17:49,094 --> 00:17:52,225
where they coordinate
their sensory motor actions

336
00:17:52,225 --> 00:17:54,166
of the mammalian brain.

337
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,886
So in this video,
we've seen that some

338
00:17:57,886 --> 00:18:01,716
GABAergic neurons have 
long-range axonal projections.

339
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:04,503
And in particular, 
we've considered three types

340
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:07,382
of long-range projection
GABAergic neurons.

341
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:10,640
We've thought about the
thalamic reticular neurons,

342
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,861
that have a role in feedback inhibition
in the sensory thalamus,

343
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:17,069
and they probably have 
an interesting role there

344
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,843
in gating and filtering
the sorts of sensory information

345
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:22,427
that are relayed to the neocortex.

346
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:25,112
We also discussed 
the GABAergic projection neurons

347
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:26,693
of the basal ganglia,

348
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,323
in particular the striatal 
projection neurons

349
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,853
that inhibit the substantia nigra,

350
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:34,130
and there, they're thought
to have an interesting role

351
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,033
in goal-directed motor control.

352
00:18:37,603 --> 00:18:41,524
And finally, we talked about
the GABAergic Punkinje cells

353
00:18:41,524 --> 00:18:44,869
that form the sole output neurons
of the cerebellum,

354
00:18:44,869 --> 00:18:47,300
where they inhibit
the deep cerebellar nuclei

355
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,405
involved in fine tuning motor action.

356
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,452
And so, not only long-range 
excitatory neurons

357
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,872
have important roles
in brain function,

358
00:18:55,872 --> 00:18:57,873
but long-range GABAergic neurons

359
00:18:57,873 --> 00:19:01,630
also play a significant role
in governing the action

360
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,251
of the mammalian brain.
