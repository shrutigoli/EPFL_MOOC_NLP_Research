1
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:08,192
In contrast to the long-range

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,275
GABAergic projection neurons

3
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:12,425
that we considered in the last video,

4
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:14,902
many GABAergic neurons in the brain

5
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:17,634
don't have long-range
axonal projections,

6
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:21,125
they have local axons
that maybe stretch

7
00:00:21,191 --> 00:00:24,617
some hundreds of microns
and they're often termed

8
00:00:24,617 --> 00:00:27,570
GABAergic interneurons for that reason.

9
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:30,759
They regulate the activity

10
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,268
of the local microcircuits
in which they are embedded.

11
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:39,947
The inhibitory neurons of the neocortex
are such local interneurons

12
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:43,848
and in general, they don't have
long-range axonal projections.

13
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:48,570
The GABAergic neurons of the neocortex
are a small fraction

14
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:51,844
of the total number of neurons
in the neocortex.

15
00:00:52,107 --> 00:00:57,742
85% of the neurons in the neocortex
are excitatory glutamatergic neurons

16
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:01,032
and that leaves about 15% of the cells

17
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:04,500
as GABAergic local inhibitory neurons.

18
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,742
Despite the fact
that there's not so many of them,

19
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:11,919
they show a striking diversity
in almost any feature

20
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:13,781
that you care to analyze.

21
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,742
The morphology of the cells is different,

22
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:19,570
their electrophysiological
properties are different,

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,559
their synaptic connectivity,

24
00:01:21,559 --> 00:01:25,851
and perhaps, most importantly
in terms of characterizing the cell types,

25
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:30,765
their molecular expression patterns
are distinct and diverse.

26
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:35,260
In this video we're going
to consider four different types

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,309
of GABAergic neocortical neurons.

28
00:01:38,927 --> 00:01:42,622
We'll think about three types
of GABAergic neurons

29
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:47,013
that are defined through their expression
of different marker genes,

30
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:51,155
so we'll discuss GABAergic neurons
that express parvalbumin;

31
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:54,173
we'll discuss others
that express somatostatin;

32
00:01:54,173 --> 00:01:57,734
and others that express
vasoactive intestinal peptide.

33
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:01,974
These are non-overlapping
expression patterns,

34
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:02,929
at least largely,

35
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,918
so they're different classes of neurons
that don't overlap with each other.

36
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:11,415
Then finally, we'll talk
about neurogliaform cells

37
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:15,241
that at this time don't have
a good molecular marker for them.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,716
We'll begin by talking about
parvalbumin expressing GABAergic neurons.

39
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:24,878
In fact, we've already discussed these
briefly in previous lectures,

40
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,803
when we were thinking
about the action potential waveform.

41
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,372
The parvalbumin expressing cells

42
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:34,883
have fast-spiking intrinsic
electrophysiological properties

43
00:02:35,308 --> 00:02:39,741
so if you have one of these cells on your
recording electrode in a brain slice

44
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:43,573
and you inject some depolarizing
current into that cell,

45
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,221
it'll depolarize
and fire action potentials,

46
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,027
and if you inject
a lot of current into it,

47
00:02:49,027 --> 00:02:52,077
it'll fire action potentials
at a very high rate,

48
00:02:52,077 --> 00:02:55,536
some hundreds of Hertz
are the maximum firing rates

49
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:58,040
of the fast-spiking GABAergic neurons.

50
00:02:59,487 --> 00:03:02,697
If we zoom in on each
individual action potential,

51
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:05,332
we'll see that they have fast waveforms,

52
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:09,671
and the AP half width
is something like 300 microseconds.

53
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:14,143
That contrasts with the glutamatergic
excitatory pyramidal cells

54
00:03:14,431 --> 00:03:17,162
where if you inject
depolarizing current into them,

55
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,025
they certainly fire action potentials,

56
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,659
but the maximum firing rates
are much lower

57
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,227
than the fast-spiking
parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons,

58
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,641
about an order of magnitude lower.

59
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:32,523
Each individual action potential
in the glutamatergic cells

60
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:35,810
has a broad waveform lasting 
more than a millisecond.

61
00:03:37,905 --> 00:03:43,489
The axonal output of the fast-spiking
parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic cells

62
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,150
comes in two different flavors,

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,556
and there are two different types of PV,
parvalbumin, expressing cells.

64
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:57,615
The major one, the so-called
parvalbumin expressing basket cell,

65
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:02,468
sends its axon close to the soma,
and often it'll decorate the soma

66
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:05,742
with a basket-shape around the soma

67
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:10,951
causing a fast hyperpolarizing IPSP

68
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,935
mediated by GABA-A here at the soma,

69
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:16,291
or on proximal dendrites.

70
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:20,175
The other type
of parvalbumin-expressing cell

71
00:04:20,175 --> 00:04:24,415
specifically sends its axon
to the axon initial segment

72
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:26,857
of the excitatory pyramidal cells.

73
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:30,080
These axo-axonic cells

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,894
or these chandelier cells,
as they're also called,

75
00:04:32,894 --> 00:04:38,675
then target their inhibition to a very 
specific place on the pyramidal cell,

76
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,466
the axon initial segment,

77
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:44,193
where action potentials
are typically thought to initiate.

78
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:47,579
So, these cells specifically
inhibit that area

79
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,852
and it may be that they leave
dendritic integration

80
00:04:50,852 --> 00:04:55,093
in the main dendrites and the soma
of the cell largely untouched,

81
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,821
and they specifically edit
whether the cell is able

82
00:04:58,821 --> 00:05:01,680
to output an action potential or not.

83
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:04,319
A very interesting type of cell.

84
00:05:05,149 --> 00:05:07,853
The parvalbumin-expressing
GABAergic neurons,

85
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:13,086
especially this type of soma
and proximal dendrite targeting cell,

86
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:16,941
form the largest family
of the GABAergic neurons

87
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,706
in the neocortex.

88
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:23,656
We can study the connectivity of these
fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing

89
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,955
GABAergic neurons in brain slices,

90
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:30,999
where we can record
from different neurons simultaneously,

91
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:34,334
and we can then initiate
action potentials in different cells

92
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,746
and study their synaptic connectivity.

93
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:41,976
This brain slice is from a specific
type of transgenic mouse

94
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:47,215
that expresses green fluorescent protein
in all the GABAergic neurons.

95
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:51,974
So we have green GABAergic neurons,
and excitatory pyramidal cells

96
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:55,025
which form the majority
of the cells here, are invisible,

97
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,817
except when they're being recorded from

98
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:00,513
where we have the red fluorescence
from the recording electrode

99
00:06:00,513 --> 00:06:03,882
that fills the soma
and dendritic arborizations.

100
00:06:04,135 --> 00:06:07,689
And so, cell one and cell two
are excitatory pyramidal cells,

101
00:06:07,689 --> 00:06:11,078
and you might be able to make out
their dendritic arborizations here.

102
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:14,254
If we inject depolarizing current
into these two cells,

103
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:17,189
they fire action potentials
with broad waveforms

104
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,968
and at slow firing rates,
typical of excitatory pyramidal cells.

105
00:06:22,771 --> 00:06:26,972
Recording electrode three is sitting
on a cell here that's turned yellow.

106
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:30,026
That's because it's
a superposition of the red

107
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:33,490
from the recording electrode,
and the green from the green

108
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,241
fluorescent protein of the mouse
indicating that this is a GABAergic neuron

109
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,916
and upon injecting current into it,

110
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:43,598
we see that it's a parvalbumin
fast-spiking GABAergic neuron.

111
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,096
And so, we can study
the synaptic connectivity

112
00:06:46,096 --> 00:06:47,673
between these three different cells

113
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,849
by firing action potentials
in each cell in turn.

114
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:54,420
If we evoke an action potential
in cell one,

115
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,266
and we measure what happens
in cell two and cell three,

116
00:06:58,266 --> 00:07:01,061
we see that there's an excitatory
postsynaptic potential

117
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:03,761
in our fast-spiking GABAergic neuron,

118
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:05,496
so these are synaptically connected.

119
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:09,063
Not shown is that there's
no impact on cell two,

120
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:12,889
so cell one connects to cell three,
but not to cell two.

121
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:16,130
We can fire
an action potential in cell two,

122
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,698
and we see that also causes an excitatory
post-synaptic potential in cell three.

123
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:24,538
And so, both cell one and cell two
are excitatory pyramidal cells,

124
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:29,490
provide input into the fast-spiking
parvalbumin GABAergic neuron.

125
00:07:30,446 --> 00:07:33,187
This type of connectivity
is entirely typical.

126
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:39,896
We saw in last week's lectures that
excitatory neurons in the neocortex

127
00:07:39,896 --> 00:07:44,370
connect to each other with something
like a 10% connection probability.

128
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:50,062
On average, excitatory neurons
and fast-spiking GABAergic neurons

129
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:53,490
connect with something
like 50% probability,

130
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,644
so the connectivity of excitatory neurons

131
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:59,400
is much higher onto these
parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons

132
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,320
than it is onto other excitatory neurons.

133
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:10,450
We can also evoke action potentials
of course in the parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neuron

134
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,022
and see what happens
in these inhibitory cells,

135
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:14,377
and that's what we do here.

136
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,031
An action potential
is fired in cell three,

137
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:18,964
a fast-spiking GABAergic neuron,

138
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:22,335
and that causes an inhibitory
post-synaptic potential in cell one.

139
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,609
You can do the same here,
fire an action potential in cell three,

140
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:28,952
and that also causes an IPSP in cell two.

141
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:33,387
So cell three inhibits
both cell two and cell one,

142
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,521
and so there are bidirectional
synaptic connections here.

143
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:39,414
In order to see these IPSP's

144
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:41,876
we have to depolarize
the post-synaptic cell

145
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:44,753
and so here we're not
at the resting membrane potential,

146
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:48,759
but we're depolarized
to -50 mV, and same here.

147
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:52,895
We have to depolarize the cell to -50mV,

148
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:57,074
and that's because of course, the chloride
reversal potential of the GABA-A receptor

149
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,421
is sitting at around -70 mV,

150
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:02,694
so at resting membrane potential
of cell one or cell two,

151
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,183
you don't see that IPSP.

152
00:09:04,183 --> 00:09:06,992
It's just a conductance,
and the hyperpolarization

153
00:09:06,992 --> 00:09:09,802
is only visible if you 
depolarize the cell.

154
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:15,098
This type of connectivity
where we have excitatory neurons

155
00:09:15,608 --> 00:09:21,146
that connect to other excitatory neurons
with relatively low rates

156
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:27,380
and very strong connectivity
to the inhibitory GABAergic neuron,

157
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,268
here we have about 50% connectivity,

158
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:33,817
and equally the inhibitory
connectivity is also strong,

159
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:37,113
we see that this is a strong inhibitory loop.

160
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:40,007
If there's more excitation
in excitatory neurons

161
00:09:40,007 --> 00:09:43,823
that's rapidly going to be damped
by this very strong inhibition,

162
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:47,548
and in fact, the whole system here,
at least in layer 2/3,

163
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:50,986
of primary somatosensory cortex,
is strongly over-damped,

164
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:55,389
so it's actually very difficult
to get polysynaptic explosive excitation

165
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:58,546
because of this very strong 
feedback inhibition loop

166
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:03,406
from the local parvalbumin-expressing
fast-spiking GABAergic neurons.

167
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,860
The second type of GABAergic neuron
that I'd like to consider

168
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,484
are the so-called somatostatin-expressing
GABAergic neurons.

169
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:15,868
These neurons are particularly interesting

170
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:19,235
because many of them
send their axonal arborizations

171
00:10:19,235 --> 00:10:22,642
to a very specific region
of the excitatory pyramidal cells.

172
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:26,056
They target distal dendritic regions,
and in particular,

173
00:10:26,056 --> 00:10:28,354
as we've seen in previous lectures,

174
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:32,888
many of the excitatory pyramidal neurons
have extensive arborizations here,

175
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,097
right at the top of the brain.

176
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:37,512
So this is the outside of the brain
and this the surface of the brain here

177
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,732
and there's sort of a layer
of the brain called layer one

178
00:10:40,732 --> 00:10:44,476
that has GABAergic neurons in it,
but very few excitatory cells,

179
00:10:44,476 --> 00:10:46,058
mainly just synapses,

180
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:50,812
and this is where the pyramidal cells
extend their dendritic tuft region here

181
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:54,145
and that is a region
that seems to be specifically targeted

182
00:10:54,266 --> 00:10:58,212
by the inhibition
of the somatostatin-expressing neurons.

183
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:02,297
There are very interesting inputs
that arrive here in layer one.

184
00:11:02,297 --> 00:11:05,384
For example, if we're thinking about
the primary somatosensory cortex

185
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:08,718
of the mouse, then signals 
from the motor cortex

186
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:11,258
arrive here specifically in layer one.

187
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:17,295
So it may be that the somatostatin cells
are specifically involved in gating

188
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:21,441
the input of motor information
into the primary somatosensory cortex.

189
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,475
A very interesting role of this distal
dendritic innovation

190
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,843
that somatostatin cells might drive.

191
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,371
Another fascinating feature
of the somatostatin cells

192
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:36,643
is that they receive
facilitating excitatory synaptic input

193
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,569
from the nearby pyramidal cells.

194
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:41,338
So, if this is a pyramidal cell
that's synaptically-connected

195
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:45,187
to a somatostatin cell,
if we fire a single action potential,

196
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,006
then the EPSP recorded here
in the somatostatin cell

197
00:11:49,006 --> 00:11:51,574
is relatively small
and variable in amplitude,

198
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:54,115
but if we fire
repetitive action potentials

199
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:57,487
at high frequency,
say at 50 Hertz as in this example,

200
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,767
then the EPSP amplitude grows

201
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:05,245
and it becomes much larger
than it was on the first action potential.

202
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,654
So this is typical
of presynaptic facilitation:

203
00:12:09,654 --> 00:12:12,528
an increase in the neurotransmitter
release probability

204
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:16,867
that occurs at the pre-synaptic
end of the specialization,

205
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:21,904
and this facilitation is very specific
onto the somatostatin cells.

206
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:27,590
The same pre-synaptic neuron
targeting a parvalbumin-expressing cell

207
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,393
will not show facilitation.

208
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,358
Rather, it will show something constant,

209
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:33,858
or perhaps even something
that's depressing.

210
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,676
So there's something very specific
about the synapses made here

211
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:41,554
onto somatostatin cells
as opposed to parvalbumin cells,

212
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:44,773
even from the same axon
of the same pre-synaptic neuron,

213
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,279
that give it remarkably
different properties

214
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,222
in terms of what's sensed
post-synaptically.

215
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,758
So there's something
interesting occurring here

216
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:55,427
in the somatostatin cells
where they seem to be integrating

217
00:12:55,427 --> 00:12:58,738
bursts of action potentials
from the pyramidal cells

218
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,535
over longer periods of time

219
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:03,329
when they can become
strongly depolarized

220
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,356
in response to trains of action potentials

221
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:09,599
and that is unique to somatostatin cells.

222
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,698
There's no other cells
in the neocortex

223
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:15,124
that have such prominent
synaptic facilitation.

224
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:20,912
The VIP-expressing GABAergic neurons
are also extremely interesting.

225
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:25,022
VIP stands for vasoactive
intestinal peptide,

226
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:28,041
and we don't know
what the functional role of VIP is

227
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:32,222
in the neocortex, but we can use it 
as a useful marker

228
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:35,214
for a cell-type in the brain.

229
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:39,742
In the neocortex, the VIP cells
seem to have a specific role

230
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:42,477
in inhibiting other GABAergic neurons

231
00:13:42,477 --> 00:13:45,565
so they release GABA here,
they inhibit cells,

232
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,455
and the cells that they inhibit
are not the excitatory cells,

233
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:50,597
but they are somatostatin cells,

234
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,441
and a little bit less,
the parvalbumin cells.

235
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:57,949
And so, the VIP cells, rather than causing
overall inhibition

236
00:13:57,949 --> 00:14:01,688
in the neocortical microcircuit,
actually cause excitation,

237
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:04,643
and they do that via disinhibition.

238
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:08,888
The last type of neocortical
GABAergic neuron that we'll consider

239
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,614
is the so-called neurogliaform cell.

240
00:14:11,614 --> 00:14:15,407
These are small, compact cells
which have an extremely dense

241
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:19,454
axonal arborization close to the soma.

242
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:23,959
What's specifically interesting
about the neurogliaform cells

243
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,555
is that along their axons
they form, of course boutons

244
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,096
and they release GABA,

245
00:14:29,096 --> 00:14:32,434
but they don't have
an obvious post-synaptic partner.

246
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:36,220
So these cells seem to release GABA
into the extracellular space,

247
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,629
and they may then regulate
the extracellular GABA concentrations,

248
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,805
and they can signal via GABA-B receptors

249
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:46,798
causing slow inhibitory
post-synaptic potentials.

250
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:49,850
In this video we've seen
that there are quite different types

251
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,158
of GABAergic neurons in the neocortex

252
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,632
and they appear to serve
quite different functions.

253
00:14:56,146 --> 00:15:01,331
Parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons
can fire at extremely high rates,

254
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:03,697
are highly connected
to the excitatory neurons,

255
00:15:03,697 --> 00:15:07,515
and probably mediate some form
of fast feedback inhibition.

256
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:11,275
The somatostatin cells, on the other hand,

257
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,665
target distal dendritic elements,

258
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:18,322
and they receive facilitating input
from the nearby excitatory neurons

259
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:21,187
and they presumably respond
to quite different patterns

260
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:26,866
of activity in the neocortex
and furthermore, their inhibition

261
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,988
is of a rather different
element in the circuit

262
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,779
than the parvalbumin cells.

263
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,225
The parvalbumin cells inhibit
proximal areas close to the soma:

264
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:41,209
the soma itself, axon initial segment,
proximal dendrites - fast inhibition,

265
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,167
whereas the somatostatin cells
are inhibiting with a slower form of inhibition

266
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:47,230
at the distal dendrites.

267
00:15:47,922 --> 00:15:51,015
We also talked about VIP-expressing cells

268
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:53,563
that have an interesting
role in disinhibition.

269
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,952
They inhibit other inhibitory neurons.

270
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:59,260
And finally, we mentioned
neurogliaform cells

271
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,249
that might be involved
in controlling the extracellular space

272
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:08,136
GABAergic concentrations,
and mediate slower IPSP's

273
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:09,914
via the GABA-B receptor.

274
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:13,429
So there's a whole diversity
of GABAergic neurons

275
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:18,419
and a challenge for the future is now
to assemble these different cell-types,

276
00:16:18,419 --> 00:16:20,219
these different mechanisms,

277
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:24,957
and see how that functions
in the living brain during behavior.
