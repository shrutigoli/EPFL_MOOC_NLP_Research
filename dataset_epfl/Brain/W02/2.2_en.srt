1
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:06,478
In the last lesson we learned

2
00:00:06,478 --> 00:00:10,494
about an important and interesting
family of ion channels:

3
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:13,509
the voltage-gated ion channels.

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:15,477
For a voltage-gated ion channel,

5
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:19,973
the open probability depends
upon the membrane potential.

6
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,224
Furthermore, we can see
that there's a complicated situation

7
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:27,054
where the opening and closing
of the voltage-gated ion channel

8
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:29,387
changes membrane potential,

9
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:30,984
and that change in membrane potential

10
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:33,519
in turn affects the open probability.

11
00:00:33,672 --> 00:00:36,223
And so, we can envisage
complex interactions

12
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:38,754
between the voltage-gated
ion channel function

13
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:40,620
and membrane potential.

14
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:47,319
The dynamics of those interactions
depend upon the channel kinetics,

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,353
how rapidly it is changed
in its open probability

16
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,024
by the membrane potential.

17
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:58,583
The voltage-gating of the ion channel

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,282
depends upon changes
to the 3D conformation,

19
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,737
the structure of the protein
ion channel itself,

20
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:07,565
and this does not occur instantaneously.

21
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:10,875
The opening and closing
of the ion channel,

22
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,145
the individual opening and closing,

23
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,654
they occur on the microsecond time scale.

24
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:20,191
The voltage gating, the change
in the open probability of the ion channel,

25
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:23,138
occurs on slightly longer time scales

26
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:26,317
and it's those dynamics that we're
going to study in today's lesson.

27
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,378
We're going to focus again

28
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:31,705
on the voltage-gated
sodium and potassium conductances

29
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:33,987
that we began to study
in the last lesson.

30
00:01:35,014 --> 00:01:38,097
These, as we remember,
are largely closed

31
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:42,277
at resting membrane potentials
of around -70 mV.

32
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:46,538
They only become activated
as we depolarize,

33
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:51,644
as we go beyond -40mV
and above, the open probability

34
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:56,114
of the voltage-gated sodium potassium
conductances increases dramatically

35
00:01:56,216 --> 00:02:01,275
causing an inward sodium current
and an outward potassium conductance.

36
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:06,441
In order to understand
how they dynamically interact

37
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,858
on the cell membrane in real cells,

38
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,446
we need to know
about the gating kinetics.

39
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:14,887
If we rapidly change
the membrane potential,

40
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:17,741
what happens
to the sodium current in time?

41
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:21,407
For the voltage-gated sodium conductance,

42
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:26,096
we can imagine a situation
where we have a patch-clamp electrode

43
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:27,993
sitting on a piece of membrane,

44
00:02:27,993 --> 00:02:31,493
we suck a bit of membrane
into the patch electrode,

45
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:35,987
and in this patch would be
voltage-gated sodium channels.

46
00:02:37,428 --> 00:02:42,885
For a given membrane potential we can,
using the patch-clamp amplifiers,

47
00:02:42,885 --> 00:02:44,753
change that membrane potential.

48
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:48,445
We can then activate these
voltage-gated sodium conductances.

49
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,935
We know that the current/voltage
relationship for a sodium conductance

50
00:02:55,935 --> 00:02:57,828
is something like this:

51
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:00,425
a reversal potential right here,
at around +60 mV

52
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:06,245
activating somewhere around -40 mV
and enclosed, basically,

53
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,743
at hyper-polarized potentials
relative to this.

54
00:03:09,143 --> 00:03:13,025
So let's take a situation
where we start at -70 mV.

55
00:03:13,025 --> 00:03:17,297
At some given time we jump
the membrane potential to 0 mV

56
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,124
and we're going to be studying 
the single-channel currents

57
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:23,017
flowing through an individual ion channel

58
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:24,939
inside the patch electrode.

59
00:03:26,552 --> 00:03:31,336
So as we go from -70 mV to zero mV,

60
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,195
initially, the open probability
is very low.

61
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,403
The ion channel is closed at -70 mV.

62
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:42,008
We then jump to zero mV.

63
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,640
Now we have an inward driving force,

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,722
so we're expecting
an inward current to happen.

65
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:51,805
Initially, nothing happens,
but then, after a short delay,

66
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:55,499
this ion channel opens,
stays open for a brief period of time,

67
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:58,197
closes again, and then remains closed

68
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,866
for the duration of the depolarization
to zero mV.

69
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:05,299
On the next trial when we repeat this

70
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:08,828
again, -70 mV,
no current flow,

71
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:13,195
we depolarize to zero mV,
short delay, ion channel opens,

72
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:18,426
stays open, closes, and then again,
remains closed for the duration.

73
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,052
In this case here, the ion channel is open
for a slightly longer duration here

74
00:04:24,052 --> 00:04:26,584
with some stochastic opening and closings.

75
00:04:26,584 --> 00:04:29,061
And you can imagine repeating this
over and over again

76
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,656
for hundreds of trials, or alternatively,

77
00:04:31,656 --> 00:04:35,514
summating that current
across a whole cell membrane

78
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:37,703
and doing just a single voltage step

79
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:42,009
and seeing that summated average currents
across the sodium channels,

80
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,006
and either way,
we get the same picture.

81
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:47,373
We make the voltage step
from -70 to zero mV.

82
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:50,756
After a brief delay,
inward current is activated.

83
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,509
This takes, maybe some
ten microseconds or so,

84
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:59,910
and then the sodium
conductance remains high

85
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,639
for a period of about 200 microseconds,

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,285
and then it closes.

87
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:08,866
The voltage-gated sodium channel
inactivates rapidly

88
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,534
on that time scale
of hundreds of microseconds.

89
00:05:11,733 --> 00:05:15,956
Fast, brief, transient voltage-gated
sodium conductance

90
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:20,005
is activated by a prolonged
step to zero mV.

91
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:24,638
For the voltage-gated
potassium conductance,

92
00:05:24,638 --> 00:05:26,626
things are rather different.

93
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,604
Again, envisage a situation

94
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:33,814
where we have a glass patch electrode
sucking a bit of membrane inside it

95
00:05:33,814 --> 00:05:37,989
and inside this membrane we now
have a potassium conductance.

96
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:42,740
We can choose the membrane potential
through the patch-clamp amplifier,

97
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,822
and again we take a situation
where we start at -70 mV,

98
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:50,934
the ion channel is closed,
we have our current/voltage relationships

99
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,665
that are characteristic, which are closed

100
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:57,057
until somewhere around -40 mV.

101
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,399
We jump to zero mV,

102
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:02,314
we have an outward driving force

103
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:06,399
and we now study what happens
at the level of single channels

104
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,923
as we make that jump in voltage
from -70 to zero mV.

105
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:16,837
Here we're looking at the single channel
current through our patch electrode,

106
00:06:16,837 --> 00:06:20,377
we make the voltage jump,
and initially, nothing happens.

107
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:23,773
There's a long delay,
and then at some time,

108
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:27,669
the channel opens,
stays open, briefly closes,

109
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,628
opens, briefly closes, opens again,

110
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:32,871
and this ion channel will remain open

111
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:38,656
as long as we keep the plasma membrane
depolarized to zero mV.

112
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,133
In another trial we do the same.

113
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:45,620
We jump from -70 to zero mV
with a delay, the ion channel opens,

114
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,127
closes, opens, and stays open
for as long as we care

115
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,049
to keep the patch
of membrane depolarized.

116
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,707
We can, again, summate this
across multiple ion channels

117
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,470
that are present in the cell membrane,

118
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,232
or we can repeat at the level
of individual ion channels

119
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:05,605
and get the mean current flow
for the potassium conductance.

120
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:10,770
And either way we get the same picture,
we jump from -70 mV to zero mV.

121
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:15,114
There's a delay, nothing happens
for a few hundred microseconds,

122
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,333
so about 200 microseconds, 
nothing happens,

123
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,322
and then the open probability

124
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,582
of the voltage-gated potassium
conductance increases

125
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:25,571
and we see an increase
in the current flow

126
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,013
through the voltage-gated
potassium channels.

127
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:33,596
We can directly compare the kinetics
of the voltage-gated sodium

128
00:07:33,596 --> 00:07:36,611
and potassium currents
by putting them on the same graph.

129
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,028
So again, we imagine going from
our hyper-polarized

130
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:43,357
to our depolarized state 
that activates both

131
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,026
the voltage-gated sodium

132
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,375
and the potassium conductances
are both activated

133
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:50,375
somewhere positive to -40 mV,

134
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:53,106
but the major difference
is in the time course.

135
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:58,111
The voltage-gated sodium conductance
is fast and transient.

136
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:02,523
The voltage-gated potassium conductance
is delayed and long lasting,

137
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,502
without inactivation.

138
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,380
The transient sodium conductance
lasts something like 200 microseconds,

139
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,192
and the potassium conductance is delayed
by that same order of magnitude,

140
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,985
some hundreds of microseconds

141
00:08:18,985 --> 00:08:22,004
delay the activation
of the potassium conductance

142
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:25,645
that then remains active
and doesn't inactivate,

143
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:29,272
whereas here, the sodium conductance
has fully inactivated

144
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:33,866
after just a few hundred microseconds
of the depolarization.

145
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,306
However, the voltage-gated sodium channel

146
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:40,167
doesn't remain inactivated forever.

147
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,866
We can take that membrane potential,

148
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:46,649
hyper-polarize it again, say, to -70 mV,

149
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,373
and under those circumstances,
the sodium channel de-inactivates

150
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:57,546
and can go through another round of this
while we can make a step activation

151
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:01,465
and will again see the transient 
voltage-gated sodium conductance.

152
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,032
The de-inactivation
doesn't occur instantaneously,

153
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,989
but again, takes some time.

154
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,459
We can study the recovery
from inactivation

155
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,673
by doing two pulse experiments.

156
00:09:16,065 --> 00:09:19,399
And so, as before, we go
from our hyper-polarized

157
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,620
to our de-polarized state.

158
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,871
We see the transient
voltage-gated sodium current

159
00:09:24,969 --> 00:09:27,964
that becomes activated
by this depolarizing step

160
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:31,344
and then at some later time,
after we've re-polarized again

161
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,112
back to -70 mV,

162
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:38,595
we can then study how long it takes
before we recover our full sodium current.

163
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:44,117
If we wait half a millisecond,
we get some recovery, but not much.

164
00:09:44,755 --> 00:09:48,414
If we wait one millisecond,
the recovery is already better.

165
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:52,581
and after about five milliseconds,
we're almost back to the full

166
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:56,511
voltage-gated sodium current
that we had from controlled conditions.

167
00:09:56,811 --> 00:10:01,030
And so, we can plot
an exponential recovery time course

168
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,688
for the voltage-gated sodium conductance

169
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:07,579
if we think of this as the second peak,

170
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,101
and this as the control, first peak,

171
00:10:10,101 --> 00:10:11,713
we can look at the ratio

172
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:19,328
of the second activated
voltage-gated sodium conductance

173
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,894
compared to the first one,

174
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:25,468
and we find that there's
a recovery time constant

175
00:10:25,468 --> 00:10:27,996
with an exponential form here,

176
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:31,438
and the exponential
for the recovery from inactivation

177
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:35,619
is on the several millisecond time scale.

178
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,337
So we've seen some important
features of the kinetics

179
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:44,107
of the activation and inactivation
of the voltage-gated

180
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:46,606
sodium and potassium conductances.

181
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,671
Both voltage-gated sodium
and potassium conductances

182
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,872
are inactive
at resting membrane potential,

183
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,636
around -70 mV.

184
00:10:55,636 --> 00:11:00,415
Above -40 mV the open probability
of both sodium and potassium conductances

185
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:02,825
increases dramatically,

186
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:06,484
but the sodium conductance
is rapidly activated in the time domain

187
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:10,018
lasting a few hundred microseconds
is then inactivated,

188
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:13,227
whereas the potassium conductance
is delayed.

189
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:16,544
It takes some hundreds of microseconds
before it even opens,

190
00:11:16,544 --> 00:11:19,179
and then, it doesn't inactivate,
but remains open

191
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,126
for as long as the membrane
is depolarized.

192
00:11:24,186 --> 00:11:28,140
Now, this is true in general
of the voltage-gated sodium

193
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,646
and potassium conductances that one sees,

194
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:34,688
but there's also some diversity
as one goes across different species

195
00:11:34,688 --> 00:11:38,683
and across different cells
in the same species,

196
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:42,019
and we'll have a little look
at the basis of that in the next slides.

197
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:49,501
The voltage-gated sodium channels
are encoded by a family of nine genes

198
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:57,118
that are given the nomenclature
Nav1.1 through to Nav1.9.

199
00:11:58,523 --> 00:12:04,217
All of them encode the voltage-gated
sodium channel in a single gene,

200
00:12:04,217 --> 00:12:09,158
so it's one long string of amino-acids
that has transmembrane domains

201
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:17,002
and it has four subunits that are all
part of the same string of amino-acids

202
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,718
so this would be the N terminal,
the C terminal,

203
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:25,173
and here's subunit I, II, III, and IV

204
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,396
and these are then
the trans-membrane regions

205
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:30,831
that will ultimately sit
in the plasma membrane

206
00:12:30,831 --> 00:12:35,512
and will then form the four subunits
of the ion channel,

207
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:39,290
the center of which forms
the ion conducting channel pore.

208
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,039
Associated with this
so-called alpha subunit

209
00:12:43,133 --> 00:12:45,271
of the voltage-gated sodium channel

210
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:47,587
is a much smaller Beta subunit

211
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:51,810
that sits somewhere tightly associated
to the ion channel proteins

212
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,768
encoded by the Alpha subunit.

213
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,682
Together this provides some diversity.

214
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,935
There are nine different
sodium channel proteins,

215
00:12:59,935 --> 00:13:02,603
there are four different Beta supplements,

216
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:07,065
and they can then encode
slightly different functions

217
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:09,541
in terms of the single-channel conductance

218
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,602
and the detailed kinetics
and the voltage activation.

219
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,779
Another very important aspect

220
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,351
that's different between
the different isoforms

221
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:20,889
is the cell types
in which they are expressed,

222
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,821
and also the sub-cellular localization
of the voltage-gated sodium channel.

223
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,012
As we'll learn in the next lesson,

224
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:32,326
the density of the voltage-gated
sodium channel

225
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:37,778
is regulated very precisely,
and some small subregions of neurons

226
00:13:37,778 --> 00:13:41,647
have very high densities
of voltage-gated sodium channels

227
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:45,250
and that makes a big difference
to the functioning of neurons.

228
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,814
There's also some diversity in terms
of the time course

229
00:13:49,814 --> 00:13:52,232
of the voltage-gated sodium channel,

230
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:55,730
and in particular, some subtypes
of voltage-gated sodium channels

231
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,480
have much less inactivation
than what we've discussed.

232
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:05,778
Potassium channels are an even more
diverse family of ion channels.

233
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:10,786
There's something like 80 different genes
in the mammalian genome

234
00:14:10,786 --> 00:14:13,103
that encode potassium channels.

235
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,549
Not all of the potassium channels
are voltage-gated.

236
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,181
They are an important family
of the potassium channels,

237
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:26,000
and are certainly the ones
that are most interesting to us

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,504
in terms of thinking about
the complex dynamics of membrane potential

239
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,367
but they're not the only ones.

240
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:36,572
There are also potassium channels
that are gated by the intracellular

241
00:14:36,572 --> 00:14:40,005
calcium concentration,
calcium activated potassium channels

242
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,766
that are so-called BK and SK channels,

243
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:49,714
and there's another family
of proteins, of potassium channels,

244
00:14:49,714 --> 00:14:53,019
that are so-called G-protein
coupled ion channels,

245
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,762
these are the so-called GIRK channels,

246
00:14:55,762 --> 00:15:01,396
and there are the Tandem pore
potassium channels

247
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:05,063
that are involved in setting
the resting membrane potential.

248
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:10,558
The voltage-gated
potassium channels in themselves

249
00:15:10,558 --> 00:15:12,647
have extensive diversity.

250
00:15:12,647 --> 00:15:15,665
Some of the voltage-gated
potassium channels

251
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:21,161
have some degree of inactivation
but on a much longer time scale

252
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:24,565
than what we saw
for the voltage-gated sodium channels.

253
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:29,433
The potassium channels are also different
in the sense that they encode

254
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:34,543
individual subunits rather
than the whole potassium channel in itself

255
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:39,013
and so, one gene will encode
the six transmembrane regions

256
00:15:39,013 --> 00:15:43,494
of the potassium channel, but it will
only encode one subunit of that,

257
00:15:43,494 --> 00:15:48,670
so one gene will encode one subunit
and another gene might mix

258
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:53,430
together with that and form other parts
of the subunit of the potassium channel,

259
00:15:53,645 --> 00:15:58,670
so we can generate even more diversity
by mixing different proteins together

260
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:01,480
to form the voltage-gated
potassium channels.

261
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,023
The diversity in the voltage-gated
potassium channels

262
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:10,068
causes a great deal of the diversity
in terms of how neuronal

263
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:13,697
membrane potential changes
in different cell types

264
00:16:13,886 --> 00:16:16,622
and in different compartments
of the same cell.

265
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:22,331
So now we've learned a bit
about the voltage activation

266
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:25,744
of the sodium
and the potassium conductances.

267
00:16:25,744 --> 00:16:29,142
We have the voltage activation
of the sodium conductance,

268
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:33,581
and we have the voltage activation
of the potassium conductance,

269
00:16:33,581 --> 00:16:39,353
both of which are activating
somewhere positive to -40 mV

270
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:42,001
and closed at resting membrane potentials.

271
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:46,422
We also know something
about the dynamics

272
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,603
of the opening of the voltage-gated
sodium conductance.

273
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:55,677
It opens rapidly and then inactivates,
whereas for the potassium conductance,

274
00:16:55,677 --> 00:17:01,333
we have a slower rise that takes
some hundreds of microseconds.

275
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:06,366
We can then begin to think
about what happens inside a cell

276
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:14,401
that might express both the sodium
and the potassium conductances.

277
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:19,505
If we think now about the different
time courses of these,

278
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:22,523
you can imagine that if we take
the membrane potential

279
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,743
a little bit depolarized
and we get into this regime

280
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:28,934
where the sodium channel
begins to activate,

281
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:33,377
we could then get this brief activity
of the voltage-gated sodium conductance

282
00:17:33,377 --> 00:17:36,332
that will drive a depolarization
for the inward current

283
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,356
through the sodium conductance.

284
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,428
This will then inactivate,
and at the same time,

285
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:44,042
while the sodium conductance inactivates,

286
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:48,026
the potassium conductance is activating,
driving a hyper-polarization.

287
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,000
We'll see it's exactly
this dynamic interaction

288
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,250
between the sodium
and the potassium conductances

289
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:01,097
giving rise to brief transient excursions
in the membrane potential with time

290
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:04,371
that drives the so-called
action potential.

291
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,433
That action potential is what
we'll be studying in the next lesson.

292
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:14,182
So to summarize this lesson,
we've learned some interesting details

293
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:17,902
about the kinetics of activation
and inactivation

294
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:20,786
of voltage-gated sodium
and potassium channels.

295
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,204
The voltage-gated sodium channel
activates rapidly,

296
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,157
then inactivates rapidly,

297
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:29,811
and remains inactivated
until the membrane potential

298
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:33,381
hyper-polarizes again, and then,
after a few milliseconds,

299
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:37,464
it's de-inactivated and ready
for the next voltage pulse.

300
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:41,159
The voltage-gated potassium channels,
on the other hand,

301
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,271
are slowly activated by depolarization.

302
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:48,576
It takes them a few microseconds
before their open probability increases,

303
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:54,298
but then they remain open for as long
as the membrane potential is depolarized.

304
00:18:56,156 --> 00:19:03,353
The complex interplay between time,
space and membrane potential

305
00:19:03,353 --> 00:19:06,796
and the opening of these
voltage-gated ion channels

306
00:19:07,316 --> 00:19:11,277
causes very interesting and complex
dynamics in membrane potential,

307
00:19:11,689 --> 00:19:15,454
and ultimately underlie
the action potential signal,
