1
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:07,602
Last video we learned
about the action potential,

2
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:09,499
an all-or-none signal

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:13,308
driven by the explosive
positive feedback activation

4
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:16,405
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

5
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:22,474
The action potential is thus
a digital, all-or-none binary signal,

6
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:27,830
and the brain apparently, therefore,
uses digital information signalling.

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,404
Digital communications are also important
in modern everyday life.

8
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:39,573
Computers, telephones, and all forms
of information-processing systems

9
00:00:39,803 --> 00:00:42,680
use digital signalling.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,977
The reason for using digital signalling

11
00:00:44,977 --> 00:00:47,806
is that we can use
much higher information rates

12
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:50,768
for reliable information transfer.

13
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,215
If we imagine trying to send a signal
down a transmission line,

14
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:57,436
and some noise is being introduced,

15
00:00:57,436 --> 00:01:00,529
it's easy to restore that
if it's a digital signal.

16
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:03,598
We simply have
very large signal amplitude,

17
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:05,515
and noise makes very little difference,

18
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:07,844
and we can restore the signal easily

19
00:01:07,844 --> 00:01:12,311
through a regenerative amplifier
of digital signals.

20
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:16,645
The same processing for an analog signal
would be very difficult.

21
00:01:16,645 --> 00:01:19,984
Digital signalling
in modern telecommunications

22
00:01:19,984 --> 00:01:23,868
therefore allows
high information transfer rates

23
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:25,557
and reliable signalling.

24
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:29,811
It turns out that the digital signal
of the action potential

25
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:33,704
fulfills a very similar role
for the brain.

26
00:01:34,124 --> 00:01:40,093
We've already studied some of the issues
of passive spread of membrane potential,

27
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:43,294
and the complexity
of membrane potential distributions

28
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:47,911
across the arborizations on real neurons.

29
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:53,298
We saw that the thin cables of neurons
in the dendrites and axons,

30
00:01:53,298 --> 00:01:59,166
were associated with a considerable amount
of spatial and temporal filtering.

31
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:02,464
There was a length scale
of around 1 mm,

32
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:06,760
which is about the size of
the dendritic arborizations in a neuron,

33
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:12,308
which <i>filter</i> the signal
-- a <i>steady-state</i> membrane voltage --

34
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:16,631
so that one voltage up here
might be half of its size

35
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:19,267
by the time it reaches the soma.

36
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:22,163
There were also membrane time constants

37
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,034
that were on the order
of several milliseconds

38
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:28,444
that further filtered the rapid signals

39
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:32,839
that could occur
in the dendritic arborizations.

40
00:02:33,456 --> 00:02:36,926
The dendrites are on a scale
of around 1 mm,

41
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:39,510
and so the length constant
of around 1 mm,

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,978
or several hundred microns,

43
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:45,993
poses a considerable and a real problem
for information transfer.

44
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:48,209
The problem is, in fact, much larger

45
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,862
when we begin to think
about the <i>output</i> of a neuron

46
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,651
that is transmitted
down the axon of cells.

47
00:02:55,651 --> 00:03:01,765
The axon of cells can travel
for many centimeters, and even <i>meters;</i>

48
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,170
and under these circumstances,

49
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,898
the length constants of around 1 mm
become so problematic

50
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:15,756
that basically no signal would be
transferred passively down an axon.

51
00:03:15,756 --> 00:03:19,082
As we'll learn today,
the regenerative nature

52
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:24,106
of the all-or-none, explosive
amplification of the action potential

53
00:03:24,106 --> 00:03:27,307
allows it to propagate
down axons faithfully;

54
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:30,210
so that when we have an axon potential
at <i>one</i> location,

55
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,744
it's faithfully transmitted
to <i>an other</i> location

56
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:37,175
because of the regenerative,
explosive activation

57
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,046
of those voltage-gated sodium channels.

58
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:43,864
Before we can think about the <i>propagation</i>
of the action potential,

59
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:48,152
we must first find out
where and how it's initiated.

60
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,909
Here is a recording of an action potential.

61
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:57,458
On the millisecond timescale,
the membrane potential depolarizes;

62
00:03:57,838 --> 00:04:01,116
on a certain point,
we hit the action potential threshold,

63
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:04,655
and the voltate <i>shoots up</i>
towards positive potentials

64
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:09,153
driven by the activation
of the voltage-gated sodium conductance.

65
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:15,564
If we zoom in on a portion here
<i>close</i> to the action potential initiation,

66
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,866
we see, of course, the depolarizing
membrane potential;

67
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:23,118
we see the increase in the sodium current

68
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:27,636
that <i>outpaces</i> the increase 
in the potassium current.

69
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:29,604
And that's the key feature:

70
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:33,735
the sodium conductance must be larger
than the potassium conductance,

71
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,711
and then eventually we hit threshold,

72
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,973
and then action potential is initiated:
a point of no return.

73
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:42,944
And the precise <i>location</i>

74
00:04:42,944 --> 00:04:47,200
of that action potential initiation
of the action potential threshold

75
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,842
will then <i>depend</i>
upon how much <i>sodium</i> current there is.

76
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,621
So, the <i>sodium current density</i>
is one important feature.

77
00:04:55,534 --> 00:04:58,842
Another important feature
is the activation voltage.

78
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:04,417
You'll remember that there's
a voltage-gated activation curve

79
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,756
of the sodium, and also
of the potassium conductance,

80
00:05:07,756 --> 00:05:10,765
where, at a certain voltage,

81
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:14,808
the sodium conductance
begins to become activated:

82
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:17,648
somewhere above +50mV.

83
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:22,368
And so, shifting the activation <i>threshold</i>
of the voltage-gated sodium channel

84
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:26,624
is <i>another</i> way in which
the AP threshold can be moved.

85
00:05:26,624 --> 00:05:30,500
And similiarly, the <i>inactivation</i>
of the voltage-gated sodium channel

86
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,948
can make a difference:

87
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:35,013
basically, if we <i>inactivate</i>
the sodium channel,

88
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:36,874
then we might never reach threshold,

89
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:40,110
because the voltage-gated potassium
conductance might out-compete it.

90
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:45,211
And the condition that we need to fulfill
is a large sodium current.

91
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:47,148
And so, there's a variety of ways

92
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,602
in which we can get
low action potential thresholds;

93
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,753
but the one that appears
to be most relevant

94
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,758
in terms of the initiation
of action potentials

95
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:59,095
in the <i>mammalian</i> nervous system

96
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:02,865
is the density of voltage-gated
sodium channels.

97
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:05,923
In fact, in most <i>mammalian</i> neurons,

98
00:06:05,923 --> 00:06:10,216
the action potential is <i>always</i> initiated
at one unique location:

99
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,782
the axon initial segment.

100
00:06:13,782 --> 00:06:20,218
Here is an image of an excitatory
pyramidal neuron in the neocortex.

101
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:25,351
The dendrites that you can see here,
filled in black with a dye

102
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,096
and reconstructed here in black for you,

103
00:06:29,096 --> 00:06:33,026
are the places where signals
from <i>other</i> neurons arrive;

104
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:36,456
so, there's an <i>input</i> end of the neuron;

105
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:39,635
and these are the so-called
<i>dendritic arborizations.</i>

106
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:43,610
Thinner, and only visible in part,

107
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,746
and only reconstructed
in part here in red, is the axon,

108
00:06:47,836 --> 00:06:50,966
which is the <i>output</i> end of the neuron.

109
00:06:50,966 --> 00:06:54,580
So, signals come <i>in,</i> into the dendrites;
it's <i>processed</i>;

110
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,950
and there's an <i>output</i> on the axon,

111
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,909
where the signals are transmitted
to <i>other</i> nerve cells.

112
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:07,225
If we zoom in on this area,
region in the green box,

113
00:07:07,225 --> 00:07:10,664
you can see at higher magnification
the cell body,

114
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,201
where the DNA of the cell is located.

115
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:18,786
We have the dendritic processes
that stick out from here;

116
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,752
and in the <i>thin,</i>
you see a smooth structure here:

117
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:27,234
the axon, that descends in
towards the depths of the brain.

118
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:32,062
This unique process, the axon,
is thinner than the dendrites

119
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:36,490
and somewhere around 50 ┬╡m
away from the cell body

120
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,521
is an interesting specific location
called the <i>axon initial segment.</i>

121
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,754
And at that area,

122
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:49,455
we find a very high density
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

123
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,766
Many times, more sodium channels

124
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:56,804
are located in <i>this</i> part
of the cell membrane than anywhere else.

125
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:03,943
The voltage-gated sodium channels
are <i>clustered</i> here by <i>molecular scaffolds.</i>

126
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:09,103
The voltage-gated sodium channels
bind to another protein called Ankyrin G

127
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,258
that binds to the cytoskeleton;

128
00:08:11,748 --> 00:08:14,119
and that <i>anchoring</i> process is involved

129
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:18,181
in <i>clustering</i> the voltage-gated
sodium channels here at a high density.

130
00:08:18,472 --> 00:08:24,350
And that <i>high density</i> of sodium channels
means that <i>this</i> is the point of the neuron

131
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,432
that has the lowest voltage activation
threshold for the action potential.

132
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:34,546
Action potentials are initiated right here,
in the axon initial segment.

133
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:40,351
So, if you were <i>recording</i> the membrane
potential of a neuron here at the soma,

134
00:08:40,685 --> 00:08:45,630
and there's input arriving
from <i>other</i> neurons across the <i>dendrites,</i>

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,346
we'll see that the membrane potential
<i>fluctuates;</i>

136
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,670
and if the input is sufficiently large,

137
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,791
that drives the membrane potential
to cross threshold,

138
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:57,488
and an action potential is initiated.

139
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:01,268
We now know that 
the action potential initiation

140
00:09:01,268 --> 00:09:04,083
occurs at the axon initial segment,

141
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,770
some 50 ┬╡m away from the recording site.

142
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:14,028
From the axon initial segment,
the action potential <i>propagates</i> actively,

143
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,938
through the regenerative activation
of voltage-gated sodium channels

144
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:22,745
that are distributed, not <i>only</i>
at the axon initial segment,

145
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:26,060
but across <i>all</i> neuronal membranes.

146
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,888
The action potential, therefore,
is initiated here;

147
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:34,492
but, through <i>regenerative</i> activation,
it propagates down the axon.

148
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:38,895
It <i>also</i> propagates
back up towards the <i>soma,</i>

149
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:41,646
which is where we <i>record</i>
this action potential;

150
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,754
and it also propagates
back into the dendrites.

151
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,371
And again, voltage-gated sodium channels
are present here,

152
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:51,429
and they can regeneratively
amplify the signal

153
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,069
in a positive-feedback way.

154
00:09:53,997 --> 00:09:55,671
Somewhere across these dendrites,

155
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:58,967
sodium channel density
drops below a critical number,

156
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,801
and the action potential
stops propagating.

157
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,208
That's <i>not</i> true of the axon;

158
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,852
the action potential
is <i>faithfully</i> propagated

159
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:12,031
throughout the extent of the axon
of real mammalian nerve cells.

160
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,285
The <i>propagation</i> of the action potential
is thus <i>supported</i>

161
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:20,993
by the regenerative activation
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

162
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,992
Let's imagine we have a snapshot
of an area of the axon

163
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:29,446
through which the action potential
is propagating.

164
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:33,236
This area of the axon
is currently excited.

165
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:38,137
It's depolarized; the voltage-gated
sodium channels are open;

166
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,277
and there's a large sodium flow
coming into the axon.

167
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:49,587
That sodium flow, <i>in part</i>, goes down
the axial direction of the axon,

168
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:53,793
causing <i>further</i> depolarization
in this area here

169
00:10:53,793 --> 00:10:57,599
-- where, in turn, it will activate
the voltage-gated sodium conductance,

170
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:01,952
driving a new,
regenerative spike in this area,

171
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:06,265
propagating the voltage waveform
forwards in this direction.

172
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:13,140
On the <i>tail,</i> the voltage-gated
sodium channels become <i>inactivated.</i>

173
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,305
Remember, they're only open
for a short period of time.

174
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:19,229
They're transiently activated
for around 200 ┬╡s.

175
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:21,714
Afterwards, they inactivate;

176
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:26,819
and instead, the delayed activation
of the <i>potassium</i> conductance takes over,

177
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,390
hyperpolarizing the membrane potential

178
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,259
on the <i>falling</i> part
of the action potential waveform

179
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,973
as it <i>propagates</i> down the axon.

180
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,531
And so, we have a <i>refractory</i> part
of the axon here

181
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,559
where the voltage-gated sodium channels
are inactivated

182
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,562
for a period of some milliseconds.

183
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,661
The potassium conductance is open,

184
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:50,577
and no further action potentials
can be initiated here

185
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:52,688
for a period of some milliseconds.

186
00:11:52,688 --> 00:11:56,757
On the other hand, this wavefront here
is propagating <i>rapidly</i>

187
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,241
through the spread of current <i>axially,</i>

188
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:05,260
and the activation of the voltage-gated
sodium conductance.

189
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:09,655
So, the spread of the action potential
depends <i>critically</i>

190
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:13,875
upon the axial spread of current flow.

191
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:20,142
And so, let's quickly review what we know
about axial current flow in cables.

192
00:12:20,142 --> 00:12:25,313
We looked at the cable equation
across neurites,

193
00:12:25,313 --> 00:12:27,484
and we found that there were 
key determinants

194
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:31,530
for the filtering of voltage
as it tries to propagate down the cable.

195
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,022
There was a length constant
for the membrane,

196
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,538
and there was a membrane time constant.

197
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:41,038
And these have obvious
and intuitive ideas about them.

198
00:12:41,588 --> 00:12:45,300
The length scale for, say,
a <i>steady-state</i> membrane potential

199
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,288
drops off with the exponential
time-distance factor of ╬╗,

200
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:56,766
and we can intuitively imagine that,
if we have a high membrane resistance,

201
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:58,632
we have less <i>leak</i> of current;

202
00:12:58,632 --> 00:13:01,726
and we therefore would have
a greater spread of current

203
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,634
in the axial direction.

204
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,205
And so, ╬╗ would increase.

205
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:10,669
Equally, if we have
a lower axial resistance,

206
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,920
that would <i>also</i>, of course,
<i>increase</i> the axial current flow.

207
00:13:15,118 --> 00:13:19,396
In addition, we have some filtering
of the signal through the capacitors.

208
00:13:19,396 --> 00:13:25,509
So, some of the axial current
flows across the membrane <i>conductances</i>,

209
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,570
and <i>another</i> part is used
to fill the capacitance.

210
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,331
And so, in time,

211
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:34,709
if we imagine that there's a brief signal
and membrane potential here,

212
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:37,416
-- a brief current pulse,
or a brief voltage pulse --

213
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,244
that will then <i>spread</i> to <i>other</i> locations,
but after <i>filtering.</i>

214
00:13:42,244 --> 00:13:46,128
And so, at <i>this</i> location, we might see
a signal that looks like <i>this;</i>

215
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:47,834
and a bit further away

216
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:50,300
-- it's filtered both in space
<i>and</i> in time --

217
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,650
we get <i>slower</i> potentials,

218
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:56,371
and that are <i>smaller,</i> in time,
and also <i>delayed</i>.

219
00:13:56,739 --> 00:14:02,177
And so, both the <i>temporal</i> filtering
and the <i>length-scale</i> filtering

220
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:07,446
will tend to affect the <i>spread</i> of current
down the axial direction,

221
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:12,713
and will therefore affect things like
the propagation, reliability, and speed

222
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,032
of the action potential.

223
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:20,249
And so, if we want to have a <i>rapid</i>
and <i>reliable</i> action potential propagation,

224
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:24,254
then we need to have
a high membrane resistance

225
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:28,067
-- so that there's little <i>leak,</i>
and we get these long length constants --

226
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,292
a low axial resistance

227
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:33,076
-- so, that there's, again,
a greater current flow

228
00:14:33,076 --> 00:14:35,291
and, again, a longer length constant --

229
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,878
and a low membrane capacitance

230
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,108
-- so that there's less
of the current flow

231
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,939
down the axial direction
that's used in <i>charging</i> the membrane,

232
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,521
and more of it
can propagate down the axon,

233
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:51,293
giving rise to the <i>regenerative</i> activation
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

234
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:55,410
In a typical neuron
of the mammalian nervous sytem,

235
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:00,139
the action potential propagation speed
is around 1 m/s;

236
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:04,475
so, that's around 1 mm/ms.

237
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,554
And if we think
about neuronal computations

238
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:10,597
that need to take place
on the millisecond time scale

239
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,877
in order to be compatible with behavior,

240
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:19,848
this then allows local processing
in a small cube of brain of around 1 mm┬│

241
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:23,818
to take place with high speed
and high accuracy.

242
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:27,105
On the other hand, if you need
to propagate the signals <i>further,</i>

243
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:32,405
then maybe 1 mm/ms
begins to seem a little bit slow.

244
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:37,731
And in particular, last lesson,
we learned about the squid giant axon,

245
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:42,260
which had this <i>enormously</i> large,
thick-diameter axon

246
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:45,425
that then gives it
a very low axial resistance;

247
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:47,810
and for the squid giant axon,

248
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,346
this then increases
action potential propagation speed

249
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,953
to something like 25 m/s:

250
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:58,027
perhaps the difference
between life and death for the squid

251
00:15:58,027 --> 00:16:01,240
as it tries to escape its predator.

252
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,308
So, we've now <i>seen</i> that the digital,
all-or-none signal

253
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:09,678
of the action potential in the brain
serves a good purpose

254
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:13,904
in terms of reliable information transfer
down the axon.

255
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:18,856
The action potential propagates
through the regenerative activation

256
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:20,930
of voltage-gated sodium channels,

257
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,924
and it propages at around 1 m/s, 1 mm/ms,

258
00:16:26,924 --> 00:16:31,437
allowing at least <i>local</i> computations
in <i>nearby</i> neurons of the brain

259
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:35,110
to take place
on that millisecond time scale.

260
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,096
However, <i>some</i> parts of the brain
are located much further away than 1 mm;

261
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:44,321
and if we think about, say,
controlling our <i>leg</i> movements,

262
00:16:44,321 --> 00:16:47,850
then we need to think about distances
of around 1 m.

263
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:52,299
And then, the action potential
propagation speed of 1 m/s

264
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:54,119
doesn't seem so impressive.

265
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:58,532
It would take one second for a signal
from the brain to reach the leg,

266
00:16:58,532 --> 00:17:01,443
and if we think
about the speed of movements,

267
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,640
this is clearly <i>not</i> compatible
with our normal behavior.

268
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,478
There must be ways in which
axon potential propagation can be sped up.

269
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:15,763
And <i>that</i> process is known
as <i>myelination.</i>

270
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:21,433
Myelination is a process
in which specialized glial cells

271
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,779
-- that is, not neurons;

272
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:28,360
so, they are <i>non-excitable</i> cells
that are present in the brain.

273
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,819
These <i>glial cells</i>

274
00:17:30,162 --> 00:17:33,828
-- oligodendrocytes, and Schwann cells
in the <i>peripheral</i> nervous system --

275
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:39,538
they wrap very thin processes
around selected axons.

276
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,445
And here, in this electron micrograph,

277
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:45,783
you <i>see</i> a large-diameter axon

278
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,365
that's somewhere around
500 nm in diameter;

279
00:17:49,637 --> 00:17:56,422
and <i>this</i> process, wrapped around it,
has this black layers of membrane

280
00:17:56,503 --> 00:18:00,745
that are wrapped around,
and around, and around.

281
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:04,995
And there's an oligodendrocyte here
that sends out this process

282
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:09,509
and wraps it around this membrane
many, many times.

283
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:13,703
And these membrane processes
-- these myelin processes --

284
00:18:13,973 --> 00:18:16,326
are made largely of <i>lipid.</i>

285
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:20,806
And lipid, as we already know from
our consideration of the cell membrane,

286
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:24,899
is a very good electrical insulator;
it's a dielectric.

287
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:28,085
And what this wrapping does,
around the axon,

288
00:18:28,085 --> 00:18:30,292
is actually a little bit similar

289
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,300
to what the plastic coating
of a cable does

290
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,804
in our standard electronical devices.

291
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:41,314
It increases the axonal
membrane resistance by a large factor

292
00:18:41,314 --> 00:18:44,150
-- something like a factor of 5,000 --

293
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,881
so that there's very little <i>leak</i> that occurs
across the myelinated axon.

294
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:53,165
And it also <i>decreases</i>
the axonal <i>capacitance</i>

295
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,680
by a factor of something like 50.

296
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,542
This, then, has several effects

297
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:01,895
in terms of the propagation
of signals down the axon.

298
00:19:01,895 --> 00:19:04,478
By <i>increasing</i> the membrane resistance,

299
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:08,196
we <i>increase</i> the length constant
of the membrane;

300
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:10,977
and by <i>decreasing</i> the <i>capacitance,</i>

301
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:14,250
we also <i>decrease</i>
the membrane time constants.

302
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,023
And so, the signals that are sent
<i>inside</i> a myelinated axon

303
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:21,325
travel <i>further</i>
and are <i>filtered less</i> in time:

304
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:27,849
both of which are helpful in terms of
propagating action potentials down axons.

305
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,027
The myelination, it turns out,

306
00:19:30,027 --> 00:19:33,442
is not sufficient
for propagating action potentials

307
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:36,737
across, say, a meter of space.

308
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:42,514
The action potential is
<i>regeneratively amplified</i>

309
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,032
at different points
called <i>Nodes of Ranvier.</i>

310
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,800
At a Node of Ranvier,

311
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,944
which is actually very similar molecularly
to the axon initial segment,

312
00:19:51,944 --> 00:19:56,002
we have a high density
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

313
00:19:56,002 --> 00:20:00,501
These are clustered and held in place
by our scaffolding molecules:

314
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:03,051
Ankyrin G, and the cytoskeleton.

315
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:06,786
And so then, this is very similar
to the axon initial segment.

316
00:20:06,786 --> 00:20:12,614
It's an area where the threshold
for action potential is very low.

317
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:16,673
And so, we can imagine
an action potential being fired

318
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,211
at this location in space;

319
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,559
in between, we have 1 mm of myelin.

320
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,873
Here, the membrane resistance is high;
the membrane capacitance is low;

321
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:32,414
and so we get
a <i>faithful</i> transfer of current

322
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:37,286
down the axial direction,
across this myelinated bit of axon.

323
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,660
The capacitance is low,

324
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,594
and so the filtering of the signal
is also very little;

325
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:45,402
and so it's a <i>fast</i> transfer
of this current.

326
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,928
The depolarization then reaches
the <i>next</i> Node of Ranvier

327
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:53,311
and fires another action potential.

328
00:20:53,734 --> 00:20:58,547
And so, the action potential <i>jumps</i>,
from Node of Ranvier to Node of Ranvier;

329
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:01,684
and the jump is <i>fast,</i>
because the capacitance is low;

330
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:06,554
and the current reaches faithfully
the next Node of Ranvier.

331
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:11,280
In myelinated axons,
action potential propagation can occur

332
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,158
at speeds of around 100 m/s.

333
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:18,633
And now we can see how the brain
can control our legs

334
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:20,832
and allow us to run at high speed.

335
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:23,947
So, in this lesson,
we've <i>seen</i> the advantages

336
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:27,261
of the digital, all-or-none
action potential signal.

337
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,483
The action potential is initiated
at the axon initial segment:

338
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,957
a location in the cell

339
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:37,588
where there's a very high density
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

340
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:43,721
The action potential propagates faithfully
down the axon and into the dendrites,

341
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:48,294
through the regenerative activation
of voltage-gated sodium channels.

342
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,886
There's a spread,
a passive spread, of current

343
00:21:51,886 --> 00:21:54,511
down the <i>axial</i> direction of the axon;

344
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:58,960
and that, in turn, drives
the explosive, positive feedback

345
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,846
of activation of voltage-gated
sodium channels

346
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:04,937
in the next segment of the axon.

347
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:12,571
Action potential propagation takes place
at around 1 m/s, or 1 mm/ms,

348
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:18,498
within unmyelinated axons that dominate
<i>local</i> circuit activity within the brain;

349
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:23,928
and, for longer-distance communication
across larger parts of the human brain

350
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:27,577
-- for example, the 20 cm that separate
the front and back of the brain,

351
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:32,340
or the 1 m that separates the brain
from the end of the spinal cord --

352
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,227
for these <i>long</i> distances,
myelinated axons are used

353
00:22:36,227 --> 00:22:41,124
that have <i>much higher</i>
propagation velocities of around 100 m/s.

354
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,390
So, the digital signal
of the action potential

355
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:47,407
allows reliable
and high-speed communication

356
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:50,162
of different nerve cells in the brain.

357
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:54,494
The signal can go from one neuron
to the entire <i>extent</i> of that neuron,

358
00:22:54,914 --> 00:22:57,696
down its axon,
in a very short period of time

359
00:22:57,696 --> 00:22:59,798
of just a few milliseconds.

360
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,101
When that signal reaches
the <i>end</i> of the axon, it releases a signal

361
00:23:04,101 --> 00:23:07,788
to talk to the downstream neuron
or the downstream muscle.

362
00:23:08,207 --> 00:23:12,781
That release of neurotransmitter
is called <i>synaptic transmission,</i>

363
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,197
and that's what we'll discuss next week.
