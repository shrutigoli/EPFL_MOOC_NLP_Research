1
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:08,903
In this video, we're going to make
a lab excursion and we're going to visit

2
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:13,212
Semihcan Sermet, who is 
a Ph.D. student in my laboratory.

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,836
He's going to show you how
to make whole-cell recordings

4
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,152
from brain slices.

5
00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:20,303
Hi, my name is Semihcan Sermet.

6
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:23,341
In this video I will explain
how to make whole-cell recordings

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:24,416
from brain slices.

8
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,008
I will explain the process
in four parts.

9
00:00:27,786 --> 00:00:31,512
First we will prepare the brain slices,
then we image the neurons,

10
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,518
we prepare our recording electrodes,
and finally we perform

11
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:37,256
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings.

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,868
Our first step is preparing
the brain slices.

13
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:44,844
We first anesthetize the mouse,
carefully extract the brain,

14
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,599
and then place it 
in ice-cold slicing solution

15
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,909
containing, in millimolars,
87 sodium chloride,

16
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:54,632
25 sodium bicarbonate,
25 D-glucose,

17
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:59,139
2.5 potassium chloride,
1.25 sodium phosphate,

18
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,825
0.5 calcium chloride,
7 magnesium chloride,

19
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:07,521
and 75 sucrose which is aerated
with 95% oxygen

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:10,405
and 5% carbon dioxide.

21
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,812
This solution is not a normal
artificial cerebrospinal fluid.

22
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:18,660
It is modified to keep the cells healthy
during the cutting process.

23
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,904
First, we extract the brain 
from the mouse and place it

24
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:24,459
in the ice-cold sucrose-based
slicing solution.

25
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:27,215
This solutions helps 
to keep neurons in a good condition

26
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,564
during the slicing process.

27
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,731
Then we chop off the cerebellum.

28
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:35,934
Since we will be recording in neocortex,
we do not need that brain region.

29
00:01:37,808 --> 00:01:41,208
Take the brain and carefully
transfer it onto the platform

30
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,701
which will be going 
into the slicing chamber.

31
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:46,834
The brain is fixed
onto the platform with glue.

32
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,932
Then we take the platform
with the brain and place it

33
00:01:50,932 --> 00:01:53,692
into the chamber filled 
with cold slicing solution.

34
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:58,610
The solution is bubbling with 95% oxygen
and 5% carbon dioxide

35
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,225
to keep a balanced pH, which is 7.3.

36
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,578
We slice the brain with the vibrotome.

37
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:10,269
It has a sharp blade which vibrates
at 85 Hertz and advances with a speed

38
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,205
of 0.09 millimeters per second.

39
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:16,529
Slices are 300 micrometers thick.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,101
When the blade reaches
the end of the brain tissue,

41
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:24,563
we gently push the slice towards the blade
and separate it from the rest of the brain.

42
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:27,739
Then we take the brain slice
with the Pasteur pipette

43
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,670
and transfer it to a chamber

44
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,297
filled with 35┬░ Celsius
warm sucrose slicing solution.

45
00:02:34,616 --> 00:02:37,268
We keep the slices here about 30 minutes.

46
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:42,386
During the slicing, the vibrating blade
damages cells in the superficial parts

47
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:45,382
of the slices, the parts 
next to the blade.

48
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:49,196
In the warm sucrose slicing solution,
the damaged cells tend to float

49
00:02:49,196 --> 00:02:52,089
away from the slice, leaving
healthy tissue behind.

50
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,768
We keep the slices incubated
at 35┬░ Celsius

51
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:58,789
for 30 minutes in slicing solution,
and then we transfer them

52
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:02,134
to the room-temperature artificial
cerebrospinal fluid,

53
00:03:02,134 --> 00:03:05,688
containing, in millimolars,
125 sodium chloride,

54
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:09,441
25 sodium bicarbonate,
25 D-glucose,

55
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:13,753
2.5 potassium chloride,
1.25 sodium phosphate,

56
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,621
2 calcium chloride
and one magnesium chloride,

57
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:22,516
which is aerated with 95% oxygen
and 5% carbon dioxide.

58
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:26,160
Then we select the slice
and place it in the microscope,

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,031
superfused with artificial
cerebrospinal fluid at 35 Celsius.

60
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,346
We take our brain slice 
from the chamber filled with ACSF,

61
00:03:35,346 --> 00:03:38,452
bubbling with carbogen,
and place it into the recording chamber.

62
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:41,487
The chamber is superfused with ACSF.

63
00:03:42,203 --> 00:03:44,043
Then we fix the brain slice with the grid

64
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:46,255
and then start visualizing 
with the microscope.

65
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:49,742
First we look at the lower magnification,
4X, to see the brain region

66
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,533
we would like to record from.

67
00:03:52,543 --> 00:03:55,085
Then we switch to the 
higher magnification,

68
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:57,767
60X, to visualize the cells.

69
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,220
In this case, we use a high-contrast
infrared video microscopy.

70
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,652
It is important to find a region
with healthy cells.

71
00:04:03,652 --> 00:04:05,963
In order to do that, we look
at the slice while

72
00:04:05,963 --> 00:04:09,193
focusing up and down,
until we find a good cell to record.

73
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:12,310
Now we prepare our patch-clamp
recording electrodes.

74
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,044
We take a borosilicate glass capillary
and place it into a pipette puller.

75
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,281
The electric element covers
the middle of the pipette

76
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,720
and delivers heat to melt the glass.

77
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:26,383
The pipette is fixed at both ends
and force is applied to pull the electrode.

78
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,701
With enough heat, 
the middle of the pipette

79
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,028
begins to melt and the pulling force
causes lengthening and thinning

80
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:33,337
of the glass capillary.

81
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:37,909
After several rounds of heating
and pulling, we obtain pipettes

82
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:40,730
with a tip size of approximately 
one micrometer.

83
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:45,969
Before we start the whole-cell recording,
we fill our glass pipette

84
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:49,651
with the intracellular solution,
which contains, in millimolars,

85
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:54,310
135 potassium gluconate, 
four potassium chloride,

86
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,041
four magnesium ATP,
ten sodium phosphocreatine,

87
00:04:58,941 --> 00:05:02,054
0.3 sodium GTP and ten HEPES,

88
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,944
which has a pH of 7.3

89
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:08,114
and osmolarity 
of 280 milliosmol per liter.

90
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:12,766
We also add Alexa-594, a red fluorophore
for further imaging.

91
00:05:13,654 --> 00:05:17,010
In order to have a better understanding
of the whole-cell recording process,

92
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,295
we can first look 
at these schematic examples.

93
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:22,319
First, before putting
our pipette into the bath

94
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,837
and the tissue, we apply
positive pressure in our pipette

95
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:29,872
so the intracellular solution,
shown as blue, can flow out

96
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,489
and then the tip stays clean.

97
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,026
We apply a test voltage
and observe the current flow

98
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,247
through the pipette.

99
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,975
Then when we touch the cell,
we remove the pressure

100
00:05:40,975 --> 00:05:42,520
and suck gently.

101
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:44,960
Then a membrane attaches 
to the pipette tip

102
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,712
and then forms a tight electrical seal.

103
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:53,312
At this time, only a very small amount
of current passes through the pipette tip.

104
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:56,905
This is now a so-called cell-attached
patch-clamp configuration.

105
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:00,707
Then, we do further
brief suction pulses

106
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,535
to break the membrane
in order to establish

107
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:05,408
the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration.

108
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:10,352
Then we break the membrane
and we see a current flow like this

109
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:13,268
charging the membrane
because of the cell capacitance.

110
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,499
We fill our glass pipette
with internal solution

111
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:19,616
and place it on the head stage,

112
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,573
which has the silver chloride 
recording electrode on it.

113
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:25,200
The reason for the internal solution
looking purple is that

114
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,838
it contains a red fluorophore called
Alexa-594 to allow fluorescence imaging.

115
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,555
Before we move the pipette
into the ACSF bath solution

116
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:37,023
we apply positive pressure on it
to keep the tip clean

117
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:39,571
by always having
an outward flow of solution.

118
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,963
First we find our pipette 
under low magnification

119
00:06:42,963 --> 00:06:45,832
and then we switch
to the higher magnification

120
00:06:45,832 --> 00:06:47,923
which we were using
to visualize the cells.

121
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,205
It is important to move the pipette
around with great care,

122
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:54,483
making sure not to damage
the brain slice.

123
00:06:55,173 --> 00:06:57,693
We bring the pipette down
towards the brain slice,

124
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:00,801
near to the location of the neuron
we would like to record.

125
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:04,276
When the pipette touches
the brain slice surface,

126
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:07,381
we can see the tissue
getting pushed away from the tip.

127
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:11,368
That is because of the positive pressure
around 15 millibars

128
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:14,796
we apply to the inside of the pipette,
causing an outward flow

129
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,216
from the pipette tip.

130
00:07:17,047 --> 00:07:19,085
Then we reach our cell step by step.

131
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:22,465
First we focus deeper
and then we go down with our pipette.

132
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:26,062
When we reach the cell,
we touch the cell carefully

133
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:28,930
and move the pipette slightly
towards the cell body.

134
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,174
Now we see a small dimple
where the tip of the pipette

135
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,527
touches the cell body.

136
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,247
Then we remove 
the pressure and suck gently

137
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,712
to establish a gigaseal.

138
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:41,770
When we have a gigaseal, we do
further brief suction pulses

139
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,940
to break the membrane
in order to establish

140
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,123
the whole-cell patch-clamp configuration.

141
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,042
Sometimes we have to continue
the suction pulses

142
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,621
to improve the opening,
reducing the access resistance

143
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:53,936
between the electrode
and the inside of the cell.

144
00:07:55,878 --> 00:07:59,489
Then we switch to the current clamp mode
to measure the membrane potential.

145
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,519
We can then start injecting
current into the cell.

146
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:06,770
Here we apply currents
for 500 milliseconds.

147
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:10,501
First we apply hyperpolarizing current,
then we increase the current

148
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:13,530
and depolarize the cell
and see action potentials.

149
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,478
The more we increase the current,
the more action potentials we see.

150
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,747
In this case, we are recording
from a neocortical layer V pyramidal cell.

151
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:27,394
We can zoom in and look
at the action potential waveform.

152
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,251
We can see that action potential
half-width in this cell

153
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,854
is around two milliseconds.

154
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:36,097
Here on the left we see
the two-photon microscope image

155
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,968
of the cell we were recording from.

156
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,975
On the right, we see
the membrane potential traces

157
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:44,966
of the same cell responding
to the injected currents.

158
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:49,695
In the bottom trace, which is here,
we see that the cell hyperpolarizes

159
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,840
and in the top trace, 
we can see here,

160
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:55,814
the cell depolarizes 
and fires action potentials.

161
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,681
So we've seen that the mammalian brain
can be cut into thin slices

162
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,153
and the neurons remain viable.

163
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,288
We can visualize the neurons

164
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:06,204
through high-contrast 
infrared video microscopy,

165
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:10,183
allowing <i>in vitro</i> whole-cell patch-clamp
recordings of membrane potential.
