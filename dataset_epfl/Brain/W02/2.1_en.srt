00:00:04,144 --> 00:00:09,372
Welcome to week two
of cellular mechanisms of brain function.

2
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:14,675
Last week, we learned about 
the phospholipid bilayer

3
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:19,255
that forms the cell membrane
and electrically acts as a capacitor.

4
00:00:19,896 --> 00:00:25,426
We also learned about ion channeled
proteins that span the plasma membrane

5
00:00:25,934 --> 00:00:29,179
and form conductors with specific

6
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,931
reversal potentials given by
the ionic species

7
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:35,571
for which that ion channel
is permeable to.

8
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:40,103
These reversal potentials were given 
by the Nernst equation

9
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,508
calculated from the concentration 
gradients distributed

10
00:00:44,508 --> 00:00:47,068
across the plasma membrane.

11
00:00:48,054 --> 00:00:53,837
We also learned that membrane potential
was signaled in a complicated way

12
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:59,202
across the extended neuronal
arborisations of real neurons.

13
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:03,520
Changes in membrane potential in one part
of a neuron were signaled

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,434
to other parts of a neuron, but only after
spatial and temporal filtering.

15
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:15,075
Temporal filtering occurred approximately
on the ten millisecond timescale

16
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,329
given by the membrane time constant.

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,275
The length constant of the cell 
on the order of several hundredths

18
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:29,291
of microns defines the length scale
over which steady state voltage

19
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:33,536
differences are propagated across 
neuronal arborisations.

20
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:39,576
Now, in real neurons, and in the real
mammalian brain

21
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:43,557
signals need to traverse 
much longer distances.

22
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,682
One part of the brain needs to be able
to communicate with another

23
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:51,023
part of the brain spanning 
some 20 centimeters.

24
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:55,762
And some parts of the brain need to be 
able to communicate down the spinal cord

25
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:57,555
extending meters.

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,688
Given that we know that membrane potential
is filtered significantly by the cable

27
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:07,433
properties of neurons, how then
do reliable signals

28
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:10,029
arise in the nervous system?

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,544
The answer comes in the form
of the action potential,

30
00:02:14,773 --> 00:02:19,233
a digital all or none signal that's 
actively propagated

31
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:24,630
across the neuronal arborisations 
through voltage gated ion channels.

32
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:30,736
Today we'll study the biophysics of these
Voltage-gated ion channels.

33
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:35,803
Last week we discussed linear channels.

34
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:43,873
These are ion channels where 
the conductance is independent

35
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:45,453
of the membrane potential.

36
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:49,713
And this then allows us to plot linear 
current voltage relations-

37
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:53,439
so-called ohmic conductances.

38
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:58,023
Today we'll think about
non-linear conductances

39
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:04,631
where the permeation of cations
through the ion channel

40
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:07,457
depends upon the membrane potential.

41
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:11,950
This gives rise to non-linear IV plots
where the conductance

42
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,693
at one potential might be very far
from its linear counterpart.

43
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:21,902
Such non-linear conductances give
the nervous system

44
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,127
enormous computational power.

45
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,914
How can an ion channel 
be voltage dependent?

46
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,648
Let's return to look at the protein 
structure of voltage-gated ion channels.

47
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:43,204
The ion channel is made out of a chain
of amino acids that span

48
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,393
from the inside to the outside
of the plasma membrane

49
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:51,835
meeting the lipid bilayer in parts
and in other parts

50
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:57,492
meeting an internal
aqueous channel that allows

51
00:03:57,753 --> 00:04:01,913
the ions to permeate across
the plasma membrane.

52
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:06,496
If we look down upon the face
of the plasma membrane

53
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,206
and see the phospholipid head groups

54
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:14,430
and the ion channel from the outside
we would see a view something like this.

55
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,965
Here are the phospholipid head groups

56
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:21,806
Here are the red sub-units 
of the ion channel.

57
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:27,426
Voltage-gated ion channels are composed
of four similar sub-units.

58
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:30,300
Sometimes they're part of the same protein

59
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:33,656
sometimes they're part of different
proteins that come together.

60
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,543
In any case, they form a tight 
association, these four sub-units

61
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:42,581
and down the middle, of course is the 
ion conducting pore.

62
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:49,473
Each of these sub-units is composed
of multiple trans-membrane segments.

63
00:04:50,341 --> 00:04:53,680
Here you see an example ion channel

64
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:57,649
with the typical six 
trans-membrane alpha helices.

65
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:04,490
We have alpha helix one, two,
three, four, five, and six.

66
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:10,182
There's a color-coding of these 
trans-membrane alpha helices

67
00:05:10,441 --> 00:05:16,391
and you'll see that there's a yellow part
here composed of S5 to S6

68
00:05:16,715 --> 00:05:21,289
and that turns out to form the pore-lining
region of the ion channel.

69
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:26,747
So, next to these alpha-helices, 
we have the aqueous pore.

70
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:32,393
And, in fact, this turns out to be where
the selectivity filter is located.

71
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:40,446
The red alpha helices S1 to S3 are here 
on the outside of the protein.

72
00:05:40,838 --> 00:05:44,223
They need to interact with the 
phospholipid bilayers

73
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:47,505
the lipophilic part of the ion channel.

74
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:53,678
And here, colored in blue, 
is a special part of the ion channel

75
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:59,253
for voltage-gating, the so-called S4
voltage-sensing region.

76
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:06,792
The S4 voltage-sensing domain
that you see again here in blue

77
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:12,575
is interesting and forms a sort of unit
that can move and is relatively

78
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:16,223
mobile within the structure of
the ion channel.

79
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,218
The S4 voltage-sensing region is 
interestingly, positively charged.

80
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:30,504
It's full of arginine amino acids
that have positive charge on them.

81
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:37,572
The ability of the S4 region to be 
relatively mobile and that it's charged

82
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,177
allows it to interact with the electric
field across the plasma membrane.

83
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:47,338
At hyper-polarized potentials,
there's a strong electric field

84
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:51,577
that is from the outside to the inside.

85
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:56,430
That electric field acts upon
the charges of the S4

86
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,399
voltage-sensing domain 
and pushes it downward

87
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:02,176
towards the inside of the cell.

88
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:09,733
The S4 voltage-sensing domain is attached
to a gating mechanism, the voltage-gate.

89
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:14,776
When these positive ions are pushed in
towards the inside of a cell

90
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,517
the gate swings up, and it's closed.

91
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:22,546
the ion channel cannot open,
and cannot permeate ions.

92
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:26,816
If, on the other hand, we switch
to a positive membrane potential

93
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:31,765
the positive charges on the S4
voltage-sensing region

94
00:07:32,059 --> 00:07:38,840
are moved out in the electric field,
they act upon the voltage-gate

95
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,768
of the ion channel, open it, and allow
the ions to flux when the ion channel

96
00:07:46,043 --> 00:07:49,546
opens and closes in its 
random stochastic manner.

97
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:53,730
So the movement of the S4
Voltage-sensing domain

98
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:58,332
gates the open probability
of a voltage-gated channel

99
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,690
in a membrane potential-dependent fashion.

100
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:07,701
We know that there's a physical reality
to the movement of these charges

101
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,786
on the S4 voltage-sensing domain,
because, even in the absence

102
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:17,314
of any ion flux through the ion channel,
you can measure the gating charge

103
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,081
if you change the membrane potential
rapidly to a positive value

104
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,389
you can see that there's 
a capacitative current

105
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,825
very brief, very fast,
on the microsecond time-scale

106
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:33,088
that indicates the capacitative movement
of these positive charges

107
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,928
on the S4 voltage-sensing domain
as it moves out.

108
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,291
So, at the level of 
an individual ion channel,

109
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:46,117
where we'll now consider the difference
between a linear and a voltage-gated

110
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:49,120
ion channel, on the right.

111
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:52,933
For a linear ion channel,
the open probability

112
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:57,540
of that ion channel doesn't depend
upon the electric field that we have.

113
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,864
The open probability will be the same
if there's a membrane potential

114
00:09:04,124 --> 00:09:06,796
of +60 mV or -60 mV.

115
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:11,026
And here, we imagine 
for example an ionic conductance

116
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:14,150
that has a reversal potential at 0 mV.

117
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,094
This would be the current, 
the voltage

118
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:19,080
and we have a linear conductance.

119
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,576
And so, at a membrane potential of +60 mV

120
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:27,454
we have a certain amount of time that
the ion channel spends in the open state,

121
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:32,286
compared to the closed state, in this case
maybe it's in the open state

122
00:09:32,523 --> 00:09:34,429
about half of the time.

123
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,495
If you go to negative 
hyper-polarized potentials

124
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:43,566
the open probability of a standard linear
ohmic ion channel doesn't change.

125
00:09:43,566 --> 00:09:46,843
The open probability is still about 50%.

126
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,630
But now, of course,
when the ion channel opens

127
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:54,687
then the currents flow in, because we're 
in this symmetric situation here

128
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,743
where we have +60 and -60 mV
the amount of current here is the same

129
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:05,179
at both ends in an ohmic ion channel 
with reversal at 0 mV.

130
00:10:05,502 --> 00:10:10,476
For the voltage-gated ion channel,
the situation is very different.

131
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:16,535
At negative potentials, the ion channel 
has a low open probability.

132
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:23,830
Remember, the S4 gating area here is 
positive, and the gate is closed

133
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,874
at negative potentials.

134
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:30,878
So, this channel spends relatively 
little time in the open state.

135
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:34,536
When it does open, 
however, we get the full normal

136
00:10:34,536 --> 00:10:38,785
single channel currents, just as we would
in the linear situation.

137
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,603
What changes through 
the voltage-dependance

138
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:45,964
of voltage-gated ion channels
is the open probability.

139
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:50,778
The probability is a function of the 
membrane potential.

140
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:56,541
At positive potentials, 
the gating of the S4

141
00:10:56,794 --> 00:11:00,054
voltage-gating region is then changed.

142
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:07,645
The S4 region moves out, the gate is 
then opened, and ions can flux.

143
00:11:07,906 --> 00:11:12,913
The open probability then increases
at positive membrane potentials

144
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,541
for a voltage-gated ion channel.

145
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:22,476
These changes in open probability can then
be either summated over time

146
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:28,333
where we take a mean current flux across
a stochastic opening and closings

147
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:34,034
of the ion channel, or we can think of
many ion channels on the cell membrane

148
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:37,135
that are opening and closing
independently of each other

149
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:41,266
and we then have a mean conductance,
that's of course composed

150
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:46,513
of the single channel conductance
times the number of ion channels

151
00:11:46,634 --> 00:11:51,811
and of course, together with the open 
probability of that ion channel.

152
00:11:52,914 --> 00:11:59,128
And so, for a linear conductance, 
the conductance is independent

153
00:11:59,128 --> 00:12:01,341
of membrane potential, 
so it's a flat line.

154
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:06,127
The conductance is the same at positive
and negative potentials

155
00:12:06,376 --> 00:12:11,400
because the open probability is the same
at open and negative potentials.

156
00:12:11,603 --> 00:12:17,528
And we've agreed that the single channel
conductance is not a function of voltage.

157
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:22,821
For the voltage-gated scenario, 
we have a change in

158
00:12:22,821 --> 00:12:25,027
open probability in voltage.

159
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:29,355
At negative potentials,
the open probability is low,

160
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:33,396
and the conductance, 
is therefore, also low.

161
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:39,572
As we depolarize, we move 
the S4 voltage-gating region out,

162
00:12:39,764 --> 00:12:46,155
the voltage-gate opens, and the open
probabilty of the ion channel increases

163
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:51,254
and we move up here on the conductance
until we reach some sort of steady state

164
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:55,149
region here, where the ion channel is
saturated with respect

165
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,939
to its voltage-dependence.

166
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:03,469
If we now think specifically about 
sodium and potassium channels,

167
00:13:04,234 --> 00:13:07,072
and voltage-dependent sodium 
and potassium channels

168
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,449
are amongst the most important
voltage-gated channels

169
00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:13,384
in the nervous system, 
we now need to think

170
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:18,692
for the sodium and potassium channels,
about their reversal potentials.

171
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:23,055
And we know that sodium has a positive
reversal potential,

172
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:27,637
somewhere around +60 mV 
and potassium

173
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:33,016
has a negative reversal potential
somewhere around -90 mV.

174
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:40,164
And so, the single channel currents all 
would be flowing through a single

175
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,175
sodium channel at different 
membrane potentials

176
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:50,069
as the ion channel opens and closes
so this single channel sodium current

177
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:52,751
will then be linear, and reversing

178
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:56,221
of course, at the sodium
reversal potential.

179
00:13:56,398 --> 00:13:59,332
Similarly, the single channel 
potassium currents

180
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:03,776
as the ion channel opens and closes
will also be linear

181
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:07,816
with respect to voltage, 
and will of course reverse

182
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:10,886
at the reversal potential for potassium.

183
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:16,127
For voltage-gated sodium
and potassium channels

184
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:21,772
in general, they become activated 
at relatively similar membrane potentials.

185
00:14:22,053 --> 00:14:28,526
And so, somewhere around -40 mV
and more positive to that

186
00:14:28,753 --> 00:14:32,381
the ion channels begin to open,

187
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:36,317
the voltage-gated sodium channels
increase their conductance

188
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:42,515
above -40 mV and the same is true
for the voltage-gated potassium currents.

189
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:47,386
And so, there's a regime here 
hyper-polarized to -40 mV

190
00:14:47,598 --> 00:14:51,346
in which there's very little conduction
through the voltage-gated

191
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,363
sodium and potassium channels.

192
00:14:53,363 --> 00:14:57,150
They're closed at most
resting membrane potentials.

193
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,848
And at more positive potentials to -40
they begin to become activated

194
00:15:03,058 --> 00:15:05,413
in a strong and steep manner

195
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:09,787
becoming almost fully
activated around 0 mV.

196
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,645
If we then convolve this voltage-gating
the change in the open probability

197
00:15:18,658 --> 00:15:23,384
of the voltage-gated sodium channel
with respect to voltage

198
00:15:23,671 --> 00:15:28,864
we convolve that open probability
with the single channel currents

199
00:15:28,978 --> 00:15:32,684
and the reversal potential 
at the sodium reversal potential

200
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:35,982
we see that we get a current 
voltage relationship

201
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,761
that looks something like this.

202
00:15:37,985 --> 00:15:41,218
At negative potentials 
the ion channel is closed

203
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,646
and therefore, there's no 
current that flows

204
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:47,610
as we move through the -40 mV

205
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,007
and the open probability 
begins to become significant

206
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:57,906
we then get single channel conductances
that are substantial then give rise

207
00:15:57,927 --> 00:15:59,750
to an inward current.

208
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:05,197
As we keep depolarizing, 
the voltage gating saturates

209
00:16:05,606 --> 00:16:12,896
we hit the reversal potential for sodium
and we enter the linear conduction regime.

210
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,995
And so we have this interesting 
biphasic situation

211
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:23,263
where between the physiological range
of membrane potentials

212
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:28,715
from -90 to around +60 mV
we have an inward current

213
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,783
that's generated by the 
voltage-gated sodium channel.

214
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:35,499
For the voltage-gated 
potassium channels

215
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,399
the situation is very similar.

216
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:44,474
At negative potentials 
the conductance is basically closed.

217
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:48,417
And so, there's nothing carried by
the voltage-gated potassium conductance.

218
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:54,829
As we depolarize beyond -40 mV
it activates, and we see now

219
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,939
that there's an outward current that we 
can then compute by multiplying

220
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:05,242
the overall open probability of 
the potassium with respect

221
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:10,053
to voltage and the single channel 
currents that go through it.

222
00:17:10,868 --> 00:17:15,923
As we keep depolarizing the
more and more conductance is activated

223
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,981
until we hit this linear regime,
and that's what we see here,

224
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:23,144
we end up in this linear regime here
and interestingly, again

225
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:27,983
in this range of the physiologically
relevant membrane potentials

226
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:33,403
from -90 to +60 mV here, we always 
have an outward current

227
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:37,194
in terms of what can be carried
by the potassium channels.

228
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:43,653
So, we've seen some interesting features
of voltage-gated ion channels.

229
00:17:43,947 --> 00:17:47,894
They're largely closed at
resting membrane potentials.

230
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:53,458
Membrane potential is normally somewhere
in the range from -70 to -50 mV.

231
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:58,493
In this range, the open probability 
of voltage-gated sodium

232
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,933
and potassium channels is very low,

233
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:03,506
and they'll make 
very little contribution

234
00:18:03,506 --> 00:18:06,579
to the overall conductance 
of the membrane.

235
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:09,269
At more positive potentials

236
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:16,389
to -40 mV the open probability increases
sharply, and the voltage gated

237
00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:20,088
ion channels then begin to conduct
and can contribute

238
00:18:20,395 --> 00:18:23,746
to the overall conductance 
of the cell membrane.

239
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:29,267
The change in conductance
of the voltage-gated ion channels

240
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:33,203
is not because of a change in the 
single channel conductance

241
00:18:33,483 --> 00:18:37,982
but it is a change in the overall
open probability.

242
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:42,702
Let's see how voltage-gated ion channels
can contribute to changing

243
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,435
membrane potential in neurons.

244
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:51,357
Let's consider a cell that has 
Voltage-gated sodium

245
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,975
and potassium channels, 
each of which has a single channel

246
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:59,117
conductance of roughly 20 pS.

247
00:18:59,117 --> 00:19:05,519
The input resistance of a cell, 
it's total input resistance

248
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,543
is somewhere around 50 M╬⌐, 
typically, and that corresponds

249
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:17,540
to an input conductance of 
something like 20 nS.

250
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:23,751
So, this is the leak conductance
of a typical neuron.

251
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,500
And it's dominated by a leak potassium
conductance that keeps membrane potential

252
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:33,369
somewhere around -70 mV on average.

253
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,893
In order for the voltage-gated 
sodium or potassium channels

254
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,913
to have a major impact 
upon membrane potential,

255
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,617
we need for these conductances 
to get close,

256
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:49,471
at least in the same ballpark, 
as these leak conductances.

257
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:56,676
Remember that the membrane potential
goes something like the sodium conductance

258
00:19:56,676 --> 00:20:03,511
divided by the total conductance
and the reversal potential for sodium.

259
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:07,566
So, if the total conductance is dominated
by sodium conductance

260
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:11,865
the membrane potential will tend towards
the reversal potential for sodium.

261
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,561
So, if we want the voltage-gated 
sodium channels to make

262
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:19,151
a considerable impact upon the 
overall membrane potential,

263
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,503
the overall sodium conductance
must somehow at least get close

264
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:25,714
to the total conductance of the cell.

265
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,238
And we said that the lead conductance
is somewhere around 20 nS.

266
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:33,139
And so, if we want the voltage-gated 
sodium conductance

267
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:36,459
to make a considerable impact upon
membrane potential

268
00:20:36,459 --> 00:20:43,429
the total voltage-gated sodium conductance
also needs to be somewhere around 20 nS.

269
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:49,490
The single channel conductance 
is around 20 pS.

270
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,084
This is 10 to the minus 9,

271
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:57,490
this is 10 to the minus 12,
there's a factor of 1,000.

272
00:20:58,218 --> 00:21:03,689
So, something like 1,000 sodium channels
are needed in order to make

273
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:08,234
a substantial impact upon the 
membrane potential of a cell.

274
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:14,598
And, indeed, most neurons have
high concentrations of voltage-gated

275
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:18,260
sodium and potassium channels, 
so that exactly this,

276
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,548
they can change the membrane potential 
rapidly in a voltage-dependent manner

277
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:26,199
in order to perform 
non-linear computations.

278
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,137
Let's see what happens if we open
a voltage-gated sodium

279
00:21:32,137 --> 00:21:33,583
conductance on a cell.

280
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:38,266
Let's imagine we have a neuron that has
some leak conductance

281
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:40,803
and it's largely governed by potassium.

282
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:46,297
In addition, we can then add a voltage-
gated sodium conductance.

283
00:21:49,718 --> 00:21:55,879
We also have the current/voltage 
relationships for the voltage-gated

284
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,909
sodium conductance and 
it looks something like this,

285
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:04,473
with the reversal potential for sodium
somewhere at around +60 mV

286
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:10,171
and the typical cell is sitting somewhere
around here at -70 mV,

287
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:14,138
a time where the current flux through the
voltage-gated sodium

288
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:16,209
channel is basically is basically zero.

289
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:21,637
What if we were now to depolarize the cell
a little bit, and we'll take it

290
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:27,039
a little bit in this direction, we'll take
the membrane potential to -50 mV.

291
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,106
At this stage, there's still very little
current that flows through

292
00:22:31,106 --> 00:22:34,637
the voltage-gated sodium channels, 
and they probably wouldn't

293
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:36,224
contribute very much.

294
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:38,675
But as we depolarize 
just a little bit more

295
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:41,316
the current flux begins to flow in.

296
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:46,308
There's a considerable influx 
of sodium into the cell

297
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:49,558
as we open the voltage-
gated sodium channel.

298
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:54,839
So, we depolarize the membrane 
potential a little bit.

299
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,718
That opens a voltage-gated 
sodium conductance.

300
00:23:00,898 --> 00:23:04,463
That voltage-gated sodium conductance 
leads to an inward current.

301
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,638
That inward current will bring more 
positive charge inside the cell

302
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:13,021
and will cause the membrane potential
to further depolarize.

303
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:17,898
Depolarizing the membrane potential
further will lead to an even larger

304
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,285
inward current, which in turn,
will depolarize some membrane

305
00:23:22,285 --> 00:23:27,316
potential even more, and so on, we get
into a positive spiral,

306
00:23:27,316 --> 00:23:32,229
where depolarization increases the 
voltage-gated sodium conductance

307
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:37,117
that further increases the charge influx
further depolarizing the cell.

308
00:23:37,687 --> 00:23:43,162
And if we think about membrane potential
with respect to time

309
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:47,012
we depolarize it a little bit, 
and suddenly the voltage-gated

310
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:52,061
sodium channels begin to participate
and we're in this explosive situation

311
00:23:52,061 --> 00:23:57,078
where membrane potential has this positive
feedback loop that takes us toward

312
00:23:57,078 --> 00:24:02,742
the reversal potential for sodium, 
somewhere around +60 mV

313
00:24:02,742 --> 00:24:06,417
depending upon the strength 
of the leak conductances.

314
00:24:06,976 --> 00:24:12,541
So, voltage-gated sodium channels give 
rise to an explosive sodium conductance

315
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:17,511
where a small bit of depolarization
will give rise to a positive feedback loop

316
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,427
taking the membrane potential toward a 
sodium reversal potential.

317
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,808
Let's now consider voltage-
gated potassium conductance.

318
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,383
The current/voltage relation
has similar features.

319
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,323
We have reversal potential at -90 mV 
for the potassium reversal potential.

320
00:24:38,323 --> 00:24:43,023
We have the activation of the
potassium conductance

321
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,470
at around -40 mV.

322
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,167
So it has zero conductance
here, this is the current.

323
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,576
This is the voltage, and then 
somewhere around

324
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,995
-40 it begins to conduct, 
and we end up with

325
00:24:53,995 --> 00:24:58,504
the linear IV relationship here
with potassium always forming

326
00:24:58,504 --> 00:25:03,223
an outward current, potassium will then
always want to leave a cell,

327
00:25:04,343 --> 00:25:08,389
and will then always make things more 
negative inside the cell.

328
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,567
So, in contrast to what we saw with the 
potassium conductance,

329
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:16,255
the sodium conductance, rather, 
where we had the positive explosive

330
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:20,822
feedback here, as we depolarize the cell,
we increase the potassium conductance

331
00:25:20,822 --> 00:25:23,483
but that makes it more negative 
on the inside,

332
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:26,305
and will then be a stabilizing influence.

333
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:30,177
So if we depolarize the membrane potential

334
00:25:30,527 --> 00:25:35,250
that will certainly lead to an increase
in the potassium conductance

335
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,237
but an increase in the potassium
conductance will, on the other hand

336
00:25:40,237 --> 00:25:44,874
lead to a reduction in the membrane 
potential, and so we have a

337
00:25:44,874 --> 00:25:49,384
stabilizing influence of voltage-gated 
potassium conductances.

338
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:55,485
For a given membrane potential, if we 
perturb it by depolarizing it a little bit

339
00:25:55,485 --> 00:26:01,357
the activation of voltage-gated potassium
channels will tend to hyper-polarize

340
00:26:01,357 --> 00:26:05,022
the membrane potential and take it 
towards the reversal potential

341
00:26:05,692 --> 00:26:09,702
for potassium, around -90 mV.

342
00:26:10,865 --> 00:26:15,180
So, in today's lesson, we've learned
a number of interesting features

343
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,843
about voltage-gated ion channels.

344
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:24,513
Voltage-gated ion channels have a specific
Voltage-sensing domain, the S4 region

345
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:27,221
that's highly charged, 
and is very sensitive

346
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:29,832
to the electric field across
the plasma membrane.

347
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:35,812
At positive potentials, the gate opens
allowing ion channel permeation

348
00:26:35,812 --> 00:26:38,258
and high open probability.

349
00:26:38,258 --> 00:26:41,064
At negative potentials the S4 voltage

350
00:26:41,064 --> 00:26:46,900
sensing domain swings in, the gate
shuts, and open probability is low.

351
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,392
Open probability is therefore
the key feature that's regulated

352
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:55,751
by the voltage-dependent gating
of ion channels, whereas the single

353
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:58,939
channel conductance remains unchanged.

354
00:27:00,791 --> 00:27:06,591
The voltage-gating of the sodium channel,
because of its positive reversal potential

355
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:12,254
leads to an explosive depolarization
once you get into that voltage-gating

356
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:15,322
activation regime of the sodium channel.

357
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:19,558
On the other hand, voltage activation 
of the potassium channel

358
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:24,148
acts to stabilize membrane potential,
hyper-polarizing the membrane potential

359
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:27,190
towards the potassium reversal potential.

360
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:32,078
It turns out that a dynamic interplay
in terms of the kinetics of the

361
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:35,479
opening and closing of sodium and 
potassium channels

362
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:39,137
underlies the generation of the 
action potential.

363
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:43,280
And in the next lesson, we're going
to look at the voltage-gating kinetics

364
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,400
of the sodium and potassium channels.
