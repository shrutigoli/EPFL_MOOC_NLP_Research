1
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:08,541
We've now studied the biophysics 
of the cell membrane in some detail.

2
00:00:09,401 --> 00:00:13,025
We have learned that the 
phospholipid bilayer

3
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:15,760
electrically acts as a capacitor.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,610
And we've learned that the 
protein ion channels

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,756
act as conductors 
for specific ionic species.

6
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:27,552
We've also begun to think about 
the complex,

7
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:30,300
nonlinear membrane potential dynamics

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,275
that could result from the voltage-gated 
activation of ion channels.

9
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:41,902
In this lesson, we're going to see 
how these basic biophysical mechanisms

10
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,492
can explain the ionic basis 
of the action potential,

11
00:00:46,692 --> 00:00:51,138
probably the most important signal 
that takes place in the brain.

12
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:56,105
The action potential is a unitary, 
all-or-none event

13
00:00:56,105 --> 00:01:00,963
that can easily be recorded 
in the brain of living animals.

14
00:01:01,193 --> 00:01:06,728
If you put a small microelectrode 
inside the brain of a mammal

15
00:01:07,148 --> 00:01:11,983
and you record the electrical potentials 
at the tip of that electrode,

16
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:16,852
you'll easily see 
the all-or-none action potential wave form

17
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:21,254
that is recorded 
near the neurons that are firing.

18
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,553
Here in this example,

19
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:29,261
we record from 
a red, a green, and a blue cell.

20
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:33,646
And looking at the potentials 
of the electrodes across time,

21
00:01:34,066 --> 00:01:37,646
we see that there are unitary, 
all-or-none events,

22
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:43,145
spikes or action potentials, 
each of which looks identical,

23
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:49,080
has a duration of about 1 ms,
and the different nerve cells

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,867
can fire these action potentials 
at different times.

25
00:01:54,237 --> 00:02:00,757
If you record these action potentials 
in the visual part of the mammalian brain

26
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:03,171
and you present different visual stimuli,

27
00:02:03,171 --> 00:02:07,378
you'll see that these action potentials 
correlate spectacularly well

28
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,969
with different features 
of the visual scene

29
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:11,694
presented to the animal.

30
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:17,317
The action potentials therefore code 
for the visual stimulus.

31
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:22,331
If you put these electrodes into 
the motor cortex of the mammalian brain

32
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:25,786
and you record spikes 
from many different cells,

33
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:29,575
you're able to predict the movements 
that an animal makes.

34
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:33,291
These action potentials 
code for the movement

35
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:35,172
that the animal will make.

36
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:41,920
Action potential discharge, 
across time and across different neurons,

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,105
therefore carries a lot of information

38
00:02:45,105 --> 00:02:50,619
about what the animal is seeing, doing, 
and feeling, and thinking.

39
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,735
It's thought that the pattern
of neuronal action potentials

40
00:02:54,735 --> 00:02:59,386
forms the most important coding 
of information in the brain.

41
00:02:59,386 --> 00:03:04,855
In order to understand 
how these action potentials are evoked,

42
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:08,355
we need to look at the membrane potential 
of individual neurons.

43
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:12,611
Here, below is schematically indicated

44
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,646
what the membrane potential 
of this green cell might look like

45
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,923
as it fires it's action potential.

46
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:24,247
The membrane potential fluctuates 
in a so-called subthreshold regime

47
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:31,690
and at one given point, it rises steeply, 
becomes positive, and then repolarizes,

48
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,650
and all of that spike takes about 1 ms

49
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,455
and that event that stands out 
from these background fluctuations

50
00:03:41,705 --> 00:03:43,730
is the action potential,

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:50,060
the all-or-none digital signal 
that encodes information in the brain.

52
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,260
In this lesson, 
we'll take a historical perspective.

53
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,580
And we have two heroes 
of the action potential,

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,838
Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley.

55
00:04:02,338 --> 00:04:07,360
They were the first to record 
the action potential intracellularly,

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,122
in terms of the membrane 
potential changes

57
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:13,484
that underlie the action potential.

58
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:18,260
Hodgkin and Huxley worked 
with the giant axon of the squid.

59
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:25,361
The squid has a escape reflex 
that it needs to activate very rapidly

60
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,037
in case of danger.

61
00:04:27,037 --> 00:04:29,209
A predator is about to eat the squid,

62
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:32,389
the giant axon fires an action potential,

63
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,659
and that in turn, 
causes contraction of muscles

64
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:40,588
that drive the squid to swim away 
from danger.

65
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:44,924
The axon of the squid, 
this giant axon,

66
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:49,581
is more than a thousand times 
larger in diameter

67
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,938
than most neuronal arborizations.

68
00:04:54,188 --> 00:05:00,060
A typical axon of a mammalian neuron
has a diameter of around 100 nm.

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,399
The squid giant axon has a diameter 
somewhere close to 1mm.

70
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:11,683
This made it possible in 1939 
for Hodgkin and Huxley

71
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:17,723
to insert electrodes 
inside this large diameter axon,

72
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:23,736
place another electrode outside 
in the bathing sea salt water

73
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:29,641
in which this nerve was bathed,
and through a differential amplifier

74
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:33,619
comparing the bath solution 
and the intracellular electrode,

75
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:38,132
they could then record 
the membrane potential of this axon

76
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:40,331
as it fired an action potential.

77
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,622
And what they saw 
looked something like this,

78
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,520
a very steep, rising positive phase,

79
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,114
a very steep, negative falling phase,

80
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:53,373
and importantly, 
the action potential overshot 0 mV

81
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:57,297
and went somewhere up to around +40mV.

82
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:01,529
The duration was somewhere around 1 ms.

83
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:03,592
Hodgkin and Huxley had thus,

84
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:07,794
recorded the intracellular 
membrane potential correlate

85
00:06:07,794 --> 00:06:10,792
of the spike event 
that had previously been seen

86
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:15,044
from the outside of cells 
as little extracellular blips.

87
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:18,221
Before they could study 
the biophysical mechanisms

88
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:21,419
that gave rise to this change 
in membrane potential,

89
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:23,773
the second world war broke out.

90
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:27,535
These first membrane potential recordings 
had been done in 1939

91
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,944
and there would then be 
an interruption of many years

92
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:35,101
before Hodgkin and Huxley could return 
to their experimental work

93
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:37,080
on the squid giant axon.

94
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,952
When they got back together again,

95
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:44,738
they applied one further advance 
in electronics

96
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:47,374
that had been developed 
during the war years.

97
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,945
They, again, 
applied the voltage measuring technique

98
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,538
to the squid giant axon,

99
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,795
but this time, 
the membrane potential output

100
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:01,360
was fed into a further 
voltage-clamp amplifier

101
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,739
that compared 
the measured membrane potential

102
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:06,620
with a command potential

103
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,161
which experimenters imposed 
upon the system.

104
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:15,183
The differential amplifier would compare 
the command requested voltage

105
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:19,901
with the measured voltage 
and inject the right amount of current

106
00:07:19,901 --> 00:07:23,909
to bring the membrane potential 
to the command potential.

107
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:26,387
Hodgkin and Huxley were thus,

108
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:31,120
able to impose voltage clamp steps 
across time

109
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,930
that would then result in voltage steps 
in the membrane potential

110
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,340
and they would then measure 
the membrane current

111
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,920
that would flow across the membrane.

112
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:49,348
The type of data that they found 
is shown in these green traces.

113
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:56,594
We begin with a membrane potential 
of around -75 mV and at time 0,

114
00:07:56,594 --> 00:08:00,986
the membrane potential is then stepped 
to different potentials,

115
00:08:01,476 --> 00:08:04,570
and they measured 
the transmembrane currents.

116
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,840
As they stepped from -75 to -50 mV, 
very little happened.

117
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,250
Very little current flow was activated.

118
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,238
Going to -25 mV however, 
they saw a rapid inward current

119
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:25,226
that then rapidly disappeared 
and gave way to a delayed outward current.

120
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:27,729
At 0 mV, the situation was similar,

121
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,482
fast, inward current,
delayed, outward current.

122
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:38,280
At +40 mV, the inward current 
was almost gone

123
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,594
and the delayed outward current 
was even bigger,

124
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:45,122
and at +75 mV, 
the early component was outward

125
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:48,001
as was the delayed component.

126
00:08:48,191 --> 00:08:53,818
Hodgkin and Huxley realized 
that this wave form in the current flow

127
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:57,357
could be accounted for 
by two different conductances,

128
00:08:57,357 --> 00:09:01,975
a fast, early conductance,
and a delayed conductance

129
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,992
that they could compute later on.

130
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:07,065
By measuring at an early time point,

131
00:09:07,065 --> 00:09:11,362
they could plot a current voltage profile 
that looks like this red curve,

132
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,738
somewhere positive to minus 50 mV,

133
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,579
the inward current is steeply activated 
as we see here,

134
00:09:18,359 --> 00:09:21,641
at around +40 mV, 
it reverses,

135
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:25,703
and at more positive potentials, 
it's an outward current.

136
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:30,175
The delayed current is represented 
by this blue curve.

137
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,953
Now, because we've been studying 
Voltage-gated ion channels,

138
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:36,652
these curves look extremely familiar.

139
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:41,457
This, indeed, is the voltage-gated 
sodium conductance,

140
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:45,151
and this is a voltage-gated 
potassium conductance,

141
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:50,175
as Hodgkin and Huxley correctly concluded 
from their early measurements.

142
00:09:50,445 --> 00:09:54,294
They repeated these measurements 
from many different starting potentials,

143
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:58,881
many different potentials 
and time intervals

144
00:09:58,881 --> 00:10:01,160
between the different 
voltage-clamp steps,

145
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,259
and they were able to build up 
a quantitative description

146
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,783
across many different conditions 
for how these voltage-gated currents

147
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:11,907
developed in the squid giant axon.

148
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,772
The measurements that 
Hodgkin and Huxley made

149
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,180
were already remarkable,

150
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,106
but even more remarkable 
was their quantitative description

151
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:26,581
of these conductances that were activated 
in the squid giant axon.

152
00:10:27,351 --> 00:10:29,371
They used a simple model

153
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,597
which could describe the currents 
that they saw.

154
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,679
As we've been using ourselves,

155
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,882
they say that the membrane current 
is equal to a conductance times a voltage

156
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:45,961
and for the potassium conductance,

157
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,067
we, of course, 
need to think about the offset

158
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:51,476
with the Nernst equilibrium potential 
for potassium.

159
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:55,388
There's some sort of maximal conductance 
that, presumably,

160
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:57,525
relates to the number of 
potassium channels

161
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,400
that are present in the cell membrane,

162
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,400
and then there's another term here,

163
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,644
a voltage and time dependent term

164
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:07,219
that basically, 
represents the open probability

165
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:10,819
of the potassium channels 
in the membrane.

166
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:17,203
In order to describe the open probability 
of these ion channels,

167
00:11:17,633 --> 00:11:23,179
Hodgkin and Huxley 
described a particle gating scheme

168
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:28,993
where there would be a probability, n, 
of a gating particle

169
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:33,584
being in an activated state 
and, 1-n,

170
00:11:34,384 --> 00:11:40,410
that it's in the other impermeable state

171
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,103
and there would be rate constants, 
alpha and beta,

172
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:46,898
that would then go between the permissive

173
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:50,648
and the non-permissive state 
of this gating particle.

174
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:56,394
This then describes a first order 
differential equation for n across time

175
00:11:56,394 --> 00:12:00,841
with these rate constants 
and the rate constants, alpha and beta,

176
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:04,269
are of course in themselves, 
voltage-dependent.

177
00:12:04,269 --> 00:12:07,185
This is a voltage-dependent ion channel

178
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:13,501
and these empirical equations here 
then relate to expectations

179
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:15,850
from Boltzmann statistics.

180
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,292
This is the description of the 
Voltage-gated potassium conductance

181
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:25,030
that is voltage-activated, 
but has no inactivation.

182
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,880
The power of four for the activation gate 
is interesting

183
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,439
because we can think of n 
now as being the probability

184
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:42,480
that the S4 voltage sensing domain 
is in the open, permissive state.

185
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,232
We remember that the voltage-gated 
potassium channel

186
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:53,760
has four subunits, each of which 
has an S4 voltage sensing domain,

187
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,788
that's the domain that, 
inside the ion channel--

188
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:00,645
if this is now the voltage-gated 
potassium channel,

189
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:05,070
there's an S4 domain that 
you will remember as positively charged

190
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:11,680
that S4 voltage-sensing domain moves
depending upon the membrane potential

191
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,521
and it then causes an opening 
of the voltage gate.

192
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:21,206
The fact that there are four 
of these S4 gating domains

193
00:13:21,206 --> 00:13:24,464
might then relate to this 
fourth power here

194
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,275
and the movement, 
alpha and beta,

195
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,300
these rate constants, 
then might relate to the movement

196
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,032
of the S4 voltage sensing domain 
in four independent gating particles.

197
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,760
And so there could be 
a biophysical reality

198
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,480
to this empirical equation
that Hodgkin and Huxley

199
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,081
empirically fitted 
to their experimental data.

200
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:53,460
The 1952 description 
of the membrane currents,

201
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,900
in the Journal of Physiology, 
is a historic paper

202
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:02,480
which incorporates these equations 
that are quantitatively able to account

203
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,578
for the voltage-gated 
potassium conductance

204
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,799
and also for the voltage-gated 
sodium conductance

205
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,894
with a small modification.

206
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:14,756
The voltage-gated sodium conductances 
are more complicated

207
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:17,846
because they have both 
a voltage-gated activation

208
00:14:17,846 --> 00:14:20,090
and a voltage-gated inactivation.

209
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,485
And so the sodium current is, again,

210
00:14:22,485 --> 00:14:24,935
described relative to the 
reversal potential

211
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:27,052
and some maximal number

212
00:14:27,052 --> 00:14:30,534
indicating the number 
of sodium channels present

213
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:34,910
and there's then an activation 
and an inactivation term,

214
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:41,497
n being the activation particle, again, 
governed by alpha and beta rate constants,

215
00:14:41,497 --> 00:14:43,363
a first order differential equation

216
00:14:43,553 --> 00:14:48,120
and again, Boltzmann type statistics 
for the voltage-dependence

217
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,789
of these rate constants.

218
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,000
The same is true 
for the inactivation term,

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,176
now termed h,
and not raised to any power.

220
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,813
Hodgkin and Huxley 
fitted their experimental data

221
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:04,717
and obtained values that they inserted 
into these equations

222
00:15:04,717 --> 00:15:09,435
and were able, quantitatively, 
to reconstruct the action potential

223
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:12,680
on the basis of their voltage-clamp data.

224
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,791
So they began with voltage-clamp data 
looking at current-voltage relationships

225
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:24,898
and also the current with respect to time 
across different voltage steps.

226
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:30,157
They came up with equations, 
empirical equations,

227
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:33,560
modeling these currents 
and conductances

228
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,120
and they then went and placed 
those currents and conductances

229
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,646
inside a simple model of the cell 
incorporating capacitance,

230
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:43,782
sodium, potassium, 
and leak conductances

231
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:49,524
and by going through and integrating 
the membrane potential

232
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:52,399
across small steps in time,

233
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:55,862
they were able to compute 
the step by step changes

234
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:59,658
in membrane potential 
for different time steps

235
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,663
and were then able to iteratively 
go through and compute

236
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:08,661
the trajectory of the membrane potential 
during an action potential.

237
00:16:08,661 --> 00:16:10,917
The work is all the more heroic

238
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:14,321
because in those days, 
the digital computer didn't exist.

239
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:17,237
The description, however, 
was remarkable

240
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:21,295
and quantitatively agreed
with their experimental results.

241
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:26,130
They found that this upstroke 
of the action potential was driven

242
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,145
by the voltage-gated sodium conductance.

243
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:34,252
It's rapidly activated 
and has a very steep voltage activation

244
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:37,500
and so above some given 
threshold potential,

245
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,568
the voltage-gated sodium channel 
becomes activated,

246
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,538
drives an inward current,

247
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:46,540
that inward current 
causes more depolarization

248
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,639
and increases, once again, 
the sodium current

249
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,521
driving an explosive depolarization 
going towards

250
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:57,069
the sodium reversal potential.

251
00:16:57,069 --> 00:17:00,598
The sodium channels 
then rapidly inactivate,

252
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,885
up here at some 200 ┬╡s

253
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:07,679
and after which the voltage-gated 
potassium channel kicks in

254
00:17:07,969 --> 00:17:13,075
and drives the repolarization 
of the membrane potential back down

255
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:15,503
to its previous state.

256
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:21,114
The description of the action potential, 
by Hodgkin and Huxley,

257
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:23,484
was made on the squid giant axon,

258
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:25,800
and the ionic conditions, 
and temperature,

259
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,355
are very different from that seen 
in mammalian nervous system.

260
00:17:29,955 --> 00:17:33,078
Nonetheless, 
the Hodgkin-Huxley formulas

261
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:38,980
with very minor adjustments, 
turns out to make a good description

262
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,794
of action potentials 
that are being observed

263
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:45,184
in every living species to date.

264
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:49,226
The Hodgkin-Huxley model 
of the action potential

265
00:17:49,226 --> 00:17:52,276
is of enormous importance 
for neuroscience

266
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:55,871
because it provides the first 
quantitative description

267
00:17:55,871 --> 00:17:59,744
of an obvious and important 
biological phenomenon

268
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,442
in terms of biophysical mechanisms.

269
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:06,872
And it changed neuroscience to a new, 
quantitative science

270
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:09,407
that still continues today.

271
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,747
And thinking about 
the action potential,

272
00:18:12,747 --> 00:18:16,160
there's one particularly 
interesting point

273
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,208
the initiation point 
of the action potential.

274
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:24,960
What happens there at the initiation 
of the action potential?

275
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:30,054
Here, in this case, 
we define a threshold potential

276
00:18:30,054 --> 00:18:34,079
at which the rate of change 
of the velocity

277
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,989
of the membrane potential is maximal.

278
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:40,970
the point of maximal curvature 
in this experiment

279
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,987
is set to define 
the action potential threshold

280
00:18:43,987 --> 00:18:48,271
that's somewhere around 
-45 mV in this case.

281
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:53,723
Let's look and see what happens 
at membrane potentials close to threshold.

282
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:56,474
Let's imagine we're recording from a cell,

283
00:18:56,994 --> 00:19:00,462
we can inject some current into it,
and we can of course,

284
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:03,769
measure the potential difference 
across the cell.

285
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,579
Inject a little bit of current,
and when we inject current,

286
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,631
the membrane potential depolarizes,

287
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:19,229
we fill the capacitance of the cell
and depending upon the leak conductance,

288
00:19:19,229 --> 00:19:23,006
we'll reach a larger 
or smaller membrane potential.

289
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:27,452
And as we turn the current off, 
the capacitance discharges

290
00:19:27,452 --> 00:19:30,539
and will return to the resting value 
of membrane potential.

291
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:34,838
If we now inject a larger current,

292
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:39,209
we'll get a larger depolarization 
in the membrane.

293
00:19:41,459 --> 00:19:47,009
If this depolarization was just below 
action potential threshold,

294
00:19:47,009 --> 00:19:48,240
nothing happens.

295
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,650
We then inject a tiny bit more current

296
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,938
and now, we hit the 
action potential threshold

297
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:58,280
and an action potential is initiated.

298
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,003
What is the difference 
between here and here?

299
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:08,020
Somehow here, 
we've reached the autocatalytic step

300
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,452
where the voltage-gated 
sodium conductance

301
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:12,592
goes into that positive feedback loop

302
00:20:12,592 --> 00:20:17,360
where an increase in membrane potential 
causes an increase

303
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,007
in the sodium conductance and then 
we get this positive feedback loop

304
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:26,666
that drives the explosive rise 
of the action potential.

305
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:31,592
And the key step is really that 
the sodium current must be bigger

306
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:35,725
than other hyperpolarizing currents
like the potassium conductance.

307
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:40,398
And if that's the case, 
then we'll get into this explosive regime

308
00:20:40,398 --> 00:20:43,249
whether sodium conductance takes over.

309
00:20:45,459 --> 00:20:50,001
The sodium conductance that's available 
at any given time varies a little bit

310
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,912
because we know that 
sodium channels inactivate,

311
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,433
and so just after this depolarization

312
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:58,698
on the rising phase 
of the action potential

313
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:02,632
the sodium channels inactivate 
and they remain inactivated

314
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,352
for a period of some milliseconds.

315
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:07,223
And so there's an absolute 
refractory period

316
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:08,900
where for some milliseconds,

317
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,265
it's impossible 
to fire another action potential

318
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:14,887
because the voltage-gated sodium channels 
are inactivated.

319
00:21:15,247 --> 00:21:18,261
The voltage-gated sodium channels 
then recover

320
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:21,063
with a time constant 
of some milliseconds,

321
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:24,291
and so after, say, 5 ms or so,

322
00:21:24,841 --> 00:21:28,050
the most of the voltage-gated 
sodium current

323
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,219
is again, available, 
but perhaps not quite all of it

324
00:21:31,219 --> 00:21:35,065
and this means that the threshold 
is now increased a little bit

325
00:21:35,065 --> 00:21:37,532
because the number of sodium channels,

326
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:41,645
the total sodium current density 
that can be driven,

327
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:43,360
is actually a little bit lower.

328
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,504
And so, we need to be able 
to go a little bit more depolarized

329
00:21:47,504 --> 00:21:51,070
in order to activate more voltage gated 
sodium conductance

330
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:56,400
in order to get to that steep, 
rising phase of the action potential.

331
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,017
Action potential threshold 
can also vary in another way,

332
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:03,060
depending upon the trajectory 
of the membrane potential

333
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,340
towards threshold.

334
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:07,470
If we come with a very steep 
membrane potential trajectory--

335
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,279
this would be voltage, 
this would be time,

336
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,520
and we hit action potential threshold.

337
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,486
This action potential threshold is lower

338
00:22:17,486 --> 00:22:23,087
than if we came with a very flat 
membrane potential trajectory,

339
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:26,130
in which case AP threshold will be, 
perhaps,

340
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,921
a couple of millivolts higher.

341
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:33,588
And again, this is because of voltage 
dependent sodium channels inactivating.

342
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:35,611
We come very slowly towards threshold,

343
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:40,008
the voltage gated sodium channels 
have some time to inactivate

344
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,840
and that then means that there's 
less sodium channel that's available

345
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,385
to drive that explosive rise 
of the action potential.

346
00:22:47,845 --> 00:22:51,040
So action potential threshold 
isn't absolute.

347
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,215
It varies, perhaps, by a few millivolts.

348
00:22:54,215 --> 00:23:00,245
And so action potential threshold 
of around -45 mV is typical,

349
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:03,177
but we must remember 
that there are small variations

350
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:05,600
in that threshold that are possible.

351
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,200
So we've now learned about 
the ionic basis of the action potential,

352
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,226
the most important electrical signal 
in the brain.

353
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:19,561
The action potential 
is an all-or-none event

354
00:23:19,561 --> 00:23:22,865
initiated at a relatively 
well defined threshold,

355
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:25,600
somewhere around -45 mV,

356
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,157
the upstroke is driven by 
the steep voltage dependence

357
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,892
and rapid activation of voltage gated 
sodium channels,

358
00:23:32,892 --> 00:23:35,597
they inactivate 
after 200 microseconds

359
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:38,340
and then the voltage gated 
potassium conductance takes over

360
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,681
and repolarizes the cell 
back to negative potentials.

361
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:47,080
Action potentials show some diversity.

362
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,230
So although an action potential 
is an all-or-none event in a given cell,

363
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,065
there's some differences 
between action potentials

364
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,265
across different cell types.

365
00:23:56,265 --> 00:24:00,002
And I'd like to illustrate that 
by an example of two neurons

366
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:05,388
that are recorded next to each other 
in the neocortex of the mouse.

367
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:09,544
The red cell here is an inhibitory cell

368
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:13,023
that will tend to inhibit its neighbors

369
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:17,280
in terms of the interactions 
of the neuronal networks.

370
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,918
So this cell has an inhibitory influence 
on its surrounding cells

371
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,190
whereas this black cell 
is an excitatory cell

372
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,978
that tends to excite 
other neurons nearby,

373
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:32,487
and this one will then try to drive 
action potentials

374
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:34,481
in other nearby cells

375
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:38,045
and this would try to prevent 
action potentials from being driven

376
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,841
in other nearby cells.

377
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:45,991
If a current is injected into the cell, 
action potentials are fired

378
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,914
and they're fired 
at a very high frequency.

379
00:24:49,304 --> 00:24:52,916
The excitatory cell also fires 
action potentials,

380
00:24:52,916 --> 00:24:57,934
but you can see that the rate 
of action potentials is much lower.

381
00:24:58,424 --> 00:25:01,981
And as we increase current, 
we can certainly increase the frequency

382
00:25:01,981 --> 00:25:04,984
of action potential discharge 
here a little bit,

383
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:08,522
but it's never going to get to the 
action potential firing rates

384
00:25:08,522 --> 00:25:11,910
of this inhibitory neuron 
that can fire several hundred hertz,

385
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,744
more than ten times what's possible 
for this excitatory neuron.

386
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:21,232
So there are differences in the 
action potential discharge patterns

387
00:25:21,232 --> 00:25:23,760
that different types of cells can have.

388
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,470
If we zoom in on these individual 
action potentials in these trains,

389
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,071
we'll see that the wave form 
of these action potentials

390
00:25:33,071 --> 00:25:34,896
is also rather different.

391
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:40,216
The upstroke of the action potential 
appears to be relatively similar.

392
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:44,277
It's very fast in both the excitatory 
and the inhibitory cell

393
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:49,720
and of course is driven by the activation 
of the voltage gated sodium conductance.

394
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,433
The repolarization, however,

395
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,909
is rather different 
in these two cell types.

396
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:58,640
In the inhibitory cell, 
we have a very rapid repolarization.

397
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,583
The action potential wave form 
lasts some half millisecond or so

398
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:09,612
and an expression of a specific 
voltage-gated potassium channel

399
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:15,042
contributes to the rapid repolarization 
of this action potential wave form.

400
00:26:15,702 --> 00:26:18,723
Excitatory cells 
have a different potassium channel

401
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:21,768
and here the wave form 
is almost twice as long,

402
00:26:21,768 --> 00:26:24,609
being about 1 ms in duration.

403
00:26:24,969 --> 00:26:29,630
The rapid repolarization of the 
action potential in the inhibitory cell

404
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,395
means that the voltage-gated 
sodium channels

405
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:37,238
can deinactivate more rapidly 
and that then allows this high rate

406
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:39,294
of firing of the inhibitory cell

407
00:26:39,294 --> 00:26:41,651
which is simply not possible 
in the excitatory cell

408
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:46,299
in part, because the availability 
of sodium channels simply takes longer

409
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:49,749
and so it's more difficult 
to get the cell to fire again

410
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,599
and we need longer delays 
to deinactivate the sodium channels

411
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:54,840
in the excitatory cell.

412
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:59,449
And so the expression of different 
Voltage-gated ion channels,

413
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:02,388
and of course different ion channels 
in general,

414
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:06,286
will contribute to different patterns 
of action potential discharge

415
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:08,040
in different neurons.

416
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,846
So in this lesson, 
we've learned about

417
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:14,077
the most important 
electrical signal in the brain,

418
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,601
the action potential.

419
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:20,429
The action potential is an 
all-or-none signal that's initiated

420
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:23,470
at a relatively well-defined 
threshold voltage

421
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,985
and once that threshold is crossed,

422
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:29,905
then the action potential 
rapidly depolarizes

423
00:27:29,905 --> 00:27:34,360
to something close to 
+40 mV and then repolarizes again

424
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,391
back down to something like -50 mV.

425
00:27:37,391 --> 00:27:41,717
All of that takes place 
in the space of about 1 ms.

426
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:45,920
The upstroke 
of the action potential is driven

427
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,360
by the positive feedback 
voltage-gated activation

428
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,504
of the voltage-gated sodium channels,

429
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:56,259
they then inactivate 
after a couple of hundred microseconds,

430
00:27:56,259 --> 00:28:00,934
the membrane potential is now reached 
close to the reversal potential of sodium

431
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:04,968
and it's then repolarized 
by the delayed activation

432
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:08,666
of the potassium conductance 
that brings membrane potential

433
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,319
back down to negative values.

434
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:16,752
The all-or-none digital signal 
of the action potential

435
00:28:16,892 --> 00:28:18,520
is a reliable signal.

436
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,760
It's one that's useful for communication 
across long distances

437
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:26,424
and the spread of that action potential 
across the neuronal processes

438
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:29,053
is what we'll look at in the next lesson.
