1
00:00:04,224 --> 00:00:05,892
In the last lesson we began

2
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:08,400
to think about how neurons
talk to each other

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,245
through the process of chemical
synaptic transmission.

4
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:16,337
An action potential is initiated
at the axon initial segment.

5
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:20,663
It travels down the axon,
reaches pre-synaptic specializations

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:22,954
where calcium influx occurs,

7
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,978
and that drives
neurotransmitter release.

8
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:29,043
That, in turn, acts upon receptors
in the post-synaptic membrane,

9
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,538
driving post-synaptic potentials.

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:35,463
In this lesson we're going to take
a closer look at what happens

11
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:38,126
inside the pre-synaptic specialization.

12
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,325
How can the action potential
drive neurotransmitter release

13
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:44,469
on such a fast timescale.

14
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:48,430
There are three key events
that need to take place

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,617
in the pre-synaptic specialization:

16
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:54,591
first, synaptic vesicles
full of neurotransmitter

17
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:58,493
need to dock and be primed
to be release-ready

18
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:02,707
in immediate apposition
to the pre-synaptic plasma membrane.

19
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:09,370
The vesicle then waits until
an action potential invades the terminal.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,767
That, then, drives an increase
in calcium concentration

21
00:01:12,767 --> 00:01:18,099
and then in the third step,
the increase in calcium drives fusion

22
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:21,106
of the vesicular membrane
with the plasma membrane,

23
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:24,895
thus driving exocytosis
of the neurotransmitter

24
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,705
inside the vesicle.

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,893
Let's begin by thinking
about how calcium rises occur

26
00:01:31,893 --> 00:01:33,721
in the presynaptic bouton.

27
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:38,080
The action potential
is traveling down the axon,

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,767
it reaches swelling where there are
many synaptic vesicles present.

29
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,817
In addition to these synaptic vesicles,

30
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:50,448
there's also a high concentration
of voltage-gated calcium channels.

31
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,534
Voltage-gated calcium channels are similar

32
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:56,714
to voltage-gated sodium
and potassium channels,

33
00:01:56,714 --> 00:01:59,921
except they have
a high permeability for calcium,

34
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:03,016
rather than for any other cation.

35
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:10,089
The voltage-gated calcium channels
also have a similar voltage dependence,

36
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:16,526
so if this is our membrane potential
across the plasma membrane and the bouton,

37
00:02:16,526 --> 00:02:20,604
and this is the open probability
of a calcium channel,

38
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:24,664
then at hyper-polarized potentials,
the open probability is low,

39
00:02:24,664 --> 00:02:29,849
and then as we get more positive
than around -40 mV

40
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,418
the calcium channels begin to open

41
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:35,216
and they can then let calcium
flood into the cell.

42
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,700
Remember, there's about 2 millimolar
of calcium in the extracellular space,

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,729
and at resting conditions, there's about
100 nanomolar of free calcium ions

44
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:50,076
that are present inside the cytosol.

45
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:53,273
So, there's a strong gradient
for calcium to enter

46
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,228
when the open probability
of the calcium channel

47
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:58,935
increases at depolarized potentials.

48
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,617
So let's see what happens
when an action potential

49
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:06,290
invades this pre-synaptic specialization?

50
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:11,094
Here we see the action potential
in a nerve terminal

51
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:18,264
it has a duration of something
like 500 microseconds or one millisecond.

52
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:21,850
The upstroke, as we know,
is driven by the activation

53
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,217
of the voltage-gated
sodium conductances.

54
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:28,578
The voltage-gated potassium conductances
drive the repolarization

55
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:32,760
and smaller than those
sodium and potassium currents,

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,977
also a calcium current is found
in the presynaptic terminal.

57
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,178
It's not activated as rapidly

58
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:43,322
as the extremely fast voltage-gated
sodium conductances,

59
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:46,727
so there's some delay before
the calcium current turns on.

60
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:49,562
It turns out that the peak
of the calcium current

61
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,867
is somewhere on the falling phase
of the action potential,

62
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,727
so delayed some hundred
microseconds or so

63
00:03:55,727 --> 00:03:59,382
from the peak and the onset
of the action potential.

64
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:04,211
This influx of calcium,
the calcium current flow

65
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,556
through the voltage-gated calcium channels
then increases the calcium concentration

66
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:12,158
in the immediate vicinity
of the synaptic vesicles,

67
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:14,692
and it's that increase
in calcium concentration

68
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:17,562
that directly drives vesicle fusion.

69
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:21,572
It turns out that there's
an extremely steep dependence

70
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:25,669
upon calcium concentration
and neurotransmitter release rates.

71
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:32,531
In this graph, which has logarithmic axes
in both the X and Y scales,

72
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:35,091
so it's a log-log plot,

73
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:40,088
you see a very steep dependence
upon the cytosolic calcium concentration

74
00:04:40,088 --> 00:04:44,268
inside the nerve terminal,
and the release rate,

75
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:47,131
the number of vesicles
being released per millisecond.

76
00:04:48,057 --> 00:04:51,515
You'll see that there's a range
of calcium concentrations here

77
00:04:51,515 --> 00:04:54,311
that goes from one
to ten micromolar.

78
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,076
This is a tenfold increase
in calcium concentration,

79
00:04:57,076 --> 00:05:00,803
whereas on the Y axis, you'll see
that the release rate increases

80
00:05:00,803 --> 00:05:02,893
by a factor of 10,000.

81
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,333
You can plot a line through data points,

82
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,804
and it turns out that there's
a nice linear relationship

83
00:05:09,804 --> 00:05:13,793
between calcium concentration
and the vesicle release rate,

84
00:05:13,793 --> 00:05:16,157
and it has a slope of around four.

85
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,274
That's the so-called Hill coefficient,
and that tells us

86
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:22,804
that if there's a tenfold
increase in calcium, then there's

87
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:26,184
a ten to the power of four-fold
increase in release rate.

88
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:30,733
Ten times calcium,
10,000-fold increased release rate.

89
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,494
Here's the relationship then.

90
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:37,315
The release rate goes as a fourth power
of the cytosolic calcium concentration

91
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:39,203
in the nerve terminal.

92
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:44,107
So increases in calcium irrespective
of action potential or membrane potential

93
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:49,079
drive neurotransmitter release
at resting calcium concentrations

94
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,897
of around 100 nanomolar,
the release rate is very, very small.

95
00:05:53,897 --> 00:05:55,178
It's nearly negligible.

96
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:57,879
There is still a small amount of vesicles

97
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,642
that are fusing spontaneously,
even at resting levels.

98
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:04,883
But that release rate increases
very dramatically

99
00:06:04,883 --> 00:06:06,317
in the presence of calcium,

100
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:11,390
so calcium is really the direct signal
that drives vesicle fusion,

101
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,741
and it does so in an extremely
steep dependence

102
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:18,841
where small increases in calcium
cause huge changes

103
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:21,200
in neurotransmitter release rates.

104
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,028
In order for the calcium
to be able to work,

105
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:28,840
there must be calcium-sensitive
binding proteins

106
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,278
that bind the calcium and translate that

107
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:34,535
into the exocytosis
of the synaptic vesicle.

108
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:41,294
In addition, for the process of exocytosis
to occur on the 100 microsecond timescale,

109
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,744
there must be an extremely
efficient machinery

110
00:06:44,744 --> 00:06:50,399
that's able to couple the calcium signal
to vesicle membrane fusion events.

111
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,484
Here we see a schematic drawing
of a synaptic vesicle

112
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:59,543
that's in immediate apposition
to the presynaptic plasma membrane.

113
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,504
So these two lines here represent

114
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,376
the phospholipid bilayer
of the plasma membrane

115
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,951
and the two black lines 
here around the vesicle

116
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,376
are the phospholipid bilayers
of the synaptic vesicle.

117
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,792
The membrane of the synaptic vesicle

118
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:15,363
is almost identical
in terms of its composition

119
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:19,872
to the membrane phospholipids
of the plasma membrane.

120
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:25,267
The synaptic vesicle with a diameter
of around 40 nanometers

121
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:28,864
is brought into close apposition
with the plasma membrane

122
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,487
through the action
of three important proteins

123
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:35,375
that form the so-called <i>SNARE complex</i>.

124
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:39,523
The SNARE complex
is composed of <i>synaptobrevin</i>

125
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:42,376
which is a so-called vesicular SNARE;

126
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:45,500
<i>syntaxin</i>, which is
a plasma membrane SNARE;

127
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,253
and <i>SNAP-25</i> that's
closely associated to syntaxin.

128
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:55,042
Through binding to each other
with very strong strength,

129
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:58,681
they pull the plasma membrane
and the vesicle membrane

130
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:01,436
into extremely close apposition
with each other.

131
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:07,104
It may, in fact, be that there's
already a pre-bound

132
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:10,193
where the inner leaflet
of the plasma membrane

133
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:13,280
is already in continuum
with the outer leaflet

134
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,385
of the plasma membrane
of the synaptic vesicle membrane.

135
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:24,192
So this would then be
the release-competent primed vesicle

136
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,760
ready to be released.

137
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,485
It's brought into close contact
with the plasma membrane

138
00:08:28,485 --> 00:08:30,992
through the action of the SNARE complex,

139
00:08:30,992 --> 00:08:33,863
and it's waiting
for an action potential to come.

140
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:36,143
The action potential invades,

141
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,192
opens the voltage-gated calcium channel,

142
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:44,793
calcium floods in, and calcium then binds
to the calcium sensor synaptotagmin

143
00:08:44,793 --> 00:08:47,475
and other vesicle-associated protein.

144
00:08:48,072 --> 00:08:51,159
Synaptotagmin has
five binding sites for calcium

145
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:56,192
and when calcium binds to it, it changes
its conformation quite dramatically.

146
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:59,502
It changes the way it interacts
with the SNARE proteins

147
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:03,118
and perhaps also with the phospholipids
in the immediate environment.

148
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:08,560
The action of calcium on synaptotagmin
opens the fusion pore,

149
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,876
and so, there's an opening that's created

150
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:14,111
where the inner leaflet
of the synaptic vesicle membrane

151
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:17,668
becomes continuous with the outer leaflet
of the plasma membrane,

152
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:21,707
and that creates a pore
where the contents of the synaptic vesicle

153
00:09:21,707 --> 00:09:25,906
are now in continuum
with the extracellular space.

154
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:31,707
There's a diffusion 
of the neurotransmitter across the cleft,

155
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:34,805
and it can then bind
to the post-synaptic receptors

156
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,955
driving post-synaptic potentials.

157
00:09:37,388 --> 00:09:42,636
So the core elements in terms
of molecular mechanisms of fusion

158
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:45,780
are the priming and docking of the event

159
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,972
setting up the vesicle
through the SNARE protein

160
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:49,642
so that it's release-competent,

161
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,374
and synaptotagmin then acts
as a calcium sensor

162
00:09:53,374 --> 00:09:56,606
that converts the action potential
and calcium influx

163
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:59,603
into the vesicle fusion event itself,

164
00:09:59,603 --> 00:10:03,197
and all of this occurs
on the microsecond timescale.

165
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,439
After the neurotransmitter

166
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,189
has been released
from the synaptic vesicle,

167
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:11,087
the synaptic vesicle is empty,

168
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,711
and there's no
neurotransmitter left in it.

169
00:10:14,032 --> 00:10:17,377
Before that synaptic vesicle
can be useful again

170
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:19,507
in terms of releasing neurotransmitter,

171
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:21,342
it must then be refilled.

172
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,000
The refilling process of synaptic vesicles

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,720
occurs through
an ATP dependent process.

174
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,668
A so-called <i>vacuolar proton pump</i> an ATPase

175
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:36,792
uses ATP to pump protons, that is,
charged hydrogen atoms,

176
00:10:36,792 --> 00:10:38,732
into the vesicle.

177
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:42,112
It then becomes acidic
inside the synaptic vesicle,

178
00:10:42,112 --> 00:10:44,497
and it also becomes positively charged.

179
00:10:44,497 --> 00:10:47,647
And so, just like there's
a membrane potential

180
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,881
across the plasma membrane,

181
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:54,842
there's also a vesicular potential
across the synaptic vesicle membrane,

182
00:10:55,032 --> 00:10:57,538
and it's a combination
of the acidification

183
00:10:57,538 --> 00:10:59,430
and the electrical potential here

184
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,151
that gives energy for the vesicular
neurotransmitter transporters

185
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:07,493
that then bring neurotransmitter
inside the synaptic vesicle.

186
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:10,235
So, this is a glutamatergic synapse,
there would be

187
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,367
a vesicular glutamate transporter,

188
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:17,161
VGlut present on
on individual synaptic vesicles

189
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,205
that then sucks glutamate in

190
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:22,993
and concentrates glutamate
inside the synaptic vesicle.

191
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,239
When the vesicle is refilled,

192
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:29,820
it then needs to move it
into these sites where it can be released.

193
00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:32,474
It needs to interact
with the SNARE complex.

194
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,547
The SNARE complex needs
to bring the membranes

195
00:11:34,547 --> 00:11:36,234
into close apposition for each other

196
00:11:36,234 --> 00:11:38,747
and will then be ready
for another action potential

197
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:41,700
to invade, and release
neurotransmitter.

198
00:11:41,977 --> 00:11:45,490
There are various ways in which
this synaptic vesicle cycle

199
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,199
is thought to work.

200
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:50,093
One way is signaled here.

201
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:52,897
This is a so-called
<i>Kiss and Run</i> exocytosis

202
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:56,198
where there's a brief fusion event,
a fusion pore opens,

203
00:11:56,198 --> 00:11:59,396
the contents are diffusing out,

204
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:04,829
and the empty vesicle then closes,
moves aside a little bit,

205
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:07,997
maybe some nanometers away
from the plasma membrane,

206
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:11,057
refuels with neurotransmitter,
and then re-docks.

207
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:14,356
That's called Kiss and Run exocytosis.

208
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,093
And as a possibility, there's
so-called <i>Kiss and Stay</i> exocytosis

209
00:12:20,093 --> 00:12:24,764
where after the vesicle
is fused, it simply reseals

210
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:30,123
and remains docked and simply
replenishes its neurotransmitter content

211
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,378
while remaining 
in a docked conformation.

212
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:39,049
Finally, another possibility
is that this fusion pore enlarges

213
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,779
and the membrane gradually

214
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,080
simply becomes part
of the plasma membrane

215
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,169
so the vesicle fuses completely
and then becomes part

216
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,605
of the plasma membrane
from where it can then be endocytosed

217
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,969
in a clathrin-dependent manner
and then enters into the vesicle cycle.

218
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,782
The fastest forms of exocytosis
and recycling are the so-called

219
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,282
<i>Kiss and Run</i> and <i>Kiss and Stay</i>
types of vesicle recycling

220
00:13:06,282 --> 00:13:10,310
which can occur on the
50 to 100 millisecond timescale.

221
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,547
And so, the whole process here
might occur very rapidly

222
00:13:13,547 --> 00:13:18,031
and help sustain fast rates
of neurotransmitter release if necessary.

223
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,184
So we've now seen
some of the key steps

224
00:13:21,184 --> 00:13:24,411
that are able to sustain
neurotransmitter release

225
00:13:24,411 --> 00:13:29,206
at these extremely fast rates
of 100 microseconds or so

226
00:13:29,206 --> 00:13:32,275
between the invasion
of the action potential into the bouton

227
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,405
and the release of the neurotransmitter.

228
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:38,341
The key steps are the priming
and docking of the vesicle

229
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:43,406
so that it's ready to react in case
of calcium concentration increases.

230
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:49,140
So, the SNARE complex forms
a key feature in an ATP dependent process

231
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,123
that brings the membranes
of the synaptic vesicle

232
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,763
and the presynaptic membrane
into close apposition with each other.

233
00:13:56,154 --> 00:14:01,799
The vesicle then waits there release-ready
until a calcium signal appears

234
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:05,804
that's driven through the activation
of voltage-gated calcium channels

235
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:10,276
driven by the voltage depolarization
of the action potential

236
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,322
as it invades the bouton.

237
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:16,756
The calcium binds that cell
to synaptotagmin,

238
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:21,186
and it's that change in conformation
of the synaptotagmin protein

239
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:25,192
that allows the vesicle to fuse
with the plasma membrane

240
00:14:25,192 --> 00:14:27,586
releasing the neurotransmitter content.

241
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:32,257
Now, it should be remembered
that the exocytosis,

242
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:35,751
the release of a vesicle,
is a stochastic process.

243
00:14:36,411 --> 00:14:39,924
A given docked
and release-ready vesicle

244
00:14:39,924 --> 00:14:43,323
may have something like
a 10% chance of being released

245
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:46,370
when an action potential
invades the nerve terminal.

246
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,469
This means that synaptic
transmission is unreliable,

247
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:53,930
but it also means that the process
can be highly regulated.

248
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,445
We can increase the efficacy
of the synaptic transmission by, say,

249
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:01,164
increasing the amount
of calcium influx into the terminal

250
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:04,355
or we can also decrease the amount
of neurotransmitter release.

251
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:07,573
It's that ability to regulate
synaptic transmission

252
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,154
that's thought to be extremely important.

253
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:12,056
And so, in the next slides
we'll take a little look

254
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:15,395
at how one might regulate
neurotransmitter release.

255
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:18,098
The first, and perhaps most obvious way

256
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:20,352
in which we can control
neurotransmitter release

257
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,322
is by controlling the amount of calcium
that enters into the nerve terminal.

258
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:28,646
You'll remember that we have
an extremely steep dependence of calcium

259
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:32,556
where if calcium goes
from one to ten micromolar,

260
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:38,033
then we go from release rates
of 0.1 to 1,000

261
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:42,030
so a factor of 10,000
increase in calcium

262
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:45,359
and typically during an action potential
invading the nerve terminal,

263
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:50,253
we think that we're reaching something
like 10 micromolar of calcium.

264
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:54,629
So by increasing or decreasing
the amount of calcium we can also

265
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,355
increase or decrease the amount
of neurotransmitter being released.

266
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:00,873
There's an extremely steep dependence

267
00:16:00,873 --> 00:16:03,379
that will go with the fourth
power of calcium.

268
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,777
So small changes in calcium can give rise
to very big changes in the amount released

269
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:10,351
from the presynaptic terminal.

270
00:16:10,852 --> 00:16:15,253
So how do we change the amount of calcium
that comes into the presynaptic terminal?

271
00:16:15,578 --> 00:16:17,335
Well, there are two obvious ways.

272
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:19,786
We can change
the action potential waveform.

273
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:25,556
So if the typical action potential
has a duration of 500 microseconds,

274
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:30,198
the calcium influx occurs
during the repolarization

275
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,456
and by the time the membrane
potential is hyperpolarized,

276
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:35,803
the calcium influx has come to an end.

277
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:39,828
So, by increasing the duration
of the action potential

278
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,252
we can then increase the amount
of calcium influx that occurs,

279
00:16:44,252 --> 00:16:47,284
and thus, we increase the amount
of neurotransmitter release.

280
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,742
That can be done by regulating
potassium channels.

281
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,327
So potassium channels govern
the repolarization phase

282
00:16:52,327 --> 00:16:53,802
of the action potential,

283
00:16:53,802 --> 00:16:57,613
and if we simply reduce
the amount of potassium current,

284
00:16:57,613 --> 00:17:00,343
then we'll delay
the action potential waveform

285
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:04,286
and we'll increase calcium influx
into the presynaptic terminal,

286
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,534
and hence, increase
neurotransmitter release.

287
00:17:06,772 --> 00:17:09,202
That's one way in which
neurotransmitter release

288
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,309
is really being regulated physiologically.

289
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,478
Another obvious way is by acting

290
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:17,335
on the pre-synaptic
calcium channels themselves.

291
00:17:17,508 --> 00:17:19,610
Increasing the open probability

292
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,667
or increasing the voltage dependence
of these calcium channels

293
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,806
will, of course, increase
the amount of calcium

294
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:27,591
that floods into the 
pre-synaptic membrane,

295
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,736
and that's another way that's used
heavily inside the nervous system

296
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:34,139
to regulate neurotransmitter release.

297
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,988
Other possibilities in terms
of regulating neurotransmitter release

298
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:43,096
are, of course, how much neurotransmitter
is actually inside a synaptic vesicle.

299
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:47,702
That's controlled in part
by the proton pumps

300
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,535
that give rise to the gradients that drive
the uptake of the neurotransmitter

301
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:54,063
into the synaptic vesicle,

302
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:57,308
and so, you can change
the efficacy of the proton pumping

303
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,069
or the efficacy
of the neurotransmitter transporters.

304
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:05,535
Both of those are used to some extent
to regulate neurotransmitter content

305
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,460
inside synaptic vesicles.

306
00:18:07,601 --> 00:18:09,032
And although synaptic vesicles

307
00:18:09,032 --> 00:18:12,770
typically have a size of something
like 40 nanometers,

308
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,928
there's also some variance.

309
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:17,404
So there are some bigger vesicles
and some smaller vesicles,

310
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:19,862
so that's another way
in which one can control

311
00:18:19,862 --> 00:18:22,092
the amount of neurotransmitter
that's being released.

312
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:23,928
Presumably, a big vesicle would have

313
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,937
more neurotransmitter content
than a small vesicle.

314
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,652
Another key way in which one can release
different amounts of neurotransmitter

315
00:18:32,652 --> 00:18:35,823
is by controlling the amount of vesicles

316
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,337
that are being released 
in response to calcium.

317
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,702
So the complex

318
00:18:42,702 --> 00:18:46,545
machinery associated
with the docked synaptic vesicle

319
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,970
here and the calcium channel

320
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,557
can then change its composition
in terms of what proteins are present,

321
00:18:53,557 --> 00:18:56,169
what isoforms, there are many
different isoforms

322
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,071
of these different proteins,
so for example,

323
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:01,978
synaptotagmin has something
like 15 different genes that code for it

324
00:19:01,978 --> 00:19:05,390
and they're expressed
differentially at different synapses.

325
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,213
Equally, there can be
phophorylation events,

326
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,555
so that can change the structure
of these different proteins,

327
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:13,335
and maybe even
the physical arrangement,

328
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:17,818
whether the calcium channels are close
to the synaptic vesicles or far away

329
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:22,051
can make a big difference to whether
the calcium is likely to drive

330
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:24,336
a lot of neurotransmitter release

331
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:27,167
or whether the probability
will rather be lower.

332
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,336
So we can change the release probability
and its sensitivity, of course, to calcium

333
00:19:33,336 --> 00:19:34,967
and that's a key way

334
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:38,229
in which neurotransmitter release
is regulated physiologically.

335
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,521
Equally, of course, it's possible
to change the number of vesicles

336
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:46,096
that are present
on the pre-synaptic specialization.

337
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:49,465
So if we only have
one vesicle that's there

338
00:19:49,465 --> 00:19:54,350
and it has a 10% chance of being released
when an action potential invades,

339
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,245
we can also put in
more synaptic vesicles.

340
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:00,200
We can simply dock
more and more synaptic vesicles,

341
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,704
put them close to calcium channels,

342
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:06,011
and each one of these might then
have a 10% chance

343
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:09,611
of being released in response
to an action potential,

344
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:13,085
and clearly, the more vesicles we have
that are in the release-ready state,

345
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:16,246
the more likely we are to get
neurotransmitter release,

346
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,642
and large amounts of it,

347
00:20:17,642 --> 00:20:20,552
when an action potential
invades the presynaptic terminal.

348
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:25,411
So we've now seen
the key events responsible

349
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,780
for coupling an action potential
to neurotransmitter release.

350
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,209
The depolarization of the bouton
causes the activation

351
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:35,255
of voltage-gated calcium channels

352
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:38,486
on the timescale
of 100 microseconds or so

353
00:20:38,486 --> 00:20:41,012
from action potential invasion,

354
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:46,701
calcium rises in the immediate vicinity
of the synaptic vesicles

355
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,644
that are release-ready and competent.

356
00:20:49,644 --> 00:20:52,444
The calcium binds to synaptotagmin,

357
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:56,647
five calcium ions bind
to a synaptotagmin molecule,

358
00:20:56,647 --> 00:21:02,693
high affinity, and they then drive
the fusion of synaptic vesicle membrane

359
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,934
with the pre-synaptic membrane.

360
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:09,174
The whole process involves
some 50 or so proteins,

361
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:13,689
all of which play an important role
in synaptic release.

362
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:17,888
They can be regulated
in a large number of interesting ways

363
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,811
that are physiologically important.

364
00:21:20,068 --> 00:21:23,610
In the next few lessons
we'll consider in more detail

365
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,811
how the neurotransmitter release
is regulated by the action

366
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:30,843
of other neurotransmitters
acting on the nerve terminal,

367
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:34,412
and also by their recent history
of action potential firing

368
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,473
in that nerve terminal.
