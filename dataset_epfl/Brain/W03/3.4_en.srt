1
00:00:04,154 --> 00:00:05,810
In the last lesson, we learned

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,431
that there's a certain context-dependence
to synaptic transmission.

3
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:12,482
The effect of an action potential

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:15,621
and its coupling
to neurotransmitter release

5
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:20,277
depends heavily upon the recent
activity of that axon.

6
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:25,383
Now in this lesson, we're going to learn
that there's another form

7
00:00:25,383 --> 00:00:28,416
of context-dependence
to neurotransmission:

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,086
that of the neurotransmitter content
of the extracellular space.

9
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,795
It turns out that the brain is made

10
00:00:37,795 --> 00:00:41,215
of about 20 percent or so
of extracellular space.

11
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,467
And that, then, means

12
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,193
that neurotransmitters
released from one bouton

13
00:00:46,193 --> 00:00:51,129
can diffuse relatively long distances
and impinge upon membranes

14
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,501
that are relatively far
from that synapse.

15
00:00:55,413 --> 00:00:58,314
Also, interestingly, there are receptors

16
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:00,938
that are present
on the presynaptic boutons

17
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:05,231
so that neurotransmitters
diffusing from other boutons

18
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,399
can impinge upon these receptors,

19
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,230
and that, then, can affect
the release process

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,160
at this synapse that we're considering.

21
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:17,963
This process
of presynaptic modulation, then,

22
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:20,720
is what we'll be considering
in this video.

23
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,361
The receptors that are most relevant

24
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:27,037
in terms of regulating presynaptic
neurotransmitter release

25
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:30,636
are the so-called
<i>metabotropic receptors</i>.

26
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:33,274
These are transmembrane proteins,

27
00:01:33,274 --> 00:01:37,181
so they have alpha helices
just like the ion channels;

28
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,236
but, rather than forming
directly an ion channel,

29
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:42,480
they signal through to other proteins

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,933
that are located
on the intercellular side.

31
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:48,972
And so, if this is a piece
of the plasma membrane,

32
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:50,350
and this is the outside,

33
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,066
and this is the inside,

34
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,065
then here, in the extracellular space,

35
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,993
we have neurotransmitters
that are diffusing around.

36
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,581
Some of these neurotransmitters

37
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:03,858
might then bind to one of these
seven-transmembrane receptors;

38
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:09,599
and so, they have seven parts
that cross the plasma membrane.

39
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,566
These are the alpha helices.

40
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:14,806
When an agonist binds to that receptor,

41
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:18,956
the protein changes
its conformational structure

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,439
but rather than being
an intrinsic ion channel,

43
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,333
it then acts upon
an intracellular protein,

44
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:29,504
a so-called <i>GTP-binding</i> protein,
or a G protein.

45
00:02:30,348 --> 00:02:37,760
The G protein, upon receptor activation,
binds GTP; then, it becomes activated.

46
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,438
It splits into two parts,
an alpha and a beta/gamma part.

47
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:44,992
They can then diffuse inside the cell

48
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:50,625
and, in part, they might act
directly upon ion channels.

49
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,063
And in part, these G proteins

50
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:57,524
might act upon other enzymes
that are present inside the cell

51
00:02:57,524 --> 00:03:01,162
that then might activate
downstream signalling cascades.

52
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,889
And so, one of the enzymes
that G proteins act upon

53
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,470
is an enzyme called phospholipase C
that splits into two parts:

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:14,091
one part that releases
inositol trisphosphate

55
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:18,648
that then goes on to release calcium
from intracellular calcium stores,

56
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,874
and another part
that releases diacylglycerol

57
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:26,346
that then activates protein kinase C.

58
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:30,195
Or, you might activate
the enzyme adenylate cyclase,

59
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:33,794
and that might increase
the level of cyclic AMP.

60
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:36,951
And there are many,
many other signalling pathways

61
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,841
giving rise to different
second messenger systems

62
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:42,936
that affect both
the structure of nerve cells

63
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:48,284
and can also even effect the gene
expression patterns of these cells.

64
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:53,958
And so, metabotropic receptors have
very diverse functions inside neurons,

65
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:58,431
and they can, therefore,
be extremely useful.

66
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:01,712
They do, however,
operate on a slower timescale

67
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:05,176
than our ligand-gated ion channels
that we've been thinking about

68
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:07,549
in terms of synaptic
transmission up to now,

69
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,384
where we'd have a presynaptic terminal
releasing neurotransmitter,

70
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,968
acting directly
on ligand-gated ion channels

71
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:17,382
to create post-synaptic potentials.

72
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:21,079
Now we're thinking
about the diffusion of messengers

73
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,052
that in itself is occurring
on a longer length scale,

74
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:29,322
but also on a longer time scale,
because diffusion takes some time;

75
00:04:29,322 --> 00:04:33,094
and there's, then, multiple steps
in the signalling process.

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,623
First, we need to activate a receptor
that then activates a G protein;

77
00:04:36,702 --> 00:04:38,368
the G protein needs to diffuse;

78
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:42,320
and then it might activate
secondary messenger signalling cascades.

79
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,165
And so, the whole process
downstream of metabotropic receptors

80
00:04:46,165 --> 00:04:50,283
probably requires at least
some tens of milliseconds;

81
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:55,100
-- probably, we're thinking, more than
a hundred milliseconds, in most cases --

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,683
and the effects, then,
can also be longer-lasting:

83
00:04:57,683 --> 00:05:02,562
they can last for many seconds
and even, in some cases, hours.

84
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,036
So, the metabotropic
receptor signalling pathways

85
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,327
are extremely useful, very diverse.

86
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,519
They couple to many
different signalling pathways,

87
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,343
and they operate on longer length scales,

88
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:17,629
because the diffusion,
messengers to these receptors,

89
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:22,054
and also on longer time scales,
because of the greater complexity

90
00:05:22,054 --> 00:05:25,938
of the intracellular signalling machinery
that's been activated.

91
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:29,470
There are, of course,
a large number of targets

92
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,855
that we've already begun to think about

93
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,872
in terms of the coupling
of the action potential

94
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,991
to neurotransmitter release.

95
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:40,910
So, if we imagine this metabotropic
signalling pathway

96
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,029
from the seven-transmembrane receptor,

97
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:47,558
activating a G protein,
activating other enzymatic cascades,

98
00:05:47,558 --> 00:05:49,824
one place where it could interact with

99
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:52,404
is with the action potential
waveform itself.

100
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:55,348
We can imagine a fast sodium spike,

101
00:05:55,348 --> 00:06:00,198
and the G protein might inactivate
potassium conductances,

102
00:06:00,198 --> 00:06:04,358
thus giving rise to a broader
action potential and more calcium influx,

103
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,910
and thus enhancing
neurotransmitter release.

104
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:10,960
Or, the G protein might directly act
on the calcium channel

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,113
and thus alter the amount of calcium
that enters in the presynaptic terminal;

106
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,685
or, it might affect the release machinery,

107
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:22,914
or other parts that influence how much
neurotransmitter's being taken up,

108
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:27,979
or the recycling, and docking,
and replenishment

109
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,409
of the readily-releasable pool.

110
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:34,120
So, we've already identified
many potential targets

111
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,896
for modulating synaptic transmission
through such metabotropic pathways;

112
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:42,349
and of course, it's interesting to see
which of these actually occur

113
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:44,848
in a major way in the brain.

114
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:49,084
And one major form
of presynaptic modulation

115
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,412
is called presynaptic inhibition.

116
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:55,876
And this occurs at almost all
synapses in the brain.

117
00:06:56,112 --> 00:07:00,933
Near to the release site,
but not at the actual active zone,

118
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,770
there are typically
seven-transmembrane receptors

119
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,747
that couple to G proteins.

120
00:07:06,447 --> 00:07:12,100
Upon activation by an agonist
of the receptor, the G protein splits;

121
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,464
the beta/gamma subunit can go

122
00:07:15,464 --> 00:07:19,228
and block the entry of calcium
through voltage-gated calcium channels;

123
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:21,982
so that's a direct interaction
of the G protein

124
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:25,508
with voltage-gated calcium channels
to inhibit calcium influx.

125
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:30,929
And the other place where presynaptic
inhibition has been noted in a major way

126
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:34,913
is through directly impinging
upon the release machinery.

127
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,814
And so, it inhibits the release
of synaptic vesicles

128
00:07:38,814 --> 00:07:39,935
in response to calcium.

129
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:42,978
So, there are at least
two independent ways

130
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:47,401
of regulating neurotransmitter release
through presynaptic inhibition.

131
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:49,410
One is reduction of calcium entry,

132
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,196
and the other is reduction
in release rates

133
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:54,969
in response to calcium rises.

134
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,414
So, if we now think

135
00:07:56,414 --> 00:08:01,137
about how presynaptic inhibition
might work in the brain,

136
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:03,152
we can imagine a situation

137
00:08:03,152 --> 00:08:07,997
where the neuromodulator,
the axon, is turned off;

138
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:11,522
and that we have a presynaptic
action potential in our red cell.

139
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:14,038
It propagates down its axon,

140
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:16,736
induces a calcium rise
in the presynaptic terminal,

141
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:21,850
and that, then, in turn, induces release
of neurotransmitter on to the blue cell,

142
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,259
driving a post-synaptic potential.

143
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:26,129
Now we turn the neuromodulator on:

144
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:31,355
so, there's action potential firing
in this neuromodulatory axon;

145
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:35,217
and that axon, the bouton
that releases a neuromodulator,

146
00:08:35,217 --> 00:08:38,590
is typically not immediately
next to the presynaptic terminal,

147
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,960
but it might be spaced
some five micrometers away.

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,572
The neurotransmitter is then released;
diffuses in the extracellular space

149
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:49,722
-- so we've got about 20 percent or so
extracellular space --

150
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:53,322
can then bind onto the receptors
here at the presynaptic terminal;

151
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,856
and then cause a decrease
in the amount of neurotransmitter release

152
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,409
in response to the action potential.

153
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,918
So, here's the action potential;

154
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,977
here's the postsynaptic potential;
and that's clearly smaller

155
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:06,315
than when there was
no neuromodulator present.

156
00:09:06,315 --> 00:09:08,473
And so this is, then,
presynaptic inhibition.

157
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:10,587
The neuromodulator has caused a decrease

158
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:14,594
in the amount of neurotransmitter released
in response to the action potential.

159
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,946
So, this is a simple view
of presynaptic inhibition.

160
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,531
The neuromodulator comes on,

161
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:23,292
and that simply decreases the amount
of neurotransmitter that's released.

162
00:09:23,498 --> 00:09:26,069
However, the situation
is not quite so simple,

163
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:30,468
because we also have to think
about short-term synaptic plasticity

164
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:33,475
that we discussed in the last lesson.

165
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:38,044
And one common form of short-term
synaptic plasticity is depression,

166
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:43,547
where a second action potential
induces a smaller post-synaptic potential

167
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:48,298
because of a depletion
in the amount of readily-releasable pool

168
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:50,273
in the presynaptic terminal.

169
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:53,127
Now, in the presence of a neuromodulator,

170
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:56,255
we've decreased the amount
of neurotransmitter released.

171
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:58,487
We've decreased the release probability;

172
00:09:58,487 --> 00:10:02,156
and so this action potential
that here caused a major depletion

173
00:10:02,156 --> 00:10:05,092
of the presynaptic terminal
now fails to do so.

174
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,252
There's only been
a small amount released.

175
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:10,645
The neuromodulator decreased
the release probability.

176
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:13,905
That, then, means, in response
to the second action potential,

177
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,913
that we can get a facilitation;

178
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:19,307
we can get an increase in the amount
of neurotransmitter released.

179
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:22,990
The calcium is probably peaking
at a higher level,

180
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,008
and the first action potential
didn't deplete the synaptic vesicles,

181
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:30,131
so they're still all present, all these:

182
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:31,638
many of them are still present.

183
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:34,125
And that, then, allows
the second action potential, now,

184
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,988
to become facilitating
rather than depressing.

185
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:40,231
And so, there's an interesting interaction

186
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:45,228
between presynaptic inhibition
and presynaptic neuromodulation in general

187
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,593
and short-term plasticity,

188
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:52,850
where presynaptic inhibition
causes a change from depression

189
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,635
to facilitating kinetics in general
at the presynaptic terminal.

190
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,369
There are, of course,
very many neurotransmitters

191
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,009
that act as presynaptic neuromodulators.

192
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:09,300
Glutamate and GABA
are two of the most important ones.

193
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,674
These are also the main
synaptic neurotransmitters,

194
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:17,582
so they release glutamate directly
onto ionotropic glutamate receptors;

195
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,433
and GABA releases...

196
00:11:19,433 --> 00:11:24,545
GABAergic synapses release GABA
directly onto GABA ionotropic receptors,

197
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:28,617
and that's a direct, local,
point-to-point neurotransmission

198
00:11:28,617 --> 00:11:31,953
that occurs on that
hundred-nanometer length scale.

199
00:11:31,953 --> 00:11:35,360
However, the glutamate and the GABA
released at these synapses

200
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,724
also diffuse out
into the extra-synaptic space.

201
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,730
And there, they can diffuse
for long distances,

202
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,277
and indeed, in general, it's thought
that the extracellular space

203
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:49,660
has relatively high concentrations
of glutamate and GABA

204
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,239
that, presumably, are escaping
from their synaptic release sites.

205
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,630
And certainly, presynaptic receptors,

206
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,528
metabotropic glutamate receptors,
metabotropic GABA receptors,

207
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:06,074
are equally important in terms
of modulating brain function

208
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,155
as many of the other
metabotropic receptors,

209
00:12:08,155 --> 00:12:10,058
and they form an important complement

210
00:12:10,058 --> 00:12:13,160
to the ionotropic glutamate
and GABA transmitters

211
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,926
that are working
on the millisecond time scale,

212
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:18,414
whereas the metabotropic receptors
are working

213
00:12:18,414 --> 00:12:22,132
on the hundreds-of-milliseconds
or second time scale.

214
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,214
So, glutamate and GABA,

215
00:12:24,214 --> 00:12:29,053
in addition to the fast ionotropic action
driving post-synaptic potentials,

216
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:32,249
also drive much slower
neuromodulatory events,

217
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,812
including presynaptic inhibition.

218
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:40,051
Similarly, there are axons
for acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin,

219
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:44,902
and many other neurotransmitters
that travel long distances

220
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:48,808
and can traverse
long and large parts of the brain.

221
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:52,592
So, a single axon
from a cholinergic neuron

222
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:58,147
can innervate a large expanse
of, for example, neocortical territory,

223
00:12:58,147 --> 00:13:02,575
and there, the boutons diffusely
release neurotransmitter

224
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,700
into the extracellular space.

225
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:09,183
Very often, for the neuromodulatory
neurotransmitters,

226
00:13:09,183 --> 00:13:12,089
there is no post-synaptic specialization,

227
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,828
and the neurotransmitter is simply
released into the extra-cellular space,

228
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,447
where it diffuses and adds up

229
00:13:18,447 --> 00:13:22,716
to a volume transmission
of neurotransmitter.

230
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:26,035
And so, acetylcholine,
dopamine, serotonin,

231
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:29,737
and these other neurotransmitters
that you see listed here

232
00:13:29,737 --> 00:13:33,704
are all typically working
in a volume-like manner.

233
00:13:33,704 --> 00:13:37,413
So, this means that they don't have
the point-to-point specificity

234
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:40,062
of the direct synaptic transmission,

235
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:42,833
but rather they act
on a longer length scale,

236
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,145
and also on a longer time scale,

237
00:13:45,145 --> 00:13:47,547
to affect presynaptic release

238
00:13:47,547 --> 00:13:51,828
and other components
of the synaptic transmission process.

239
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:58,132
So, the synaptic transmission,
the output of an axon,

240
00:13:58,202 --> 00:14:02,136
is modulated in a number
of important ways.

241
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,537
We learned previously
about the temporal modulation

242
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,960
in terms of the action potential
firing pattern of that neuron.

243
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,451
That can make a big difference

244
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:14,709
in terms of facilitation or depression
of neurotransmitter release.

245
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,715
Here, we now see

246
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:20,610
that the neurotransmitter concentrations
in the extracellular space

247
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,480
can also affect neurotransmitter release
in an important way;

248
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,536
and so, during different
behavioral conditions,

249
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:32,506
acetylcholine, serotonin,
dopamine levels will increase or fall

250
00:14:32,506 --> 00:14:37,752
in different parts of the brain,
depending upon the behavioral context;

251
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:42,328
and, depending on where the receptors
for these neuromodulators are expressed,

252
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:45,244
this will have different
and cell-type-specific effects

253
00:14:45,244 --> 00:14:48,524
upon the downstream brain structures

254
00:14:48,524 --> 00:14:51,989
and the synaptic transmission
at different synapses

255
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:55,611
between different
specific cells in the brain.

256
00:14:56,107 --> 00:14:58,444
So, we've considered the situation

257
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:03,780
where presynaptic metabotropic
receptors on the bouton

258
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,410
will affect the coupling
of the action potential

259
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,290
to the neurotransmitter release process,

260
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:15,209
and a prominent feature here
is presynaptic inhibition.

261
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:17,657
Now, these metabotropic receptors

262
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,993
are not just present
on presynaptic membranes,

263
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:23,594
but are also present post-synaptically.

264
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:29,259
And so, here, if we think
about a post-synaptic specialization,

265
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:32,435
and a dendrite that will hook up
to the soma of a cell,

266
00:15:32,435 --> 00:15:36,250
there will also be receptors,
seven-transmembrane receptors,

267
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,947
decorating the post-synaptic membrane.

268
00:15:38,947 --> 00:15:42,488
And so, we can imagine having
a seven-transmembrane receptor here,

269
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:44,452
coupling to a G protein;

270
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:49,010
and that, then, might affect
several cellular processes here,

271
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,873
in the post-synaptic neuron.

272
00:15:50,873 --> 00:15:56,131
In part, it might affect similar things
post-synaptically as presynaptically.

273
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:59,286
In fact, we also have
voltage-gated calcium channels here

274
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:01,068
on the post-synaptic membrane,

275
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:07,122
and seven-transmembrane receptors,
via G proteins, have been shown, also,

276
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:11,761
to block voltage-gated calcium channels
on the post-synaptic dendrites.

277
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:15,326
And so, that's one similarity
about the signalling processes

278
00:16:15,326 --> 00:16:19,321
and the presynaptic
and the post-synaptic specializations.

279
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,552
Also, on post-synaptic membranes,

280
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:25,559
there are other interesting
potassium channels

281
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,433
that are strongly regulated
by seven-transmembrane receptors.

282
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,643
So again, via G proteins,

283
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:34,186
they can affect potassium channels.

284
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,176
In particular there's a family
of potassium channels

285
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,970
called the <i>G protein inwardly-rectifying
potassium channels</i>,

286
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,605
or the K_ir channels,

287
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:47,690
that are strongly affected
by G protein coupling here;

288
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,847
and they're activated
by receptor activation.

289
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:57,419
And this, then, can give rise to so-called
slow post-synaptic potentials

290
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:03,834
where we can imagine, say, from
a GABAergic release of neurotransmitter

291
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,706
that can then cause an inhibitory
post-synaptic potential

292
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:11,363
that's fast via the standard
ionotropic receptors.

293
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,039
This is the spike in the presynaptic cell,

294
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,919
and it can cause
a slow post-synaptic potential

295
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,007
through activating potassium channels
via this G protein signalling pathway;

296
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,742
and this might be something that
takes place on the half-second time scale:

297
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:31,258
so, much slower than the ten- to twenty-
millisecond post-synaptic potential

298
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,957
via the ionotropic receptors.

299
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:39,277
So, there are both presynaptic and
post-synaptic effects of neuromodulation,

300
00:17:39,337 --> 00:17:42,511
and both of them contribute
equally importantly

301
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:45,662
to the neuromodulation of brain function.

302
00:17:46,562 --> 00:17:50,404
One of the exciting features
about neuromodulation

303
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:53,053
is its clinical relevance.

304
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:56,636
The location of where receptors
are expressed

305
00:17:56,636 --> 00:18:00,602
to the different neurotransmitters
turns out to be highly specific.

306
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:04,591
So, some cells express
one type of dopamine receptor;

307
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:07,661
others will express
another type of dopamine receptor;

308
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:11,800
and similary for serotonin receptors,
adrenergic receptors,

309
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,171
oxytocin receptors, you name it:

310
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:19,603
the seven-transmembrane receptors
are expressed in highly specific manners,

311
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:23,379
in terms of which cells express
those receptor subtypes,

312
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:27,992
and also where in the nerve cell
those receptors are located.

313
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:31,715
So, some will be located
on presynaptic specializations,

314
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:34,191
others on post-synaptic specializations,

315
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:37,831
and some will only be located
on a presynaptic specialization

316
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:41,772
that contacts a specific
post-synaptic cell type.

317
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:46,011
And so, where the neuromodulators
gain their specificity from

318
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:49,511
is really where the receptors
are expressed.

319
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:52,796
The neurotransmitter itself is,
of course, also released

320
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:55,255
with some temporal
and spatial specificity,

321
00:18:55,255 --> 00:18:56,915
but that's much less so

322
00:18:56,915 --> 00:18:59,575
than the standard,
fast synaptic transmitters

323
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:00,955
we've been thinking of.

324
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:05,170
And that means that they're relatively
amenable to neuropharmacology,

325
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,219
which, of course,

326
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:11,284
we can influence the receptors
and the neuromodulatory transmitters

327
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:16,051
on long time scales,
and without much spatial specificity.

328
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,579
And there, there's some match
between what we can do pharmacologically

329
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:25,553
and what is physiologically involved
in the neuromodulatory process.

330
00:19:25,737 --> 00:19:29,542
And here, I'd just like to highlight
two types of drugs

331
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:33,424
that are in common usage
for different brain disorders.

332
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:38,255
One is the fluoxetine / sertraline
type of drug

333
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:41,126
that works against depression;

334
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:47,007
and the way that they work is as
a selective serotonin re-uptake blocker.

335
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:52,052
And so, we have our serotonin
nerve terminals,

336
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:54,547
our boutons that release serotonin.

337
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:58,774
Serotonin is also called
5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT.

338
00:19:58,774 --> 00:20:05,645
And so, these serotonergic axons release
serotonin into the extracellular space.

339
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:09,345
There's no post-synaptic specialization
for these axons,

340
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:15,114
and the amount of neurotransmitter
that's released,

341
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:18,032
and the distance they can diffuse,

342
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:23,700
depends upon how it's degraded
and taken up from the extracellular space.

343
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:28,168
And it turns out that there are
specific serotonin transporters

344
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:31,649
that suck up the serotonin
from the extracellular space.

345
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:33,396
And that's one of the major ways

346
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:38,023
in which the extracellular
5HT concentration is regulated,

347
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:42,040
is by the so-called
<i>serotonin re-uptake proteins</i>.

348
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,549
And what fluoxetine and sertraline do

349
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,397
is that they block
that re-uptake machinery;

350
00:20:47,397 --> 00:20:50,646
and that, then, allows the 5HT
to diffuse further,

351
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:52,956
and reach higher concentrations.

352
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:57,119
And so, fluoxetine has
its major way of action

353
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:00,489
to increase serotonin
in the extracellular space

354
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,949
by blocking the re-uptake transporters;

355
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:06,409
and it turns out that the fluoxetine
has been very successful

356
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:09,295
in countering depression and anxiety.

357
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:15,600
Another drug, risperidone, acts
by blocking specific subtypes

358
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,591
of dopamine receptors,
of serotonin receptors,

359
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,730
and adrenergic receptors;

360
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:25,023
and, interestingly, it seems
to derive some degree of specificity

361
00:21:25,023 --> 00:21:29,461
from not binding to muscarinic
acetylcholine receptors.

362
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,586
So it targets many of these other systems,

363
00:21:31,586 --> 00:21:35,975
but seems to have 
more than a thousand-fold less binding

364
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,145
to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

365
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:41,320
And so another drug, this Risperidone,

366
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,345
acts at a whole bunch
of different neuromodulatory receptors,

367
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,023
and it seems to have
an interesting and useful effect

368
00:21:49,023 --> 00:21:54,053
as an anti-psychotic that can help
treat patients with schizophrenia.

369
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:58,786
The neuromodulators bind
to seven-transmembrane receptors

370
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:02,389
that activate G proteins;
they bind GTP;

371
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:06,675
they diffuse and activate, then,
downstream signalling pathways;

372
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:10,743
and there's really a large variety
of signalling pathways that are open

373
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:13,161
to seven-transmembrane receptors.

374
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:20,169
In particular, they act to presynaptically
inhibit neurotransmitter release,

375
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,866
by down-regulating calcium influx

376
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:26,392
and by decreasing the efficacy
of neurotransmitter release;

377
00:22:26,392 --> 00:22:31,537
and that, then, also impacts synaptic
dynamics in the presynaptic terminal.

378
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:36,260
The neuromodulators are also
particularly interesting:

379
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,160
because they act on this long time scale
and in a more diffuse way,

380
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,285
they're also amenable
to pharmacological interventions,

381
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:46,114
and there, there's
a great deal of interest

382
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,670
in trying to specify
which receptors are responsible

383
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,536
for which types of neuromodulation,

384
00:22:52,536 --> 00:22:55,404
and how that interacts
with different brain diseases,

385
00:22:55,404 --> 00:23:00,022
which is an area of intense
research in neuropharmacology.
