1
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:09,260
We've now learned about the complex 
process coupling an action potential

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,974
in a presynaptic bouton 
to neurotransmitter release

3
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:15,590
through complex molecular machinery.

4
00:00:16,155 --> 00:00:19,688
The action potential firing rate 
in a neuron

5
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:24,369
makes a large difference
about its synaptic transmission.

6
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:30,196
Some neurons, some types of cells
in the mammalian brain,

7
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:34,647
fire action potentials at very high rates,
almost continuously.

8
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:37,438
So, some cells fire at 100 Hz:

9
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:40,787
that's an action potential
every 10 milliseconds,

10
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:43,862
almost continuously 
throughout our lives.

11
00:00:44,591 --> 00:00:48,066
Other neurons fire
much more sparsely and selectively.

12
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,797
They might be silent for minutes,

13
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:54,367
and then fire a brief burst
of five action potentials

14
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:56,558
within a few milliseconds of each other,

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,980
and then remain silent again
for many minutes.

16
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:04,868
There are thus diverse patterns
of action potential firing

17
00:01:04,868 --> 00:01:10,748
and the brain has adapted to make use, 
enhance, and suppress

18
00:01:10,748 --> 00:01:14,437
some of the information 
transmitted by action potentials

19
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:17,142
in different time scales.

20
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:20,477
The amount of neurotransmitter 
that's released

21
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,449
in response to an action potential

22
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:28,738
is therefore dependent upon the history
of activity in that particular axon.

23
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:33,811
If an action potential occurs 
immediately <i>before</i>,

24
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:37,951
then that leaves an imprint 
upon the synapse.

25
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:40,021
And that can change the amount of 
neurotransmitter

26
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,242
that's released in response 
to subsequent action potentials.

27
00:01:44,364 --> 00:01:48,962
And that process of so-called 
<i>presynaptic plasticity</i>

28
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:52,894
is what we're going to study 
in today's video.

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,115
The modulation of neurotransmitter release
in response to activity of that same axon

30
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:04,101
is called presynaptic 
short-term plasticity,

31
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:07,371
or presynaptic dynamics.

32
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:12,335
It can be thought of as occurring 
on three different time scales,

33
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:16,859
which also relate
to three different mechanisms

34
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:20,049
that are at play
in the presynaptic terminal.

35
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:23,835
We can have short-term 
synaptic plasticity:

36
00:02:23,835 --> 00:02:28,030
that's a form of short-term dynamics

37
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,700
that occurs on a time scale
of less than one second,

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,451
typically 10 milliseconds;

39
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:37,109
100 milliseconds is the time scale

40
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,558
of interaction between
neighboring action potentials

41
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:43,382
when we're thinking 
about short-term synaptic plasticity.

42
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:45,680
It can be divided into two forms:

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,237
<i>facilitation</i>,

44
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:51,498
where subsequent action potentials
<i>increase</i> the amount of neurotransmission,

45
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:53,198
and <i>depression</i>,

46
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:55,430
where consecutive action potentials

47
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,591
induce less and less release
of neurotransmitter.

48
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:03,543
There are other forms of 
presynaptic plasticity

49
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,833
that occur on much longer time scales:

50
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,676
postsynaptic potentiation,
that occurs on the <i>minute</i> time scale,

51
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:12,258
and long-term presynaptic plasticity,

52
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:16,080
that can last hours, days, 
perhaps even a lifetime

53
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,001
and might ultimately contribute
to forming memories in the brain.

54
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:24,646
These two longer-lasting plasticities

55
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:31,420
rely upon complex signaling cascades
downstream of activity, and calcium,

56
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,984
whereas these are <i>immediately</i>
related to the calcium

57
00:03:35,984 --> 00:03:40,093
and the amount of neurotransmitter
vesicles available.

58
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:44,005
We will talk a bit
about each of these four different forms

59
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:47,760
of presynaptic short-term plasticity 
in the next slides.

60
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:51,768
We'll begin by thinking 
about facilitation.

61
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:56,985
In the process of facilitation,
we imagine a connected pair of neurons

62
00:03:56,985 --> 00:04:03,579
where action potentials in the red neuron 
propagate down to the presynaptic bouton,

63
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:06,418
calcium influx causes 
neurotransmitter release,

64
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:10,801
and then postsynaptic potentials 
are evoked in the blue neuron.

65
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:14,329
One action potential
causes calcium influx,

66
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:16,648
causes a postsynaptic potential.

67
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:20,015
Then we'll envisage
a second action potential,

68
00:04:20,015 --> 00:04:22,192
occurring shortly after the first one:

69
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:25,791
in this case, on the time scale
of 20 milliseconds later.

70
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,616
The second action potential

71
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:30,830
induces a large amount
of neurotransmitter release,

72
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,914
and therefore also 
a larger postsynaptic potential.

73
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,768
That's the process of <i>facilitation.</i>

74
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:42,245
The mechanism underlying 
presynaptic short-term facilitation

75
00:04:42,245 --> 00:04:46,963
is thought to be an accumulation 
of calcium in the presynaptic terminal.

76
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,169
So, the first action potential 
induces a calcium influx

77
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:53,762
that activates the voltage-gated
calcium channels;

78
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:57,400
calcium then floods
into the presynaptic bouton,

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,849
and that's what causes
neurotransmitter release.

80
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:03,884
There are a number of different calcium 
binding proteins, of course,

81
00:05:03,884 --> 00:05:06,250
including the Synaptotagmin:

82
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,636
that's the effector
for neurotransmitter release.

83
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:11,311
But there are many other proteins
that also bind calcium.

84
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,295
They become calcium buffers.

85
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:15,969
There are also proteins 
that are involved

86
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:19,804
in sucking the calcium
out of the presynaptic terminal:

87
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:24,394
calcium pumps that are involved
in reducing the calcium concentration.

88
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:28,299
And so, in the 20 milliseconds 
that follow the action potential,

89
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:32,656
there's a gradual reduction 
in the calcium concentration

90
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:34,074
in the presynaptic terminal;

91
00:05:34,074 --> 00:05:36,314
and that depends
on the activity of the pumps,

92
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,925
the diffusion of the calcium

93
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:42,028
away from the entry site
at the voltage-gated calcium channels,

94
00:05:42,028 --> 00:05:44,990
and the binding
of various calcium buffers.

95
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,113
When the second action potential arrives,

96
00:05:48,113 --> 00:05:49,114
there may, then, be

97
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:53,993
a little bit of residual calcium
left in the presynaptic terminal.

98
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:58,717
We may not have reached 
the equilibrium baseline situation.

99
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,999
Equally, some of the buffers
may be saturated;

100
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:05,986
and when the second action potential
occurs, and calcium floods in,

101
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:08,654
those buffers won't be able
to bind calcium;

102
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:11,070
and there's already an elevated baseline;

103
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,106
and so the peak calcium concentration
that's reached

104
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,041
in response to the second action potential

105
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,342
can be higher than that
in response to the first.

106
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,330
And even if that's only, say,

107
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,450
a 20-percent increase
in the peak calcium concentration,

108
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,485
that can make a major difference

109
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:30,920
to the amount of neurotransmitter 
that's being released.

110
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:36,495
In the last lesson we discussed 
that the release rate of vesicles

111
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:40,168
depended upon the fourth power 
of the concentration of calcium.

112
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:44,260
And so, if we have a 20-percent 
increase in the calcium concentration,

113
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,945
we put that to the fourth power:

114
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:49,735
that induces a doubling
in the amount of neurotransmitter release.

115
00:06:50,412 --> 00:06:52,969
So, even small changes in the amount

116
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:57,004
of peak calcium influx reached
in response to an action potential

117
00:06:57,004 --> 00:07:01,558
can have a large impact
upon the release of neurotransmitter.

118
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:04,299
And in the process
of short-term facilitation,

119
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,080
it is thought to be
increased calcium signals

120
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,427
that give rise to increased amounts
of neurotransmitter release.

121
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:14,721
And that's the process
of short-term facilitation,

122
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:17,576
that typically lasts less than a second,

123
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:20,493
and is typically, sort of, studied
on the time scale

124
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:23,624
of action potentials 
that are 10 milliseconds,

125
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,954
50 milliseconds, 
or 100 milliseconds apart.

126
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:32,111
There's another process
of short-term synaptic plasticity

127
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,015
that does the converse: <i>depression.</i>

128
00:07:35,015 --> 00:07:36,898
In the process of depression,

129
00:07:36,898 --> 00:07:42,123
the second action potential gives rise
to a smaller postsynaptic response

130
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:45,108
because of less release
of neurotransmitter

131
00:07:45,108 --> 00:07:47,487
compared to the first action potential,

132
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:53,025
when those action potentials are separated
by a few tens of milliseconds.

133
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:56,648
In the process of synaptic depression,

134
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,646
we imagine that the first action potential
is quite efficacious,

135
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,000
and it releases a large amount 
of neurotransmitter

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,445
from the presynaptic nerve terminal.

137
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,197
After that neurotransmitter 
has been released,

138
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,437
the vesicles need to replenish.

139
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:15,902
And in the time space
of 20 milliseconds, perhaps,

140
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:18,653
there's very little time 
for the vesicles to replenish;

141
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:21,803
and so, in response
to the second action potential,

142
00:08:21,803 --> 00:08:23,942
less neurotransmitter is released.

143
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,464
We can envisage the situation here:

144
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,061
in response to the first action potential,

145
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:31,788
there might, for example, 
be two release-ready vesicles.

146
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:34,704
The action potential induces 
calcium influx;

147
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:40,053
one of these is released
and causes a postsynaptic potential.

148
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,267
In response to the second 
action potential

149
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:45,323
that first vesicle is now gone;

150
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,345
It's probably somewhere 
in the recycling process,

151
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:50,601
trying to load up with neurotransmitter.

152
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:53,565
So there's only one vesicle, now, 
that's left;

153
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,676
and the action potential
causes the same calcium influx;

154
00:08:57,676 --> 00:08:59,379
and, in this case,

155
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:04,079
there's, then, a reduced probability
of releasing a neurotransmitter.

156
00:09:05,474 --> 00:09:11,104
It's also possible to modulate 
presynaptic release on longer time scales;

157
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:13,027
and this typically involves

158
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:16,671
high-frequency stimulation
of the presynaptic nerve terminal

159
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:20,467
and activation 
of additional signaling pathways.

160
00:09:20,924 --> 00:09:24,643
These sort of longer-lasting forms 
of presynaptic plasticity

161
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:27,707
only occur at certain types of synapses.

162
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,731
So, most types of synapses

163
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:32,659
have the short-term forms
of synaptic plasticity,

164
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:36,962
and only certain ones have,
for example, <i>post-tetanic potentiation,</i>

165
00:09:36,962 --> 00:09:39,875
or long-term potentiation,
that we'll discuss next.

166
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:44,260
And so, at synapses that express 
post-tetanic potentiation,

167
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,583
we can imagine having
a high-frequency burst of action potential

168
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:52,785
where we might fire the presynaptic cell
at 100 Hz for one second:

169
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:54,542
so, that's 100 action potentials

170
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:59,075
and each one separated
by a 10-millisecond time scale.

171
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:02,459
And we can have a baseline,
where we stimulate, perhaps,

172
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,724
once every 10 seconds,
or once every 20 seconds.

173
00:10:05,724 --> 00:10:08,778
That gives us our baseline
postsynaptic potential.

174
00:10:08,778 --> 00:10:10,629
We can plot the amplitude of that,

175
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:13,122
in the form of these dots here,
across time.

176
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:15,604
So we stimulate, perhaps,
every 10 seconds:

177
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:18,559
we see some variation
in the postsynaptic potential;

178
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,313
then, we give our high-frequency
tetanic stimulation, the 100 Hz.

179
00:10:23,313 --> 00:10:26,391
That causes a massive influx of calcium

180
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,397
through the voltage-gated 
calcium channels.

181
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:34,263
That rise in calcium activates an enzyme
called protein kinase C

182
00:10:34,263 --> 00:10:37,145
that depends upon calcium to activate it:

183
00:10:37,145 --> 00:10:39,268
so, there's a large calcium influx

184
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:42,286
during this one second 
of high-frequency stimulation

185
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:44,548
that activates protein kinase C;

186
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:46,568
and one of the targets of protein kinase C

187
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:51,102
is part of the molecular machinery 
involved in neurotransmitter release.

188
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:53,412
It's a protein called Munc-18;

189
00:10:53,412 --> 00:10:56,481
and if that becomes phosphorylated
by protein kinase C,

190
00:10:56,481 --> 00:11:02,883
then the release rate at any given
calcium concentration is increased.

191
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:05,452
And so, if our action potential

192
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:10,354
induces, say, 3 micromolar calcium 
in the presynaptic cell

193
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,187
under baseline conditions,

194
00:11:12,187 --> 00:11:16,638
after the post-tetanic potentiation
-- this 100 Hz stimulus;

195
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:21,083
after the activation of protein kinase C 
in the phosphorylation of Munc-18,

196
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:26,409
three micromole of calcium will now 
induce a much higher release rate;

197
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:28,269
and that's, then, what we see here.

198
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,238
After the post-tetanic potentiation 
stimulation,

199
00:11:31,238 --> 00:11:36,470
we go back to our stimulation of action
potentials every 10 seconds or so,

200
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,315
and we now see that the release 
of neurotransmitter is enhanced;

201
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:44,769
and it can be enhanced 
for a time of many seconds.

202
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:47,604
So, here we're in seconds,
so this is one minute.

203
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:51,523
And, after one minute,
there's still a substantial enhancement

204
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:55,175
in the release from this synapse,
compared to the baseline.

205
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:58,489
So, a brief period
of high-frequency activity

206
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:03,528
can induce a long-lasting change here
over a period of about a minute,

207
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:07,213
where there's a substantial increase
in neurotransmitter release.

208
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:09,545
And that can, of course,
affect brain function

209
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:11,224
in important and interesting ways,

210
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:15,360
where one can imagine holding 
a short-term memory of activity

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,932
at the synapse for a period of a minute.

212
00:12:18,782 --> 00:12:23,930
We can also have much longer terms 
of presynaptic plasticity,

213
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,717
in so-called long-term potentiation.

214
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:30,697
Again, this only occurs
at <i>some</i> types of synapses in the brain.

215
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:36,702
Again, we have a high-frequency train
of stimuli in the presynaptic cell

216
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,337
that induce the long-term potentiation;

217
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:42,267
we have baseline PSPs that come in;

218
00:12:42,267 --> 00:12:44,620
we stimulate every now and then,
and we see

219
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,319
that there's a relatively-reliable
postsynaptic potential that comes in.

220
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:54,182
We give our high-frequency tetanization, 
the amplitude of the PSP,

221
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:56,511
that, we recall,
postsynaptically increases

222
00:12:56,511 --> 00:13:00,021
because of an enhanced release
of neurotransmitter.

223
00:13:00,021 --> 00:13:03,205
And molecularly, what's thought 
to be happening

224
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,211
at synapses that express
long-term potentiation

225
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,559
is that the calcium influx
during the high-frequency train

226
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,794
activates an enzyme
called adenylate cyclase.

227
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,033
There are calcium-dependent forms
of adenylate cyclases,

228
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:19,407
and so the calcium that floods in

229
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:22,172
during the presynaptic train
of action potentials

230
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:24,610
activates adenylate cyclase;

231
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:31,045
that, in turn, turns ATP into cyclic AMP.

232
00:13:31,045 --> 00:13:32,895
That's the job of adenylate cyclase.

233
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:36,641
Cyclic AMP is an important
signaling molecule

234
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:41,026
that activates another protein
called protein kinase A;

235
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:46,216
and that phosphorylates 
one of our favorite proteins here

236
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:48,758
in the release machinery:
a Synaptotagmin.

237
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,443
Not the standard Synaptotagmin

238
00:13:50,443 --> 00:13:52,537
that's responsible
for calcium-dependent release,

239
00:13:52,537 --> 00:13:55,737
but another one,
another isoform, Synaptotagmin-12,

240
00:13:55,737 --> 00:13:58,113
at least in some cases
where it's been studied.

241
00:13:58,113 --> 00:14:00,806
And the phosphorylation 
of Synaptotagmin-12

242
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:05,267
causes this long-lasting enhancement
of neurotransmitter release,

243
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:07,830
known as presynaptic 
long-term potentiation.

244
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,935
And this is something that can take place

245
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:12,639
on many minutes',
on the hour time scale.

246
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,082
So one hour, two hours later,
there's still a large increase

247
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:20,165
in the efficacy of synaptic transmission
at the synapse,

248
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:22,577
and that can maybe go on for days.

249
00:14:23,157 --> 00:14:27,390
So the amount of neurotransmitter
that's being released at a synapse

250
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,091
depends on a large number of things;

251
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:32,460
and one of them is the recent history,

252
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,968
the activity of that individual bouton
in its past.

253
00:14:36,968 --> 00:14:40,354
If it just received another
action potential before,

254
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:43,820
then the calcium concentration
will rise to higher levels

255
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,697
with the next action potential,

256
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:49,067
and that can induce
presynaptic facilitation:

257
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:53,065
something that occurs
on the 10- to 100-millisecond time scale.

258
00:14:53,205 --> 00:14:57,681
Equally, the release of a lot of vesicles 
from the presynaptic terminal

259
00:14:57,681 --> 00:14:59,861
leads to a process of depletion.

260
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:04,600
The vesicles need to dock
and refill with neurotransmitter

261
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,313
before they can be released again;

262
00:15:06,499 --> 00:15:11,382
and so there's also a process where
we need to refill and reload vesicles.

263
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:14,528
And again, that process of replenishment

264
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,958
of the vesicles that are depleted
by a previous action potential

265
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:21,899
can take place on the time scale
of 10 to 100 milliseconds.

266
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,256
So there are these short-term
facilitation and depression dynamics

267
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:29,332
that affect nearly all synapses
in the brain.

268
00:15:29,752 --> 00:15:33,563
Other synapses are able
to be modified on longer time scales

269
00:15:33,563 --> 00:15:36,579
through signaling processes
involving kinases

270
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:39,844
that are calcium-sensitive,
for the most part.

271
00:15:39,844 --> 00:15:43,214
And so, they can sense 
the activity of the presynaptic terminal;

272
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:46,075
and, through phosphorylating
different enzymes

273
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:50,297
or changing the amount
-- availability -- of vesicles,

274
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:53,673
can then change the efficacy
of neurotransmitter release.

275
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:58,072
And some of those modifications
can last for minutes or hours.

276
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,376
In order to begin thinking

277
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,256
about how these modulations
of neurotransmitter release

278
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:08,386
can occur in the brain
and at different synapses

279
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,238
-- and, in particular,
when we start thinking

280
00:16:10,238 --> 00:16:13,505
about how <i>many</i> neurons
interact with each other --

281
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:16,914
it's useful to come up with 
some computational models,

282
00:16:16,914 --> 00:16:22,641
some simple models that, nonetheless,
provide reasonable descriptions

283
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,218
about the types of changes

284
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:28,541
that occur in synaptic transmission 
on different time scales.

285
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:31,517
And so one useful way
of thinking about it

286
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:36,135
is by bringing in
exponential time courses

287
00:16:36,135 --> 00:16:38,887
that will help model different events.

288
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:44,743
And so, if we imagine that there's
a readily-releasable pool of vesicles,

289
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,918
and they, then, need to be replenished,

290
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:51,104
and that will take
some sort of time course, here,

291
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:54,750
that we can give an exponential
recovery rate

292
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,812
to a readily-releasable pool:

293
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:59,600
So, we have a given number of resources

294
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,642
and when an action potential is fired,
some of those resources are used up;

295
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:08,386
there's an exocytosis, 
a release of vesicles;

296
00:17:08,386 --> 00:17:11,356
and then those vesicles need to recover.

297
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,647
And that can be thought of as occurring

298
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:16,749
on some exponential
recovery time constant.

299
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:20,332
Equally, we know that there's 
a process of facilitation,

300
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:25,283
so that when calcium floods 
into the presynaptic nerve terminal,

301
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:30,290
then the release probability in response
to an action potential goes up.

302
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:32,320
And so, if we have an action potential

303
00:17:32,563 --> 00:17:35,941
that then causes an increase
in release probability,

304
00:17:35,941 --> 00:17:39,382
which we can think of as an increase
in the calcium concentration

305
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:42,942
that, again, lasts
for a given amount of time.

306
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:46,354
So, we can think
of a facilitation time constant.

307
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:49,605
And so, we have two different 
time constants.

308
00:17:50,045 --> 00:17:53,367
We can also have, of course,
different amplitudes for these effects;

309
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,955
and by putting, simply, two different,

310
00:17:56,515 --> 00:17:59,455
exponentially-dependent
time constants together

311
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:03,317
in some sort of releasable, pool fashion,

312
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,706
where action potentials
then convert resources

313
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:09,969
into released neurotransmitter,
and some of those get used up,

314
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:14,086
we can then generate very complex patterns
of interactions, with...

315
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:19,477
we can imagine modeling spike trains
with quite complicated dynamics.

316
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:24,114
And it turns out that simple models,
with just a few variables in them,

317
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,874
can actually recover quite a lot
of the dynamics

318
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:30,004
that occur at real synapses in the brain.

319
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,201
And so, there are simplifications

320
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:36,648
to the complexity that we see
at the molecular level.

321
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,270
We can have empirical,
much simpler models

322
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,621
that do a relatively good job
of modeling synaptic transmission,

323
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:46,569
at least on short time scales.

324
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,238
And of course, in future work,
more detailed models need to be generated

325
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:56,143
in order to fully understand
the synaptic process of transmission.

326
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,891
And so, we've learned
that not all action potentials are equal.

327
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:04,866
An action potential will certainly
cause calcium influx

328
00:19:04,866 --> 00:19:08,197
into the presynaptic bouton,
and neurotransmitter release;

329
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:12,764
but the amount of neurotransmitter
release and the amount of calcium influx

330
00:19:12,764 --> 00:19:19,184
depends upon the recent history
of action potential firing in that axon.

331
00:19:20,261 --> 00:19:21,678
Action potentials occurring

332
00:19:21,678 --> 00:19:25,182
within some tens or hundreds
of milliseconds of each other

333
00:19:25,182 --> 00:19:27,852
can induce facilitation
through summation

334
00:19:27,852 --> 00:19:31,026
of calcium concentrations
in the presynaptic terminal,

335
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:35,126
and they can induce depression 
through the depletion of synaptic vesicles

336
00:19:35,126 --> 00:19:37,935
and a reduction
in the readily-releasable pool.

337
00:19:38,405 --> 00:19:40,223
On the longer time scales,

338
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:44,164
the calcium influx that occurs,
particularly during high-frequency firing,

339
00:19:44,164 --> 00:19:49,831
can induce changes
in calcium-activated signaling cascades.

340
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:55,112
Calcium activation of protein kinase C
can cause post-tetanic potentiation

341
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:59,195
lasting for a minute or so,
whereas calcium activation

342
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:02,619
of adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP
signaling pathways

343
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,390
can cause long-lasting forms
of potentiation

344
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,213
at the presynaptic nerve terminal

345
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:11,549
that probably contributes 
to the formation of memories.

346
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:14,059
As a result, changes in the efficacy

347
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:17,219
of presynaptic neurotransmitter release
are prominent,

348
00:20:17,219 --> 00:20:21,349
and form an interesting way
in which the brain can auto-regulate

349
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:25,685
its amount of neurotransmitter release
from its synaptic terminals.
