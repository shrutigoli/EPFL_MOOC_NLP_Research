00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:09,316
Welcome back to week three 
of Cellular Mechanisms in Brain Function.

2
00:00:10,006 --> 00:00:13,314
Over the last two weeks, 
we've considered extensively

3
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:16,719
the membrane biophysics 
of electrical signalling

4
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,723
in single neurons.

5
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:21,123
The brain is composed 
of many neurons

6
00:00:21,123 --> 00:00:23,839
and these neurons 
communicate with each other.

7
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:28,560
A single neuron might communicate 
and send messages

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,368
to hundreds or thousands 
of other neurons

9
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:34,350
and equally, 
that neuron will receive signals

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,116
from hundreds or thousands 
of other neurons.

11
00:00:38,196 --> 00:00:42,064
The communication between 
different nerve cells in the brain

12
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:44,579
sending specific messages 
to each other,

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,620
underlies the complex 
and important computational powers

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,420
of the mammalian brain.

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,463
Neurons communicate to each other

16
00:00:54,463 --> 00:00:58,186
at specialized junctions called synapses.

17
00:00:59,206 --> 00:01:04,000
Typically, an action potential 
in a presynaptic neuron

18
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,371
causes that action potential 
to travel down the axon of that neuron

19
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:12,571
and when it reaches 
the presynaptic bouton,

20
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:15,506
it releases 
a neurotransmitter substance,

21
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:19,400
a chemical that binds to receptors 
on the postsynaptic cell

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,275
and causes a change 
in the membrane potential of that cell.

23
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,940
That process of synaptic transmission 
is the main way

24
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,870
in which neurons communicate 
with each other

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,754
and signal to each other.

26
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:36,099
There are many different 
neurotransmitters

27
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,773
present in the mammalian brain,

28
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:43,145
and here, I show just a small handful 
out of that total diversity.

29
00:01:43,155 --> 00:01:47,981
The most important two neurotransmitters 
in the central nervous system

30
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:51,682
are glutamate 
and gamma-aminobutyric acid,

31
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:57,176
that's typically written, simply, 
in it's short form as GABA.

32
00:01:57,666 --> 00:02:02,404
So glutamate is the amino acid

33
00:02:02,404 --> 00:02:06,282
that we know that forms parts of proteins

34
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:11,762
and glutamate is the main 
excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.

35
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:16,015
A release of glutamate causes 
postsynaptic neurons

36
00:02:16,015 --> 00:02:19,533
to increase the probability 
of firing action potentials.

37
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:22,081
GABA, on the other hand,

38
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:25,196
is the most important 
inhibitory neurotransmitter,

39
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:31,074
and a neuron that releases GABA
will tend to decrease the probability

40
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:34,238
of the postsynaptic cells 
firing action potentials.

41
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:39,630
A given neuron will release 
one neurotransmitter from its axon.

42
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,598
And so, a neuron might be glutamatergic,
in which case, from its axon

43
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,611
-- along all its different
synaptic specializations --

44
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,057
it'll release glutamate;

45
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:53,691
and a different neuron
will release GABA from its axon.

46
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:57,958
And so glutamate and GABA 
make up the vast majority

47
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,339
of synapses in the central nervous system.

48
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,948
The first neurotransmitter 
that was identified, however,

49
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:07,426
was acetylcholine.

50
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:11,204
And that has an important role 
in regulating heart function,

51
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,974
and, most importantly, 
it is the neurotransmitter

52
00:03:14,974 --> 00:03:17,840
at the mammalian 
neuromuscular junction.

53
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,612
So a motor neuron will release 
acetylcholine from its nerve ending,

54
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:26,341
and that acetylcholine will bind 
to acetycholine receptors

55
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,062
that are present on muscle;

56
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:30,143
and that forms the first step

57
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,336
in initiation of contraction
of that muscle.

58
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:37,400
Dopamine is another 
interesting neurotransmitter.

59
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,000
Dopamine function is thought to be 
highly involved in reward-based learning,

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,816
and deficits in dopamine function

61
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:51,246
appear to be important components
in diseases such as Parkinson's disease,

62
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:57,078
in which case there's a deficit 
in the regulation and release of dopamine.

63
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,012
Equally, dopaminergic dysfunction

64
00:04:00,012 --> 00:04:04,356
is also thought to be a key player
in schizophrenia,

65
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:08,323
and dopamine is part
of a family of neurotransmitters

66
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,795
called the catecholamines.

67
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:17,749
These small molecules are complemented 
by slightly larger neurotransmitters,

68
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:21,392
made out of small peptide chains.

69
00:04:21,392 --> 00:04:24,513
And so one neuropeptide, 
met-enkephalin,

70
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:27,033
is composed of five different 
amino acids

71
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:31,338
and here another one, oxytocin,
has nine different amino acids in it.

72
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:34,313
And of course, there are
many different neuropeptides

73
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:36,935
that signal as neurotransmitters;

74
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,534
and indeed, this is just a small subset

75
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:42,497
of the total number
of neurotransmitters that are present;

76
00:04:42,497 --> 00:04:47,462
and indeed, new neurotransmitters 
are continually being discovered.

77
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:52,581
The basic process 
of fast chemical synaptic transmission

78
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:56,319
that dominates 
neuron-to-neuron communication

79
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,400
is schematically shown here 
in five important steps.

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,714
We have the presynaptic axon.

81
00:05:04,594 --> 00:05:08,121
An action potential 
is traveling down the axon;

82
00:05:08,121 --> 00:05:12,793
it invades the 
presynaptic specialization, the bouton.

83
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:19,521
At the bouton, there are present 
a set of voltage-gated calcium channels.

84
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:21,835
And so these are 
voltage-gated ion channels,

85
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:26,275
similar to the potassium and sodium
channels we've already considered,

86
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:29,400
except they conduct calcium ions.

87
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,408
And so they're activated by the
depolarization of the action potential,

88
00:05:33,408 --> 00:05:37,355
and the voltage-gated calcium channel 
then increases its open probability,

89
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:42,724
and allows an influx of calcium to occur 
into the presynaptic bouton.

90
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,370
That elevation in calcium concentration

91
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,230
causes the release 
of neurotransmitter that's stored,

92
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,920
and it's released 
into the extracellular space,

93
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,241
into the synaptic cleft.

94
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:59,284
There's some 50 nanometers 
of extracellular space here.

95
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:05,768
The neurotransmitter diffuses 
and binds to a neurotransmitter receptor

96
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:08,960
that's present
in the postsynaptic membrane.

97
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,545
For fast chemical synaptic transmission,

98
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:17,591
the binding of the neurotransmitter 
to the receptor

99
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:22,754
is onto a so-called
ligand-gated ion channel.

100
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,599
That's a protein, it's an ion channel

101
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,947
very similar to the other types of ion
channels that we've already considered;

102
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,319
but the open probability 
of this ion channel

103
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
is not gated by voltage 
or anything else,

104
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,385
but it's gated by the presence 
or absence of a neurotransmitter.

105
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:44,954
And so, that released neurotransmitter
binds to a ligand-gated ion channel,

106
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:48,984
and the binding of that neurotransmitter
increases the open probability,

107
00:06:49,058 --> 00:06:52,095
and that then causes an influx of ions

108
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:56,653
that then changes the membrane potential 
of the postsynaptic cell

109
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,688
and causes a so-called 
postsynaptic potential.

110
00:07:01,836 --> 00:07:06,761
The synapses are typically on dendrites

111
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:09,953
that are far from the somatic area 
of the neuron.

112
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,340
And so there's a dendrite
that connects the synapse,

113
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,044
and the flow of current 
from the postsynaptic potential;

114
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:20,143
and the postsynaptic current, then,

115
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:24,167
needs to cross the cable properties
of the dendrites

116
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:29,020
before it reaches the soma
and the axon initial segment;

117
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,168
and of course,

118
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:33,197
it's the axon initial segment
that forms the trigger point

119
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:36,207
for an action potential
in the postsynaptic cell.

120
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,288
And so, a typical postsynaptic cell

121
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:41,898
will have many hundreds 
or thousands of synapses.

122
00:07:41,898 --> 00:07:46,867
Some of them will be excitatory synapses;
some of them will be inhibitory synapses;

123
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:52,340
and the potentials here will be summated 
at the level of the axon initial segment;

124
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,068
and that will then be the place 
where the postsynaptic neuron decides

125
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,957
on whether it should fire
an action potential in turn;

126
00:08:00,227 --> 00:08:02,034
and if it fires an action potential,

127
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:04,821
the axon of that cell can then come back,

128
00:08:04,882 --> 00:08:07,775
and we'll have another process
of synaptic transmission

129
00:08:07,851 --> 00:08:10,971
with different partners 
somewhere in the brain.

130
00:08:11,231 --> 00:08:15,232
The process of synaptic transmission 
is extremely rapid.

131
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:19,424
The action potential has a time course 
of about 1 millisecond,

132
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:23,971
there's a short delay
for getting calcium into the bouton

133
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:26,698
and the release process
also takes a short delay,

134
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:29,640
but the postsynaptic potential
typically occurs

135
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,951
with a latency of within 1 millisecond
of the action potential

136
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:36,249
in the presynaptic terminal.

137
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:39,580
So, synaptic transmission 
is a very fast process,

138
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,891
and neurons can communicate 
with each other

139
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,673
on the millisecond timescale.

140
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:48,969
Synapses can be excitatory and inhibitory.

141
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,111
And here, we illustrate 
the two major forms of synapses

142
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,626
that are present 
in the central nervous system.

143
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:59,414
An excitatory synapse
typically releases glutamate

144
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:02,019
from its presynaptic specialization.

145
00:09:02,019 --> 00:09:05,960
That release of glutamate
acts upon glutamate receptors:

146
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,869
these are so-called
ionotropic glutamate receptors

147
00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:11,178
-- that is, that they're
ligand-gated ion channels

148
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,742
activated by the presence of glutamate --

149
00:09:13,742 --> 00:09:19,165
and the glutamate receptor is permeable 
to both sodium and potassium,

150
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,535
and they're a little bit more permeable 
to sodium.

151
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:25,687
The reversal potential
of these ionotropic glutamate receptors

152
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:27,931
is somewhere around 0 millivolts.

153
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:33,021
0 millivolts is depolarized
relative to action potential threshold,

154
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:36,680
and so the excitatory
postsynaptic potentials,

155
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,763
the EPSPs that are made
in the postsynaptic neuron,

156
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:44,735
tend to depolarize the cell 
beyond action potential threshold

157
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:47,721
and tend to increase 
action potential firing

158
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,547
in the postsynaptic neuron.

159
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:54,293
And that's why glutamate 
is an excitatory neurotransmitter.

160
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:58,610
The major inhibitory neurotransmitter 
is GABA,

161
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,952
and release of GABA 
from the presynaptic terminal,

162
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:06,640
binds to ionotropic GABA receptors, 
GABA_A receptors.

163
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,011
They turn out to be
conductors of chloride,

164
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:16,510
and chloride, as we know, is present 
at low concentrations intracellularly,

165
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,951
at high concentrations extracellularly;

166
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,001
and so chloride wants to enter a cell,
carrying negative charge with it,

167
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,057
causing hyperpolarization of the membrane;

168
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:31,742
and that then causes
inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, IPSPs,

169
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:34,242
that take the neuronal membrane potential

170
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,792
more negative
than action potential threshold,

171
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,270
and thus causing a reduction
in action potential output.

172
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,826
So we have excitatory and inhibitory types
of neurotransmission.

173
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:51,272
The structure of synapses
can be observed at high resolution

174
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:53,204
using electron microscopy.

175
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,006
Synapses turn out to be small,
typically smaller than 1 micron.

176
00:10:58,006 --> 00:11:02,078
On this scale bar here,
we have a 500 nanometer distance

177
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:07,667
and this synapse here, shown in the left,
has a size of about 200 nanometers;

178
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,003
and this synapse here is larger:
it has a size of about 500 nanometers;

179
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:18,160
and they're entirely typical synapses 
found in the central nervous system.

180
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,773
You will see the two compartments 
that we've already discussed.

181
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:26,415
There's the presynaptic membrane,

182
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:29,477
and there's the postsynaptic
membrane, here.

183
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:34,670
The distance between the presynaptic
and postsynaptic membrane is very short

184
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,851
-- it's on the order of 50 nanometers --

185
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:42,508
and you can also see that it's rich 
in this dark stuff here,

186
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:44,701
electron-dense material,

187
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:48,806
proteins that link the pre-
and postsynaptic specializations

188
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:51,800
and hold them tightly apposed
to each other.

189
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:57,557
Also obvious are these so-called
round synaptic vesicles.

190
00:11:57,557 --> 00:12:01,126
They're around 40 nanometers in diameter

191
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:05,157
and they're filled with high concentrations
of neurotransmitter.

192
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:08,439
And what the incoming
action potential does,

193
00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:11,257
is cause these synaptic vesicles,

194
00:12:11,257 --> 00:12:14,351
that are in close apposition
with the presynaptic membrane,

195
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,177
to release the contents
into the synaptic cleft.

196
00:12:19,207 --> 00:12:21,965
We see that schematically drawn here.

197
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:24,816
The action potential invades the bouton;

198
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:31,000
the synaptic vesicles are, in fact, 
enveloped by lipid membranes

199
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,274
just the same as the lipid membrane 
that we have at the plasma membrane;

200
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:39,553
and these lipid bilayer membranes 
also envelope the synaptic vesicles

201
00:12:39,553 --> 00:12:41,708
-- they're 40 nanometers in diameter --

202
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:46,443
and upon action potential firing,
calcium influx,

203
00:12:46,443 --> 00:12:51,916
the synaptic vesicles fuse their membrane 
with the presynaptic membrane.

204
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,487
That fusion of the membrane 
causes exocytosis;

205
00:12:55,487 --> 00:13:00,857
the contents, the neurotransmitter 
inside the synaptic vesicle, is released;

206
00:13:00,857 --> 00:13:06,285
and that neurotransmitter molecules
then diffuse into the synaptic cleft,

207
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,279
something like 40, 50 nanometers.

208
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,480
Their diffusion is rapid;

209
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,957
the neurotransmitter binds
to its ligand-gated ion channel

210
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:15,938
and causes a conductance.

211
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:20,522
The presence of these synaptic vesicles,
then, raised the idea

212
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:23,913
that synaptic transmission
might be quantal in nature.

213
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,241
An action potential 
might release a vesicle,

214
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,692
or it might not release a vesicle.

215
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:34,232
And so there could be a quantized,
all-or-none form of communication

216
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:36,124
at individual synapses.

217
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,144
And indeed, the first measurements
of synaptic transmission,

218
00:13:39,144 --> 00:13:44,309
at the frog neuromuscular junction,
by Sir Bernard Katz in the 50's,

219
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,209
showed exactly this:

220
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,961
that neurotransmitter occurs 
in quantized packages;

221
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,894
and this is schematically 
illustrated here.

222
00:13:53,894 --> 00:13:58,132
Here we have an action potential 
in a presynaptic axon;

223
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,150
it causes calcium influx;

224
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:02,061
the action potential is reliable,

225
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:06,196
but the synaptic transmission 
has failures.

226
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:09,971
So on this trial, 
there's synaptic transmission;

227
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:12,513
there's release of 
neurotransmitter;

228
00:14:12,513 --> 00:14:14,994
activation of the ligand-gated
ion channels;

229
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,191
a nice postsynaptic potential 
is formed here also.

230
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:22,768
But on <i>this</i> trial, the action potential 
failed to cause exocytosis,

231
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:25,165
and no substance was released;

232
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,994
and therefore, 
there's no postsynaptic response.

233
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:31,171
And here, there's again
a success; failure; success.

234
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:34,179
And you can see that these
have roughly the same size.

235
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,498
There's a little bit of variation 
in amplitude,

236
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:38,780
and that's probably because

237
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,303
there's different amounts
of neurotransmitter present

238
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:45,181
or because the neurotransmitter
reaches a little bit further

239
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:47,591
and can, perhaps,
activate more postsynaptic receptors.

240
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,799
So, there's some variability here;

241
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:55,444
but the major feature
is an all-or-none synaptic transmission

242
00:14:55,444 --> 00:15:01,134
caused by the all-or-none exocytosis 
of individual synaptic vesicles.

243
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:05,429
There's, then, some variability 
and randomness

244
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,640
in the process of synaptic transmission 
at individual synapses;

245
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,556
and therefore, if a neuron needs
to communicate

246
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:16,001
a very important message 
to another nerve cell,

247
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:19,406
then typically, it'll do so 
by having multiple synapses.

248
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:22,021
So if this is one cell, 
and this is its axon,

249
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,290
that axon might then
make multiple contacts

250
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,949
with a postsynaptic cell,

251
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,858
if it was going to make 
a very important message

252
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,867
that had to be reliably communicated.

253
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,648
And so this axon 
might come back and forth,

254
00:15:36,648 --> 00:15:39,310
and it might make 
many different synapses here.

255
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:44,030
And then the stochastic variations 
that occur at individual synapses

256
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,541
are then averaged out,

257
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:49,522
by having many synapses,
or many different active zones,

258
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:53,143
that then give rise
to a statistically average,

259
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:57,018
well-defined quanta amount
of neurotransmitter,

260
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,846
sensed postsynaptically.

261
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,842
So we've now seen 
some fundamental aspects

262
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:04,891
about how neurons 
communicate with each other.

263
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:10,528
Neurons communicate 
through chemical synaptic transmission,

264
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:13,692
where an action potential 
in a presynaptic cell

265
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:15,894
travels down the axon,

266
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:20,556
causes release of neurotransmitter 
from presynaptic boutons.

267
00:16:20,556 --> 00:16:25,447
They then act at postsynaptic 
ligand-gated ion channels

268
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:28,855
that cause postsynaptic potentials.

269
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:33,189
There are many synapses 
down a single axon

270
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,064
and one neuron 
releases the same neurotransmitter

271
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:40,408
onto many different 
postsynaptic target cells.

272
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:45,605
Equally, an individual neuron 
receives synaptic inputs

273
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,162
distributed across 
its dendritic arborization

274
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,520
from many other neurons.

275
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,840
Those synaptic inputs 
can be excitatory and inhibitory;

276
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,723
and what the postsynaptic cell 
needs to do

277
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:01,411
is to summate the excitatory 
and inhibitory conductances,

278
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:04,703
and see whether it, too,
should fire an action potential.

279
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:09,119
And that final integration 
occurs at the axon initial segment,

280
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:12,909
close to the somatic location of the cell.

281
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,835
And so the way that neurons 
communicate with each other, then,

282
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,050
is through large networks of synapses

283
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,022
passing messages
from one cell to another,

284
00:17:23,022 --> 00:17:25,944
integrating those specific messages,

285
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:29,456
and seeing whether
the resulting computation is sufficient

286
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,641
to drive an action potential 
in the postsynaptic neuron.

287
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:37,107
And all of this communication 
takes place at the millisecond timescale,

288
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:41,625
allowing rapid computations to take place 
in the mammalian brain.

289
00:17:42,615 --> 00:17:44,894
Now, although chemical synapses

290
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:48,326
are the most important signals 
in the mammalian brain,

291
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,870
they're not the only ones.

292
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,234
And in the next three slides,
we'll show three variations

293
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,930
on the theme 
of neuron-to-neuron communication.

294
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,987
The first aspect is that not all synapses,

295
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:04,239
and not all communication 
between neurons,

296
00:18:04,239 --> 00:18:06,932
occurs through chemical messages.

297
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:10,159
There are, in fact,
also electrical synapses

298
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,302
that are present
in the mammalian nervous system.

299
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:19,492
And so one neuron may have axon
and dendrite that looks like this,

300
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:23,920
and another cell may have axon
and dendrite that overlap

301
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,275
and, perhaps, in one location,

302
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,823
they come into close contact
with each other

303
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:31,272
and they might form
an electrical synapse.

304
00:18:31,532 --> 00:18:35,788
Electrical synapses are rare
in the mature mammalian brain,

305
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,394
but during early development,

306
00:18:37,394 --> 00:18:40,478
many cells are, in fact,
electrically coupled.

307
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:45,011
If we then take cell one
and inject some current into it

308
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:49,333
while we're making a recording 
of the membrane potential

309
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:52,665
of the cell through a glass electrode

310
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:55,321
-- so, we can inject the current
into cell one;

311
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,757
that will then cause
depolarization of that cell;

312
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:02,217
and its membrane potential;

313
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:06,239
and if these cells
are electrically coupled to each other,

314
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:12,557
then, in cell two, 
we will then also get a depolarization.

315
00:19:13,477 --> 00:19:19,448
The size of that depolarization, 
here in cell two, would be much smaller

316
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,533
than the depolarization
present in cell one.

317
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:25,082
There's quite a lot of resistance

318
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:28,632
at the gap junction coupling
between these two cells.

319
00:19:28,632 --> 00:19:34,095
And so the scale here:
if this, say, is 10 millivolts,

320
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:40,298
then the postsynaptic cell 
might depolarize by 1 or 0.1 millivolts.

321
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:42,120
So there's a big change,

322
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,877
a drop in potential 
across electrical synapses.

323
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:51,849
The electrical synapses 
are formed by specialized junctions,

324
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,201
so-called <i>gap junctions,</i>

325
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:57,775
where if this is the membrane of cell one,

326
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:02,791
and we have the membrane 
of cell two sitting close by it

327
00:20:02,791 --> 00:20:05,019
-- these could be axons or dendrites --

328
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:09,703
then, the way that they communicate
is through special proteins

329
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:12,286
that are sitting here
in the plasma membrane;

330
00:20:12,286 --> 00:20:17,801
they're present on both sides 
of the so-called electrical synapse;

331
00:20:18,201 --> 00:20:23,580
and they then create gap junctions,

332
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,319
where current can flow directly
between one cell and another.

333
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,368
Another important feature 
of synaptic transmission

334
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:41,560
is that there is a diffusive component,
where a presynaptic bouton

335
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,253
-- that's filled with neurotransmitters,
of course --

336
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:48,106
releases those vesicles

337
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:50,965
onto the postsynaptic
specialized structure,

338
00:20:50,965 --> 00:20:55,275
and activates an ion channel
-- ligand-gated ion channels --

339
00:20:55,275 --> 00:20:59,275
to cause postsynaptic potentials,
as we've already discussed.

340
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:03,492
But: that neurotransmitter 
will also leak out of the synaptic cleft

341
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:06,024
and go into the extracellular space;

342
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:10,132
and here, it can also bind 
to neurotransmitter receptors,

343
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:17,263
causing distinct actions at a distance
from the actual one-to-one synapse.

344
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,455
And so there's a highly specific,

345
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:22,531
one-to-one communication
of synaptic transmission,

346
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,520
and then there's a more general,
volume synaptic transmission,

347
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,005
where this neurotransmitter diffuses out;
of course, the concentration goes down;

348
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,837
and the speed of transmission
is also, of course, reduced

349
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,798
in this extracellular volume transmission.

350
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:42,144
But it is an important regulator 
of brain function

351
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:45,560
and, indeed, the extracellular
concentration of neurotransmitters

352
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,909
is likely to have important roles.

353
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:51,335
So, for glutamate and GABA,

354
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:56,352
the two main fast synaptic transmitters 
in the mammalian nervous system,

355
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,667
they have this fast one-to-one component;

356
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,154
and then, in addition, 
there's glutamate and GABA

357
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,211
that's present in the extracellular space,

358
00:22:03,211 --> 00:22:05,410
and that binds 
to different types of receptors

359
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,825
than are present in the synapse.

360
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,883
For yet other neurotransmitters,

361
00:22:11,073 --> 00:22:14,625
their only way of function 
is through volume transmission.

362
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,845
And, so for example,

363
00:22:15,845 --> 00:22:20,540
at a dopaminergic synapse 
or presynaptic bouton,

364
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,552
there's no postsynaptic specialization,
at all.

365
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:29,221
And here, the dopamine is simply being
released into the extracellular space,

366
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:33,231
where it can bind
to different dopamine receptors

367
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:36,263
that are present on a variety
of different membranes.

368
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:40,401
And so there are different forms
of synaptic transmission:

369
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,919
fast, point-to-point
chemical synaptic transmission,

370
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,092
driving the opening 
of ligand-gated ion channels;

371
00:22:47,092 --> 00:22:49,632
and a more diffuse volume transmission

372
00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:55,195
that typically operates through other,
slower biochemical signaling cascades.

373
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:59,196
As a final point, 
I would like to make a note

374
00:22:59,196 --> 00:23:03,101
that synaptic transmission, 
although largely unidirectional

375
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:09,269
-- that is, from the presynaptic bouton,
on to the postsynaptic membrane;

376
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,206
and so there's a one direction, 
the normal direction,

377
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:17,702
from action potential 
to postsynaptic potential --

378
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:20,272
is, by far, the most important form

379
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:22,897
of neurotransmission
and synaptic transmission;

380
00:23:22,897 --> 00:23:25,552
but there is also a retrograde signaling

381
00:23:25,552 --> 00:23:28,847
that has been discovered 
over the last decades

382
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:32,248
and that's likely to form
an important regulatory role.

383
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:36,737
And so dendrites
and postsynaptic compartments

384
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:41,748
can release neurotransmitters,
such as the endocannabinoids,

385
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:46,836
and other transmitters
such as nitric oxide.

386
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:52,808
And so it seems that the synapse
is actually bidirectional communication,

387
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:56,426
where the main direction
is from the bouton,

388
00:23:56,426 --> 00:23:59,072
releasing synaptic vesicles' 
neurotransmitter

389
00:23:59,072 --> 00:24:02,252
onto ligand-gated ion channels,
causing postsynaptic potentials;

390
00:24:02,252 --> 00:24:04,859
but retrograde signals 
are also important;

391
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:07,540
and they act on other receptors

392
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,647
and regulate the forward direction
of synaptic transmission.

393
00:24:12,557 --> 00:24:15,246
In still other more specialized systems,

394
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:18,495
for example in part of the olfactory bulb,

395
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:22,004
there's actually the situation
where two different dendrites,

396
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:24,239
dendrite one and dendrite two,

397
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:27,582
can communicate directly with each other 
through synaptic transmission.

398
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:32,489
And so, some dendrites actually have 
synaptic vesicles that can be released,

399
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:36,487
act upon neurotransmitter receptors 
in the postsynaptic dendrite;

400
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,636
that in turn causes calcium increases;

401
00:24:39,636 --> 00:24:40,680
and here, again,

402
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,368
synaptic vesicles clustered here
can then be released

403
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:49,420
and act as a retrograde signal
back onto the same dendrite.

404
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,826
And so dendrodendritic release
is also possible.

405
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:55,972
And so there's a number of different ways

406
00:24:55,972 --> 00:25:00,396
in which synaptic transmission
differs from its standard form;

407
00:25:00,396 --> 00:25:04,254
but these are specializations,
and the most important thing

408
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:08,485
is the standard,
unidirectional synaptic transmission

409
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:11,170
from presynaptic 
to postsynaptic neuron.

410
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,070
And so, in this lesson,

411
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:17,215
we've seen interesting aspects
of synaptic transmission,

412
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,880
how two neurons talk to each other.

413
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,525
Typically, in chemical
fast synaptic transmission,

414
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:29,211
the action potential 
invades the presynaptic bouton,

415
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:32,809
causes an increase 
in the calcium concentration,

416
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:34,660
and that rising calcium concentration

417
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,510
causes the exocytosis
of synaptic vesicles.

418
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:44,726
Small, lipid-bound vesicles that contain 
high concentrations of neurotransmitter:

419
00:25:44,726 --> 00:25:47,103
they're released into the synaptic cleft,

420
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:52,913
and they then bind rapidly
onto ionotropic ligand-gated receptors

421
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:56,199
that form ion channels
that increase their open probability

422
00:25:56,199 --> 00:25:58,553
in response to the neurotransmitter,

423
00:25:58,553 --> 00:26:03,205
causing, in turn, a change
in the postsynaptic membrane potential.

424
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:06,865
We then have excitatory
postsynaptic potentials

425
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,166
that tend to increase the firing
of the postsynaptic cell,

426
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:13,150
and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials

427
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,209
that tend to hyperpolarize
the postsynaptic cell

428
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:18,562
and reduce action potential firing.

429
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:22,770
Neurons receive excitatory
and inhibitory synapses

430
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,490
all across their dendrites,

431
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,000
and they need to integrate that

432
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,572
and decide whether to fire 
an action potential themselves.

433
00:26:29,772 --> 00:26:34,368
That action potential is then transmitted 
down the axon of that nerve cell,

434
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:37,868
and the nerve cell releases 
one type of neurotransmitter

435
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:40,008
from its presynaptic specializations.

436
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:42,843
It might release glutamate,
if it's an excitatory cell;

437
00:26:43,063 --> 00:26:48,053
or GABA, if it's an inhibitory cell;
or, if it's another type of cell,

438
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,700
it might release
more specialized neurotransmitters

439
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,079
such as dopamine, 
acetylcholine, norepinephrine,

440
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,657
or any of a large plethora
of neurotransmitters

441
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,012
that are available
for the mammalian brain.

442
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,596
In the next lessons,
we'll learn more

443
00:27:02,596 --> 00:27:06,512
about the molecular details
of neurotransmission.
