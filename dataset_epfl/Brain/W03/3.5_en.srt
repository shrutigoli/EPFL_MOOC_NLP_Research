1
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,742
In this video we're going to take a look
at the structure of synapses

2
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:11,129
using electron microscopy.

3
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:13,305
And to introduce you
to electron microscopy

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:15,634
I'd like to welcome Graham Knott,

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:19,009
who heads up BioEM at the EPFL.

6
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:21,855
He's a world expert
in electron microscopy.

7
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,868
Thank you, Carl,
and hello, everybody.

8
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:25,766
In this video I'd like 
to give an introduction

9
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:29,289
to how we use electron microscopy
to image biological samples,

10
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:31,902
and in particular I'd like to show you

11
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:34,663
how we prepare tissue
from the central nervous system

12
00:00:34,663 --> 00:00:37,719
for imaging with transmission
electron microscopy,

13
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,629
and scanning electron microscopy.

14
00:00:39,827 --> 00:00:44,110
So what we will look at is how we prepare
brain samples for electron microscopy.

15
00:00:44,598 --> 00:00:45,921
We'll look at also the principles

16
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,891
of both scanning and transmission
electron microscopy,

17
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:51,124
and at the end I will just introduce you

18
00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,274
to some techniques
of imaging volumes of tissue

19
00:00:54,274 --> 00:00:57,510
using the current electron
microscopy techniques.

20
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,451
If we start off by looking at
a micrograph of the mouse brain,

21
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,422
it's a section that has been stained
with a silver technique,

22
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:07,049
that reveals just a tiny percentage

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,743
of some of the neurons
contained in this material.

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,537
We can see neuronal cell bodies,

25
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:21,438
we can also see dendrites
protruding from the cell bodies,

26
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,005
and we can also see some axons
traversing through the material.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,578
But if we were to take
a tiny piece of this material

28
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,885
and image it in the electron microscope,

29
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:36,193
here I show a window of about 15 microns,

30
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,233
we would see an image
that looks very much like this,

31
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,666
showing a jumble of membranes

32
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,954
and very heavily stained
cellular structures.

33
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:48,302
Easily seen in this image
are mitochondria,

34
00:01:48,302 --> 00:01:50,424
that are seen throughout the material,

35
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,377
which essentially shows
axons and dendrites

36
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:57,104
that are lying in various orientations.

37
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:01,052
On the right-hand side,
we can see a very large dendrite

38
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:04,258
that has been cut almost longitudinally,

39
00:02:04,622 --> 00:02:09,015
and in it you can see two mitochondria.

40
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,543
You can also make out the thin shapes

41
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:15,957
of the microtubules

42
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:18,654
that run throughout structures like this.

43
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,082
If we increase the magnification,

44
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:26,391
and look just at a small
portion of the image,

45
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:28,708
for example, this region here,

46
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,748
you see on the right-hand side,

47
00:02:30,748 --> 00:02:34,245
we have a dendrite that's been cut
almost transversally,

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,653
containing a mitochondria,

49
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:40,592
and inside the mitochondria
we can see the cristae membranes.

50
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:44,967
We also have the microtubules in evidence,

51
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:49,057
but protruding from the dendritic shaft

52
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:53,007
we have this long, thin spine neck,

53
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:54,759
and on the end of the spine neck

54
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,992
we can see the head
of the dendritic spine,

55
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:01,804
and here we find a synaptic connection.

56
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:06,683
This is characterized by
a thick postsynaptic density

57
00:03:06,683 --> 00:03:09,648
and a thinner presynaptic density,

58
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:14,974
and this is typical of an asymmetric
or glutamatergic excitatory connection.

59
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,475
We also can see the synaptic vesicles

60
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:21,635
in the presynaptic part,

61
00:03:22,053 --> 00:03:24,063
and these are round, and clear.

62
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:30,562
The two synaptic densities
are separated by synaptic cleft,

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,095
and in the presynaptic part we can see

64
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:36,733
that the vesicles are accumulating here

65
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,900
around the active zone.

66
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:42,790
So with this technique we're able to see

67
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,047
much of the detailed
morphology of the brain,

68
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,132
such as the synaptic connections,

69
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:50,849
and I would like to explain how we're able
to capture images like this

70
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,846
from such fragile living material.

71
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,077
For biological structures,
we need to remember, of course,

72
00:03:57,077 --> 00:04:01,019
that they're mostly made up of atoms,
with a very low molecular weight.

73
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:03,644
Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen,

74
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,153
and there's very, very few heavy atoms.

75
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:11,788
And it's these heavy atoms that
interact mostly with the electron beam,

76
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:13,896
so we need to think about
staining our structures.

77
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:16,232
Of course most biological samples
contain water,

78
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,885
and we're going to be putting
the sample into a high vacuum,

79
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,773
so we need to think
about removing that water,

80
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:22,504
or at least stabilizing it.

81
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:25,042
We also need to consider
the intense heat of the electron beam,

82
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:26,666
and also the size of the specimen.

83
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,950
We have to make sure we have
a very, very small specimen

84
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,804
that's put into the microscope.

85
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,173
So the general scheme
for preparing biological samples

86
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,482
is first of all, we need to think
about the fixation:

87
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:38,434
we need to stabilize the structure.

88
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,908
We may need to think about
embedding it in a medium

89
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:44,291
in which it remains stable under
the intense heat of the beam.

90
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:46,802
We should consider sectioning the sample,

91
00:04:46,802 --> 00:04:50,220
and also we need to think about
the EM Imaging technique,

92
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,059
which we'll of course going to be using.

93
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,843
So, say, for imaging the brain
with electron microscopy

94
00:04:55,096 --> 00:04:57,908
we generally use a scheme
that's outlined here.

95
00:04:57,908 --> 00:05:00,414
We generally use a chemical fixation,

96
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:04,360
and after chemical fixation we then
use a staining technique, dehydration,

97
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,394
and then we embed them in resins,
these can be epoxy or acrylic resins,

98
00:05:08,394 --> 00:05:13,100
these can then be sectioned very thinly:
40 to 200 nm-thick sections,

99
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,794
typically in a transmission
electron microscope,

100
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:18,906
and then these are imaged
at ambient temperature in the TEM.

101
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,049
Of course there are cryofixation
techniques that we can use,

102
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:26,088
and we stabilize the structure,
obviously using very low temperatures.

103
00:05:26,088 --> 00:05:29,419
Then these frozen samples
can be embedded in resin

104
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,216
with a substitution technique,
or we can, in fact,

105
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:35,295
thin-section the frozen material directly,

106
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:40,215
or if we're actually able
to fix a very, very thin sample,

107
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,872
for example, a layer of water
containing very small particles,

108
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:48,062
we can directly image
a cryofixed sample in the Cryo-TEM.

109
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,216
However, the cryofixation
and cryo imaging techniques

110
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:53,847
are not something
I'll be discussing in this video.

111
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:55,068
So what about fixation?

112
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:58,492
Well fixation is the preservation
of freshly killed material

113
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:02,860
in a state that most closely resembles
the structure when living,

114
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,682
and for many thousands of years
we've understood

115
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:09,405
that we can use different chemicals
to preserve biological structure.

116
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:14,000
Typically, in the past, things like acids
and alcohols have been used

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,882
to preserve foods, for example,
for many, many months, and even years.

118
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:21,490
But this is a coagulation approach,

119
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,447
where proteins coagulate together,

120
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,803
and render them very immobile, very inert,

121
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,235
and they can be preserved
for a long period of time.

122
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,520
This is very useful for light microscopy,

123
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,698
but not very useful
for electron microscopy,

124
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:35,704
where we need to see ultrastructure.

125
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:38,118
Seeing the ultrastructure
we really need to use

126
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,064
a non-coagulative fixation approach,

127
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,253
and typically we use aldehydes.

128
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:47,256
Now the aldehydes that we use
are mostly things like formaldehyde,

129
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:50,454
and for electron microscopy,
we also use a lot of glutaraldehyde.

130
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:53,258
And of course one of the considerations
is that we need to introduce

131
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:55,946
the fixative very rapidly into the system.

132
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,924
So on the right-hand side
we see a fixed human brain,

133
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,359
and this has been fixed quite rapidly

134
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:05,670
by replacing the blood with fixative.

135
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,759
This clears out all the blood,

136
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,150
and it provides fixative
into the tissue directly to the tissue,

137
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,545
very, very quickly,
via the capillary beds.

138
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,476
So let's have a look at how aldehydes
fix biological material,

139
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:20,068
and essentially they polymerize proteins.

140
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,556
Here we have
the paraformaldehyde molecule,

141
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:27,542
which in water forms
this methylene glycol compound.

142
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:30,001
This then interacts with the amine groups

143
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,391
that are found on proteins

144
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:35,086
to form, essentially, a methylene bridge,

145
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,793
and it's this part of the protein molecule

146
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:41,064
that can then interact with
other proteins,

147
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:42,773
bind them together,

148
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:46,532
and form very, very long
chains of proteins,

149
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:50,896
and to polymerize proteins
into huge complexes

150
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,640
that can then trap lipids,

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,738
carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

152
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:59,457
This essentially binds them up
and renders them immobile.

153
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:03,486
In electron microscopy, we use also

154
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:06,449
the glutaraldehyde fixative,

155
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,754
and glutaraldehyde has these
aldehyde groups,

156
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,443
one at each end,

157
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:14,326
linked with this chain
of methylene bridges.

158
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:16,277
And here we have the opportunity

159
00:08:16,756 --> 00:08:19,366
to form much more cross-links,

160
00:08:19,686 --> 00:08:22,038
and therefore a much stronger fixation.

161
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:26,359
So now I'd like to show you
how we prepare

162
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:27,842
a piece of brain tissue

163
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:30,375
for looking with the electron microscope.

164
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,658
And here we have a mouse brain
that's been perfusion-fixed

165
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:36,298
with paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde.

166
00:08:36,727 --> 00:08:40,406
It's sitting in a petri dish with PBS.

167
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,000
So we take the brain,
and we just dry it a little bit,

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,859
take off the excess buffer.

169
00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:51,025
We then push it into a small holder

170
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:53,024
containing molten agarose,

171
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,545
and this agarose allows us then

172
00:08:55,545 --> 00:08:58,573
to just position it at
the right angle

173
00:08:59,954 --> 00:09:01,138
in the mold.

174
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,953
This agarose is then solidified on ice,

175
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,007
and after a few minutes
we can take it out of the mold

176
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:12,330
and then cut away the excess agarose

177
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:16,377
so we can get better access to the brain.

178
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:19,880
And once this block is of an ideal size

179
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,829
it can then be stuck
with superglue to a metal holder.

180
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:30,148
The metal holder is then placed
into the vibratome,

181
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,918
so it's then put into the bath
of the vibratome

182
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,964
that's containing a buffer,

183
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:40,526
and this machine simply contains
a vibrating razor blade

184
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:43,399
that moves across
the surface of the block,

185
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,683
cutting sections of the brain.

186
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:50,842
And this can cut sections of between
50 and a few hundred microns thick,

187
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:54,962
and it allows us to get access
to exactly the brain region we want,

188
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,102
with these very thin slices

189
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,755
that we can then image directly
under the light microscope

190
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:03,380
to actually check whether we're
in the right region of the brain.

191
00:10:03,526 --> 00:10:05,545
But if we'd imaged it
with a fluorescent microscope

192
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,811
we could also see fluorescent markers.

193
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:13,689
So these are placed into wells,
these plastic wells,

194
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:17,362
which we can image very easily
under a dissecting microscope,

195
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:21,215
and we can select
the sections that we want.

196
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,894
The process now is to first of all
wash the sections

197
00:10:25,461 --> 00:10:27,429
in buffers like cacodylate buffer,

198
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,625
which we use a lot
for electron microscopy,

199
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,827
which are very nonreactive

200
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:34,148
to some of the later
contrasting agents that we use.

201
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,527
And of course all this work
is done in a fume hood.

202
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:42,603
So at this point we need
to stain the material,

203
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:44,821
so we introduce heavy metal stains

204
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:47,572
into the fixed material,

205
00:10:47,572 --> 00:10:51,902
and typically, for electron microscopy,
we use osmium tetroxide,

206
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:55,673
which will stain very heavily
the membranes and the proteins.

207
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:59,443
We use uranyl acetate,
which typically is a very basic stain

208
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,582
which will reveal the DNA and RNA,

209
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:05,127
and we also use compounds
like lead citrate,

210
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:09,270
which will stain very heavily
glycoproteins like starch and glycogen.

211
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:11,635
So again, these are very toxic compounds,

212
00:11:11,635 --> 00:11:13,740
and we need to work in a fume hood.

213
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:18,258
The first process is typically
to introduce osmium tetroxide,

214
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,458
then we have a rinse of uranyl acetate,

215
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,228
and then we may use some lead staining,

216
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:26,636
but often the lead staining's
done afterwards.

217
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,331
And introducing these heavy metals

218
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,437
gives us these very, very
densely stained sections,

219
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:36,743
so they typically become black,
very, very opaque.

220
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:39,733
There's then a process
of removing the water,

221
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,473
so we dehydrate the section

222
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:45,131
through a series of increasing
concentrations of ethanol,

223
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,974
and then once we're in 100% ethanol,

224
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,652
we can then start to introduce a resin.

225
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:53,328
And here we see
we're using an epoxy resin,

226
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,639
and this epoxy resin
is mixed with the 100% alcohol,

227
00:11:58,129 --> 00:11:59,533
and over a process of many hours

228
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:03,088
the resin infiltrates
the tissue completely,

229
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:06,373
there's a removal of any of the ethanol,

230
00:12:07,206 --> 00:12:10,832
and this pure resin-embedded sample

231
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:15,083
is then placed onto microscope slides

232
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:18,371
which have a mold-releasing agent
dried onto the surface.

233
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:23,093
These are then flattened
with a microscope slide on top,

234
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:25,779
and this "sandwich,"

235
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:29,614
containing the sections
in between, in the resin,

236
00:12:29,614 --> 00:12:34,069
is then placed into an oven,
and the resin is polymerized at 60Γäâ.

237
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:39,169
This polymerization process takes
about 24 hours to fully harden.

238
00:12:39,594 --> 00:12:44,472
What we end up with
is a section of plastic, essentially,

239
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,309
in which we've embedded
our brain sections.

240
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,732
We can then place this
under a dissecting microscope,

241
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:52,974
and we're very easily able to see

242
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:55,508
the regions of the brain
that we're interested in.

243
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,885
We can then scratch the surface,
make a mark of the region

244
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:01,249
that we'd like to image
with electron microscopy,

245
00:13:01,249 --> 00:13:03,850
and then just taking a razor blade,

246
00:13:04,796 --> 00:13:07,734
we can cut away this region

247
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:10,915
from the rest of the brain section,

248
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:16,374
and this piece,
this very tiny piece of brain,

249
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:20,016
can then be stuck
onto a blank resin block,

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,999
again with superglue.

251
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,302
This blank resin block is then ready

252
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:31,488
for trimming and cutting
in the ultramicrotome.

253
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:35,671
So the first approach
is to very firmly hold it

254
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:39,484
in a sample holder of the ultramicrotome,

255
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,938
and then place it underneath
the dissecting microscope,

256
00:13:44,307 --> 00:13:46,202
and then, again with a razor blade,

257
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:50,340
just trim away any of the excess material
that we don't require.

258
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,600
Now this can be a long process,

259
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,803
to very precisely make a block
of the exact region needed.

260
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:02,667
This is then placed in the arm
of the ultramicrotome,

261
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:05,104
a diamond knife is then put in place,

262
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:10,120
and this diamond knife
has a very sharp 45┬░-angle blade,

263
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,333
as you see marked
on the side of this blue holder,

264
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,922
and the block then passes
in front of this blade,

265
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,038
moving forward at a few
nanometers each time.

266
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:21,803
And here we can see

267
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:26,051
40 nm-thick serial sections

268
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:30,158
being cut by the diamond knife,
and floating onto the water

269
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:33,895
that's contained in the bath
of the diamond knife.

270
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:35,639
We can then take these manipulators,

271
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,290
which are simply very fine hairs
stuck to wooden sticks,

272
00:14:39,888 --> 00:14:42,676
and these are able
to manipulate the sections,

273
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:46,177
and push the sections towards
the microscope grid,

274
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:49,999
or the slot grid, onto which
the sections will stick.

275
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,553
Now these grids, or these slot grids,
are simply an aperture

276
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:56,827
across which there's
a very thin membrane of polymer,

277
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:59,834
and the sections
will stick onto this aperture.

278
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:01,782
You can just about see the sections here,

279
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:04,768
these gold-colored sections,
sitting across that hole.

280
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,187
This is then dried for a few minutes,

281
00:15:07,187 --> 00:15:10,358
and then this is now ready
either for further staining,

282
00:15:10,358 --> 00:15:13,223
or for imaging in the electron microscope,

283
00:15:13,223 --> 00:15:16,266
so once the sections have dried,
we can also stain them again,

284
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:19,328
so post-staining of ultrathin sections,

285
00:15:19,328 --> 00:15:22,458
where they're held in a plastic holder,

286
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,175
and they can be then
flooded with different stains,

287
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,568
for example uranyl acetate
and lead citrate,

288
00:15:28,568 --> 00:15:31,322
to again stain structures like

289
00:15:31,322 --> 00:15:34,354
the RNA, the DNA, and also glycoproteins.

290
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:38,229
So we can consider
the transmission electron microscope

291
00:15:38,715 --> 00:15:41,453
as being very similar
to the light microscope,

292
00:15:41,453 --> 00:15:44,376
and instead of photons being produced
we have electrons,

293
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,470
which pass through
a condenser-lens system.

294
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:49,514
They then pass through the objective lens,

295
00:15:49,514 --> 00:15:51,700
and then through a projection system

296
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,926
which will then magnify the image

297
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,653
onto a screen or the CCD camera.

298
00:15:56,653 --> 00:16:00,319
We can have a very quick look
at a movie of how--

299
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,374
of putting the sample
into the electron microscope.

300
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:07,965
The sample goes into
the objective-lens system here,

301
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,837
the beam is then switched on,

302
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,826
and an image is then projected down

303
00:16:14,826 --> 00:16:18,186
onto the screen at the bottom.

304
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:22,470
And we can see here
that the heavily stained regions,

305
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,076
so the mitochondria, the membranes,
are appearing black,

306
00:16:26,076 --> 00:16:27,627
and the regions that are less stained,

307
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:30,723
the cytoplasm, for example,
is much lighter.

308
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:34,687
What we can do is just have a quick look
at how we do this practically in the lab,

309
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:36,740
and look at a movie of Stephanie

310
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,028
putting a sample
into the electron microscope.

311
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:43,630
First of all, we place the very small grid

312
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,327
onto the sample holder.

313
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,960
The grid is then clamped in place

314
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:51,434
so that it doesn't, obviously,
move in the microscope.

315
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:55,119
This holder is put in

316
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,137
at the level of the objective lenses.

317
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:00,528
It's then put in place,

318
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,953
and then into a primary position,

319
00:17:03,953 --> 00:17:07,229
where air is pumped out, and then
when that air is pumped out,

320
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,831
then it's placed right into
the column of the microscope.

321
00:17:09,831 --> 00:17:12,086
As I said, we have a microscope
where at the top

322
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:15,385
we have the cannon
producing the electrons,

323
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,061
we have a condenser-lens system,

324
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,623
then we have the objective lenses
where the sample goes,

325
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,257
we have the projection lenses,

326
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:25,166
and then, of course, we have a screen.

327
00:17:25,384 --> 00:17:27,553
And we can see this phosphorescent screen

328
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:30,817
is being illuminated
by the electrons falling on it,

329
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,965
and we can move this,

330
00:17:32,965 --> 00:17:36,648
the grid, around in the stage

331
00:17:37,294 --> 00:17:39,858
and see our sections, you can see
the edge of our sections here,

332
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,269
and if we turn up the magnification

333
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,427
we can already start to see
at fairly high magnification,

334
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:48,327
the structure that we have
in our thin sections.

335
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:51,247
Of course now with CCD cameras attached

336
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,361
we can look directly on a computer screen

337
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:57,251
at the samples in the microscope.

338
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,636
And here we can see at a low
magnification some brain tissue.

339
00:18:00,636 --> 00:18:02,143
As we turn up the magnification

340
00:18:02,143 --> 00:18:05,476
we can start to see much, much more detail

341
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:08,834
in our section,

342
00:18:08,994 --> 00:18:12,223
and here in the middle
we can have a synaptic contact,

343
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:14,380
an asymmetric synaptic contact

344
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,479
from our piece of mouse brain.

345
00:18:17,417 --> 00:18:19,817
So with this technique of
transmission electron microscopy

346
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:25,371
we can generate images,
like the one we see here of a section,

347
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,194
through this asymmetric synapse
on the spine head.

348
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:31,185
And we can get a lot of information
from just this two-dimensional image.

349
00:18:31,758 --> 00:18:35,840
Of course what we could do is get
serial images from the electron microscope

350
00:18:36,572 --> 00:18:40,403
and gather lots more information

351
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,913
from this type of material.

352
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:44,985
And here we have a series of images

353
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:48,471
through a piece of mouse cerebral cortex,

354
00:18:48,471 --> 00:18:51,509
and we can start to appreciate
the three dimensionality

355
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:53,539
of the features that we're looking at.

356
00:18:53,539 --> 00:18:56,734
In these serial images,
which are 50 nm apart,

357
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:59,024
because they're 50 nm-thick sections

358
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,574
we get an appreciation

359
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:03,810
of this very complex
architecture in the brain.

360
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,427
So that was transmission
electronic microscopy,

361
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:08,315
and for the last few minutes of this video

362
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:11,506
I would like to introduce you
to scanning electron microscopy,

363
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:15,630
because for certain aspects of imaging
volumes of biological material,

364
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,280
the scanning electron microscope
has really taken center stage.

365
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,530
Now the scanning electron microscope has,

366
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:25,900
as before, we have an electron gun
producing our electrons,

367
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,410
that then pass through
the condenser-lens system.

368
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,287
This then goes through, 
this very fine beam of electrons

369
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,066
goes through these scanning coils,

370
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:37,031
that then is able to put the beam,

371
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:39,617
and scan the beam across the sample.

372
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,204
Electrons that are produced are then
captured by different detectors

373
00:19:44,591 --> 00:19:45,999
to produce our image.

374
00:19:46,197 --> 00:19:52,141
So if we look at just a very simple
schematic diagram of how this takes place,

375
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:56,630
we have a scanning beam
that passes over the sample,

376
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,380
and this builds up an image

377
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,344
from the electrons that are produced
off the surface of the sample.

378
00:20:03,717 --> 00:20:08,786
So if we have a look at producing an image
in the scanning electron microscope

379
00:20:08,786 --> 00:20:13,564
we have the incident electron beam
that hits the sample,

380
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:18,685
and then this beam
can then produce electrons,

381
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,482
so secondary electrons
can be ejected from the surface

382
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:24,773
as well as other particles,
for example photons.

383
00:20:25,355 --> 00:20:27,739
And of course we're all very aware

384
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:31,194
of the type of image we can produce
with the secondary electron.

385
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:32,796
So here we have an image

386
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:37,378
of a neuron that's in culture,

387
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:40,472
so it's sitting on the surface
of the culture dish,

388
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,122
and we can see its general shape,

389
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:44,386
and we can see this process,

390
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:47,299
and some of the smaller
processes in the protrude.

391
00:20:47,777 --> 00:20:50,894
So this is giving us information
about the surface of this neuron.

392
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:55,445
So this electron beam,
that is incident on this sample,

393
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,602
as well as producing secondary
electrons and photons,

394
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:03,471
can also actually
interact with the sample,

395
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,299
and the electrons themselves
can be reflected out.

396
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,812
These are backscattered electrons.

397
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:11,596
Now the yield, the numbers
of backscattered electrons

398
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:14,808
really depends on
the nature of the sample.

399
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:18,772
And the denser and
the higher concentration of heavy atoms

400
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:22,295
means we get higher numbers
of backscattered electrons.

401
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,773
So if we have a sample here

402
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:27,604
with lots of osmium uranyl-acid,

403
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:30,155
uranium atoms and lead,

404
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,038
we'll get lots of backscattered electrons,

405
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,928
so very heavily stained samples
will give a high yield,

406
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,855
whereas if we just have empty resins,

407
00:21:37,855 --> 00:21:40,389
so in the cytoplasm,
where there's very little staining,

408
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,863
we will get very few
backscattered electrons.

409
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,737
In this next series of images,

410
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:51,354
in the top image we have
a secondary electron image

411
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:53,700
of the side of the edge of a block

412
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,263
of resin-embedded brain tissue,

413
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,174
and we can see the surface structure.

414
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:01,589
And in this little window here
we don't really see very much,

415
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,124
we see the surface.

416
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:06,625
In the second image we have
the backscattered electron image,

417
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,563
and in this particular window here
we can start to see

418
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:12,501
some of the structures
within the block itself.

419
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,641
From here we can just about make out

420
00:22:15,757 --> 00:22:18,021
what looks like a capillary.

421
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:19,365
So this electron beam

422
00:22:19,365 --> 00:22:21,339
that's able to collect images

423
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,815
from the face of the sample

424
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:26,057
can then be combined with an ion beam

425
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:28,209
that's able to then polish away

426
00:22:28,209 --> 00:22:30,606
just a few nanometer-thick layers

427
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,801
from the region that's being imaged.

428
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,196
And using a process of sequential imaging,

429
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:37,993
and then ion-beam milling

430
00:22:37,993 --> 00:22:41,800
in a focused ion-beam scanning
electron microscope,

431
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,556
we're able to take serial images
through the sample.

432
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:46,969
So now I'd like to show you a video

433
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:50,152
of how we use the focused
ion-beam scanning electron microscope,

434
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:52,612
or FIBSEM, at the EPFL.

435
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:54,087
Here's the machine,

436
00:22:54,087 --> 00:22:56,550
and we first of all take our sample,

437
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:59,508
and load it onto a carrier.

438
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:03,540
You'll notice that the sample has been
gold coated to improve conduction.

439
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:08,432
It's then placed into the loading chamber,

440
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,635
and then when the vacuum
equilibrates, the door opens,

441
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:15,981
and then we're able to slide it in
onto the main stage.

442
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:18,509
We can then lock this in place

443
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,247
and remove this loading rod,

444
00:23:22,927 --> 00:23:24,165
and once that's out of the way

445
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:28,038
we can then close the door
of the main chamber,

446
00:23:28,423 --> 00:23:30,283
and then start our microscopy.

447
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,088
Now through a CCD camera we're able

448
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:35,781
to just see an image
of our sample in the microscope.

449
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:39,200
We can then bring it to the right height,
just below the pole piece,

450
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,038
and then of course we need
to very carefully orient the sample

451
00:23:42,038 --> 00:23:43,585
at the right angle,

452
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:45,745
so that we're able to image

453
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:48,689
the region that we've preselected.

454
00:23:48,689 --> 00:23:51,164
Here you can see a higher resolution image

455
00:23:51,164 --> 00:23:53,130
of just the edge of this block

456
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,012
that we'll be using
the FIB beam to mill away.

457
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,565
At a high magnification
we see the block edge

458
00:23:59,565 --> 00:24:00,950
that's been carefully trimmed

459
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:03,486
so the region of interest
is close to this side.

460
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,506
This edge is then correctly oriented

461
00:24:05,506 --> 00:24:09,018
so the ion beam's able to scan
parallel to the edge that we see here,

462
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:11,445
and as the beam scans parallel to the face

463
00:24:11,445 --> 00:24:13,258
it also moves closer and closer,

464
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:15,148
and the thin metal coating
on the block surface

465
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:18,302
is slowly milled away,
leaving darker regions,

466
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:20,285
which is the resin below.

467
00:24:20,285 --> 00:24:22,029
And it's dark because
we have few electrons

468
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,340
being collected from these areas.

469
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,855
So this is the signal
from the secondary electrons,

470
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,901
but if we change to collect
the backscattered signal,

471
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,511
we get information
from just below the surface

472
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:34,139
of the embedded material,

473
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:36,687
and when the ion beam is being left

474
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:39,203
to polish the face for a few more minutes

475
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:41,411
we're able to see
the general tissue structure.

476
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:44,719
And here on the right,
and also at the top of the milled face,

477
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:47,198
we can see the dark shapes
of the blood capillaries,

478
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:51,214
but also some faint forms
of cell bodies in the lower half.

479
00:24:52,061 --> 00:24:55,242
At a high magnification we see
the heavily stained membranes

480
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:57,825
giving a very strong signal that
therefore more electrons

481
00:24:57,825 --> 00:24:59,991
are being reflected from them,

482
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:02,669
and in the cytoplasm appearing very dark.

483
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:05,457
We can use this procedure
of milling and imaging

484
00:25:05,457 --> 00:25:07,112
to get a large series of images

485
00:25:07,112 --> 00:25:09,903
through our resin-embedded
samples of brain tissue.

486
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:13,140
This is, of course,
a very automated procedure,

487
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,728
whereby the machine will mill away
a few nanometers with the ion beam

488
00:25:16,728 --> 00:25:20,234
and then switch the electron beam
to collect an image.

489
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:24,232
It then returns to milling once more,

490
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:26,980
and this can be repeated
many thousands of times

491
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:30,165
to collect a series
like the one I'm showing here,

492
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:33,202
that shows images through the CA1 region

493
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:35,491
of the hippocampus in an adult rat.

494
00:25:36,814 --> 00:25:40,525
Here the horizontal field width
is about 8 microns,

495
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:43,513
and each of the pixels

496
00:25:43,513 --> 00:25:47,635
has a size of 5 nm x 5 nm.

497
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:51,550
Now after each image the ion beam

498
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,668
removes about 5 nm of material,

499
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:58,033
so we can collect a series of images,

500
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,583
and each of the voxels,
or the 3-dimensional pixels,

501
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:06,328
has dimensions of 5 nm x 5 nm x 5 nm.

502
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:09,218
And at this magnification

503
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:12,199
just about all of the stained structures
are clearly visible.

504
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:16,020
We have here two large dendrites,

505
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:18,713
one on either side of the field of view,

506
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:22,207
and within them we can follow
all the microtubules.

507
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,817
We can also see
all of the synaptic connections

508
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,215
seen in this material,

509
00:26:28,215 --> 00:26:31,159
and we're able to identify

510
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,323
each of the vesicles
within the axonal boutons.

511
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:41,531
So by collecting this quality of images,
with these isotropic voxels,

512
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:44,312
we have the opportunity
to image large structures

513
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,837
at an optimal resolution

514
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,556
from which we're able to gather
very detailed 3D information.

515
00:26:50,965 --> 00:26:53,080
This then gives us the opportunity

516
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,975
to rebuild structures like synapses

517
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,981
in very high resolution, in 3D.

518
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:03,850
And here is a couple of images
from a figure of a paper

519
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:07,319
that we published recently from the lab,

520
00:27:08,239 --> 00:27:11,889
and what we've been able to do
is actually take a fluorescent structure

521
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:14,818
that was actually imaged
live in the mouse brain,

522
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:17,391
so here we have a 2-photon image

523
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:21,409
of an axon, an axonal bouton,

524
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:23,461
here we have a dendrite,

525
00:27:24,331 --> 00:27:27,483
and we can see
the dendritic spines protruding.

526
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:30,489
We're able to actually find this

527
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:34,120
back in our stack of serial sections,

528
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,336
and then Bohumil Maco in the lab

529
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:40,013
has done this very detailed
reconstruction of this axonal bouton,

530
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:44,223
and actually put together
this 3-dimensional model

531
00:27:44,223 --> 00:27:46,274
of the bouton itself,

532
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:49,487
we have the mitochondria,

533
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:53,705
and then all the synaptic vesicles,
the endoplasmic reticulum,

534
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,381
and of course the postsynaptic structure,

535
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:58,699
the dendritic spine
that wraps around this bouton,

536
00:27:58,699 --> 00:28:02,253
and we have the synapse
in red in between.

537
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:05,343
I hope from this short video
you've been able to understand

538
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:07,330
how we prepare biological material

539
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,681
for both imaging and scanning
and transmission electron microscopy,

540
00:28:11,681 --> 00:28:15,632
and how we can use these techniques
to get a very unique view

541
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:19,288
of structures like synaptic contacts.

542
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,094
Thank you.
