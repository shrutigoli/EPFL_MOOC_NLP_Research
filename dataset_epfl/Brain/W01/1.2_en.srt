1
00:00:04,079 --> 00:00:06,431
The overall goal of this course

2
00:00:06,431 --> 00:00:11,346
is to obtain a causal and mechanistic 
understanding of brain function.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,258
We will be taking a bottom-up approach,

4
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:19,575
and so the first thing we need to do 
is to look at the components:

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:22,027
what makes the brain.

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:27,581
Like every other organ of the body,
the brain is made of cells.

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,419
There are many types of brain cells,

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,692
and each performs its own function.

9
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:39,616
In order to get a causal
understanding of the brain

10
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:42,864
we therefore must study
cellular mechanisms.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,674
The cell is a fundamental
unit of organization of the brain.

12
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:54,884
A key defining feature of a cell
is the so-called cell membrane.

13
00:00:55,315 --> 00:01:01,054
It separates the inside of a cell
from the outside of a cell.

14
00:01:02,728 --> 00:01:07,233
When the cell membrane evolved,
some three billion years ago,

15
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,188
presumably its primary advantage

16
00:01:09,188 --> 00:01:13,330
was to offer a stable
intracellular environment

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,857
for biochemical reactions to take place

18
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:20,711
that wouldn't be affected by changes
in the extracellular milieu.

19
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,140
As we will learn,

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,657
the brain has evolved
to take exquisite advantage

21
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,455
of the electrical properties
of the cell membrane,

22
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:35,028
and has turned this into
a dedicated computational device

23
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,842
working on transmembrane currents

24
00:01:37,842 --> 00:01:42,211
changing the electrical field
across the plasma membrane.

25
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:46,283
The cell membrane
is made of phospholipids,

26
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:50,539
and this is a typical example
of a phospholipid.

27
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:53,632
It can be divided into two parts:

28
00:01:53,632 --> 00:01:56,895
a phosphate-containing head group,

29
00:01:56,895 --> 00:02:01,336
and long hydrocarbon chains.

30
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:08,000
These long hydrocarbon chains
are lipophilic, non-polar,

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,310
and therefore they are hydrophobic,

32
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,029
they don't like to interact with water.

33
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:15,515
On the other hand,

34
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:19,762
the phosphate head group
that's shown magnified here,

35
00:02:19,762 --> 00:02:24,030
that links through the ester bonds
to the hydrocarbon tails,

36
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,160
is highly polar.

37
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,523
It contains a phosphate group

38
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:33,825
with oxygen atoms that carry
strong negative charges.

39
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:38,249
These negative charges
like to interact with water,

40
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:42,965
and the head group
is polar and hydrophilic.

41
00:02:44,445 --> 00:02:47,922
Phospholipids have remarkable properties.

42
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:53,360
In water, they spontaneously form
a variety of stable structures,

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,281
a bit like droplets of oil in water.

44
00:02:57,032 --> 00:03:01,175
Of particular interest to us
is the fact that phospholipids

45
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:07,253
spontaneously form
planar lipid bilayers in water.

46
00:03:08,076 --> 00:03:12,158
In a phospholipid bilayer,
the polar head groups,

47
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,036
containing the phosphate group,
interacts and is close

48
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:19,814
to the aqueous phase of the solution.

49
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:26,817
The lipid hydrocarbon tails join together

50
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:31,491
the two leaflets of the membrane,
and form a lipophilic core

51
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:37,727
surrounded by hydrophilic edges
here by the polar head group.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,983
The phospholipid bilayer

53
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:47,014
then forms the membrane of the cell,

54
00:03:47,752 --> 00:03:51,007
separating the inside and the outside.

55
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:55,004
Importantly, as we look
at these static images,

56
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:59,918
it's useful to think that
actually, in the living cell,

57
00:03:59,918 --> 00:04:03,953
these are jiggling around
and diffusing at high rates

58
00:04:03,953 --> 00:04:08,641
in the two-dimensional
structure of the membrane.

59
00:04:09,727 --> 00:04:13,423
The most important feature
of the phospholipid bilayer

60
00:04:13,423 --> 00:04:16,868
is that it is only permeable
to lipophilic substances

61
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:22,099
such as gases, lipids,
and small non-polar molecules.

62
00:04:23,945 --> 00:04:28,677
The cell membrane has very limited
permeability to water

63
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:34,929
and, most importantly, the cell membrane
is impermeable to ions,

64
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:40,263
that is charged atoms,
and other charged molecules.

65
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:44,240
Ions are of enormous importance
in all biology,

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,002
but nowhere more so,
than in the context of brain function.

67
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:52,052
Ions are charged,
and it this charge of the ions

68
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:55,230
that forms the basis
of electrical signaling

69
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,910
in the nervous system.

70
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:02,274
That the cell membrane
is impermeable to ions

71
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:05,292
means that there can be
different concentrations of ions

72
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:08,120
on the two sides of the cell membrane.

73
00:05:09,053 --> 00:05:12,577
In a typical cell
there is a high concentration

74
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:17,854
of positively-charged potassium ions
on the inside of a cell,

75
00:05:18,574 --> 00:05:23,340
and on the outside of a cell
the extracellular solution

76
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,404
contains high concentrations
of positively-charged sodium ions

77
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:33,632
and high concentrations
of negatively-charged chloride ions.

78
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:38,334
So the extracellular solution
is made out of salt,

79
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,873
just like the salt
that we use in the kitchen.

80
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,830
The plasma membrane is very thin.

81
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,824
It's about five nanometers in thickness.

82
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:55,175
And this very small distance
allows the charged ions

83
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:56,898
on one side of the membrane

84
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,726
to interact, through electrostatic fields,

85
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,429
with the charged membranes

86
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:04,468
on the other side
of the plasma membrane.

87
00:06:05,173 --> 00:06:08,671
The fact that the ions can't move
across the membrane,

88
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,814
but that they can interact
through electrostatic forces,

89
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:18,403
means that the lipid membrane
is a capacitor, it's a dielectric,

90
00:06:18,403 --> 00:06:25,308
and there is electric fields that
are strong across the lipid membrane.

91
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,690
If ions are moved from one side
of the membrane

92
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,304
to another side of the membrane,
they generate an electric field.

93
00:06:33,739 --> 00:06:37,244
And the potential difference,
across the plasma membrane,

94
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,779
is called the <i>membrane potential</i>.

95
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:45,691
Membrane potential is of fundamental
importance to neuroscience.

96
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,974
That the lipid membrane

97
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,481
can be considered
electrically as a capacitor

98
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:57,040
means that we can also apply
some of the simple equations of physics

99
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,057
to uncover the membrane biophysics.

100
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,863
From physics we know
that the potential of a capacitor

101
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:10,856
is equal to the charge of that capacitor
divided by the capacitance.

102
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:15,287
And so by placing
different amounts of charge

103
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:18,145
on the two sides of the plasma membrane

104
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:20,525
we can generate membrane potentials,

105
00:07:21,198 --> 00:07:24,945
and the amount of the membrane potential

106
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,082
will depend upon the charge
and the capacitance

107
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,132
of the lipid membrane.

108
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,329
In this first lesson

109
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:35,794
we've learned that the cell membrane

110
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:41,154
is made of a phospholipid bilayer
that's impermeable to ions,

111
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:44,613
and is of about five nanometer thickness,

112
00:07:44,613 --> 00:07:46,813
allowing the cell membrane

113
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:49,930
to act as an electrical capacitor.

114
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:55,679
Charges separated on the
different sides of the plasma membrane

115
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,563
generate electric fields,
a membrane potential,

116
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,947
and this membrane potential
is of fundamental importance,

117
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:07,422
forming the basis of electrical signaling
in the nervous system.

118
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:12,122
Now I'd like to be a bit more specific,

119
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,647
and get to some numbers,
just some ballpark numbers

120
00:08:15,647 --> 00:08:17,953
from back of the envelope calculations

121
00:08:17,953 --> 00:08:21,291
so that you can see
approximately how many ions,

122
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:25,878
how much charge is involved
in generating membrane potentials

123
00:08:25,878 --> 00:08:28,894
and electrical signals
in biological cells.

124
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,459
The cell membrane
has a specific capacitance

125
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,478
that is a capacitance per unit area

126
00:08:37,478 --> 00:08:42,305
of around one microfarad
per centimeter squared.

127
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:48,411
The area of a cell,
of a small circular cell,

128
00:08:48,411 --> 00:08:51,367
with a radius of around 10 micrometers

129
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:54,192
means that the capacitance
of a typical cell

130
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,521
is somewhere around 10 picofarad,

131
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:01,604
a number useful to bear in mind
when you're thinking about

132
00:09:01,604 --> 00:09:05,302
how the membrane
biophysics of cells works.

133
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:10,294
Knowing the capacitance of a cell,
we can now calculate

134
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:13,593
how much positive charge
would need to move

135
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,593
from the inside of a cell
to the outside of a cell

136
00:09:17,593 --> 00:09:23,104
in order to generate
a membrane potential of -100 mV.

137
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,410
The outside of a cell, by convention,

138
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,752
is always fixed to be at 0 mV.

139
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,438
So we take our standard equation:

140
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:39,697
charge is equal to the capacitance
times the voltage.

141
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,501
We agreed that the capacitance
of a typical cell

142
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:48,962
was somewhere around
10 x 10╦å-12 farad,

143
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:54,136
and the voltage is 0.1 volts.

144
00:09:54,981 --> 00:10:00,265
This gives us a charge
of 10╦å-12 coulomb,

145
00:10:00,747 --> 00:10:03,838
and that is one picocoulomb.

146
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:07,931
So one picocoulomb of charge

147
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:11,287
needs to move
from the inside to the outside

148
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:16,680
in order to generate
a membrane potential of -100 mV.

149
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,047
How many ions does that correspond to?

150
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:27,318
So one picocoulomb of charge
needs to move

151
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:30,751
from the inside to the outside
in order to generate

152
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:35,185
a membrane potential of -100 mV.

153
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,606
Now the inside of a cell
contains a lot of potassium ions.

154
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:44,473
And so let's wonder how many
potassium ions it would take

155
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:48,584
in order to move one picocoulomb.

156
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,990
In order to make that calculation

157
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,838
we need to look at the charge
on each individual potassium ion.

158
00:10:56,418 --> 00:11:01,273
The potassium ions are monovalent,
they carry a single charge,

159
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:06,122
and that charge is then given by e,
the elementary charge:

160
00:11:06,441 --> 00:11:11,584
1.6 x 10╦å-19 coulomb.

161
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:16,215
And so in order to see
how many ions is in one picocoulomb,

162
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:19,753
we take 10╦å-12 coulomb,

163
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:25,843
and we divide it by 1.6 x 10╦å-19,

164
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,999
and that gives us a number of 6 x 10╦å6.

165
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:38,228
So six million potassium ions
need to move

166
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:42,057
from the inside of a cell
to the outside of a cell

167
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:47,228
in order to generate -100 mV
membrane potential

168
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:50,013
in a small typical cell.

169
00:11:51,138 --> 00:11:53,488
Is six million ions a lot?

170
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,633
Are there even six million ions
inside a cell?

171
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:00,118
Well let's find out.

172
00:12:00,413 --> 00:12:02,906
How many ions are there inside a cell?

173
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:09,518
A cell has a diameter
of around 10 micrometers.

174
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:16,591
The volume is then around one picoliter,
and in order to work out

175
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:20,737
how many moles of potassium
there are inside this

176
00:12:20,737 --> 00:12:23,353
we then need to know
the potassium concentration

177
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:28,613
and the intracellular potassium
concentration of a typical nerve cell

178
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:33,036
is sitting at around 150 millimolar.

179
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:39,840
So the number of moles of potassium
inside a typical cell

180
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:47,016
is then 0.15 x 10╦å-12,

181
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:53,318
and that is then the number of mole
in a given cell.

182
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:57,456
In order to find out
how many ions that is,

183
00:12:57,456 --> 00:13:01,332
we'll then need to multiply this number
by Avogadro's number.

184
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:05,410
And so the total number of ions, then,

185
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,012
is equal to the above number,

186
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:12,478
0.15 x 10╦å-12

187
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:19,697
x Avogadro's number, 6 x 10╦å23,

188
00:13:20,144 --> 00:13:22,655
and that gives us a final number

189
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:28,020
of 10╦å11 ions of potassium

190
00:13:29,777 --> 00:13:32,179
inside an individual cell.

191
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,609
So we found that we needed
to move six million ions

192
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:40,829
to generate the -100 mV
membrane potential,

193
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:45,130
but inside a cell we have 10╦å11 ions,

194
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,310
100 thousand times more than are needed

195
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,316
to generate the electric field.

196
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,896
This back of the envelope calculation

197
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:58,407
has told us a number of useful things.

198
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,994
Most importantly,
we find that only a small fraction

199
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:06,282
of the total number of ions inside a cell

200
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,846
need to move across
some plasma membrane

201
00:14:08,846 --> 00:14:14,205
in order to generate biologically-
relevant membrane potentials.

202
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,400
This means that electrical signaling
can be extremely efficient.

203
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,936
You can generate large changes
in membrane potential

204
00:14:21,936 --> 00:14:25,524
without changing
the intracellular concentrations.

205
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:28,553
As we will see in the next lessons,

206
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:33,307
the nervous system
has evolved specific mechanisms

207
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,209
to move ions across the plasma membrane

208
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,924
and rapidly change membrane potential,

209
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:41,542
and this forms the underlying signals

210
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:45,248
that drive brain function
and neuronal computations.
