1
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:06,934
In the last lessons we learned

2
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:10,804
that the phospholipid bilayer
of the cell membrane

3
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:13,989
electrically acts as a capacitor,

4
00:00:13,989 --> 00:00:18,192
and that transmembrane
ion channel proteins

5
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:22,249
act as conductances for specific ions.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,790
In this lesson, we'll see
how the biophysical properties

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,137
of electrochemical diffusion

8
00:00:30,137 --> 00:00:32,244
determine the membrane potential.

9
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:35,851
Let us begin by considering
a piece of membrane

10
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,473
with a potassium-selective
ion channel in it.

11
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:45,665
There are two main forces
that act upon the potassium ions.

12
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,124
As we've already discussed,

13
00:00:48,124 --> 00:00:52,278
there's an electrical potential
across the cell membrane,

14
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,025
the membrane potential.

15
00:00:54,261 --> 00:01:00,033
That membrane potential causes
an attraction or a repulsion

16
00:01:00,033 --> 00:01:02,332
for ions of a given charge.

17
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:06,553
If we have a negative potential
on the inside

18
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,449
then potassium ions
will be attracted inside,

19
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,763
down the electric-field gradient.

20
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:18,219
In general, there's a force applied
to any charged ion

21
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:22,841
that depends upon the spatial gradient
of the electric field.

22
00:01:23,553 --> 00:01:29,341
So one major determinant of ionic movement
across ion channels

23
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:31,705
is the electric field.

24
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:36,305
The other major push
that moves ions

25
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,093
from one side
of a membrane to another

26
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,111
is concentration.

27
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:44,842
If there's a concentration gradient
so that, for example,

28
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:47,829
potassium might be high
inside a cell

29
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:50,267
compared to the outside of a cell,

30
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:53,235
then naturally there's
a gradient for potassium

31
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:56,761
to flow down the concentration gradient.

32
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:03,128
The electrical and
the concentration gradients

33
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:05,684
are the two main forces

34
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:08,446
that drive electrochemical diffusion

35
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,700
across the plasma membrane.

36
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:16,209
The two forces: the concentration gradient

37
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,638
and the electrical gradient,

38
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,077
can oppose each other,

39
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:24,320
and can precisely balance each other out

40
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:29,130
so that at one specific membrane potential

41
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,844
it might prevent the overall
net flux of ionic flow

42
00:02:34,844 --> 00:02:38,380
induced by concentration gradients.

43
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,718
For example, for the case of potassium,

44
00:02:42,718 --> 00:02:44,949
which is very high inside a cell,

45
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:47,147
there's a natural tendency

46
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,543
for potassium to want to leave a cell

47
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:54,236
down its concentration gradient
of about 150 mM inside

48
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,932
to about 5 mM potassium outside a cell.

49
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:02,152
If we make the inside
of a cell more negative,

50
00:03:02,152 --> 00:03:05,951
then that will then try
to attract positive ions

51
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,475
inside the cell.

52
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:11,255
If we make the membrane
potential very negative,

53
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,880
for example -90 mV,

54
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,755
it's so negative that that precisely
counters the flow of ions

55
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:22,311
induced by the concentration gradient.

56
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,133
The reversal potential is the potential

57
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:29,822
at which there's no net flux of ions,

58
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:31,873
and that can be calculated exactly

59
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:34,535
from biophysical considerations.

60
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:41,408
The Nernst equation,
here described for potassium ions,

61
00:03:41,408 --> 00:03:48,408
precisely describes the relationship
of the potential at which an ion,

62
00:03:49,048 --> 00:03:54,291
given the intracellular
and extracellular concentrations

63
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,437
are in precise match,
so that there's an equilibrium,

64
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,516
and no net flux of ions

65
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:03,721
across the potassium-selective
conductance.

66
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:09,039
The Nernst equation describes
that the reversal potential

67
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,630
is given by the gas constant,
Avogadro's gas constant,

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,126
the temperature in kelvins,
divided by the Faraday constant,

69
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:21,428
and Z is the charge on the ion.

70
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,758
For potassium, that's +1,

71
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:25,991
for chloride, it's -1,

72
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,483
and for calcium, it's +2,

73
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:32,506
so that's the charge associated
with the ionic species.

74
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:37,980
RT over zF multiplies the logarithm

75
00:04:38,353 --> 00:04:43,508
of the ratio of the outside
to the inside ionic concentration.

76
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:47,639
At 37 degrees Celsius,

77
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,276
so that's at physiological temperatures,

78
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:54,835
RT over zF for a monovalent,
positively-charged ion,

79
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:57,335
and converting this
to a base 10 logarithm,

80
00:04:57,335 --> 00:05:01,945
gives us a 61.5 times base 10 logarithm

81
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:04,115
of the ratio of the outside

82
00:05:04,115 --> 00:05:06,910
to the inside potassium concentrations,

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,542
here we've set as 5 mM potassium

84
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,421
outside, 150 mM of potassium

85
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:15,734
inside. If we do the math,

86
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,356
we find out that that comes out

87
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:20,961
with a reversal potential of -90 mV.

88
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:23,926
That's the membrane potential

89
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,757
that's needed to counter

90
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,866
the concentration gradient

91
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:30,607
that tries to drive potassium out.

92
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,839
We counter that by having
a negative potential on the inside

93
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,644
that tries to attract
the potassium channels in,

94
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:40,495
and at this potential,
with these concentrations,

95
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:43,401
it's precisely balanced,
it's at equilibrium,

96
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:46,606
at the Nernst equilibrium potential.

97
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,907
Although potassium is
the most important ion

98
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:53,237
in determining membrane potential,

99
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:55,470
it is certainly not the only one.

100
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:57,089
And so we need to find out

101
00:05:57,089 --> 00:06:00,471
what the relevant biological
concentrations are

102
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,809
of ions on the intracellular
and extracellular side.

103
00:06:05,624 --> 00:06:09,796
And in general,
these are approximate values,

104
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,917
but are entirely indicative.

105
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,574
The potassium ions are high
intracellularly at about 150 mM,

106
00:06:17,574 --> 00:06:21,079
and extracellularly low at about 4 mM.

107
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:26,791
Sodium ions are low inside cells,
around 12 mM,

108
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,781
and extracellularly they're high,

109
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:31,361
at somewhere around 140 mM.

110
00:06:32,088 --> 00:06:35,459
Chloride concentration
is also low inside cells,

111
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,093
around 4 or 5 mM,

112
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:40,942
and extracellularly is high
at around 120 mM.

113
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,671
Calcium ions are low inside cells,
at about 100 nM,

114
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:53,327
and much higher outside,
around 1-2 mM outside cells.

115
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:58,046
These concentrations,
inside and outside,

116
00:06:58,046 --> 00:07:02,222
can then be plugged into
the Nernst equilibrium potential

117
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:05,527
to define the reversal potentials

118
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:08,095
of these different ionic species.

119
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:11,796
As before, we see that
the reversal potential

120
00:07:11,796 --> 00:07:15,985
for potassium ions is very negative.

121
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:19,696
The sodium ions
have positive reversal potentials,

122
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,310
and the reason is that
the relative concentrations

123
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,177
of sodium and potassium
are opposite to each other.

124
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:30,505
Potassium concentrations
are high inside the cell,

125
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,591
and so potassium wants to leave the cell.

126
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:36,694
In order to counter
that concentration gradient

127
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:39,053
of potassium wanting to leave the cell,

128
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,167
we can apply a negative potential

129
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:43,548
to try and attract
those positive ions back

130
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:45,766
to reach a equilibrium situation

131
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:49,072
where potassium has no net flux

132
00:07:49,072 --> 00:07:51,790
through potassium-selective ion channels.

133
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,276
For sodium, the situation's different.

134
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,665
We have a high extracellular
concentration of sodium.

135
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:00,715
Sodium wants to flow inside a cell,

136
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,359
and in order to prevent that flux

137
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,920
we would have to have
a positive potential inside a cell

138
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,743
that would then repel
the positively-charged sodium ions,

139
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:13,335
and so we have a positive
reversal potential for sodium.

140
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:18,175
For chloride we have a similar situation
as with sodium,

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:22,642
in that it's high extracellularly,
and low intracellularly,

142
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:28,753
so chloride, through its diffusion
down the concentration gradient,

143
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:30,168
wants to enter a cell,

144
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:33,560
and bring negative charges inside a cell,

145
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,788
and in order to prevent that,

146
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,206
we would then have to have
a negative potential

147
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:40,427
that would then repel
the negatively-charged chloride ions

148
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:41,957
from entering the cell.

149
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:45,850
And, finally, calcium has an enormous
concentration gradient,

150
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,356
10,000 times more calcium
outside a cell than inside,

151
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:53,064
and that then naturally means

152
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,636
that whenever a calcium conductance opens,

153
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,847
calcium flows inside the cell,

154
00:08:57,847 --> 00:09:00,068
and you need to go
to very positive potentials

155
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:04,042
in order to reverse the effect
of a calcium conductance.

156
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,053
In general, a cell has permeability
to many different types of ions.

157
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:17,348
And so there are permeabilities
to potassium, sodium and chloride

158
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:22,035
that are all mixed on the plasma
membrane of a single cell.

159
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,931
And indeed, an individual ion channel,

160
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:29,252
although primarily selective
for, say, potassium,

161
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:32,926
would also have some degree
of permeability for other ions,

162
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:35,957
and so even a single ion channel opening

163
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:38,611
doesn't have a reversal potential

164
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,594
that's exactly that of
an individual ionic species,

165
00:09:42,594 --> 00:09:44,831
but rather it would be
a mixed permeability

166
00:09:44,831 --> 00:09:47,348
of several different ions.

167
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:51,452
In order to calculate
the equilibrium potentials

168
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:56,089
when there are permeabilities
to several different ions,

169
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,838
one can use
the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation,

170
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:04,198
which is a modified version
of the Nernst potential.

171
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:07,251
And it states that
the equilibrium potential

172
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:11,101
is equal to RT over F again

173
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:16,920
times a natural logarithm
of the permeability to potassium

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,191
times the extracellular
potassium concentration,

175
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,148
plus the permeability to sodium

176
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:25,041
times the extracellular
sodium concentration,

177
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,283
plus the permeability to chloride

178
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:30,943
times the intracellular
chloride concentration

179
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,256
divided by the permeability to potassium

180
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:36,009
times the intracellular
concentration of potassium

181
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:38,262
plus the permeability to sodium

182
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,602
times the intracellular
sodium concentration

183
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,294
plus the permeability to choride

184
00:10:42,294 --> 00:10:46,204
times the extracellular
chloride concentration.

185
00:10:46,748 --> 00:10:52,020
Note that whereas here we have
the extracellular concentration

186
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,147
for the positively charged cations
of potassium and sodium,

187
00:10:57,147 --> 00:11:00,979
here we have the intracellular
concentration of chloride,

188
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:03,451
because this is negatively charged.

189
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:08,514
As an example we can consider a cell

190
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:15,264
that has a relative permeability ratio
of potassium, to sodium to chloride

191
00:11:15,264 --> 00:11:18,965
of 1 to .04 to .45.

192
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:22,780
So this would be a cell that has
a high potassium conductance,

193
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,416
a much lower sodium conductance,

194
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,951
and an intermediate chloride conductance.

195
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,939
If we plug the numbers in,

196
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:36,045
and the concentrations
from the previous slide,

197
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:40,798
we reach a situation where
the equilibrium potential

198
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:46,428
for this particular cell,
with a high potassium permeability

199
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:48,275
and a high chloride permeability

200
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:53,306
has a membrane potential
of around -76 mV.

201
00:11:53,675 --> 00:11:56,992
And so in this case we have
a negative membrane potential,

202
00:11:56,992 --> 00:11:59,005
and that's because our permeability

203
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:02,479
is dominated by potassium and chloride.

204
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:07,754
Potassium has a high concentration
inside a cell, it wants to leave,

205
00:12:07,754 --> 00:12:10,379
and so that creates negative charges.

206
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,279
Chloride has a high
concentration outside cells,

207
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,806
and therefore wants to enter,
again bringing in negative charges.

208
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:24,391
And so you can see that
at resting conditions, at equilibrium,

209
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:29,668
we would expect hyperpolarized,
negative membrane potentials,

210
00:12:29,668 --> 00:12:34,327
sitting somewhere close to the potassium
and chloride reversal potentials,

211
00:12:34,327 --> 00:12:37,484
in this case -76 mV.

212
00:12:38,878 --> 00:12:43,872
We can now also return
to our electrical model of a cell.

213
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,087
As before, we have membrane capacitance

214
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,849
formed by the lipid bilayers.

215
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:55,752
We have ionic conductances

216
00:12:55,752 --> 00:13:00,637
where we now add the reversal potentials
for the individual species,

217
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:03,266
so we have a potassium conductance

218
00:13:03,266 --> 00:13:05,937
with a reversal potential of potassium,

219
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:08,709
and that's here,
this potassium ion channel.

220
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,967
We have sodium conductances
with the reversal potential of sodium

221
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:15,043
going through the sodium ion channels,

222
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,776
and we have chloride conductances,

223
00:13:17,776 --> 00:13:19,288
chloride ion channels,

224
00:13:19,288 --> 00:13:22,703
again with their own reversal potential.

225
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:28,941
We can use our two
simple electrical equations

226
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,898
to derive some interesting facts

227
00:13:30,898 --> 00:13:34,288
about how the membrane potential behaves.

228
00:13:34,757 --> 00:13:36,934
We can use Ohm's law,

229
00:13:36,934 --> 00:13:40,129
thinking about the ionic conductances

230
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:45,144
where we have the voltage is equal to
the current flow times the resistance,

231
00:13:45,144 --> 00:13:49,844
and we know that the resistance
is 1 over the conductance,

232
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:52,710
so we can rewrite that,
and say that the current flow

233
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,359
is equal to the voltage
times the conductance.

234
00:13:55,657 --> 00:14:02,471
And for the capacitance we know
that the charge stored in a capacitor

235
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:04,853
is equal to the capacitance
times the voltage.

236
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:07,285
We also know that a current

237
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:11,991
is equal to the rate of change of charge.

238
00:14:12,356 --> 00:14:14,422
And so we can differentiate this equation

239
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,802
to give us the capacitative current flow,

240
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,796
which is equal to the derivative of this.

241
00:14:19,796 --> 00:14:22,838
The capacitance times dV by dt.

242
00:14:23,826 --> 00:14:28,016
If we now think about
the electrical circuit of the cell

243
00:14:28,016 --> 00:14:33,362
we can say that the total
transmembrane current, Im,

244
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:36,800
can be composed
of four different channels.

245
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,566
There's the capacitative current, Ic.

246
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,875
We have a potassium current, Ik.

247
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,792
We have a sodium current, INa,

248
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,953
and we have a chloride current, ICl.

249
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,199
And that's what we have here,

250
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,769
we simply sum up
these different conductances.

251
00:14:54,634 --> 00:14:57,723
Now we've already said that
the capacitative conductance

252
00:14:57,723 --> 00:14:59,999
is equal to C, dV, dt.

253
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,101
We can, by inspection, see that
the potassium conductance

254
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,961
is equal to the difference between
the membrane potential

255
00:15:07,961 --> 00:15:11,633
and the reversal potential of potassium

256
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,837
times the potassium conductance,

257
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:18,001
and so on for sodium and for chloride.

258
00:15:20,747 --> 00:15:24,729
At the membrane potential
that is equal to the reversal potential,

259
00:15:24,729 --> 00:15:28,797
there's no current flux, as expected.

260
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,991
Now, we can put these equations together

261
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:35,303
and solve for membrane potential,

262
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:39,677
and we can do it
under one interesting condition,

263
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,683
the steady-state equilibrium condition

264
00:15:42,683 --> 00:15:45,133
where the total
transmembrane current is zero,

265
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:50,239
and by definition, the rate of change
of membrane potential is also zero.

266
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,164
In order just to simplify
the writing of our equations,

267
00:15:54,164 --> 00:15:57,891
we can consider the total
conductance of the cell

268
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:02,407
as being the sum of the potassium,
sodium and chloride conductances.

269
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:07,627
The solution to the equation
we presented on the previous slide

270
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,845
then has that the membrane potential

271
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,864
is equal to the ratio
of the potassium conductance,

272
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,936
relative to the total conductance

273
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:18,562
times the reversal potential of potassium

274
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,308
plus the ratio of the sodium conductance
to the total conductance

275
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,292
times the reversal potential of sodium

276
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:30,521
plus the ratio of the chloride conductance
to the total conductance

277
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,572
times the reversal potential of chloride.

278
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:36,824
So in order to change
the membrane potential,

279
00:16:36,824 --> 00:16:41,248
what we have to do is to change
the relative importance

280
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,982
of each of these ionic conductances.

281
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,751
If we want to have a membrane potential

282
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,909
that's quite close to
the reversal potential of potassium,

283
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:54,750
then the potassium conductance
should dominate the total conductance.

284
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,475
Similarly, if we want to have
a membrane potential

285
00:16:59,475 --> 00:17:03,151
that begins to approach
the reversal potential of sodium,

286
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:05,689
then the sodium conductance
should dominate

287
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:08,107
the total conductance of the cell.

288
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:11,038
By inspecting this equation

289
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,525
you can see that it's very easy to change
the membrane potential of a cell.

290
00:17:15,525 --> 00:17:18,693
All you need to do
is to change the conductance

291
00:17:18,693 --> 00:17:23,233
of different ionic species,

292
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:26,348
and you'll change the membrane potential,

293
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:30,126
forcing it towards these
different reversal potentials

294
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:34,468
that are being driven to
by the conductances.

295
00:17:35,528 --> 00:17:39,119
So we've now seen
that simple biophysical laws

296
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,916
determine electrochemical diffusion.

297
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:46,517
Concentration gradients
and electrical fields

298
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:50,805
determine the flux of ions
across the plasma membrane.

299
00:17:51,383 --> 00:17:56,208
We can define reversal potentials
given by the Nernst potential,

300
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,336
and we can see that it's easy

301
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:02,023
to move the membrane potential
from one value to another

302
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:04,848
by simply changing
the relative permeability

303
00:18:04,848 --> 00:18:06,204
of the plasma membrane

304
00:18:06,204 --> 00:18:08,972
to specific ionic species,

305
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:11,651
each of which have their own
reversal potential,

306
00:18:11,651 --> 00:18:14,585
determined by their
concentration gradients.

307
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:18,049
Let's next consider
some specific examples,

308
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,706
and get towards
some numbers and dynamics

309
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:23,886
as to how membrane potential changes

310
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,141
when ion channels open.

311
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:29,710
Let's consider what happens
if potassium channels

312
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,839
suddenly increase their open probability.

313
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:37,686
Let's imagine we start off
with a simple situation

314
00:18:37,686 --> 00:18:42,279
where the membrane potential
is at 0 mV initially.

315
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:45,378
We have a potassium-rich intracellular,

316
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:50,671
and lower concentration
of potassium outside the cell.

317
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:54,757
A potassium conductance suddenly opens,

318
00:18:54,757 --> 00:18:57,716
and of course potassium ions
want to leave,

319
00:18:57,716 --> 00:19:00,024
and go down the concentration gradient,

320
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:03,312
and create a negative potential inside.

321
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,419
We've just learned
that there's a potential

322
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,594
to which the membrane
potential will tend to.

323
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:11,260
The membrane potential will go

324
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,384
towards the reversal
potential for potassium,

325
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:18,945
which is around -90 mV.

326
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,582
But let's think about
the dynamics of the situation.

327
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,993
If we have time running here,

328
00:19:25,993 --> 00:19:29,420
we begin and think about
the potassium conductance.

329
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,815
It starts off low, and at some stage
it suddenly jumps up.

330
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:38,053
Membrane potential we say starts at 0 mV,

331
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,452
and we know that at equilibrium

332
00:19:40,452 --> 00:19:43,659
it's going down to the reversal
potential of potassium,

333
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:46,135
at around -90 mV.

334
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:49,089
What are the dynamics?

335
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,509
How does the membrane potential

336
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,638
reach the equilibrium potential
for potassium?

337
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:58,952
Let's return to our
electrical equivalent of a cell,

338
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:00,953
where we have a capacitance,

339
00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:05,762
and we have a conductance.

340
00:20:06,728 --> 00:20:11,364
And together they define
the membrane potential and its dynamics.

341
00:20:12,037 --> 00:20:14,699
We then have a potassium
reversal potential,

342
00:20:14,699 --> 00:20:17,294
and we have a resistor or a conductor,

343
00:20:17,294 --> 00:20:20,361
depending on how
we want to think about it.

344
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,748
We know from capacitor equation
that Q is equal to CV,

345
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:31,123
and that the current flowing
in the capacitator is a derivative,

346
00:20:31,123 --> 00:20:36,599
the rate of change of charge
over time: C, dV by dt.

347
00:20:37,378 --> 00:20:39,943
We also know that the membrane potential,

348
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:43,504
from considering this arm of the equation,

349
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:51,399
that the membrane potential
is equal to E + IR.

350
00:20:51,801 --> 00:20:55,485
That's simply just the Ohm's law here,

351
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,646
if we consider this as a resistor here,

352
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:59,632
just for the sake of simplicity.

353
00:21:00,477 --> 00:21:04,068
Now this current
that's flowing through here,

354
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:06,311
in this particular case
that we're thinking about,

355
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,017
is actually the capacitative current.

356
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:20,460
We can therefore rewrite this equation
as V equals -RC, dv by dt,

357
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,809
and the minus sign is because
they're flying in opposite directions,

358
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:26,155
in terms of the electrical
circuit diagram.

359
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:28,837
You can solve this equation,

360
00:21:29,608 --> 00:21:32,510
and because it's a differential equation

361
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,953
you expect to find
exponentials present in it,

362
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:39,813
and you find out that the solution
can be written in this form.

363
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:45,770
Here ≡¥₧â (tau) is a membrane time constant,

364
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,957
which is equal to the resistance
times the capacitance.

365
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:53,663
You can check this equation,
of course, by plugging it in

366
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:56,494
and seeing that it comes out correct.

367
00:21:57,307 --> 00:22:00,576
So what we see, from this equation here,

368
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:07,159
is that at time zero,
the membrane potential is indeed 0.

369
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:11,806
At time infinite, this disappears,

370
00:22:11,806 --> 00:22:14,932
and we reach the reversal
potential for potassium,

371
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:18,387
and in between we have
an exponential time course

372
00:22:18,387 --> 00:22:23,571
that then brings us to the reversal
potential of potassium,

373
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:29,588
and that is characterized
by a time scale ≡¥₧â (tau),

374
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:35,267
over which it goes to 1 over e
of the membrane potential,

375
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,529
so that's about 63 percent.

376
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:41,059
That time course, ≡¥₧â (tau),

377
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:45,134
is given by the resistance
times the capacitance,

378
00:22:45,542 --> 00:22:49,026
which is also the capacitance
divided by the conductance.

379
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:54,847
So the rate of change
of membrane potential in a cell

380
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,291
is determined by a number
of different factors.

381
00:23:00,387 --> 00:23:07,471
If the cell has a high resistance,
a low conductance,

382
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,346
then the time course is long,

383
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:13,117
it takes a long time to change.

384
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:16,417
If the capacitance is high,

385
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,091
then it also takes a long time to change,

386
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:21,230
and both of those factors make sense.

387
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,685
If there's very little conductance
then it takes time to move

388
00:23:24,685 --> 00:23:27,245
sufficient charge to change
the membrane potential.

389
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:30,777
If the capacitor's very large,
we need a lot of ions

390
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:33,245
to change the membrane potential.

391
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:35,814
This equation, then, tells us also

392
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:39,139
that membrane potential
can't change instantaneously,

393
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:42,465
rather it changes with a time scale

394
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:48,102
that is equal to RC,
the membrane time constant.

395
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,902
In general, of course,
potassium conductances

396
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:56,614
aren't the only important
conductance in a cell,

397
00:23:56,614 --> 00:24:00,436
and we have to consider
both potassium, sodium,

398
00:24:00,436 --> 00:24:02,401
and chloride conductance changes

399
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:06,793
if we want to understand
how the membrane potential moves.

400
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:12,036
We know that at equilibrium,
membrane potential

401
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:16,395
will be driven towards
the potassium reversal potential,

402
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:18,928
if the potassium conductance increases.

403
00:24:18,928 --> 00:24:23,264
It'll be driven towards
the sodium reversal potential,

404
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,709
if sodium conductance increases.

405
00:24:25,709 --> 00:24:30,980
It'll be driven towards
the chloride reversal potential,

406
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,645
if a chloride conductance increases.

407
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:39,522
And, typically, this is sitting at +60 mV,
-90 mV for potassium

408
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:43,691
and around -70 mV for chloride.

409
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:51,050
If we then begin with a membrane potential
sitting at -55 mV,

410
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,751
and that's our membrane potential,

411
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:57,842
and we open a sodium conductance

412
00:24:57,842 --> 00:25:00,541
then with an exponential time cross

413
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:03,747
we head towards
the sodium reversal potential.

414
00:25:03,747 --> 00:25:07,863
Again, this membrane potential
doesn't occur instantaneously,

415
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:11,847
but depends upon
the membrane time constant RC.

416
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,970
If we open a chloride conductance

417
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,339
then the membrane potential

418
00:25:16,339 --> 00:25:19,428
tends towards the chloride
reversal potential,

419
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:22,614
and so on, also,
for the potassium conductance.

420
00:25:23,734 --> 00:25:26,209
So we can move membrane potential

421
00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:30,360
by simply opening
the conductance for sodium,

422
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,243
and then it goes towards
the sodium reversal potential,

423
00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:36,930
towards the chloride reversal potential,

424
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,565
or towards the potassium
reversal potential.

425
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:46,373
In general, if we make
the membrane potential more positive,

426
00:25:46,373 --> 00:25:49,457
this is called a depolarization.

427
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:55,226
And if we make the membrane
potential more negative,

428
00:25:55,226 --> 00:25:59,032
then it's called a hyperpolarization,

429
00:26:00,022 --> 00:26:03,043
and these are terminologies
that we'll consider

430
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,972
and talk about a lot in the next lessons.

431
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:11,274
Depolarization for more positive
membrane potentials,

432
00:26:11,274 --> 00:26:14,664
and hyperpolarization
for more negative potentials.

433
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:17,504
And so if you want
to hyperpolarize a neuron

434
00:26:17,504 --> 00:26:21,231
we need to open a chloride
or a potassium conductance,

435
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:23,581
and if you want to depolarize a neuron

436
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:26,683
we want to open a sodium conductance.

437
00:26:27,908 --> 00:26:29,420
In this lesson we've learned

438
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,596
a number of important
biophysical principals

439
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:36,167
that ultimately lead us to find out

440
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:39,482
how the membrane potential
of a cell is determined.

441
00:26:40,407 --> 00:26:43,137
We've seen that electrochemical diffusion

442
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:46,000
describes ion flow through ion channels,

443
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,116
and so there are two important forces

444
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:51,090
that act upon ions.

445
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,419
There's a concentration gradient,
where ions want to move

446
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:58,451
from high concentration
to low concentration,

447
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,923
and there's an electric field,

448
00:26:59,923 --> 00:27:05,318
which also acts upon
the individual charged ions.

449
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:11,775
Together, these two forces,
electricity and concentration gradients,

450
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:17,117
can mathematically be formulated
into the Nernst equilibrium potential,

451
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,537
which is the electrical potential

452
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,799
that precisely counters
the concentration gradient,

453
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,382
and leads to no net ion flux.

454
00:27:25,843 --> 00:27:31,271
By independently regulating
the ion channel conductances

455
00:27:31,271 --> 00:27:34,008
with selective permeability

456
00:27:34,008 --> 00:27:36,066
we can control the membrane potential.

457
00:27:36,066 --> 00:27:39,387
If we open a sodium conductance,

458
00:27:39,387 --> 00:27:43,182
the membrane potential will move towards
the sodium reversal potential,

459
00:27:43,182 --> 00:27:45,044
and depolarize the cell.

460
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:47,989
If we open a chloride,
or a potassium conductance

461
00:27:47,989 --> 00:27:52,784
we will cause negative charge
to accumulate inside the cell

462
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:55,760
causing a hyperpolarization.

463
00:27:57,116 --> 00:28:00,574
These basic principals
of ionic conductances

464
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:03,250
driving membrane potential changes

465
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,841
are fundamental to understanding
how neurons work.
