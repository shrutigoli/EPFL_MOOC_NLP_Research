1
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:08,047
So far, we have learned 
that the cell membrane contains

2
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:13,098
ion channels of selective permeability 
for specific ions.

3
00:00:13,907 --> 00:00:17,419
Ionic currents flowing across 
the cell membrane can then drive

4
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:19,367
membrane potential changes

5
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,953
that are filtered, in time,
by the membrane capacitance.

6
00:00:23,986 --> 00:00:27,121
We've considered the cell
to be small and round,

7
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:30,179
and therefore,
isopotential -- that is,

8
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,481
all parts of the cell membrane have
the same electrical potential.

9
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:37,775
And, indeed, many types
of cells in our body are

10
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:40,043
small, round, and isopotential.

11
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:43,548
However, this is very far
from the situation

12
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:45,831
when it comes to considering neurons.

13
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:50,348
Neurons, in fact, have
very extensive arborisations.

14
00:00:50,668 --> 00:00:53,987
These outgrowths from the cell body are

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,702
filled with cytoplasm
and covered by a plasma membrane,

16
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:00,864
just like the cell body,
but much thinner.

17
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:07,006
Whereas the cell body typically has
a diameter of 10 microns,

18
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,877
your neuronal arborisations may have

19
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:13,729
diameters of the order
of one micrometer or less.

20
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:20,176
Typically, these branches of the neuron
extend for hundreds of microns.

21
00:01:20,857 --> 00:01:25,065
In the largest arborisations,
the process can extend several meters.

22
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:28,822
Think of neurons in the giraffe brain
that need to communicate

23
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,184
along the length of the spinal cord.

24
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:36,033
It turns out that the neuronal arbors 
can be considered

25
00:01:36,033 --> 00:01:39,700
as leaky electrical cables
with capacitance.

26
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:43,880
These cables transmit and transform
the electrical signals

27
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,776
generated in one part of the neuron
to other parts of the neuron.

28
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:52,328
The most important point to realize is
that the membrane potential

29
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:55,233
at different locations
across the neuronal arborisation

30
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,732
will be different.

31
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:01,900
Membrane potential can fluctuate strongly
in one part of a neuron

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,826
and might make little impact
upon other regions of the neuron.

33
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:11,548
To understand why, in this lesson
we'll study the basic principles

34
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:15,164
of leaky electrical cables
with capacitance.

35
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:21,883
The simplest analogy to think about
in terms of neuronal arborisations

36
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:25,756
and ionic current flow
in these arborisations

37
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:30,820
is to think of a watering hose
as you might use in your garden.

38
00:02:31,645 --> 00:02:37,631
Water influx across this leaky cable
will be high at the input end,

39
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:42,609
and if we make small holes
in this garden hose,

40
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:46,611
water will leak out
along the length of this tube.

41
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:51,195
The pressure at different points
in the tube will differ.

42
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:53,511
Here we'll have a high water pressure,

43
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:58,558
and as the water leaks out,
at the far end of the water hose

44
00:02:58,558 --> 00:03:00,550
you'll have a lower pressure.

45
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:05,209
We can think of the same thing
in terms of the arborisation.

46
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:08,344
We have intracellular cytoplasm,

47
00:03:08,344 --> 00:03:13,033
we have axial current flow,
ionic flow of electricity

48
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:17,025
down the length
of the center of the arborisation.

49
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:20,501
This is flanked by
lipid bi-layer membranes,

50
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,514
and part of that current flow
will leak out

51
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:27,072
across the ion channels
that are present in the plasma membrane.

52
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,896
The current flow that enters here
will therefore decrease

53
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:34,864
in each part of the cable

54
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:39,030
by the amount of current that leaks out
across the plasma membrane.

55
00:03:39,707 --> 00:03:42,228
In addition, of course,
we must remember

56
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:45,320
that the lipid bilayer is
an important capacitor,

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,528
and we therefore need to think
of capacitance of the axial current

58
00:03:49,528 --> 00:03:53,489
in part goes to flow
across the ionic channels,

59
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,284
in part charges the membrane,
and in part drives

60
00:03:57,284 --> 00:04:02,223
the additional current flow
down the length of the arborisation.

61
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:10,428
We can draw the electrical equivalent
of any small length of this cable

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,172
through thinking about the capacitance
across that unit length

63
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,841
provided by the surface area
of the lipid bilayer.

64
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:23,456
There's the membrane conductance

65
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:26,649
provided by the numbers
and types of ion channels

66
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:29,337
present in that part of the membrane,

67
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:32,141
and of course,
we have the axial current flow

68
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:35,832
that flows down the length
of the arborisation,

69
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:39,818
changing potential depending
upon the axial resistance

70
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:41,756
that's offered to that current.

71
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:46,549
In general, we can write cable equations

72
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:50,412
that describe this electrical situation.

73
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:54,415
The simplest one is
the steady-state cable equation

74
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:57,485
where we forget about
time-dependent changes

75
00:04:57,485 --> 00:05:00,482
and if we forget about
time-dependent changes,

76
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:02,751
we don't need to consider capacitance

77
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:07,533
because current only flows
into a capacitor during charging,

78
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:11,181
when it is obviously not
at steady state.

79
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:15,579
The membrane potential
at any given point in this cable

80
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:19,450
is therefore given by
the trans-membrane current

81
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,759
multiplied by
the trans-membrane resistance.

82
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,579
Ohm's Law: V = IR.

83
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:32,148
We can also see that the drop in potential
between adjacent points in the cable

84
00:05:32,148 --> 00:05:34,784
depends upon the axial resistance,

85
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:40,998
and the change in potential across
arbitrarily small areas of the cable

86
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:45,794
depend upon the current
and the resistance, axially.

87
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:50,711
Finally, we can see that
the change in axial current depends upon

88
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:55,929
how much of that current
leaves across the plasma membrane,

89
00:05:55,929 --> 00:06:01,304
and so, the change in axial resistance is
equal to minus the membrane current.

90
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:06,146
We can take these three equations
and solve it for the cable equation

91
00:06:06,146 --> 00:06:08,599
in one dimension at steady state.

92
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,161
We begin by Ohm's Law.

93
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,166
From this equation we can see

94
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:20,712
that Im can also be written as
minus dI Axial over dx.

95
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:24,958
And so, the membrane potential is
therefore equal to:

96
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:29,794
minus Rm, dI axial by dx.

97
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:35,240
The axial current we can rewrite here

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,255
as being one over R axial, dv by dx.

99
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,962
Differentiating this one more time

100
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:53,269
gives us the second derivative here
with respect to space.

101
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:56,820
We can then put this equation in here,

102
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,642
and finally we solve for Voltage
as being the ratio

103
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:04,577
of the membrane resistance
to the axial resistance

104
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:08,298
times the second derivative
with respect to space.

105
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:14,645
This second order
differential equation has

106
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:18,092
a solution with an exponential form

107
00:07:18,092 --> 00:07:22,441
with respect to space,
length down the cable,

108
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:26,323
and we introduce now the length constant

109
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:29,481
which is equal to the square root
of the membrane resistance

110
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:32,256
divided by the axial resistance.

111
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,757
We can plot the exponential drop-off
of voltage across the length of the cable

112
00:07:39,757 --> 00:07:44,279
here as the exponential decay
of the membrane potential

113
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,499
as the current traverses
this leaky cable at steady state.

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,181
The distance where
the potential has dropped to 63% --

115
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:55,122
that is, 1/e --

116
00:07:55,122 --> 00:08:00,293
is equal to the length constant
of the cell, Lambda.

117
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:03,598
Lambda defined as the square root

118
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,729
of membrane resistance
divided by axial resistance

119
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:09,438
has some obvious intuitive properties.

120
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:14,324
If we were to increase
the membrane resistance,

121
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:19,382
there would be less leak of current
across the length of the cable,

122
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:23,641
and the voltage would therefore
drop less across space.

123
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:30,315
Conversely, if we had
a very high axial resistance,

124
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:34,352
then the amount of current
that would leak out would increase

125
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,257
and it would be more difficult
for current to flow down here,

126
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:40,393
and we would therefore get
a more sharp drop

127
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:42,059
in the membrane potential.

128
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,774
Lambda would be low.

129
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:50,974
The steady-state cable equation
can be rewritten

130
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:55,125
to include the time-dependent charging
of the membrane capacitance.

131
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,307
As we saw last week,

132
00:08:58,307 --> 00:09:02,539
there's a time constant involved
with charging the membrane

133
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:05,922
that's equal to the product
of the membrane resistance

134
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,800
and the membrane capacitance,

135
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,964
and that can then be included in
this larger partial differential equation

136
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:17,202
that describes the one-dimensional,
time-dependent spread of voltage

137
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:18,477
across space.

138
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,774
We have two important constants:

139
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:24,606
we have a length constant that indicates

140
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,470
the length scale over which
the membrane potential decreases,

141
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,820
and we have another important constant,

142
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,160
the time constant,

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,510
that tells us over what time scale
the membrane potential is filtered

144
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,718
as it traverses the neuronal arborisation
in space and time.

145
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:47,982
It's worth noting that these constants are
actually variable in time and space.

146
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:51,448
The membrane resistance depends upon

147
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:55,368
how many ion channels are open
at any given time, and in general,

148
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:59,543
the open probability of ion channels is
something that's highly regulated,

149
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:02,928
and so, the membrane conductance
and membrane resistance

150
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:04,962
varies considerably over time;

151
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:09,036
in fact, that's what drives
the membrane potential changes in a cell.

152
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:13,875
The axial resistance may not
change over time,

153
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,506
but it certainly changes over space,

154
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:22,857
and so, very thick arbors of the neuron
which have large diameters

155
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,809
have low axial resistance,

156
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:29,560
whereas the very thin arborisations
that might be far from a neuron

157
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,276
might have much higher axial resistances

158
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:35,781
and so the membrane time constants

159
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:41,582
are not constant across
the neuronal arborisation in space or time,

160
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:44,676
leading to a great deal of complexity.

161
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:49,061
In general, it's fair to say
that there are no analytical solutions

162
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:52,281
to the cable equation
for real neuronal structures,

163
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:55,742
and therefore,
numerical computer simulations are

164
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,563
therefore typically used,

165
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:02,461
and one that's particularly used often is

166
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,579
the one called Neuron,

167
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:09,159
which is freely available for download
at this World Wide Web address,

168
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,741
and you can download it
and play with these simulations

169
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:14,637
and see for yourself
how complicated and interesting

170
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:20,293
the spread of neuronal membrane potential
is within individual neurons.

171
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,145
So in terms of
membrane potential distributions,

172
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:26,533
neurons are rather complicated.

173
00:11:26,923 --> 00:11:31,127
The membrane potential at one point
in a neuron differs from that

174
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:32,932
in a different point of a neuron.

175
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:35,352
The membrane potential is filtered

176
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:39,366
as current flows down
the neuronal arborisations

177
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:43,118
because there's some leak
across the plasma membrane.

178
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:47,821
Equally, membrane potential changes are
highly filtered in time.

179
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,599
A membrane potential change
that occurs rapidly

180
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,153
at a distal part
of a neuronal arborisation

181
00:11:55,153 --> 00:11:59,536
may have very little impact
upon the cell soma.

182
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,874
In order to get a better feel
for how this works,

183
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:09,593
let's have a look at some example neurons
and how membrane potential varies

184
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:12,353
across the neuronal arborisation.

185
00:12:12,726 --> 00:12:15,599
Let's first think about membrane area.

186
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:21,063
In the distal processes of a neuron,

187
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:26,099
the diameter might be 0.1 micrometers

188
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:30,427
or one micrometer,
or somewhere in between.

189
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:36,694
The largest diameters are
present at the cell body,

190
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:40,163
where the nucleus
and the genetic material is also located,

191
00:12:40,398 --> 00:12:44,431
and there we have diameters
of around ten micrometers.

192
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,685
So there's an approximately
hundredfold difference in the diameter

193
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:54,827
of the structures that are located
at different points across a neuron.

194
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:58,422
The surface area of a cable

195
00:12:59,084 --> 00:13:03,179
is approximately proportional
to the diameter of that structure.

196
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:08,870
and the surface area,
of course, also for a capacitor,

197
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,926
tells us how much capacitance there is,

198
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:15,985
and so, the local capacitance at the soma

199
00:13:16,385 --> 00:13:18,984
might be a hundred times higher

200
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:22,513
than the local capacitance
sitting here in a dendrite.

201
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:28,615
A given amount of current or charge
flowing into a small dendrite here

202
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:31,462
with a small amount of capacitance
might then give rise

203
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:35,014
to a very large voltage change,

204
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:37,990
whereas the same charge
flowing into the cell body

205
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,895
will give rise to a smaller change
in membrane potential.

206
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,519
One might, therefore, imagine
very large potential differences

207
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,976
across time and space here
as conductances open here,

208
00:13:51,976 --> 00:13:56,262
compared to slower and smaller
membrane potential changes

209
00:13:56,262 --> 00:14:00,113
at the cell body, where there's
considerably larger filtering

210
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:06,150
due to the large amount of surface area
immediately available to this region.

211
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:11,934
Let's consider a situation where we have
three recording electrodes

212
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,856
placed across the arborisation
of a given neuron.

213
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:22,256
At each electrode we could record
the membrane potential at that location,

214
00:14:22,256 --> 00:14:27,482
and let's see what happens
if we inject current into Location One.

215
00:14:28,011 --> 00:14:34,075
Let's take a given point in time
where we begin to inject current.

216
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:40,409
At recording electrode one,
location one on the dendritic arborisation

217
00:14:40,409 --> 00:14:43,419
we're very close
to where the current is being injected.

218
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:46,615
There's only a small surface area here.

219
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:50,376
The membrane is rapidly charged
and reaches steady state.

220
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:56,324
Current then begins to flow
and charge the capacitors along the way

221
00:14:56,548 --> 00:15:00,688
and gradually, we charge location two

222
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:03,958
and location three.

223
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:07,440
And each time, there's some delay

224
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
that increases as the current
needs to flow down here,

225
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,489
and the rate of charging slows down
because the overall amount of surface area

226
00:15:16,489 --> 00:15:19,004
that needs to be charged has increased.

227
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:24,300
The steady-state voltage that's reached
at these different locations

228
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,436
is described by the steady-state
cable equation as we saw before,

229
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:32,280
where we have our length constant Lambda

230
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,732
that tells us how much of a drop
in membrane potential we might expect.

231
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:41,842
Now, in real neurons,
the sizes of this dendritic arborisation

232
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,587
might be hundreds of micrometers,

233
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:50,212
and that's exactly the length scale that
also the membrane length constant has.

234
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,296
And so if we imagine
that there's 500 microns

235
00:15:53,296 --> 00:15:57,044
between recording electrode one
and recording electrode three,

236
00:15:57,044 --> 00:16:02,175
we can then say that this change
in membrane potential

237
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,259
will just be 37%

238
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,893
of the steady state membrane potential
reached here at this point

239
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:11,509
in the neuronal arborisation.

240
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,511
The length constant of neurons,

241
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:19,362
then being on the same scale
as the arborisation of a neuron,

242
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:21,831
we realize that there's
a considerable impact

243
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:26,581
upon the steady-state membrane potential
across this neuronal arborisation.

244
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:31,181
The situation, however,
becomes even more extreme

245
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:34,095
when we think about brief current pulses.

246
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:39,431
Again, we consider injecting current
here into electrode one,

247
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,865
but now just a brief current pulse.

248
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:46,178
We charge the membrane,
and then it relaxes,

249
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:51,730
because of the current spread
rapidly flowing away from that location.

250
00:16:52,468 --> 00:16:55,090
What we see at electrode two, however,

251
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,869
is a highly filtered version of this
which is much slower,

252
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:03,495
and electrode three,
if we see anything at all,

253
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:06,504
is again slower and smaller.

254
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:12,245
The half-time of these membrane
potential changes is very different

255
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:14,396
comparing these different locations.

256
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,653
The amplitude might be

257
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:23,490
forty times larger at distal dendrites

258
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,649
compared to what we see at the soma,

259
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:30,339
and equally, the time course
here, which is fast,

260
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:35,832
will be much more extensive at these
small membrane potential fluctuations.

261
00:17:36,028 --> 00:17:40,996
Here at the soma,
we may have around ten milliseconds

262
00:17:40,996 --> 00:17:44,233
in terms of the half-width
of membrane potential changes,

263
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:49,400
whereas here, at the distal dendrites,
we probably have time constants

264
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,429
that are much closer to one millisecond.

265
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:58,585
When currents and conductances
are opening at different times

266
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:02,223
across different locations
of a neuronal arborisation,

267
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:06,606
you can see that there will be
very complex spatiotemporal dynamics

268
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:11,449
where the fast, large signals
taking place here are strongly filtered,

269
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:18,371
giving rise to smaller amplitude,
longer duration potentials at the soma.

270
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,140
Membrane potential is, therefore,
clearly very complex in real neurons.

271
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,597
So in this lesson we've learned
about the complexity

272
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,147
of neuronal membrane potential.

273
00:18:31,147 --> 00:18:35,952
Neurons have extensive arborisations
that electrically can be considered

274
00:18:35,952 --> 00:18:39,372
as leaky cables
with significant capacitance.

275
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:45,303
Membrane potential, therefore, has
complex spatiotemporal dynamics

276
00:18:45,303 --> 00:18:48,911
within single neurons,
with significant attenuation

277
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:52,204
and filtering of the signals
across the arbors.

278
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:56,056
In general, this leads
to a complicated situation

279
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,507
in terms of information processing,

280
00:18:58,507 --> 00:19:03,385
and next week we'll see
that the nervous system has come across

281
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:07,636
at least one solution
as to how to make reliable signaling

282
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:11,774
across large distances in the form
of the action potential

283
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,808
that we'll discuss next week.
