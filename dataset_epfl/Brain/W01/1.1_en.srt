00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,592
Welcome to this course

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:10,152
about the cellular mechanisms
of brain function.

3
00:00:10,152 --> 00:00:14,802
Brain function governs our every thought
and every action.

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:16,793
Activity in our brain allows us

5
00:00:16,793 --> 00:00:20,583
to perceive the world
and learn from our experiences.

6
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:23,490
So, how does the brain do that?

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,066
This course aims for a causal
and <i>mechanistic</i> explanation

8
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:32,787
of brain function, at the level
of the brain's <i>irreducible components:</i>

9
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:36,160
its <i>neurons</i> and <i>synapses.</i>

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,885
The <i>neurons</i> are the excitable cells
of the brain,

11
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:42,393
and the <i>synapses</i> are the specializations

12
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:46,019
where the neurons communicate
with each other.

13
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:49,648
In the same way that Newtonian
and quantum mechanics

14
00:00:49,648 --> 00:00:52,678
provide equations
for the laws of physics,

15
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:57,355
here we seek the underlying laws
governing neuronal activity:

16
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,623
the biophysics of brain function.

17
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:06,177
However, in contrast to physics,
neuroscience is still a very young field.

18
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:08,781
It's only just over a hundred years ago

19
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,592
that the neurons of the brain
were first described,

20
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:15,511
and there's much that still
remains unknown.

21
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:18,520
Neuroscience is now
undergoing a revolution,

22
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,246
with an ever-increasing speed
of discovery

23
00:01:21,246 --> 00:01:24,872
driven by new techniques
and exciting hypotheses

24
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:27,367
that are continuously being developed.

25
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:31,067
This course will take you through
the basic principles

26
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,773
of mammalian brain function,

27
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:37,729
and try to assemble that knowledge
into a coherent and up-to-date description

28
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,679
of how neuronal activity
can process sensory information,

29
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:47,046
leading to subjective percepts
and behavioral decisions.

30
00:01:47,046 --> 00:01:49,598
Here, in this introductory video,

31
00:01:49,598 --> 00:01:53,004
I'll give you a brief overview
of the course.

32
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:57,590
The course lasts seven weeks,
and every week there'll be five videos,

33
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,620
each lasting 15 to 30 minutes.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,303
At the end of each video,
there'll be a short quiz

35
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,503
to help you better understand
the subject matter.

36
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:09,845
If you have further questions
or you want to go deeper,

37
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:13,168
then you should write comments
in the online discussion forum,

38
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:17,128
which I hope will be a lively,
fun, and interactive environment.

39
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,748
We'll begin in weeks one to three

40
00:02:20,748 --> 00:02:25,493
with studying the basic principles
of how neurons and synapses work.

41
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,417
In weeks four and five,
we'll think about how neurons are wired

42
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:33,543
into networks of excitatory
and inhibitory neurons.

43
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,282
And finally, in weeks six and seven,

44
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:40,600
we'll consider how to study neuronal
network function in behaving animals,

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,647
and how we can now begin to causally link
brain function and behavior.

46
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:49,622
The brain is essentially
an electrical device.

47
00:02:49,622 --> 00:02:53,158
Electricity is not generated
by the movement of electrons,

48
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:55,338
as in an electronic computer,

49
00:02:55,338 --> 00:03:00,529
but rather by the movement
of charged atoms: that is, <i>ions.</i>

50
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:03,143
It's the movement of ions
across the cell membrane

51
00:03:03,143 --> 00:03:06,194
that generates the electrical signals
in the brain.

52
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:11,007
These ionic currents flow across
the elongated neuronal structures,

53
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,841
and at synapses, these electrical signals

54
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:17,406
are converted into the release
of chemical messages:

55
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:22,907
so-called <i>neurotransmitters</i>
that affect <i>specific</i> target neurons.

56
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:28,340
After this introductory video,
there are four further videos of week one.

57
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:31,839
We'll discuss the <i>lipid bilayer</i>
of the <i>cell membrane</i>

58
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,896
that electrically acts as a capacitor;

59
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:37,890
and we will also discuss
the <i>protein ion channels</i>

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,940
that allow transport of speciifc ions
across the cell membrane.

61
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,169
The different concentrations of ions
inside and outside of cells

62
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,929
and the differential ion <i>permeability</i>
of the cell membrane

63
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:56,076
causes an electrical potential:
the so-called <i>membrane potential.</i>

64
00:03:56,076 --> 00:04:00,753
Because neurons have long,
elongated processes that act as <i>cables,</i>

65
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:05,930
these electrical potentials have complex
spatiotemporal dynamics.

66
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,835
In week two, we'll learn about
<i>nonlinear</i> signal processing inside neurons

67
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,009
generated by so-called
<i>voltage-gated ion channels</i>

68
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,815
with complex <i>kinetics</i> of activation
and inactivation,

69
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,665
depending upon the membrane potential.

70
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:26,722
These nonlinear ionic conductances
form the basis

71
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:31,566
of an all-or-none digital signal,
the <i>action potential</i>,

72
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:34,826
which forms an important unit
of information in the brain.

73
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,739
The action potential actively propagates
down the neuronal cables,

74
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,776
and is therefore useful
for transfering information

75
00:04:42,776 --> 00:04:45,479
from one part of the brain
to another.

76
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,147
At the end of week two,
we'll make a lab excursion

77
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:52,753
to see how neuronal membrane potential
and action potentials

78
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:56,269
can be measured <i>in vitro</i>
in mouse brain slices

79
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,795
using the <i>whole-cell
patch-clamp recording technique</i>.

80
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:05,874
A key function of the action potential
is to drive <i>synaptic transmission</i>:

81
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:09,520
the release of a chemical substance,
a <i>neurotransmitter,</i>

82
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,554
sending a signal 
to other specific neurons.

83
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:17,142
Synaptic transmission involves
a complex cascade of molecular processes

84
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:20,808
which are strongly influenced
by recent patterns of activity,

85
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:25,792
giving rise to interesting 
<i>presynaptic dynamics</i>.

86
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,416
Synaptic transmission
is also strongly regulated

87
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:33,161
by the presence of other chemical
substances, termed <i>neuromodulators</i>,

88
00:05:33,161 --> 00:05:36,997
which are present
in the extracellular space of the brain.

89
00:05:36,997 --> 00:05:41,144
In the last video of week three,
we'll make another lab excursion:

90
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:45,272
this time, to see how we can
image synapses at high resolution

91
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:48,444
using electron microscopy.

92
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:51,939
Having got a basic understanding
of the components of the brain,

93
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,465
we'll next turn our attention
to how the neurons work together

94
00:05:55,465 --> 00:05:57,748
in <i>neuronal networks</i>.

95
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:01,406
We'll focus on the two most important
neurotransmitters in the brain:

96
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:08,218
the excitatory neurotransmitter <i>glutamate</i>
and the inhibitory neurotransmitter <i>GABA</i>.

97
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,964
These are released
from different cell types in the brain

98
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:15,774
which are wired together
in highly-specific networks.

99
00:06:15,774 --> 00:06:18,858
In week four of the course,
we will study the <i>receptors</i>

100
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:22,108
that receive the glutamate signals
from other neurons,

101
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,986
and we'll discuss
the excitatory electrical signals

102
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:28,305
driven by the activation
of the glutamate receptors:

103
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:33,434
the so-called
<i>excitatory post-synaptic potentials</i>.

104
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,683
We'll also study examples
of specific neuronal <i>circuits</i>

105
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:39,724
used for signalling information
from the sensory periphery

106
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:41,851
to higher stations in the brain.

107
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:45,438
These synaptic circuits
are not written in stone;

108
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:49,518
rather, they can <i>change</i> through a process
known as <i>synaptic plasticity.</i>

109
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:53,600
And these long-lasting, activity-dependent
changes in synaptic strength

110
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,539
are thought to underlie
learning and memory.

111
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,115
Much of this synaptic plasticity occurs

112
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:03,340
at the specialized structures
called <i>dendritic spines</i>

113
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,422
that we'll study in some detail.

114
00:07:06,422 --> 00:07:11,955
Whereas the neurotransmitter <i>glutamate</i>
drives <i>excitation</i> of the neurons,

115
00:07:11,955 --> 00:07:16,085
the neurotransmitter <i>GABA</i>
<i>inhibits</i> neurons.

116
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:19,732
Neuronal networks, therefore,
work through a dynamic process

117
00:07:19,732 --> 00:07:23,217
of integrating excitatory 
glutamatergic signals

118
00:07:23,217 --> 00:07:26,679
with inhibitory GABAergic signals.

119
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:30,022
We'll study the <i>synaptic conductances</i>
evoked by GABA

120
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:34,479
and some specific neuronal circuits 
in the brain that use GABA.

121
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,094
In addition, we'll introduce the field
of <i>neuropharmacology</i>

122
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,918
in the context of <i>benzodiazepines,</i>

123
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:45,404
which act specifically at GABA receptors

124
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:49,750
and are widely used
as an anxiolytic medication.

125
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:52,509
Neuropharmacology
is of obvious importance

126
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:58,122
because it provides the simplest means
of treating brain disorders.

127
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:01,458
The purpose of the brain
is to govern behavior;

128
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,579
so in order to understand brain function,

129
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:08,125
we need to correlate and control
neuronal activity in living animals

130
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,357
during quantified behavior.

131
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:14,010
This is an important challenge
for modern, integrative neuroscience,

132
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,259
and solving <i>this</i> will provide causal
and mechanistic insight

133
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:21,673
into deep questions
about how our brains work.

134
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:24,196
Breakthroughs in linking
neuronal activity to behavior

135
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:29,873
will also form the foundations necessary
for developing rational therapies

136
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,996
to treat the many brain diseases.

137
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:34,619
Up to this point in the course,

138
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:37,801
we will largely have covered
principles of neuroscience

139
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:42,031
derived from reduced,
<i>in vitro</i> preparations.

140
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:45,701
In order to investigate mammalian
brain function during <i>behavior</i>

141
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:47,119
in mechanistic detail,

142
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:52,068
we need to make invasive,
<i>in vivo</i> measurements and manipulations.

143
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:54,450
The overall organization
of the mammalian brain

144
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,465
is similar across a wide range of species,

145
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:02,190
and currently, substantial effort goes
into understanding the mouse brain.

146
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,198
What we learn from studying
the mouse brain

147
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,228
will in many cases likely
be directly analogous

148
00:09:07,228 --> 00:09:09,520
to what happens in the human brain.

149
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,168
We'll describe techniques
for optical imaging of the mouse brain,

150
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:16,130
resolving signals
at millisecond temporal resolution

151
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,883
and with cellular and subcellular
spatial resolution.

152
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:24,358
Electrophysiological measurements
can also be made in behaving mice,

153
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:28,249
allowing action potential firing
and membrane potential dynamics

154
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:31,637
to be studied during quantified behavior.

155
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,450
In order to gain causal insight,

156
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,439
these methods for <i>correlating</i>
neuronal activity with behavior

157
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,760
must now be complemented
by <i>manipulations</i> of neuronal activity.

158
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,904
Over the last few years,
the development of <i>optogenetics</i>

159
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,337
is providing tools
that allow neuroscientists

160
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,220
to control highly-specific
neuronal activity

161
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,809
with millisecond precision.

162
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,691
We are now in a position

163
00:09:55,691 --> 00:10:00,906
to investigate the causal,
neuronal mechanisms underlying behavior.

164
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:05,179
In the final week of the course,
we'll begin by considering behavior

165
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:10,372
as a result of movements
driven by specific motor neurons.

166
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:15,012
Sensory input provides important
information for guiding motor control,

167
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:16,476
and so the simplest behaviors

168
00:10:16,476 --> 00:10:20,107
can be regarded
as <i>sensorimotor interactions.</i>

169
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,908
We'll also learn that <i>sensory perception</i>
is an active process

170
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:27,875
whereby we make movements
to gain specific information:

171
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:31,954
like moving our eyes
to look at an interesting object,

172
00:10:31,954 --> 00:10:36,631
or touching a surface
to feel its shape and texture.

173
00:10:36,631 --> 00:10:38,821
Sensory perception
is also an active process

174
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,269
from an internal,
computational perspective

175
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,363
whereby the neurons in our brains
<i>generate</i> sensory percepts

176
00:10:46,363 --> 00:10:51,557
derived from our past experiences
and current expectations.

177
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:54,133
We'll also study aspects
of reward-based learning,

178
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:58,420
in which the brain tries
to organize behavior to maximize reward.

179
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,684
Finally, we'll discuss 
how the cellular mechanisms

180
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:05,262
of some brain diseases
are beginning to be understood,

181
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:08,034
giving hope for future treatments.

182
00:11:08,604 --> 00:11:12,406
So, in this course, you'll see 
that the unitary elements of the brain,

183
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:17,751
the neurons and synapses, are beginning
to be understood in biophysical detail.

184
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,403
We already have quite a good
quantitative description

185
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:26,163
of membrane potential, action potentials,
and synaptic transmission.

186
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:29,971
Neuroscientists have also
made good progress

187
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:35,525
in delineating the synaptic connectivity
of specific neuronal cell types.

188
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:40,260
We're thus learning a lot about the rules
underlying the wiring diagram

189
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,451
of the mammalian brain.

190
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:46,814
The next major challenge
for modern neuroscience

191
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:52,202
is now to causally link
neuronal activity to behavior.

192
00:11:52,202 --> 00:11:55,791
This requires <i>in vivo</i> measurements
and manipulations

193
00:11:55,791 --> 00:12:00,873
to correlate and perturb brain function
<i>during</i> behavior.

194
00:12:00,873 --> 00:12:04,209
Fortunately, enormous progress
has been made,

195
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:08,364
and many neuroscientists think
that we'll have a deep understanding

196
00:12:08,364 --> 00:12:13,881
of how the basic operating principles
of the mammalian brain govern behavior

197
00:12:13,881 --> 00:12:18,649
within the next 50 years,
and hopefully within our lifetimes.
