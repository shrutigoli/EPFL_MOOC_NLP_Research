3
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:07,958
In the last lesson we learned 
that the cell membrane

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:13,401
was made of a phospholipid bilayer 
that was impermeable to ions.

5
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:18,307
The movement of ions, of charges,

6
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:22,967
from the outside to the inside 
of the plasma membrane

7
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,987
would make large changes 
in the electrical field

8
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:29,987
but make small changes 
to ionic concentrations.

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:34,329
Ion movement across the cell membrane 
can therefore give rise

10
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:36,937
to large membrane potential changes,

11
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:39,097
but, as we learned,

12
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:43,905
the phospholipid bilayer 
isn't by itself permeable to ions.

13
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,988
So, how do ions move 
across the cell membrane?

14
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:50,378
How does membrane potential change?

15
00:00:50,653 --> 00:00:56,933
Inserted into the phospholipid bilayer 
that we learned, acts as a capacitor,

16
00:00:57,603 --> 00:01:02,333
are other elements: proteins,
transmembrane proteins

17
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:08,201
-- like this red ion channel-- that 
are inserted inside the plasma membrane,

18
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:14,456
traverse the plasma membrane 
reaching from the outside to the inside

19
00:01:14,545 --> 00:01:18,295
and they have an aqueous pore 
in the middle

20
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:23,995
through which ions like 
Potasium, Sodium or Chloride

21
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:28,027
can traverse through these ion channels

22
00:01:28,198 --> 00:01:34,308
and move ions from one side 
of the plasma membrane to another.

23
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:37,364
Ion channels are transmembrane proteins

24
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:44,092
That is, they're made of a string 
of amino acids in a simple sequence.

25
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:48,427
In order for the protein 
to cross the cell membrane

26
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:51,008
it needs to have some specific features:

27
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:55,199
It needs to have a part outside
that likes water,

28
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:59,822
because the inside and outside 
solutions are made of water.

29
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:05,270
It needs to have an area here 
that is able to cross a lipophilic area

30
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,770
because this is where 
we have the hydrocarbon chains

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,150
of the phospholipids,

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,400
and this area here 
is very hydrophobic,

33
00:02:14,181 --> 00:02:16,021
and of course on the other side

34
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:19,891
it again needs to be able to interact 
with the aqueous environment,

35
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:26,151
so it has to have hydrophilic aspects 
and a hydrophobic part here

36
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,301
where actually crosses the membrane.

37
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:33,071
And it turns out that for all 
relevant transmembrane proteins,

38
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:37,071
the protein forms a so-called 
alpha helical structure

39
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:40,121
where it can traverse the plasma membrane.

40
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:45,061
In the alpha helix, 
the more hydrophilic parts

41
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:48,364
of the amino acids, the charged parts,

42
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,851
can hide on the inside of the alpha helix

43
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:56,851
whereas the lipophilic parts 
of the protein can stick out

44
00:02:56,851 --> 00:03:00,991
and be happily interacting 
with the hydrocarbon chains.

45
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:06,017
So, alpha helices are the ones 
that actually cross the plasma membrane.

46
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:09,995
A typical ion channel 
doesn't just have one alpha helix

47
00:03:09,995 --> 00:03:11,605
but it might, for example, have six

48
00:03:11,605 --> 00:03:14,275
as it's drawn in this example here
where we have one, two,

49
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:17,845
three, four, five, six 
transmembrane regions

50
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:21,845
and another part here that just dips 
into the lipophilic part

51
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:23,963
of the plasma membrane.

52
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,943
Typically, ion channels 
don't just have one of these

53
00:03:26,943 --> 00:03:30,293
but are associated 
with multiple sub-units

54
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,673
that come together 
and form the ion channel itself,

55
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:37,533
and one specific part of the ion channel,

56
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,923
for example here,

57
00:03:38,923 --> 00:03:41,983
might then have some charged areas
down the middle

58
00:03:41,983 --> 00:03:46,253
which allow it to interact 
with the aqueous pore of the ion channel.

59
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,765
So, the ion channel 
is a complicated structure.

60
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,245
It needs to have a part that likes water,

61
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,055
that is present both 
on the outside and the inside.

62
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:58,835
It also needs to have a part here 
that interacts nicely with water

63
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:02,225
and so it's also a relatively 
polar environment here

64
00:04:02,487 --> 00:04:09,367
and that then allows the ions and water 
to flow freely across the plasma membrane

65
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:13,367
through these ionic protein channels.

66
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:20,531
In the 80's two remarkable scientists,
Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann,

67
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:23,813
developed the so called 
patch-clamp recording technique

68
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,893
which allowed them 
from the very first time

69
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,871
to measure the function 
of single ion channels,

70
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,625
in fact, the first time that 
the function of an individual protein

71
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:37,905
was studied in real time at a millisecond
and microsecond temporal resolution.

72
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,974
Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann 
used glass recording electrodes,

73
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:49,526
tips of about one micrometer in diameter
filled with an ionic solution

74
00:04:49,526 --> 00:04:52,586
and attached to an electrical amplifier

75
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:56,096
where they could differentially
measure currents.

76
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:01,536
They could fix the potential
inside the patch electrode

77
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,054
relative to the bath solution

78
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:09,234
and measure the current flow
inside the electrode.

79
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:14,251
They moved this electrode 
up against a cell,

80
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:21,268
they sucked gently here, 
and they found that they could suck

81
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:24,688
a little bit of plasma membrane
inside the electrodes

82
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:27,348
-- This is still the glass pipette here --

83
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,701
and the remarkable thing
that they discovered

84
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:34,701
was that the electrical seal 
between the inside of the pipette

85
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,941
and the outside solution
was extremely tight

86
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:43,241
and that the current flow, 
the leak around the seal here

87
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:50,481
was on the order of 1 Giga-Ohm and 
going up to something like 10 Giga-Ohm.

88
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:55,181
So, an enormously tight 
electrical seal was built here

89
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,063
by the glass and the cell membrane

90
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,693
for reasons that is still
poorly understood,

91
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:04,193
and that very very tight 
electrical seal here

92
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:09,023
allowed them to study the flow of ions
across individual ion channels

93
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:11,263
sitting inside this bit of 
patch of membrane

94
00:06:11,263 --> 00:06:14,233
that they sucked into the pipette
and of course,

95
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:17,763
they connected this to amplifiers,
so they could measure

96
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:20,773
the current flow through the pipette.

97
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:27,113
When they made these measurements 
they saw several remarkable features.

98
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:33,358
The most remarkable one was the unitary
opening and closing of ion channels.

99
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:36,628
Ion channels don't open 
part way, a little bit,

100
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,048
but they flip between two states:

101
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:42,985
They can be in a closed state 
or they can be in an open state

102
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:47,225
and it seems that the protein 
rapidly changes from a closed state

103
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:52,995
to an open state, stays open for a while,
closes, stays closed, opens,

104
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:57,044
opens here so briefly that we don't 
even fully resolve it in this recording,

105
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:01,044
it's closed again, brief opening,
slightly longer opening.

106
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:06,175
And these are two well defined states:
a closed state and an open state,

107
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:11,185
and here it's analyzed 
in a binary digital form down below.

108
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:16,753
So, ion channels transition 
between open states and closed states,

109
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:21,816
and they can do so with different 
rate constants that then determine

110
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,816
how long they spend in the open state, 
how long they spend in the closed state

111
00:07:25,816 --> 00:07:31,486
and the transition itself from open 
to closed and from closed to open

112
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:34,355
takes place on a microsecond time scale.

113
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:38,085
Extremely rapid changes
in the protein structure

114
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:42,995
open and close that ion channel 
and allow it to permeate ions

115
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:46,896
or to have no conductance whatsoever.

116
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:53,619
The probability that an ion channel 
is in the open state is one of the things

117
00:07:53,619 --> 00:07:58,589
that is most highly regulated 
in relationship to ion channel function.

118
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:01,829
Phosphorylation of the ion channel,

119
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:05,139
changes in the electric field 
across the plasma membrane,

120
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,159
changes in the concentration
of different ions,

121
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,829
and many other features can change
the open probability of an ion channel

122
00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:15,729
and can change it
on a variety of time scales

123
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:20,759
from hours to minutes, to seconds, 
to milliseconds and microseconds.

124
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,290
Open probability is highly regulated
and forms the most interesting

125
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,390
and convenient way to regulate 
the function of individual ion channels.

126
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,060
We can calculate the open probability
of an ion channel simply by summing up

127
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,060
the amount of time it spends here
in the open state and dividing it

128
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,180
by the total amount of time 
that the measurement is taking place.

129
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,050
So that's the open probability,

130
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,900
it's the amount of time spent
in the open state

131
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,570
divided by the time in the open
and the closed state.

132
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,900
In this example, the probability 
that the ion channel is open

133
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,560
is relatively low, maybe it's about 10%.

134
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,330
In this lower example you see 
that the ion channel spends

135
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,520
much longer periods of time 
in the open state than it did up here

136
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,150
so the open probability 
in this recording might be about 50%.

137
00:09:12,446 --> 00:09:16,446
And, as I mentioned, ion channels 
can rapidly transition

138
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:20,286
from high open probability 
to low open probability states

139
00:09:20,286 --> 00:09:24,446
through, for example, different 
signaling mechanisms inside cells.

140
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:28,834
Another extremely important feature 
of ion channels is that

141
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:34,304
they don't just let any ion through 
but very often they're highly selective

142
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:36,664
for one specific species of ions.

143
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:41,544
So there are, for example, ion channels 
that specifically allow sodium to permeate

144
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:46,034
Different ion channels that specifically
allow potassium to permeate,

145
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,141
others that allow chloride 
to permeate, and so on.

146
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,780
In order for that ion selectivity to occur

147
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,700
there must be some specific interactions
inside the ion channel.

148
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,953
So the ion channel isn't completely 
an aqueous pore as I previously mentioned

149
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,313
In fact, there must be 
a selectivity filter.

150
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:11,193
And in general it is thought to be
that at that selectivity filter,

151
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,628
in order to get a very specific selection
for a given ion,

152
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,643
there must be a close interaction.

153
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:22,593
So, although ions are hydrated, 
of course, in the solution

154
00:10:22,593 --> 00:10:25,523
of the extracellular 
and intracellular solution,

155
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:28,163
and they're also hydrated as they enter

156
00:10:28,163 --> 00:10:33,063
inside the ion channel pore
at different sides,

157
00:10:33,063 --> 00:10:35,033
somewhere in the middle of it,

158
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,433
for an ion channel selective 
for one type of ion,

159
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:42,433
there must be a selective 
high affinity binding site

160
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,963
which specifically says:

161
00:10:43,963 --> 00:10:48,723
This ion is the right one, 
it can permeate and other ions can't.

162
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,147
And so, for example, if you want 
to look at a cation channel

163
00:10:52,147 --> 00:10:54,634
-- cations are positively-charged ions --

164
00:10:54,634 --> 00:10:58,504
that selectivity filter would have
negative charges in it

165
00:10:58,504 --> 00:11:03,224
and would have a specific protein
conformation that binds to that ion

166
00:11:03,224 --> 00:11:09,058
and doesn't allow other ions to permeate
through that specific selectivity filter.

167
00:11:11,031 --> 00:11:14,001
The current flowing through an ion channel

168
00:11:14,001 --> 00:11:18,901
is regulated by a variety 
of different features.

169
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:21,081
We've talked about the open probability,

170
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,081
and that's something that's regulated
on a millisecond time scale.

171
00:11:25,081 --> 00:11:30,101
There are other features that also 
regulate how much current

172
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:32,811
is flowing through an ion channel.

173
00:11:32,811 --> 00:11:36,811
The electric field 
is one of the key driving forces

174
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,247
for how much current flow there is.

175
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:45,777
So, if we imagine that there's a given
concentration, say, of potassium,

176
00:11:45,777 --> 00:11:51,237
and there's the same concentration 
on the outside and the inside of the cell,

177
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:56,842
then, the major driving force that'll move
potassium through this ion channel

178
00:11:56,894 --> 00:12:00,334
will be the electric field 
across the plasma membrane,

179
00:12:00,334 --> 00:12:02,144
the membrane potential.

180
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:06,694
Equally important in terms of determining
how much ionic flux there'll be

181
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:12,039
at a given membrane potential
is the concentration of the ions.

182
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,530
If there's a much higher
concentration of ions

183
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:18,009
on either the inside or the outside,

184
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:23,009
then the probability that that ion 
will enter in the ion channel increases.

185
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:26,239
And again, we're dealing 
with the diffusion situation

186
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:30,799
where these ions, in terms of moving
through the ion channel,

187
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,923
we think of them, basically, 
as being free hydrated ions

188
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:39,527
and the ability to difuse will, of course,
depend upon the concentration.

189
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:44,895
Here we think about the membrane
potential dependence in such a situation

190
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:48,502
where we have an equal concentration
of the conducting ion

191
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:52,092
on the outside and the inside 
of the plasma membrane.

192
00:12:52,158 --> 00:12:57,418
If there's no electric field, 
if the membrane potential is zero

193
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,727
then there's also no driving force 
that tries to bring the potassium

194
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:05,136
in or out across 
this patch of membrane.

195
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:08,377
So, even if the ion channel
is opening and closing

196
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:10,827
there will then be no flow of current

197
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:13,667
and we'll get a flat line 
in our measurement.

198
00:13:13,837 --> 00:13:18,507
If we go to very high positive potentials,
we get a certain amount of current,

199
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:20,807
in this example 10 picoampere.

200
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:27,267
We go to negative potentials 
so we invert the electric field

201
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:31,419
and now when the ion channel opens 
current flows in the opposite direction

202
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,019
to where it went before.

203
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:36,279
So we might have 
-10 picoampere of current.

204
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,723
If we now halve the membrane potential,
we halve the current.

205
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:45,189
In this example, and it's not true
of all ion channels,

206
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:49,979
in this example we have 
a linear current-voltage relationship.

207
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:55,287
At 100 millivolts we have 10 picoampere,

208
00:13:55,287 --> 00:14:00,781
100 millivolts, 10 picoampere, 
we have a data point, we have 5, 50;

209
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:05,991
we have 0, 0; -5, -50;
and -10, -100.

210
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:12,113
This then forms a linear conductance 
and we can, of course,

211
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:17,993
calculate the single channel conductance
from the basis of these measurements.

212
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:22,533
We can do this using Ohm's Law:
V = IR

213
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,739
We can invert that and say

214
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:30,019
that the current flow is equal
to the Voltage times the Conductance

215
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:34,412
So, in order to work out
the conductance of this ion channel

216
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:39,792
we can say that it's equal to 
the current flowing -- 10 picoampere --

217
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:43,295
divided by the potential,
100 millivolts,

218
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:47,745
and that gives us a single channel
conductance of 100 picosiemens.

219
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,991
It turns out that this
is quite a large number.

220
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:55,481
Most ion channels have much smaller 
single channel conductances.

221
00:14:55,481 --> 00:14:59,475
Something like 1 picosiemens 
or 10 picosiemens perhaps.

222
00:14:59,692 --> 00:15:01,699
100 picosiemens is only

223
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:05,488
for the very largest
ion channel conductances.

224
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,327
So, we've now learned 
a number of interesting things

225
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:11,587
about the plasma membrane.

226
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:15,827
In addition to the phospholipid bilayer
that forms a capacitor

227
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:19,677
and sets up a strong electric field
that can be charged

228
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:23,827
by relatively few ions moving 
from one side of the membrane to another,

229
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:27,827
we've now also found out that there are
specific transport mechanisms

230
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:33,077
that move ions from one side 
of the plasma membrane to another.

231
00:15:33,077 --> 00:15:38,276
And these are largely aqueous pores
that allow high speeds of ions

232
00:15:38,276 --> 00:15:41,512
to traverse the membrane.
They are highly selective,

233
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,512
they can be selective 
for cations or anions,

234
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,352
positive or negatively charged ions,

235
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:51,202
and they can even furthermore be selective
for very specific types of ions

236
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,229
so there are sodium channels
and potasium channels

237
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:59,679
that specifically allow the permeation
of one species of ions.

238
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:04,576
These ionic movements 
through ion channels

239
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:10,326
are the basis of how membrane potential
can change nerve cells

240
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:15,555
and those are the electrical signals 
that underline the neuronal computation.

241
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:20,327
In the next few slides, I'd like 
to go through just a few examples,

242
00:16:20,456 --> 00:16:24,606
so that once again we learn 
a little bit about the ballpark

243
00:16:24,606 --> 00:16:27,755
in which we're operating
and what the size of currents are,

244
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:31,806
how much ions are moving 
second by second

245
00:16:31,806 --> 00:16:34,556
and how this works as we move 
from a single channel

246
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,950
to thinking about a whole cell 
with many ion channels.

247
00:16:39,807 --> 00:16:43,887
As we've already mentioned, 
a typical ion channel has a conductance

248
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,879
somewhere between 1 picosiemens
and 100 picosiemens.

249
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,879
And it seems interesting and relevant 
to find out how many ions

250
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:57,259
are actually transported per second 
through a single ion channel protein.

251
00:16:57,894 --> 00:17:01,894
So let's take the example 
of a 10 picosiemens channel,

252
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:05,894
already quite a large ion channel, 
very respectable.

253
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:08,964
The amount of current
through that ion channel

254
00:17:08,964 --> 00:17:12,700
will depend upon the voltage,
and, of course, the conductance.

255
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:20,202
The voltage, the membrane potential, 
is typically around 100 millivolts or less

256
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:25,079
and so we multiply this
by our conductance of 10 picosiemens

257
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:31,525
and this then works out to be 1 picoampere.

258
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:37,731
That is 10 to the -12 ampere.

259
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:43,266
If we want to know how many ions
this corresponds to,

260
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:47,266
we need to know the unitary ionic charge:

261
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:53,263
"e" which is equal to 
1.6 times 10 to -19 coulomb

262
00:17:54,075 --> 00:18:00,743
So the number of ions flowing
is 10 to the -12 over 10 to the -19,

263
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:06,311
approximately 10 to the power of 7
ions per second.

264
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:11,400
So, over a million ions flow 
through an ion channel

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,332
that's open at any given time.

266
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:17,430
A remarkable flux of ions.

267
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:25,734
A given patch of membrane often 
doesn't just contain one ion channel.

268
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:29,939
Typically, there might be two 
or more ion channels

269
00:18:29,939 --> 00:18:34,999
in the same patch of membrane 
that we have in our recording,

270
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,376
in our patch-clamp recording set-up.

271
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:42,395
So, typically the traces 
are more complicated

272
00:18:42,395 --> 00:18:44,825
than the ones we've already looked at.

273
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:48,787
It might remain closed 
for a while, open,

274
00:18:48,787 --> 00:18:52,317
one ion channel might open,
might close again,

275
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,607
stay closed for a while,

276
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:57,987
an ion channel might open 
and then a second ion channel might open,

277
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:03,497
closed and open, closed, 
and both of them closed here.

278
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:06,427
So you can see that 
there's now multiple states

279
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:09,717
There's a state where 
both ion channels are closed,

280
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,987
a state where one ion channel is open,

281
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:15,847
and then another state
where two ion channels are open.

282
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,837
And in general, of course, 
we have to consider the situation

283
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:22,287
where there's not just one type 
of ion channel, but there might be

284
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:26,617
multiple different sorts of ion channels
that might each individually

285
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:29,327
have their own single channel conductance

286
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,207
and their own specific ion permeability.

287
00:19:32,207 --> 00:19:34,877
So we might have a small ion channel

288
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:39,336
mixed in with a large one,

289
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:45,126
if we were recording them at the same time
in the same patch of membrane

290
00:19:45,126 --> 00:19:48,516
we would have traces 
that looked a bit like this

291
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:51,226
where you would see 
the individual channels

292
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:56,236
but it wouldn't necessarily look
exactly how we had it before

293
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,526
with just open and closed states

294
00:19:58,526 --> 00:20:02,526
but we would have these 
multiple apparent sub-states here,

295
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:04,276
that would actually be created

296
00:20:04,276 --> 00:20:07,636
by the mixture of ion channels 
that were inside

297
00:20:07,636 --> 00:20:11,636
an individual patch of membrane 
that we're recording from.

298
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:16,766
As we begin to think about cells, we need
to begin to be able to put together

299
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:19,902
the information from individual 
patches of membrane

300
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:23,902
and see how that works across
the entire plasma membrane.

301
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:27,488
Clearly, we expect to have
many ion channels

302
00:20:27,488 --> 00:20:32,004
present across the entire surface area
of an individual cell,

303
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:37,154
so we need to see how individual 
ion channels would summate

304
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,091
to form so-called whole-cell currents.

305
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:44,091
So individual ion channels will be 
opening, closing, opening and closing,

306
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:49,071
they'll do so independently
at different random times

307
00:20:49,071 --> 00:20:52,300
and in order to understand 
the whole current,

308
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,300
we need to add up all the currents
from many different ion channels

309
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,810
and that will then give us a total 
whole-cell current flowing

310
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,956
at any given time.

311
00:21:02,956 --> 00:21:08,206
The current across the plasma membrane
will depend upon a number of things.

312
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:11,707
One is the number of ion channels
that are present.

313
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:15,246
One, two, three, four, five, six, 
seven in this particular case

314
00:21:15,246 --> 00:21:18,831
but typically hundreds for real cells.

315
00:21:19,165 --> 00:21:21,847
The number of ion channels,

316
00:21:22,216 --> 00:21:27,176
the current flow for each
individual ion channel

317
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,867
-- so the single channel current --

318
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,567
and the open probability

319
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:35,737
-- the amount of time that it spends
in the open time,

320
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,697
relative to the total time --

321
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:42,017
And together, this then 
tells us on average

322
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:46,049
how much current will be flowing
across the plasma membrane.

323
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:51,354
It's also important to recollect
that the open probability

324
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:54,728
is the feature that's regulated
most dramatically

325
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,578
on the millisecond time scale.

326
00:21:56,578 --> 00:22:00,638
So, if you wanted to change the currents
flowing across the plasma membrane

327
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:04,642
then it would turn out 
to be through regulation

328
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:09,582
of this open probability that decides
the millisecond by millisecond

329
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:13,594
current flowing across 
the plasma membrane.

330
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,810
Finally, I'd like to point out 
that ion channels

331
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,510
aren't the only type of protein 
that spans the membrane

332
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,404
and moves ions from one side
of the membrane to another.

333
00:22:26,619 --> 00:22:29,339
The ion channels are remarkable

334
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:31,779
in that they have these 
very high transport rates

335
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:36,899
where millions of ions are flowing 
through single ion channels

336
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,205
across the plasma membrane.

337
00:22:39,564 --> 00:22:43,884
These high fluxes of ions are possible

338
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:47,854
because the ion channel 
has an aqueous pore

339
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:52,926
So the individual ions remain hydrated, 
fully diffusable, freely diffusable

340
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:55,469
except, of course,
for the selectivity filter

341
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:59,307
as we discussed where the hydrated ion

342
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:02,597
needs to come off,
specifically bind with selectivity filter

343
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:06,597
before it can continue 
traversing the ion channel.

344
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:12,319
There are other types of proteins, 
transporters, as they're typically called,

345
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,037
which operate on much slower time scales,

346
00:23:15,037 --> 00:23:19,037
so the transport rates 
are many orders of magnitude slower

347
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:26,087
but they are able to transport ions 
against the electrochemical gradients.

348
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:28,227
The ion channel, 
because of its aqueous pore,

349
00:23:28,227 --> 00:23:35,217
basically has to follow the electric field
and the concentration gradients

350
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:38,757
that are presented for the different ions.

351
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:44,297
A transporter, on the other hand, 
can transport ions against gradients.

352
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,900
It can couple different types of ions 
and different sorts of ionic gradients

353
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,064
and transport against electrochemical 
gradients perhaps even by using energy.

354
00:23:54,064 --> 00:23:59,564
So some proteins use ATP to get energy 
and will suck ions

355
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,766
against the normal
electrochemical gradients.

356
00:24:03,012 --> 00:24:04,395
In transporters,

357
00:24:04,395 --> 00:24:09,375
the ions are tightly bound to the protein
as it changes conformational state,

358
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:13,118
gradually moving these ions 
in tightly bound stages

359
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:18,068
from the outside 
to the inside of the cell.

360
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
Because of all these different 
conformational changes in the protein

361
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,010
that are required to move the ion,

362
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:26,930
this is a very slow transport phenomenon,

363
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:32,620
but it has this very nice flexibility 
that it can move the ions

364
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,411
against the electrochemical gradients 
through the use of energy

365
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:41,237
or through coupling it
to a favorable gradient.

366
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:46,413
So, we've now learned quite a lot 
about membrane biophysics.

367
00:24:46,713 --> 00:24:50,713
We've learned that there are 
phospholipid bilayers

368
00:24:50,713 --> 00:24:54,713
that act as capacitors 
and are impermeable to ions,

369
00:24:54,713 --> 00:25:00,813
and embedded inside 
these cell membranes are proteins,

370
00:25:00,813 --> 00:25:03,931
ion channel proteins 
that have an aqueous pore

371
00:25:03,931 --> 00:25:06,851
that transition between open 
and closed states

372
00:25:06,851 --> 00:25:09,811
allowing very rapid fluxes of ions,

373
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:13,811
millions of ions per second 
to move in and out of cells.

374
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,790
The ion channels can be highly specific 
moving only a single type

375
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,685
of ionic species,
for example, sodium or potassium,

376
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:27,616
and the flux of millions
of ions per second

377
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:30,866
can then be used to change
the membrane potential,

378
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:32,946
and that then forms the basis

379
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:35,928
of neuronal computation
and electrical signaling.

380
00:25:37,189 --> 00:25:41,649
In the next lesson we're going to learn
more about membrane potential

381
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:43,808
and electrochemical diffusion

382
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:47,808
and how these gradients
are set up and regulated

383
00:25:47,808 --> 00:25:51,528
and control membrane potential in cells.
