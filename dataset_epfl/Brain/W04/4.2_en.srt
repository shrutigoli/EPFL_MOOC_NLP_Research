1
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,636
In the last video,

2
00:00:07,636 --> 00:00:10,960
we saw that there are
two important major types

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,260
of ligand-gated glutamate receptors.

4
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:18,394
These are the receptors that are sitting
in the postsynaptic membrane,

5
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:22,735
and respond through the release
of glutamate from presynaptic terminals.

6
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:27,890
We explored the function
of these ligand-gated ion channels

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,722
in isolated patches of membrane,
and found that there were

8
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:34,682
two different types
of glutamate receptors:

9
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:38,304
the AMPA receptor,
that was extremely fast,

10
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,548
and the much slower NMDA receptors,

11
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:43,837
that in addition were found
to be voltage dependent.

12
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:48,232
In this lesson we'll explore
how these receptors function

13
00:00:48,232 --> 00:00:51,796
at real synapses, in situ, in the brain.

14
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,360
These receptors are, of course,
placed in the postsynaptic locations

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,419
immediately adjacent
to presynaptic release sites,

16
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:04,379
so the action potential invading an axon,

17
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,308
and a presynaptic nerve terminal,

18
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,911
will cause release of glutamate
from the presynaptic specialization,

19
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:15,233
and that will act on
the postsynaptically located receptors.

20
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:18,383
And so now instead of considering
what happens in response

21
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:22,233
to a 1 millimolar pulse
of glutamate for 1 millisecond,

22
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:24,933
we'll consider the more
physiological situation

23
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,483
of where an action potential
evokes release of glutamate,

24
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:33,239
and that acts on these receptors present
in the postsynaptic membrane.

25
00:01:33,688 --> 00:01:38,899
We'll also think about how the integration
of those postsynaptic conductances

26
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,130
occurs in the postsynaptic neuron,
and how those conductances

27
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,850
are changed into
membrane potential changes

28
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,725
that in their turn can effect
the ligand-gated ion channels themselves,

29
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,618
through the voltage-dependence
of the NMDA receptor,

30
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,567
and we'll also think about what happens
in terms of dendritic integration,

31
00:01:57,567 --> 00:02:01,165
and how those potentials
are filtered across the dendrites

32
00:02:01,165 --> 00:02:03,771
before they reach
the final integration site

33
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:06,861
in the soma
and the axon initial segment.

34
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:11,085
So here now we have a schematic drawing

35
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:13,402
of what happens at a real synapse,

36
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:16,832
where we're considering
a presynaptic neuron,

37
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,300
that fires an action potential,

38
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,126
perhaps in response to a current injection
in the experimental setting,

39
00:02:23,126 --> 00:02:26,912
and simultaneously, we're recording
from a small, compact cell,

40
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:31,490
that's voltage-clamped and synaptically
connected to the presynaptic neuron.

41
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:35,200
So the action potential invades
the presynaptic nerve terminal,

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
it releases glutamate, and with
a short delay of around 1 millisecond,

43
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,965
there's an activation of
the postsynaptic glutamatergic currents.

44
00:02:45,508 --> 00:02:50,166
And at a negative membrane
potential postsynaptically,

45
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:54,788
the total synaptic current
that's recorded here is brief, and fast,

46
00:02:54,788 --> 00:03:00,156
and it is almost entirely dominated
by the AMPA component.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,980
AMPA receptors, just like
the isolated patch measurements

48
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:08,496
that we discussed in the previous video,

49
00:03:08,496 --> 00:03:13,455
give rise to short, 2 millisecond
or so duration conductance changes

50
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:16,727
that here are then measured
through the voltage-clamp amplifier

51
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,445
in terms of a excitatory
postsynaptic current.

52
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:25,710
That's an EPSC,
an excitatory postsynaptic current.

53
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:32,464
The NMDA receptors are, however,
largely blocked at negative potentials.

54
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:37,511
The magnesium ions from the extracellular
solution enter the NMDA receptor,

55
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,731
and block it at negative potentials.

56
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:44,061
And so at typical resting membrane
potentials of a neuron,

57
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:45,824
somewhere around -60 mV,

58
00:03:45,824 --> 00:03:49,297
the NMDA conductance is basically shut.

59
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,520
The AMPA conductance is large,

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,610
and the total excitatory
postsynaptic current, the EPSC,

61
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,251
has this fast kinetics,
dominated by the AMPA receptor.

62
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:05,654
If we now change the postsynaptic
membrane potential,

63
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,586
still in voltage-clamp mode,

64
00:04:07,586 --> 00:04:10,859
so now we voltage-clamp
our small, compact neuron

65
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,249
to be at +60 mV,

66
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,915
the AMPA receptor looks as before,

67
00:04:16,915 --> 00:04:20,402
except now, of course, the current
is outward, rather than inward,

68
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:21,822
we're sitting over here,

69
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:26,050
reversal potential for AMPA
and NMDA receptors is close to 0 mV,

70
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,915
so the amplitude and kinetics
of the AMPA receptor are similar,

71
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,391
but now the NMDA channels can contribute.

72
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,345
Magnesium has been expelled

73
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,497
from the ion channel pore,
it no longer blocks,

74
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:42,696
and we get a considerable current
flowing through the NMDA receptor,

75
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:45,316
and it's the summation
of these two that give rise

76
00:04:45,316 --> 00:04:50,012
to the total EPSC recorded
at positive potentials.

77
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:55,264
A fast AMPA component, and a slower,
longer-lasting NMDA component.

78
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:59,163
Now different synapses
have very different ratios

79
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,891
of AMPA and NMDA receptors
that are present.

80
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:06,582
Some synapses are almost entirely
dominated by AMPA receptors,

81
00:05:06,582 --> 00:05:11,810
whereas other synapses are almost entirely
dominated by NMDA receptors.

82
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,958
But in most synapses, there's a fair mix,

83
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,047
where both AMPA and NMDA receptors

84
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:22,506
are present in roughly even quantities

85
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:25,025
in terms of the total synaptic currents.

86
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,626
And so although there are cases

87
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:30,310
where there's a large AMPA,
and just a very small NMDA,

88
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,693
or small AMPA and very large NMDA,

89
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:38,302
most of the time there's a mix,
and both AMPA and NMDA

90
00:05:38,302 --> 00:05:42,775
contribute importantly
at most glutamatergic synapses.

91
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:47,012
Now we'd like to know,
in the physiological situation,

92
00:05:47,012 --> 00:05:50,684
where the postsynaptic membrane
is <i>not</i> voltage-clamped,

93
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,122
but rather that the membrane potential
is free to swing

94
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:57,177
under the influence
of these ionic channels

95
00:05:57,177 --> 00:05:59,133
that are present in the plasma membrane,

96
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,524
how now do these postsynaptic conductances

97
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:04,937
of the AMPA and the NMDA receptor

98
00:06:04,937 --> 00:06:07,956
interplay with membrane potential?

99
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:11,940
And so we imagine that we have
a membrane potential recording

100
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,177
from a small, compact neuron
that receives a glutamatergic input.

101
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,582
The action potential comes down,

102
00:06:19,582 --> 00:06:22,091
the axon releases glutamate,

103
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,622
and of course it activates
the ion channels that are sitting here,

104
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:29,771
the glutamate receptors,
the AMPA and the NMDA receptors,

105
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,567
and that of course
causes then a current flow

106
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:35,846
through the AMPA and NMDA receptors.

107
00:06:35,846 --> 00:06:38,127
And we've already
considered the relationship

108
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:40,801
between current flow
and membrane potential

109
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,621
in our electrical equivalent circuits,

110
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:46,374
where we found that
the phospholipid bilayer

111
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,915
could be thought of as a capacitor,

112
00:06:48,915 --> 00:06:51,889
that we draw here,
in the electrical equivalent circuit,

113
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:56,427
and the individual ion channels,
with their different ionic permeabilities,

114
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:59,899
can be thought of as conductors,
or resistors, alternatively,

115
00:06:59,899 --> 00:07:03,837
with a specific driving force
relating to their reversal potential.

116
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:07,049
So we have potassium, sodium
and chloride conductances,

117
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:09,604
and now, for the synaptic conductances,

118
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:12,957
we can add the AMPA
and the NMDA conductances

119
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:16,054
that have reversal potentials
close to 0 mV,

120
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:21,774
and that then are involved in determining
the membrane potential of the cell.

121
00:07:23,116 --> 00:07:27,551
We also already know
the quantitative description

122
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:31,381
of how membrane potential
and currents interrelate.

123
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:35,321
So the total membrane current
is made out of different components.

124
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,493
There's the capacitative component,

125
00:07:37,493 --> 00:07:41,920
that's the filling or charging
of the capacitor,

126
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,068
that then relates to the change
in membrane potential over time,

127
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:52,175
so that's the typical equation here,
from Q = CV,

128
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:55,488
we take the derivative of that,
and that then gives us

129
00:07:55,488 --> 00:08:00,701
that the current is equal to
dVm/dt times the capacitance.

130
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:04,062
We also have our various leak conductances

131
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:06,958
relating to potassium, sodium
and chloride conductances,

132
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:10,531
that we can also just rewrite
in a single term, here,

133
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,817
that the leak is equal
to the membrane potential,

134
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,974
minus some leak potential,

135
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:20,804
times the leak conductance overall,

136
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:24,077
and the leak here

137
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:26,850
is simply the resting
membrane potential of the cell

138
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,874
in the absence of synaptic conductances,

139
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,033
and typically that's sitting
at around -70 mV.

140
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:37,417
Now we also add
the synaptic conductances here,

141
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,639
and of course the current flow through
each of these synaptic conductances

142
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:44,422
relates to the driving force,
or the membrane potential,

143
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,703
the 0 mV reversal potential,

144
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,522
so it's simply the membrane potential,

145
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:52,767
times the conductance
of the different channels.

146
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:55,400
And of course for the NMDA conductance

147
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,906
we also have to, in addition, think that
this is actually voltage dependent,

148
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,361
in addition, of course, to its dependence

149
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:06,908
upon the presence of glutamate
released from the presynaptic terminals.

150
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,905
Now, importantly, when we think
about these currents,

151
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,935
and their relationship to voltage,

152
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:17,097
we need to think about the charging
and discharging of a capacitor.

153
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:20,894
And so there's a big difference between
the synaptic currents that are flowing,

154
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,495
and the influence
on the membrane potential,

155
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:27,518
both in terms of how the leak conductances

156
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:31,782
will determine how large
that potential is, postsynaptically,

157
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:36,463
how large the EPSP is in response
to a given conductance,

158
00:09:36,463 --> 00:09:41,027
and of course the membrane
capacitance will also affect

159
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:44,463
the kinetics of how
those currents are translated

160
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:46,800
into membrane potential changes.

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,198
And so if we now try to directly compare,

162
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:53,008
for the same synapse,
the same conditions,

163
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:58,130
presynaptic action potential
gives rise to a fast EPSC.

164
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,651
If we're talking about
hyperpolarized conditions at -70 mV,

165
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:04,961
we only need to think about
AMPA receptors,

166
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:06,980
the NMDA receptor is blocked,

167
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:11,015
so we have these brief, transient
AMPA conductances,

168
00:10:11,015 --> 00:10:16,371
lasting about 2 ms,
and that then generates a 2 ms EPSC,

169
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:20,752
the current follows the conductance
in voltage clamp mode,

170
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:23,959
and we see these rapid synaptic currents.

171
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,909
Now in terms of the membrane potential,

172
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:31,012
the situation is a bit more complicated.

173
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:35,514
So we imagine, again, a synapse here,
the release of glutamate.

174
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:38,862
We have the synaptic currents that are,

175
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:42,512
as stated here, about 2 ms in duration,

176
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:46,901
then the conductance closes,
and that is then closed,

177
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:52,244
but there's still a lot of charge
that entered during that EPSC.

178
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:57,679
And the decay phase of the EPSP is determined

179
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,473
by how that charge
then discharges the capacitor,

180
00:11:02,473 --> 00:11:04,963
and that is, of course,
through the leak conductances.

181
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,141
So we have the leak conductance here,

182
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,795
we have our membrane capacitor here,

183
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:14,747
and essentially the charging
that occurs due to the EPSC,

184
00:11:14,747 --> 00:11:16,930
that causes the depolarization
of the membrane,

185
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,657
the decay phase of the EPSP,
that's determined here

186
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:24,306
through the leak conductance
and the membrane capacitance.

187
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:26,394
And you'll remember
from our previous studies

188
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:30,511
that there's a membrane
time constant that is related here

189
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:35,027
to the membrane resistance,
times the membrane capacitance,

190
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,071
and of course
the membrane resistance here

191
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,000
is simply 1 over the membrane conductance,

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,941
or the leak conductance, if you like.

193
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,749
And typically these
membrane time constants

194
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,948
are on the order
of many tens of milliseconds,

195
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:54,493
so it's somewhere 10, 20 ms in duration

196
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:56,988
for the membrane time constants,

197
00:11:56,988 --> 00:12:01,313
And that's then the conversion factor,
if you like, between the EPSC,

198
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:03,666
which has this rapid time constant,

199
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:07,490
and the EPSP,
that's through the filtering here,

200
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,443
the discharge properties
of the membrane capacitor

201
00:12:10,443 --> 00:12:15,171
that has a built-in time constant
sitting somewhere around 10 ms,

202
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:16,845
and so there's a major difference

203
00:12:16,845 --> 00:12:20,552
in the time course
between EPSCs and EPSPs,

204
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:24,532
when EPSP is a much slower
and longer-lasting event

205
00:12:24,532 --> 00:12:27,862
than the underlying conductance
that drives it.

206
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:35,143
So far we've been looking at schematic
example-type drawings

207
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:39,266
of how EPSCs and EPSPs are.

208
00:12:39,936 --> 00:12:42,434
Now I'd like to look at real data,

209
00:12:42,434 --> 00:12:47,103
how synaptic transmission looks like
in physiological conditions,

210
00:12:47,103 --> 00:12:50,476
at least in brain slice-type recordings.

211
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:55,161
In this particular example,
we're recording simultaneously

212
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:57,824
from three different neurons.

213
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:03,054
There's a presynaptic neuron that
we stimulate to fire an action potential

214
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:05,430
at a well-controlled point in time,

215
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,698
and simultaneously we record
from two postsynaptic neurons,

216
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:12,099
a red neuron and a blue neuron,

217
00:13:12,099 --> 00:13:14,424
each of which is synaptically connected,

218
00:13:14,424 --> 00:13:17,970
and so the action potential here
propagates down the axon,

219
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,799
releases glutamate onto the red cell,

220
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,111
and also simultaneously releases
glutamate onto the blue cell.

221
00:13:25,474 --> 00:13:29,923
And it turns out that the properties
of the postsynaptic potentials

222
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,712
are really very different in this example,

223
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:36,333
between these two cells, postsynaptically.

224
00:13:36,737 --> 00:13:40,875
These potentials can be thought of
as unitary potentials,

225
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:46,203
in the sense that a major and important
unit of information in the brain

226
00:13:46,203 --> 00:13:50,341
is one cell firing
a single action potential.

227
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:55,009
And we then measure the so-called
unitary postsynaptic potentials again

228
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:59,774
in single cells,
at the somatic location here,

229
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:03,300
how the action potential
of one neuron here

230
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,224
influences the postsynaptic
membrane potential

231
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,559
of two other neurons.

232
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:13,350
And in this particular example,
an action potential in the black neuron

233
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:17,620
induces a large depolarization
in the red neuron,

234
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,451
so let's look at the scale bar here.

235
00:14:19,451 --> 00:14:22,403
This is about 0.5 mV depolarization,

236
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,702
lasting some tens of milliseconds
in the red cell,

237
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:32,493
whereas in the blue cell you'll see
that the amplitude is much smaller,

238
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:33,959
there's a different scale bar,

239
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,408
it's about ten times smaller,

240
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:40,100
and also the duration of the PSP
in this case is also much faster,

241
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,637
the decay time here is maybe 10 ms,

242
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:45,494
whereas here maybe it's 30 ms,

243
00:14:45,494 --> 00:14:47,712
and so there are differences
in the amplitude

244
00:14:47,712 --> 00:14:49,736
and the kinetics of the responses,

245
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,927
and in addition there's also
an obvious difference

246
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:57,652
in the reproducibility, or the variability
of the postsynaptic potential.

247
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,941
Here we have ten consecutive trials,

248
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:02,858
an action potential
is evoked in each one,

249
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,819
and in the red cell you see that there's

250
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:08,098
a relatively constant depolarization
that's measured.

251
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:12,355
Here we superimpose those ten trials,
and you see that it's almost

252
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:16,379
the same postsynaptic depolarization
we see in the red cell,

253
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,231
whereas in the blue cell
there seems to be enormous variability,

254
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:22,998
sometimes there's a response,
sometimes there isn't,

255
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:27,862
and that corresponds to failures
and successes, as we record here.

256
00:15:28,785 --> 00:15:31,965
And we can envisage a sort
of a simple explanation

257
00:15:31,965 --> 00:15:34,590
for why we might have this type

258
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,104
of large-amplitude, reliable transmission,

259
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:42,421
compared to this small-amplitude,
unreliable synaptic transmission,

260
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:47,383
and part of the reason
for this explanation then might be

261
00:15:47,383 --> 00:15:50,671
that there's many different synapses here,

262
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,431
that actually independently form

263
00:15:53,431 --> 00:15:57,007
release sites and
postsynaptic contact sites

264
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:00,212
between this single axon here.

265
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:04,984
It might make multiple contacts,
say it might make 10 different synapses,

266
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:09,842
each of which can independently
have released glutamate onto this red cell

267
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,841
when an action potential is released,

268
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:15,192
and that will then increase
the amplitude of the response,

269
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:18,251
and in addition decrease the variability,

270
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:22,933
because all though these might be
independently releasing glutamate or not,

271
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,928
in the probabilistic manner
of synaptic transmission,

272
00:16:25,928 --> 00:16:30,369
if we have 10 synapses,
then the chance that some of them

273
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:34,192
will be releasing simultaneously,
and the variance here will decrease,

274
00:16:34,192 --> 00:16:38,779
whereas for the blue cell, it really
might be just a single synaptic contact,

275
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,513
and then the action potential

276
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:43,788
either causes release
of a neurotransmitter or it doesn't,

277
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:48,654
and then we can get this all-or-none type
of synaptic transmission.

278
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,896
And of course there's also
some smaller amplitude responses,

279
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:54,039
and that might then correspond to vesicles

280
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,280
that have less glutamate
in them than other vesicles.

281
00:16:58,177 --> 00:17:02,668
So typically when we think about
synaptic transmission in the brain,

282
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:07,421
there are small-amplitude PSPs,
and even this one,

283
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:11,238
which is amongst the larger
that are seen at most synapses.

284
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:15,476
This is still a small depolarization,
compared to what's needed

285
00:17:15,476 --> 00:17:17,918
in order to fire an action potential.

286
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:21,461
So here the postsynaptic cell
might be at -70 mV,

287
00:17:21,768 --> 00:17:23,815
we get a 5 mV depolarization,

288
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:29,083
but we're still more than 20 mV
away from action potential threshold,

289
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:32,606
and so unitary inputs onto most cells

290
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:35,811
don't cause postsynaptic
action potential firing.

291
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,432
And what you need in order to get

292
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,039
action potentials fired
in postsynaptic cells

293
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,450
are perhaps inputs from many cells
around it, that all provide input,

294
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,911
perhaps at the same time,
onto the postsynaptic cell,

295
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:51,741
so that you can get
a larger degree of summation,

296
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:55,629
and then you can cross
action potential thresholds, and fire.

297
00:17:56,678 --> 00:17:58,879
Although this is
the most common situation,

298
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:03,238
where we have
relatively small unitary EPSPs,

299
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:08,552
on the range of a few millivolts,
lasting a few tens of milliseconds,

300
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:11,184
there are other examples in the brain,

301
00:18:11,184 --> 00:18:13,878
and one important one that's studied,

302
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:16,954
in much detail,

303
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,806
is the so-called <i>Calyx of Held</i> synapse,

304
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:24,977
where an individual axon comes
and envelops the postsynaptic cell,

305
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:29,981
and has really a large number
of release sites present in it,

306
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:35,000
maybe some 200 or more synapses,

307
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,950
and because the action potential comes in,

308
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,202
and it then releases glutamate
onto the postsynaptic cell,

309
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:46,021
which has many receptors,
this then causes automatically

310
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,505
an action potential to fire
in the postsynaptic neuron,

311
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,508
and so there are cases
where an action potential

312
00:18:52,508 --> 00:18:56,525
is converted into an action potential
in the postsynaptic cell

313
00:18:56,525 --> 00:19:00,054
through a large number
of synaptic connections,

314
00:19:00,054 --> 00:19:03,890
like, for example,
here in the Calyx of Held,

315
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,687
an example from the auditory brain stem.

316
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,777
But for most synapses in the brain

317
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:12,306
we need to think about
small depolarizations,

318
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,021
lasting relatively short amounts of time,

319
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:18,864
and that these potentials
need to be integrated, postsynapticallly,

320
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:23,009
in order to have further processing
of information in the brain.

321
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,742
We can begin to explore this process
of postsynaptic integration

322
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:33,135
artificially, at first, by thinking
about what happens

323
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:36,119
as we simply depolarize
the postsynaptic cell.

324
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,060
And so we can imagine
having a recording electrode

325
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,412
sitting on a cell,
that's receiving a synaptic input,

326
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:50,518
glutamate is being released,
opening AMPA and NMDA receptors,

327
00:19:50,518 --> 00:19:53,632
and we're measuring
the membrane potential of the cell.

328
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:57,058
And in addition to measuring
the membrane potential of the cell,

329
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:00,788
we can also use this electrode
to inject current.

330
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:06,254
And so we can inject 0 pA of current,

331
00:20:06,254 --> 00:20:09,691
in which case we measure
the membrane potential at rest,

332
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,006
so this is the current being injected.

333
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:15,210
We can inject some current,
and that will then cause

334
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,186
a filling of the membrane
capacitance, a depolarization.

335
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:22,741
We can depolarize,
even inject more current,

336
00:20:22,741 --> 00:20:26,118
and cause further depolarization,
and then we can, of course,

337
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:29,494
stimulate the presynaptic cell
at different time points,

338
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:33,953
and see what happens to the PSP
at different membrane potentials.

339
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:38,077
And here are examples, schematic drawings
of what might happen.

340
00:20:38,077 --> 00:20:43,814
At -65 mV the membrane potential
is relatively hyperpolarized.

341
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:47,308
The NMDA receptors don't get activated,

342
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:50,442
and so we have an AMPA-driven EPSP,

343
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,846
the rapid 2 ms conductance
of the AMPA receptor,

344
00:20:53,846 --> 00:20:56,220
and then the discharge of the membrane,

345
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,863
through the membrane time course,

346
00:20:57,863 --> 00:21:00,976
discharging through the leak conductances.

347
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:05,869
If we depolarize the postsynaptic cell,
here by 10 mV,

348
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,632
and it gives the same
presynaptic action potential,

349
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:10,686
same amount of glutamate
is being released,

350
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,769
same activation of AMPA receptors,

351
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,230
but now, in addition, also perhaps
some contribution of NMDA receptors,

352
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,443
because we're depolarized a bit.

353
00:21:20,443 --> 00:21:23,653
And so there are now two different
phenomena that are going on.

354
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:27,702
If we think about our current
voltage relationships,

355
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:30,390
we've gone from having large currents,

356
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,795
to having somewhat smaller currents,

357
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:36,651
and so there might be a decrease
in the amplitude of the EPSP.

358
00:21:36,651 --> 00:21:40,213
if we're just thinking about
the AMPA component,

359
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:43,811
but on the other side
we have the NMDA component

360
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:48,731
that might now be making
a larger contribution.

361
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:52,732
And so we can imagine that perhaps
at slightly later times during the PSP

362
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:57,037
the AMPA component is supplemented
by an NMDA component,

363
00:21:57,037 --> 00:22:00,342
and the EPSP might have
a slightly longer time course,

364
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:03,098
and a smaller overall amplitude,

365
00:22:03,098 --> 00:22:05,751
because of the change
in the driving force,

366
00:22:05,751 --> 00:22:08,738
that is also, of course,
involved in helping

367
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:11,192
the NMDA receptor get recruited.

368
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,942
If we depolarize even further,

369
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:17,219
there'll be a further drop
in the amplitude of the response,

370
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:20,814
because we're moving towards
smaller and smaller currents,

371
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:23,610
the driving force for the AMPA receptor

372
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:27,663
has decreased, but we're, of course,
much closer to AP threshold,

373
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:32,014
and if we hit AP threshold,
an action potential wlll be fired

374
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:34,762
in the postsynaptic neuron,
and the membrane potential

375
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:38,284
will zoom up to something like +40 mV.

376
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:41,188
And so you can see here that
there are some relatively complex

377
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:44,497
membrane potential dynamics
that we need to think about.

378
00:22:44,497 --> 00:22:47,906
As we depolarize,
the driving force gets smaller,

379
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:52,043
but at the same time we're also
recruiting more NMDA receptors,

380
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:53,547
and so, again, depending upon

381
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:57,594
how much NMDA receptors
are present at the synapse,

382
00:22:57,594 --> 00:23:02,510
you can get quite different effects
of depolarization at different synapses.

383
00:23:03,604 --> 00:23:06,434
The situation is, in fact,
much more complicated

384
00:23:06,891 --> 00:23:09,943
because these synapses that
we've been talking about

385
00:23:09,943 --> 00:23:14,451
are typically distributed
over the dendrites of a neuron,

386
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:17,042
and so there will be glutamatergic inputs

387
00:23:17,042 --> 00:23:19,699
that are distributed
all over the dendrites,

388
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:22,920
and, in fact, relatively
few synapses are present

389
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,201
on the actual soma of a neuron,

390
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:28,242
and so, typically, the input
that arrives on a cell

391
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,542
occurs on dendrites

392
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:34,700
at electrotonically remote
locations to the soma.

393
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,777
And so if glutamate is coming in

394
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:40,857
at synapses close to
our recording site here,

395
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:46,043
because there's relatively
little membrane here, so these are small,

396
00:23:46,043 --> 00:23:50,840
the dendrites are something like
1 micrometer or so in diameter.

397
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:55,927
And the opening of the AMPA
and NMDA conductances here,

398
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:57,686
then the charge that comes in here,

399
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,727
will then cause a considerable
change in the voltage,

400
00:24:00,727 --> 00:24:04,170
because there's relatively little
membrane here that needs to get charged.

401
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,226
And so you get large membrane potential

402
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:10,951
changes here in dendritic areas,

403
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,963
because of the small surface area,

404
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:15,725
and these are also very fast
in their time course,

405
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:20,081
because the amount of membrane,
again, here, is relatively low,

406
00:24:20,081 --> 00:24:23,034
and there's a rapid flow
of current away from this,

407
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:26,839
down the axial direction of these cables

408
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:31,301
that are, ultimately,
the dendrites that we're thinking about.

409
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,179
And so the membrane potential
has these rapid,

410
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:36,685
and large amplitude excursions,

411
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:39,410
when synaptic conductances are opened,

412
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:44,187
and those potentials, of course,
spread passively down the dendrites,

413
00:24:44,187 --> 00:24:49,231
and are filtered, in time, because
of the cable properties of the dendrites,

414
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:51,953
and so what's ultimately seen at the soma

415
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:55,314
is a much slower,
and smaller amplitude version

416
00:24:55,314 --> 00:25:00,304
of this synaptic potential that's
been recorded here in the dendrites.

417
00:25:00,864 --> 00:25:03,886
So this gives rise
to even further complexity

418
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:08,116
as to how synaptic integration
occurs in real neurons.

419
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:11,822
So if we have our cell body here,
and there are synapses

420
00:25:11,822 --> 00:25:17,180
that are distributed across
the dendritic arborization of the cell

421
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,308
there will be a barrage of membrane
potential fluctuations that occur,

422
00:25:23,431 --> 00:25:27,411
some of them at the same time,
and others at different times,

423
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:30,273
across the dendritic arborization.

424
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:34,886
And if there are conductances
that are synaptic inputs

425
00:25:34,886 --> 00:25:36,939
that come at slightly different times

426
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:40,943
then they may not give rise to summation,

427
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:44,426
but if, on the other hand,
these synapses occur at the same time

428
00:25:44,426 --> 00:25:49,004
then of course you can get
much larger depolarizations here,

429
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:50,681
and so there's a summation process,

430
00:25:50,681 --> 00:25:55,781
and that summation process can take place
also locally on dendrites,

431
00:25:55,781 --> 00:26:00,795
and that can even be very helpful,
in terms of activating NMDA receptors.

432
00:26:00,795 --> 00:26:05,637
You'll remember that the NMDA receptor
is blocked at hyperpolarized potentials,

433
00:26:05,637 --> 00:26:08,332
but, especially in these dendrites,

434
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:12,706
where the individual synaptic events
have large amplitudes,

435
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:15,870
if you just have a few of them
occurring more simultaneously

436
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,993
we can get very large
depolarizations in the dendrites

437
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:24,198
that are likely to activate
NMDA receptors extensively.

438
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,314
And so these distal areas here

439
00:26:27,314 --> 00:26:29,734
might be involved
in communicating with the soma

440
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:33,727
largely through activation
of the voltage-gated NMDA receptors

441
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:37,034
that might further drive
voltage-gated sodium conductances.

442
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:40,991
And so the process
of dendritic integration,

443
00:26:40,991 --> 00:26:43,821
in both terms of time and space,

444
00:26:43,821 --> 00:26:48,078
is very complex, and there can be
highly nonlinear phenomena

445
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:51,367
going on in the dendrites,
as well as, of course,

446
00:26:52,242 --> 00:26:55,075
there can be proximal inputs
close to the soma

447
00:26:55,075 --> 00:26:57,392
that in themselves give rise

448
00:26:57,392 --> 00:27:01,410
to large potentials in the soma.

449
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,566
And so what we typically see at
the membrane potential level, at the soma

450
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:10,960
is then the summated input
of the synapses across the dendrites,

451
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,710
and it's when the membrane
potential at the soma,

452
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,549
or more precisely
at the axon initial segment,

453
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,697
crosses the threshold,
that an action potential is fired,

454
00:27:20,697 --> 00:27:22,999
giving rise to the output of that cell.

455
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:27,783
So that's, in a sense, the essence
of the neuronal computation,

456
00:27:27,783 --> 00:27:30,357
how you take
these postsynaptic potentials,

457
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,675
integrate them
at the axon initial segment,

458
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:36,125
and decide whether
to fire an action potential, or not.

459
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:38,383
And so we've now begun to consider

460
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:42,239
what happens at glutamatergic
synapses in the brain.

461
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:46,638
These glutamatergic synapses
are very important to think about

462
00:27:46,638 --> 00:27:48,426
because they make up about 80%

463
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:51,451
of all the synapses
that are present in the brain,

464
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,495
and so we absolutely
need to understand how these work

465
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:57,562
if we want to understand
how the brain functions.

466
00:27:58,167 --> 00:28:03,038
The postsynaptic responses are composed
of rapid AMPA conductances,

467
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,802
and much slower, longer-lasting
NMDA conductances

468
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:09,852
that in addition have
a voltage-dependence to them.

469
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,037
And it's that voltage-dependence
of the NMDA receptor

470
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:18,270
that gives rise to complicated
membrane potential dynamics.

471
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,997
Individual, unitary PSPs
that come into the soma

472
00:28:22,997 --> 00:28:24,781
are typically small in amplitude,

473
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:29,430
they may be one or two millivolts
in amplitude if you're lucky,

474
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,422
and they last some tens of milliseconds.

475
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:33,239
But typically they're not sufficient

476
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,909
to drive postsynaptic
action potential firing.

477
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:38,096
For that we probably need the convergence

478
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,716
of many tens or hundreds
of presynaptic neurons,

479
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:46,262
all to fire action potentials
with some degree of synchrony

480
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:49,603
so that we can get this
postsynaptic temporal integration

481
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,869
on the time scale of the PSP,

482
00:28:51,869 --> 00:28:56,166
which is somewhere
around 10 to 20 to 50 ms,

483
00:28:56,772 --> 00:29:01,346
depending again upon how much
depolarization there is postsynaptically,

484
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:06,647
and to what extent the slower
NMDA receptors are being activated.

485
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:13,277
And so the total conversion of activation
of postsynaptic conductances,

486
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:16,730
downstream of an action potential
in the presynaptic terminal,

487
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,612
is a complicated phenomenon,

488
00:29:18,612 --> 00:29:22,956
and it's still something that's actively
being investigated in research,

489
00:29:22,956 --> 00:29:27,801
in terms of how these dendritic inputs
are integrated in real neurons

490
00:29:27,801 --> 00:29:31,565
during real behavior
in the mammalian brain.
