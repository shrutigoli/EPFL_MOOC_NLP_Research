00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:08,072
One of the most remarkable things
about the brain

2
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:13,164
is its ability to change in response
to sensory experience.

3
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:18,728
During development, sensory experience
specifies how the neural circuits will wire

4
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:23,118
in order to be able to process information
in a sensible manner

5
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,831
and throughout our lives, we learn
through changing in the neural circuits

6
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:30,395
inside the brain.

7
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:36,641
The changes inside the brain
are largely occurring at synapses,

8
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:42,366
so-called <i>synaptic plasticity</i>
changes how synapses function,

9
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:46,215
and that's the topic of today's video.

10
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:49,970
Much of the synaptic plasticity
that takes place in the brain

11
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,010
is so-called <i>post-synaptic plasticity</i>

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,278
where there are changes
in the receptor composition

13
00:00:56,278 --> 00:00:58,189
of the post-synaptic membrane

14
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:00,970
at excitatory glutamatergic synapses.

15
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:04,696
We've already discussed
pre-synaptic plasticity,

16
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:10,854
and that's the dominant form of plasticity
on the millisecond and second time scale

17
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:14,331
in the brain,
but long-term forms of plasticity,

18
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:17,904
the types of changes in the brain
that might underlie memories

19
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:21,912
that last for our lives,
or at least for days,

20
00:01:21,986 --> 00:01:24,262
that is thought to largely occur

21
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:28,053
through changes
in the post-synaptic density.

22
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:31,026
And that's what we'll focus on today.

23
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:37,347
We'll think about changes that are largely
driven by the NMDA receptor

24
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,943
that induces synaptic plasticity

25
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:43,209
and it is changes
in the AMPA receptor composition

26
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,907
that largely underlie the long-term
functional differences at synapses.

27
00:01:50,565 --> 00:01:55,868
Bliss and Lomo discovered Long Term
Potentiation in the hippocampus.

28
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,641
They found that if they stimulated
axonal fibers and recorded

29
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:07,519
synaptic potentials in the hippocampus,
they could evoke a stable baseline

30
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,670
where each time
they stimulated some fibers,

31
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,630
they would get excitatory
post-synaptic potentials,

32
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:18,637
release of glutamate activating
AMPA receptors, primarily.

33
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:23,450
They then made a LTP induction protocol.

34
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:27,512
LTP stands for Long Term Potentiation,

35
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:31,149
and they did this through
high frequency stimulation

36
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:33,664
of the axons that they were stimulating,

37
00:02:33,664 --> 00:02:40,286
so they would stimulate axons,
say, at 100 Hz for one second.

38
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:45,382
That's a very typical protocol
for inducing Long Term Potentiation.

39
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:49,265
So they did that for one second, 
maybe a few times.

40
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:54,362
You might want to repeat that 100Hz
tetanic stimulation a few times,

41
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:58,752
and then when they returned to stimulating
as they'd been doing here

42
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:04,084
during the baseline period,
they found that the response amplitude

43
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:09,892
had dramatically increased, and that's
the phenomenon of Long Term Potentiation.

44
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:16,354
That increase in the PSP amplitude
can be very long-lasting.

45
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,172
It can last, basically,
for as long as you're able to record.

46
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:25,929
In this case, we've plotted out
two hours of recordings,

47
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:29,653
but if you are able to record
for much longer periods of time,

48
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:33,508
these changes in synaptic efficacy

49
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:38,413
can last for many days
when recorded in vivo.

50
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:42,360
So, this is a remarkable situation,

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,255
where a brief change in the activity
of the neural circuits

52
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:51,766
can induce long-lasting and large changes

53
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:55,081
in the efficacy of synaptic transmission.

54
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,065
How does that occur?

55
00:03:57,065 --> 00:04:00,817
Experimentally, you can induce
Long Term Potentiation

56
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,849
by a variety of ways.

57
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,116
One of the most common ones,
the one I just pointed out,

58
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:11,458
is this high-frequency
stimulation of many axons.

59
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:15,081
You might put, for example,
field stimulation electrodes

60
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:19,104
where you might stimulate
hundreds of axons at the same time.

61
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:25,520
You stimulate these at high frequencies,
and during that stimulation period

62
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,797
where you stimulate every 10 milliseconds,

63
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:33,109
what's happening post-synaptically
is that you get EPSP's coming in.

64
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:37,424
They summate, and often
you get action potential firing

65
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:39,490
coming in on top of this.

66
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,030
So there's post-synaptic depolarization

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,104
and often, action potential firing
of the post-synaptic neurons.

68
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:51,624
That's one of the most popular ways
in which Long Term Potentiation

69
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,582
can be induced.

70
00:04:53,582 --> 00:04:57,587
There are also other ways in which
you can induce Long Term Potentiation

71
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:01,488
where you don't change the way
that you stimulate the pre-synaptic cells,

72
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:05,673
and you just purely make
post-synaptic changes.

73
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:10,511
One way in which you can do that
is in your whole-cell recording electrode.

74
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:15,217
If you're recording with a glass electrode
the membrane potential of a cell,

75
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:18,042
you can simply inject current

76
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:23,081
and you can then, of course, depolarize
the cell's membrane potential,

77
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,425
so during a baseline period,

78
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:31,046
the membrane potential of the cell
might be sitting at, say, -70mV

79
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:38,263
You get EPSP's driven here that are
largely driven by the AMPA receptors.

80
00:05:38,263 --> 00:05:41,653
You can then depolarize
the post-synaptic neuron.

81
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:44,335
That then unblocks the NMDA receptor.

82
00:05:44,335 --> 00:05:49,916
You'll remember that there's a voltage
dependent Mg block of the NMDA receptor.

83
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,026
If you now have depolarized the cell

84
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:55,046
and you gave the same stimulation
to the pre-synaptic cell,

85
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:59,008
you can now induce
long-lasting NMDA currents.

86
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:04,450
So, depolarizing the post-synaptic cell
is another way

87
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,669
in which you can induce
Long Term Potentiation.

88
00:06:08,252 --> 00:06:14,236
And finally, you can also, again,
it's a similar type of thing,

89
00:06:14,236 --> 00:06:16,220
you are also injecting currents,

90
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,852
but here it's not
a long-lasting depolarization,

91
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:20,851
but you can simply inject brief currents

92
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:24,057
to find action potentials
in the post-synaptic neuron.

93
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:29,148
If we are recording an EPSP,

94
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:33,567
then we can make brief current injections
in the post-synaptic cell

95
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,424
to depolarize and find
action potentials here

96
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:41,406
during the actual EPSP that's occurring
in the post-synaptic cell.

97
00:06:41,803 --> 00:06:46,491
So there are two ways here
in which we can depolarize a cell.

98
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,666
One is simply
just taking the membrane

99
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,841
potential to depolarized potentials,

100
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:53,017
and you may not need
any action potential firing.

101
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:55,840
Another way is to get brief current pulses,

102
00:06:55,902 --> 00:06:58,347
firing action potentials at the same time

103
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:01,310
that an EPSP is arriving
in the post-synaptic neuron.

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,801
What all these different methodologies

105
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,799
for inducing Long Term
Potentiation have in common

106
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:12,963
is that they induce activation
of the NMDA receptor.

107
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:18,542
That's the key event for most forms
of post-synaptic Long Term Potentiation.

108
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:23,649
We need to depolarize the cell,
get the Mg out of the NMDA receptor,

109
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,859
and what that then allows
is for calcium influx to occur.

110
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,220
You remember that AMPA receptors
are not permeable to Ca,

111
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,311
but the NMDA receptor, in addition
to its interesting voltage-dependence,

112
00:07:35,311 --> 00:07:39,613
also has Ca permeability
so when we depolarize the cell

113
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,876
either through high-frequency stimulation,

114
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:44,564
injecting depolarizing current,

115
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,721
or firing action potentials
in the post-synaptic cell

116
00:07:47,721 --> 00:07:49,804
that unblocks the NMDA receptor.

117
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,434
Glutamate is still bound
to the NMDA receptor,

118
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:57,845
and now, cytosolic Ca can increase
in that post-synaptic area.

119
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:03,136
That, in turn, causes
activation of protein kinases.

120
00:08:03,136 --> 00:08:07,357
Many signaling molecules inside cells

121
00:08:07,357 --> 00:08:11,203
are sensitive to the cytosolic
Ca ion concentration

122
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:16,609
and at the post-synaptic density,
there's a particularly high density

123
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:19,923
of a Ca dependent protein kinase

124
00:08:19,923 --> 00:08:23,606
called Calcium/calmodulin-dependent

125
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,476
protein kinase II or CaMKII,

126
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:30,421
and activation of that molecule
downstream of Ca increases

127
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:33,102
is thought to be the most important signal

128
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:37,479
that then, ultimately, leads
to an increase in synaptic efficacy.

129
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,936
This is how we envisage
the situation at the synapse.

130
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:49,067
In the baseline situation action potentials
will propagate down the axon,

131
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:52,558
cause the release
of neurotransmitter, glutamate

132
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:55,089
from the pre-synaptic specialization,

133
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:58,483
and that will largely
activate AMPA receptors.

134
00:08:58,483 --> 00:09:01,930
We imagine here that under
these baseline conditions,

135
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,879
the membrane potential
of the cell during rest

136
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,488
is maybe around -70 mV.

137
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:10,019
The NMDA receptor is blocked.

138
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,710
There's Mg that's sitting here
at negative potentials,

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,263
and the released glutamate
activates AMPA receptors,

140
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:21,488
and that then gives rise
to an excitatory post-synaptic potential.

141
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:26,377
During the LTP induction protocol,

142
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:29,614
we're depolarizing
this post-synaptic neuron.

143
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:32,930
Either because we're making
high-frequency stimulation

144
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,612
of many different axons, and so,
the whole post-synaptic neuron

145
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:40,860
is seeing a lot of glutamate
across its entire dendritic arborisation,

146
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,848
and thus depolarized,
or because experimentally

147
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:47,630
we've depolarized the membrane potential

148
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,430
to, say, zero mV, which is
a typical manipulation to do.

149
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,133
That then gets the Mg
out of the NMDA receptor

150
00:09:56,133 --> 00:09:59,214
so the Mg is now gone.

151
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:01,644
The NMDA receptor can then contribute

152
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:04,938
when glutamate is bound
to the NMDA receptor.

153
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,533
We're at these depolarized potentials

154
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,998
and now Ca can flow in
though the NMDA receptor

155
00:10:10,998 --> 00:10:13,764
and as mentioned, there's a high density

156
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:17,145
of Calcium/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II

157
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:19,816
in this post-synaptic density region,

158
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:26,763
and this kinase adds phosphate groups
to a variety of different targets.

159
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:30,706
One target is the AMPA receptor itself,

160
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:34,264
so it can add a phosphate group
onto the AMPA receptor

161
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:38,414
and that seems to change
the conductance of the AMPA receptor

162
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:41,600
and make it larger,
and that in itself might contribute

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,390
to enhancing the amplitude
of the post-synaptic potentials.

164
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,346
However, what turns out to be
the more important contribution

165
00:10:50,346 --> 00:10:53,483
to post-synaptic longterm plasticity

166
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:59,625
is the recruitment of additional AMPA
receptors onto the post-synaptic area.

167
00:11:00,543 --> 00:11:06,631
So AMPA receptors are actually
floating around on the plasma membrane

168
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:12,327
at many locations across
the dendritic arborisation,

169
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:13,713
and they're mobile.

170
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:18,120
They diffuse in the two-dimensional plane
of the plasma membrane.

171
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,167
One of the things that seems to happen
during Long Term Potentiation

172
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,150
is the ability
of the post-synaptic density

173
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,823
to bind AMPA receptors and hold them

174
00:11:28,823 --> 00:11:32,819
tightly locked in place here
at the post-synaptic density.

175
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,933
So, one of the major features
that CaMKII is thought to do

176
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:42,259
is to make more slots, as it were,
binding partners here

177
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:46,847
where AMPA receptors can bind tightly
at this post-synaptic area here

178
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:50,564
and you then simply recruit
more AMPA receptors

179
00:11:50,564 --> 00:11:54,826
into the post-synaptic area,
so whereas before we might have had

180
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,692
ten AMPA receptors sitting
in the post-synaptic density,

181
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:02,115
after Long Term Potentiation,
we might now have 20 AMPA receptors

182
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:05,447
that have been driven in
and bound here to the synapse

183
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:08,803
through the activation
of these cycling cascades

184
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:12,456
downstream of phosphorylation via CaMKII.

185
00:12:12,456 --> 00:12:15,361
The net result is that we have
more AMPA receptors

186
00:12:15,361 --> 00:12:22,142
when we now return to the situation
where we simply measure the potential,

187
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,668
so we've done the LTP induction protocol,

188
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:27,451
we depolarized here
but only temporarily,

189
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,912
while we were inducing
synaptic plasticity.

190
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:34,711
We then return to the same conditions
as we had in our baseline recording period

191
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:38,017
but now the post-synaptic
potentials are much larger

192
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:41,169
because we simply have
more AMPA conductance

193
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:43,668
that is present post-synaptically.

194
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:49,523
Now, if Long Term Potentiation were
the only thing that went on in the brain,

195
00:12:49,523 --> 00:12:53,104
synapses would always
get larger and larger,

196
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:58,577
and that clearly isn't feasible, for all
the synapses in the brain simply to grow.

197
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:03,213
So it turns out that, luckily,
there's a converse process

198
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:08,244
called Long Term Depression
that also takes place in the brain.

199
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:15,241
Through the process of Long Term Depression
the baseline synaptic efficacy,

200
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:20,084
the post-synaptic potential amplitude
can be made to grow smaller

201
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:24,872
through a so-called
Long Term Depression induction protocol.

202
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:29,100
We start off with EPSP's
that are relatively large in amplitude.

203
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,632
We do the Long Term Depression
induction protocol,

204
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:37,581
and now, in a stable way
across many hours or days,

205
00:13:37,581 --> 00:13:43,283
we can decrease the amplitude of these
excitatory postsynaptic potentials.

206
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,309
In order to induce Long Term Depression,

207
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:55,002
typically, many axons are stimulated
at an intermediate frequency of, say, 1 Hz

208
00:13:55,736 --> 00:14:07,962
so the baseline EPSP's might be stimulated
with an interval of ten seconds,

209
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,298
so we record baseline EPSP's.

210
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:16,267
Then there's a period of stimulating
at 1 Hz for many minutes,

211
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:22,768
maybe for five or ten minutes,
there's a constant 1 Hz stimulation

212
00:14:22,768 --> 00:14:28,486
of the same axons, and then we return
to stimulating every ten seconds,

213
00:14:28,486 --> 00:14:31,745
and then it turns out
that the EPSP amplitude

214
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:36,674
has decreased in many
different synapses across the brain.

215
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:41,586
So, that's one way in which
we can induce Long Term Depression,

216
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:46,767
is through 1 Hz stimulation
of many axons simultaneously.

217
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:52,050
Another way of doing it is without
changing the inter-stimulus interval

218
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,090
of the pre-synaptic axons,

219
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,966
but again just making
post-synaptic manipulations

220
00:14:56,966 --> 00:15:00,838
where one can inject a weak
depolarizing current

221
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:03,126
through the whole-cell recording pipette.

222
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:07,943
So before, for Long Term Potentiation,
we might have been depolarizing the cell

223
00:15:07,943 --> 00:15:12,879
to 0 mV, and then strongly
unblocking the NMDA receptor.

224
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,584
In the induction of Long Term Depression,

225
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:21,551
you might depolarize
the cell, say, to -50 mV.

226
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:25,770
A sort of an intermediate situation
where one might expect some degree

227
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,433
of unblock of the NMDA receptors,

228
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:32,154
but nowhere near as big an unblock
of the NMDA receptor

229
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:34,145
as you'd get at 0 mV.

230
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,469
So the NMDA receptors
are presumably partially activated,

231
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,125
and indeed, many forms
of Long Term Depression

232
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,050
require an NMDA receptor activation,

233
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:50,318
but it's at a smaller scale
than for inducing Long Term Potentiation.

234
00:15:50,506 --> 00:15:53,694
Downstream of NMDA receptor activation,

235
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,693
it's a little bit unclear what happens.

236
00:15:56,693 --> 00:16:03,617
Ca rises, or at least cytosolic Ca
is required post-synaptically,

237
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,968
but it's also possible
that the NMDA receptor

238
00:16:05,968 --> 00:16:09,683
has additional signaling capabilities

239
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:14,355
and it may be that protein-protein
interactions between NMDA receptors

240
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:18,561
and other signalling proteins
in the post-synaptic density

241
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:25,173
are actually the ones that affect
the expression of Long Term Depression.

242
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:29,542
It's also known that the activation
of protein phosphatases

243
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,135
is essential for Long Term Depression,

244
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:35,677
and in particular,
the protein phosphatase calcineurin

245
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,466
is essential for Long Term Depression.

246
00:16:38,466 --> 00:16:41,597
Phosphatases do the opposite of kinases,

247
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:46,146
so a kinase adds
a phosphate group to a protein,

248
00:16:46,146 --> 00:16:48,563
a phophatase does exactly the opposite:

249
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,402
it'll take that phosphate
away from the protein.

250
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,631
So in some respects, this process

251
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,926
looks like the opposite
of Long Term Potentiation,

252
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:59,847
but in fact, there are interesting
and important differences

253
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:02,616
between LTP and LTD.

254
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:06,637
They're not directly
reversals of each other.

255
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:13,246
In terms of what happens after the NMDA
receptors have been partially activated

256
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:17,205
and the protein phosphatases
have been activated,

257
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:20,265
presumably, there's
a dephosphorilation event that occurs,

258
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,824
and in particular
it seems that, in part at least,

259
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,913
directly dephosphorylating AMPA receptors

260
00:17:25,913 --> 00:17:30,439
appears to be a key aspect
to Long Term Depression.

261
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:36,380
After that, the AMPA receptors are simply
removed from the synapse at least in part.

262
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,347
And so, you start off with a situation
where we might have many

263
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:42,531
AMPA receptors post-synaptically,

264
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:45,458
and after the Long Term
Depression protocol,

265
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:50,357
depression, we end up
with fewer receptors post-synaptically,

266
00:17:50,357 --> 00:17:53,044
and so, we have less conductance,

267
00:17:53,044 --> 00:17:56,469
and therefore, we get
smaller post-synaptic potentials.

268
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,951
So that's the basis
of Long Term Depression.

269
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:04,595
There's another form
of synaptic plasticity

270
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:10,521
that probably relates closely to NMDA
receptor-dependent Long Term Potentiation

271
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:14,998
and NMDA receptor dependent Long Term
Depression that we've been talking about,

272
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:20,213
but this is a mechanism that has
at least a more physiological bent to it

273
00:18:20,213 --> 00:18:23,530
in the sense that it relies
upon action potential firing

274
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,530
and the precise timing
of those action potentials,

275
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,252
so now we're not talking
about long-lasting depolarizations

276
00:18:30,252 --> 00:18:34,911
or high frequency stimulation manipulations
that experimentally, of course,

277
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:36,963
can be carried out in a dish,

278
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:40,327
but we have no idea whether
they actually take place normally

279
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,756
under physiological conditions
inside the brain.

280
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:49,319
Spike timing-dependent plasticity relies
on the precise temporal relationship

281
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:52,349
of an action potential
in a pre-synaptic neuron

282
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:55,972
and an action potential
in a post-synaptic neuron,

283
00:18:55,972 --> 00:18:57,904
and of course, in the brain, we know

284
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,917
that both pre-synaptic
and post-synaptic cells

285
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:02,511
fire action potentials,

286
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:06,661
and there was an interesting discovery
by Henry Markram and Bert Sakmann

287
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,164
that the precise timing
of action potentials

288
00:19:10,164 --> 00:19:12,566
in the pre-synaptic
and post-synaptic neurons

289
00:19:12,724 --> 00:19:17,315
can make a major impact
upon the synaptic efficacy.

290
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:21,593
In particular, what they found
was that if we imagine

291
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,763
a synaptically connected pair of neurons

292
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:28,167
where we have an action potential
in a pre-synaptic neuron,

293
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,790
that then releases glutamate
onto the post-synaptic cell,

294
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:35,703
causing, of course, a unitary
excitatory post-synaptic potential.

295
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:41,165
They then began to inject currents
into the post-synaptic cell

296
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:44,630
at the same time that there was
also a synaptic input,

297
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,164
so we have the pre-synaptic
action potential that releases glutamate

298
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:50,885
onto the post-synaptic cell as before

299
00:19:50,885 --> 00:19:52,645
causing the post-synaptic potential,

300
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:57,057
but now, in addition to that EPSP
there is also a current

301
00:19:57,057 --> 00:19:59,603
that's being injected
into the post-synaptic cell,

302
00:19:59,603 --> 00:20:02,112
and that then makes it fire
an action potential

303
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:05,620
riding on top
of the post-synaptic potential.

304
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:11,543
When one then goes back and looks
at what happens at the EPSP

305
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,197
when we just stimulate
the pre-synaptic cell,

306
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:16,714
now the EPSP has grown.

307
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:21,455
It's important to note that typically
this process, this pairing process

308
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,754
of pre-synaptic followed
by post-synaptic action potential,

309
00:20:24,754 --> 00:20:28,213
is typically repeated many times,
maybe a hundred times,

310
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:34,203
in order to generate a robust increase
in the efficacy of the connection

311
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:37,705
between the pre-synaptic
and the post-synaptic neuron.

312
00:20:37,913 --> 00:20:43,724
And so, we go from
a small baseline EPSP to a large EPSP

313
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:48,623
after the Spike Timing Dependent
Plasticity protocol has been run,

314
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:53,531
and in particular it's with a delay
in the post-synaptic spike

315
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:55,654
relative to the pre-synaptic spike.

316
00:20:56,594 --> 00:21:01,400
At these so-called
positive delta-T intervals,

317
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,782
that causes an increase
in the efficacy of the EPSP.

318
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:09,833
Remarkably, if you move
the timing of the action potential

319
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:15,418
to be just ten ms before
the pre-synaptic action potential,

320
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:19,883
then the plasticity reverses sign.

321
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:24,242
So here again we're looking
at a unitary synaptic connection,

322
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,470
action potential in the pre-synaptic cell,

323
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,486
post-synaptic potential
in the post-synaptic cell.

324
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:34,941
An action potential can then be evoked
in the post-synaptic neuron

325
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:37,721
by injecting current
into the post-synaptic cell

326
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:41,051
firing an action potential,
and you can do that at a time

327
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:44,412
that precedes the action potential
in the pre-synaptic cell,

328
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:48,817
so the pre-synaptic cell evokes
an EPSP just like it did before,

329
00:21:48,817 --> 00:21:53,497
but now that EPSP is preceded
by an action potential here

330
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:57,880
during the spike timing-dependent
plasticity induction period

331
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:03,022
where again you might pair a hundred times
the action potential and the EPSP,

332
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,518
but now the timing
is very different to before.

333
00:22:05,518 --> 00:22:09,022
Here, the action potential
was riding on top of the EPSP.

334
00:22:09,022 --> 00:22:13,695
Now the action potential precedes
the glutamatergic input onto the cell.

335
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:19,937
And what is found is that the EPSP
now decreases in amplitude

336
00:22:19,937 --> 00:22:24,237
and so we now have a decrease
in the efficacy of the EPSP

337
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:28,635
when we've reversed the timing
of the pre- and the post-synaptic cells,

338
00:22:28,635 --> 00:22:32,813
so this is at so-called
negative delta-T intervals

339
00:22:32,813 --> 00:22:37,864
where the post-synaptic cell fires
before the pre-synaptic cell.

340
00:22:37,864 --> 00:22:43,598
By measuring what types of plasticity
happen when you vary this time interval

341
00:22:43,598 --> 00:22:46,386
between pre-synaptic
and post-synaptic spikes,

342
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:51,464
you can build up a timing
of the plasticity of the change

343
00:22:51,607 --> 00:22:55,973
in EPSP amplitude, so that's
what's plotted here on the Y axis

344
00:22:55,973 --> 00:23:02,090
where positive values here indicate
increased enhanced EPSP size

345
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,100
and the negative values
are decreased amplitudes in the EPSP.

346
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:11,507
Here on the X axis we're looking
at the difference in the timing

347
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:14,758
between the post-synaptic spike
and the pre-synaptic spike

348
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:19,020
at positive times, that's when
the post-synaptic cell fires

349
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,224
after the pre-synaptic cell,
and that then gives rise

350
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:24,791
to enhanced synaptic plasticity.

351
00:23:24,952 --> 00:23:27,517
When we have the timing
the other way around,

352
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:29,653
the post-synaptic cell fires first.

353
00:23:29,653 --> 00:23:32,945
That gives rise to decreases in the EPSP.

354
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:38,214
In this temporal relationship
to synaptic plasticity,

355
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:42,773
the so-called spike timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP)

356
00:23:42,773 --> 00:23:46,913
has been now found at a large variety
of synapses in the brain,

357
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:50,853
so it appears to be an interesting,
and perhaps general, rule.

358
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:55,149
What's remarkable is really
the short timescale here

359
00:23:55,149 --> 00:24:04,299
where we're thinking about ten, twenty ms
and maybe 50 to 100 ms on this side here

360
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,756
where on this millisecond time scale,

361
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:13,167
the order of the action potential firing
makes a very big difference

362
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:16,170
to the types of plasticity
that are involved.

363
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,007
To some extent, this makes sense,

364
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:23,567
so this EPSP didn't just
come at a random time.

365
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:28,698
It came at a time when the neuron
actually fired action potentials.

366
00:24:29,393 --> 00:24:33,203
So one might then think
that this input to the cell was useful

367
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:36,587
and something that should be kept
and maybe even strengthened,

368
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:40,356
and that's what happens here
in spike timing-dependent plasticity.

369
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:44,603
Apparently useful inputs that contribute
to firing the post-synaptic cell

370
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:46,015
get strengthened.

371
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:52,428
In this scenario, the action potential
occurred before the glutamate was released

372
00:24:52,428 --> 00:24:54,465
from the pre-synaptic neuron.

373
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:57,082
Clearly, the firing
of the post-synaptic cell

374
00:24:57,082 --> 00:25:00,468
has nothing to do
with what the pre-synaptic cell was doing.

375
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:03,558
This input from the pre-synaptic cell

376
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:07,493
might not be a particularly useful 
input for that cell.

377
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:11,142
It certainly doesn't contribute
to this artificially fired spike

378
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,637
that's done under these
experimental conditions.

379
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:17,131
So, the cell may think that this synapse

380
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:21,140
is not a particularly helpful one
for the function of the neuron,

381
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:27,092
so it may be the reason for why
the depression of that EPSP occurs

382
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:29,167
when the action potentials occur

383
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:32,369
in an uncorrelated way 
with the pre-synaptic neuron.

384
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:37,955
Changes in the post-synaptic
receptor composition,

385
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:40,662
the number of AMPA receptors in particular

386
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:43,416
that are present
at the post-synaptic density

387
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,200
are an important way in which
the synapse strength can be regulated

388
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,406
between two different neurons.

389
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:55,883
It's the activity of these neurons,
and in particular the depolarization

390
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:57,765
of the post-synaptic cell

391
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,416
concomitant with the release of glutamate
from the pre-synaptic cell

392
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:04,613
that is typically
involved in setting the plasticity

393
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:11,995
and the direction of the plasticity
that occurs in these different paradigms.

394
00:26:12,922 --> 00:26:20,488
Strong depolarization or action potentials
riding directly on top of EPSP's coming in

395
00:26:20,488 --> 00:26:23,407
strengthen that synaptic connection,

396
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,731
and the strengthening
appears to occur, at least in part,

397
00:26:26,731 --> 00:26:29,845
through the insertion
and recruitment of AMPA receptors

398
00:26:29,845 --> 00:26:31,961
that are diffusing
on the plasma membrane

399
00:26:31,961 --> 00:26:36,308
but then bind onto
post-synaptic density proteins

400
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:38,985
and get locked onto
the post-synaptic density

401
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:42,408
where they can contribute
to driving post-synaptic potentials.

402
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:46,196
On the other hand, weak depolarization

403
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:49,552
or action potentials occurring
at times that are different

404
00:26:49,552 --> 00:26:51,922
than when the synaptic inputs arrive

405
00:26:51,922 --> 00:26:54,909
tend to cause a depression
of the synaptic inputs,

406
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:59,237
so there's a strengthening
of what appear to be useful inputs,

407
00:26:59,237 --> 00:27:03,502
and there's a weakening of inputs
that appear to not contribute

408
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:05,646
to the post-synaptic firing.
