1
00:00:05,477 --> 00:00:10,824
In the last lesson we saw how postsynaptic
conductances evoked by glutamate release

2
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:15,591
from presynaptic terminals were converted
into postsynaptic potentials and

3
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:20,005
integrated in complex ways across
the dendritic arborization.

4
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:27,960
We found that most unitary excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs)

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,679
that originate from a single action
potential in a single presynaptic neuron

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,143
that most unitary EPSPs
are small in amplitude.

7
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:44,260
They have an amplitude typically of 1 mV
and they last 10-20 msec in duration.

8
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:53,176
An excitatory neuron is typically at rest
at around -70 mV, so something like

9
00:00:53,176 --> 00:00:56,549
30 mV away from action potential threshold.

10
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:01,771
In order for a postsynaptic neuron
to contribute to further computation

11
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,307
in the brain, it must receive those
excitatory synaptic signals,

12
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:09,922
depolarize beyond threshold and
fire action potentials of its own

13
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:11,846
at the appropriate time.

14
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:17,309
This means that many synaptic inputs must
be integrated in that individual neuron.

15
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:21,845
In order to understand how that neuron
integrates sensory information,

16
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:25,270
we need to know where its
presynaptic neurons are.

17
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:31,026
We need to map the wiring diagram and
the connectivity of how synaptic input

18
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,761
arrives onto postsynaptic neurons.

19
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:39,803
In this lesson we'll begin to think a bit
about how synaptic wiring diagrams

20
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:43,937
can be constructed at least in a
probabilistic way and how that might

21
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:47,073
relate to sensory processing
in the mammalian brain.

22
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:52,982
We'll begin by considering sensory
processing in the mammalian brain

23
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:57,004
and its dependence upon
glutametergic synaptic signals.

24
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:05,011
We'll think about vision and touch:
two important senses for us humans.

25
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:11,183
If we think about the sense of touch,
there are mechano-gated ion channels

26
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:16,665
sitting in our skin inside
axons of sensory neurons.

27
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:23,478
Touch on the skin causes action potential
firing in the sensory neuron and these

28
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:27,522
sensory neurons release glutamate
from their synaptic terminals

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,645
somewhere here in the brain stem.

30
00:02:31,045 --> 00:02:35,634
The brain stem neurons in turn receive
those excitatory glutametergic signals

31
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:40,444
and send them on to the thalamus,
the somatosensory part of the thalamus

32
00:02:40,664 --> 00:02:44,135
deals with the sense of touch.
Neurons there receive the

33
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:50,255
glutametergic signals from the brain stem
neurons and in turn they generate PSPs,

34
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:55,571
action potentials and send the
sensory signals up the neocortex

35
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:00,464
where it's thought that our conscious
precept of touch is driven by the

36
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,336
activity of the neurons in the neocortex.

37
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:07,988
Again, most of that activity is 
driven by glutamatergic synapses.

38
00:03:08,509 --> 00:03:12,949
And so we have here a pathway
of brain stem synapse and thalamic synapse

39
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:16,723
and neocortical synapses,
all of which are primarily

40
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:20,180
glutamatergic in nature
and essential in order to convey

41
00:03:20,293 --> 00:03:24,718
a sensory signal from the periphery
to the neocortex, where it might generate

42
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,247
sensory percepts.

43
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,564
Similarly, if we think about our sense
of vision, this also depends heavily

44
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:34,111
upon glutamatergic synapses.

45
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:39,685
Within the eye, the photoreceptors
that detect photons arriving

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,555
from the visual field,
they release glutamate

47
00:03:44,862 --> 00:03:47,723
on to second order
so called bipolar cells

48
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,067
in the retina.

49
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:55,492
These bipolar cells sense the glutamate
and in turn release glutamate at their own

50
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:58,391
synaptic terminals,
on to retinal ganglion cells.

51
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,046
It's the retinal ganglion cells
that then receives its glutamatergic

52
00:04:02,277 --> 00:04:06,182
inputs, fires action potentials
and transfers the visual information

53
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:10,175
first to the thalamus where again
a glutamatergic synapse

54
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:13,845
conveys that information
further to the visual cortex.

55
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:17,910
Again, glutamate is the signalling
molecule there.

56
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,482
And so glutamatergic synaptic transmission
is a fundamental importance

57
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,744
of getting sensory information
from the periphery to the neocortex

58
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,730
where it drives sensory perception.

59
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:33,293
And that's true for all of our senses.

60
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:38,073
In this video I'd like to focus
particularly on one sensory pathway

61
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:42,617
that has some specific features
that are useful for detailed analysis

62
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:46,004
in terms of microcircuits
and synaptic connectivity.

63
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:49,688
We'll think about
the <i>Mouse Whisker System</i>

64
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:53,692
and the mouse is an attractive animal
in terms of neurophysiology

65
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:57,625
because of its extensive genetics
and its extensive use

66
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,143
in biological research.

67
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,172
Mice are nocturnal animals,
they live underground in tunnels

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,188
and so vision is not
one of their most developed senses.

69
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:12,758
Instead, one of the ways
in which they gather

70
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:16,376
a lot of sensory information
about their immediate surroundings

71
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:20,327
comes from their array
of whiskers that are present

72
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,310
on the snout of the animal.

73
00:05:22,619 --> 00:05:26,824
These are arranged
in a highly organized manner

74
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:32,340
and using their whisker system,
the animals are able to navigate

75
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,810
in tunnels, they can see whether a hole
is a sufficiently large aperture

76
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,692
for them to enter in,
they can detect the shape

77
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:42,934
of objects and their sense
of texture discrimination

78
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,889
with their whiskers rivals
that of the human finger tip.

79
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,335
So this whisker system
is an immensely sensitive organ

80
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:54,219
through which the mouse can learn
a lot about its immediate

81
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,501
spatial environment.

82
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:01,955
Deflection of one of these whiskers
activates mechanogated ion channels

83
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:07,013
sitting here in the whisker follicle
and that drives action potential

84
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,777
firing here down the trigeminal nerve.

85
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:16,154
There's a first glutamatergic synapse
in the brain stem and neurons

86
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:20,084
in the brainstem receive
that glutamatergic signal

87
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:23,939
postsynaptic potentials are generated,
some of the neurons in the brainstem

88
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,929
fire action potentials
and those signals in turn,

89
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,137
are relayed to the thalamus.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,377
Again, thalamic neurons here
receive the glutamatergic input

91
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:37,615
post synaptic potentials
are generated and integrated

92
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:41,125
in the thalamic neurons,
action potentials are fired

93
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:45,942
in subsets of those thalamic neurons
and information is then further relayed

94
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:50,293
to the primary somatosensory cortex
where presumably,

95
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:53,062
whisker sensory perception
takes place for the mouse.

96
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:58,067
So there are three glutamatergic
synapses that relay

97
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,531
sensory whisker information
from the periphery

98
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:06,429
through to the neocortex
of the mouse, and in particular

99
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:10,630
it's the primary somatosensory
neocortex of the mouse

100
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,718
that deals with whisker sensation.

101
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:19,562
The organization of the primary 
somatosensory neocortex of the mouse

102
00:07:19,838 --> 00:07:25,403
is remarkable in the sense
that it has obvious anatomical units

103
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,363
that appear to be in a direct
one to one correspondence

104
00:07:29,641 --> 00:07:31,852
with the layout of the whiskers
on the periphery.

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,588
So the whiskers here, the hairs
that eminate from individual

106
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:41,402
whisker follicles are laid out
in a highly stereotypical patent

107
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:46,600
where every mouse has a same organization
of the whisker lay out

108
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,227
and indeed mice and rats
have also the identical layout.

109
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:55,608
So because it's highly stereotypical
we can then label these whiskers

110
00:07:55,608 --> 00:08:01,143
in specific ways and so this is called
the <i>A</i> row, the <i>B</i> row, the <i>C</i> row,

111
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:04,666
<i>D</i> row, <i>E</i> row and equally
there are considered to be

112
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:09,646
arcs <i>1,2,3</i> and <i>4</i> in terms
of the whiskers and so this one here

113
00:08:09,646 --> 00:08:13,881
that's highlighted in yellow
is a so called <i>C2</i> whisker.

114
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,799
If we now look at the neocortex
across the horizontal extent

115
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,180
of the neocortex when looking down
on the face of the neocortex

116
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:28,989
across a so called somatotopic map,
we'll see that there are corresponding

117
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:33,743
units here drawn in blue
that correspond to the whiskers.

118
00:08:33,743 --> 00:08:38,952
Again, highlighted here in yellow
is one particular anatomical unit.

119
00:08:38,999 --> 00:08:45,018
The so called <i>C2</i> whisker representation
and these round things here

120
00:08:45,018 --> 00:08:46,731
are called barrels.

121
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,995
So this is called the <i>C2 barrel</i>.

122
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:56,123
Present in primary somatosensory cortex
and because of its obvious analog

123
00:08:56,123 --> 00:09:00,377
in terms of the whiskers on the periphery
one might think that sensory information

124
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:06,936
relating to the <i>C2</i> whisker is primarily
processed in the <i>C2</i> barrel column

125
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,344
in the primary somatosensory cortex,
and indeed, at the various stations

126
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,939
in the brain stem and the thalamus
there's a nice representation

127
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:22,235
also of the individual whiskers
in terms of anatomically identifiable units.

128
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:31,811
Now if we look at a section of the brain
where we cut through

129
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:35,976
the thickness of the brain
and so before we were looking

130
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:38,336
at the top of the brain
and we saw that there was

131
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:41,829
a nice C2 representation
of the whisker.

132
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:47,197
Now we look inside the brain
and we see that it has some depth.

133
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:52,282
It's about 1mm thick,
the neocortex in this particular location

134
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,316
in the mouse.

135
00:09:53,408 --> 00:09:58,498
In here maybe you can make out
the walls of the C2 whisker representation

136
00:09:58,877 --> 00:10:02,415
that's here, high cell density
represented here

137
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,088
by this fluorescent stain of DAPI
that stains the cell nuclei

138
00:10:06,441 --> 00:10:10,574
and you can also see it here
in this stain of neurons

139
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:13,834
present in this area, you'll see
that there are these walls here

140
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:18,618
that represent these limits here
of the C2 whisker representation

141
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,853
and now this would be the surface
of the brain up here,

142
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:26,583
and here we go deeper into the brain
and this is the thickness of the neocortex.

143
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,343
Its about 1.2mm thick.

144
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:35,015
Now there are some obvious differences
at different depths in the neocortex

145
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,339
and people have divided the neocortex
into different layers,

146
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,413
and so there's a layer one,
the most superficial,

147
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,532
the outside area of the brain
that has very few cells in it.

148
00:10:44,692 --> 00:10:49,740
It's mainly composed of synapses,
axons, dendrites and synapses.

149
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:55,623
The cells themselves begin here
in layers 2 down to layer 6,

150
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:59,654
and you'll see that there are different
densities of cells in different layers.

151
00:10:59,755 --> 00:11:03,667
And here we've labeled
some individual neurons

152
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:06,379
that are present of these
different layers and you can see

153
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:09,322
that there are some different
morphologies of the cells.

154
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:13,049
And so there are very small cells
that are present here

155
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:17,832
in this so called <i>Layer 4</i> area
that's actually where the main sensory

156
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:21,276
input arrives in the neocortex
and in the superficial layer,

157
00:11:21,523 --> 00:11:25,774
there are so called <i>small pyramidal</i> cells
small excitatory neurons,

158
00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,353
and in the deeper layers,
there are much larger cells

159
00:11:28,467 --> 00:11:31,049
with much more extensive dendrites.

160
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:35,603
And it turns out that the molecular biology,
the electrophysiology

161
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,718
and the synaptic properties of the cells
in different layers are different,

162
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:42,841
and so we can think of these
as different cell types.

163
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:46,493
All of these neurons here
are glutamatergic neurons

164
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:49,725
that have their axonal outputs 
release glutamate.

165
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:54,265
So they are of one cell type
in terms of their neurotransmitter

166
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:58,726
but we can subdivide them
into many different subtypes

167
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,603
of excitatory neurons 
and one of the ways

168
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,966
of subdividing them
is their laminate position

169
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,835
within the neocortex that tells a lot
about the synaptic connectivity.

170
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:11,138
Which is what we're
going to look at further.

171
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,188
Now in order to functionally
map the wiring diagram

172
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:21,415
of the C2 barrel column, 
we first need to identify it

173
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:22,642
in the living brain.

174
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:28,480
It turns out that the anatomical 
barrel map that we've looked at so far

175
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,086
is nice in anatomical sections
but when you look at the living brain,

176
00:12:34,137 --> 00:12:40,651
you simply see the surface blood vessels
without an obvious indication

177
00:12:40,766 --> 00:12:43,114
of where different
whisker representations are.

178
00:12:44,268 --> 00:12:50,186
However we can perform a simple optical
imaging technique where we can shine

179
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,325
a red light on the surface of the brain,
we can then stimulate the C2 whisker

180
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:58,999
that then causes activity
in a localized region of the brain,

181
00:12:59,103 --> 00:13:02,518
the C2 whisker representation,
and that changes in turn,

182
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:05,463
the optical properties
of this area of the brain.

183
00:13:05,601 --> 00:13:09,270
There are changes in blood flow,
downstream of neuronal activity,

184
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,539
and there are also swelling
of different processes

185
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:18,595
that affects how light enters and leaves
this area of the brain.

186
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:22,181
So, simply by shining a red light
on the surface of the brain,

187
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:26,534
stimulating the whisker, we can see
changes in reflection of this red light

188
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:28,776
and it turns out that
when an area of the brain

189
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:34,051
is activated, less light is reflected,
and at the level of hundreds of microns,

190
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,528
we can now map the location
of the C2 whisker, it causes a response

191
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:41,784
in the small area here of the brain.

192
00:13:42,747 --> 00:13:46,822
We can then furthermore
put a bit of red dye at this location

193
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:52,371
inside the brain and at later times
we can cut horizontal sections

194
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:57,010
of the brain and see that the red dye
that we placed inside the brain

195
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:02,261
is located inside the map of the whiskers
and in particular,

196
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:07,682
it corresponds to the C2 barrel column
inside the neocortex.

197
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:11,831
As one would expect,
there's a nice mapping

198
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:17,294
of the functional location 
of where C2 whisker evokes responses

199
00:14:17,294 --> 00:14:21,233
and the anatomical map
that matches them nicely.

200
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:25,653
You can also see that the spatial extent
of this whisker representation

201
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:28,699
is really at this level
of hundreds of microns.

202
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:33,357
The C2 whisker representation
is maybe some 200 by 300

203
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:37,134
micrometers in extent,
and as mentioned, the neocortex

204
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:40,471
is about 1.2 mm thick at this location.

205
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,116
So we can then 
do this type of experiment,

206
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:47,068
inject some red dye,
cut brain slices

207
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,068
through the thickness
of the cortex,

208
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:52,725
and we can then begin to analyze
how neurons that are located

209
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,621
in different layers
communicate with each other.

210
00:14:56,721 --> 00:15:00,315
So here's a picture 
of a living brain slice,

211
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:04,092
we injected red dye to label
the C2 barrel column,

212
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:08,390
you might be able to make out
the so called barrel walls here,

213
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,489
present inside the layer 4
of the neocortex,

214
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:13,983
and in order to analyze
synaptic connectivity,

215
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:19,086
we can then simultaneously record
from a number of different nerve cells.

216
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,648
In this particular experiment, 
we're recording from six neurons

217
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:27,632
that are located here
in layer 5 of the neocortex,

218
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:31,046
so some depth from the surface
of the brain, we go

219
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,359
to the infragranular layers
and here we've got

220
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:37,873
six whole-cell recordings
that are located on six different neurons,

221
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:42,853
so in each case there's a whole-cell
glass electrode that's making contact

222
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:48,370
with this neuron as a membrane potential
recording and so there's a continuity

223
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,181
between the patch electrode
and the cell membrane here,

224
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:54,473
so we can record the membrane potential.

225
00:15:57,087 --> 00:16:02,573
In order to study synaptic connectivity,
we can then initiate an action potential

226
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:03,784
in one of our cells.

227
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:08,848
We can simply inject current into <i>Cell 1</i>
cause it to depolarize,

228
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:13,977
fire an action potential, and then see
what happens in these other neurons,

229
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:17,217
whether any of them respond
with post synaptic potentials.

230
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:21,633
In this particular experiment, <i>Cell 1</i>
released glutamate

231
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,402
and caused post synaptic potentials
in <i>Cell 3</i>.

232
00:16:25,208 --> 00:16:28,119
That's what you see here, 
an action potential in <i>Cell 1</i>,

233
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,376
and a post synaptic potential
in <i>Cell 3</i>.

234
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:35,524
This 80 mV refers to the action potential
trace and the 2 mV

235
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:39,427
refers to the post synaptic potential
so the post synaptic potential,

236
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:45,150
as expected is somewhere in this 1 mV range
lasting some tens of milliseconds,

237
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,877
whereas the action potential is brief, 
it is one millisecond depolarization

238
00:16:49,984 --> 00:16:54,171
of about 50 to 80 mV.

239
00:16:55,858 --> 00:17:01,869
So, <i>Cell 1</i> is synaptically connected
to <i>Cell 3</i>, there's a synaptic connection.

240
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:06,415
But what's not shown here is that,
that same action potential didn't cause

241
00:17:06,783 --> 00:17:10,913
any effect of the membrane potential
in cells 2, 4, 5 or 6

242
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:14,566
so there's a single connection here
from <i>Cell 1</i> to <i>Cell 3</i>

243
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:20,954
and four of the others have no connection
and so <i>Cell 1</i> has a 20% probability

244
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:24,649
of having post synaptic partners,
only one out of five

245
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:27,840
of these possible cells were synaptically
connected to <i>Cell 1</i>.

246
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:31,110
So we can think of that
as a 20% probability

247
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:32,818
of finding a synaptic connection.

248
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,777
We can then of course, go through
the different cells and stimulate <i>Cell 2</i>

249
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,839
and see whether any of these other cells
responded and in fact it turns out

250
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,262
that <i>Cell 2</i> drives a small
postsynaptic potential in <i>Cell 1</i>.

251
00:17:46,713 --> 00:17:50,080
Note though, the scale is rather different
and the time course of the PSP

252
00:17:50,237 --> 00:17:52,122
is also different from <i>Cell 3</i>.

253
00:17:52,122 --> 00:17:55,820
There's some diversity in the properties
of the postsynaptic potentials

254
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,852
as we've already seen.

255
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:04,988
We then go through all the different cells
stimulating cell 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in turn,

256
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:09,534
and seeing who responds
postsynaptically to that action potential.

257
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:13,528
That then allows us to draw
a small wiring diagram

258
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:16,349
for these particular six neurons
that we recorded from,

259
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:20,563
here you see the dendritic structure
of those cells, here we've separated them,

260
00:18:20,563 --> 00:18:23,490
adding different colors so you can see
the structure of the different neurons,

261
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:27,177
they're all excitatory, pyramidal neurons
and they're connected

262
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:33,361
in this particular wiring diagram pattern
where <i>Cell 2</i> connects to 1, one to three

263
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:36,694
three connects to six, but it receives
an input from <i>Cell 5</i>,

264
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,569
four connects to both five and six
and so there's a divergent output here

265
00:18:41,569 --> 00:18:43,710
from <i>Cell 1</i>,
causing postsynaptic potentials

266
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:48,026
in both of these two partner cells
that are postsynaptic to it.

267
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:53,957
So we can then repeat this experiment
over and over again in different layers

268
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:58,885
recording cells in layer 2,
in layer 5, layer 4

269
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:03,172
and simply see what the probability
of finding synaptic connections

270
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:07,116
is across a population of neurons.

271
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,414
We can't record from all the cells
at the same time so it becomes

272
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,156
a statistical argument in the end
where through analyzing

273
00:19:14,229 --> 00:19:18,064
many different brains,
focusing on the one particular area

274
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:22,294
of the brain, a nicely delimited
column of the neocortex,

275
00:19:22,364 --> 00:19:24,801
we can get the statistical
wiring diagram

276
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:29,398
of how neurons in different layers,
different cell types if you like,

277
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:33,238
communicate with each other
at a statistical level and that then,

278
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,844
helps us understand
how sensory information

279
00:19:35,844 --> 00:19:38,256
is processed in this part of the brain.

280
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:44,820
So here's the end result of the analysis
after recording from hundreds of pairs

281
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:51,509
of neurons we find that there's
a connection probability matrix

282
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,576
that we can construct where
we take the location

283
00:19:54,657 --> 00:19:58,251
of the presynaptic neuron
in terms of which layer

284
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:00,710
of the neocortex it's in,
and when we look and see

285
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:04,504
how often that connects
with postsynaptic neurons

286
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:09,132
again, ordered according to which layer
the soma is located in.

287
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:13,302
And if we now start with neurons
that are located

288
00:20:13,308 --> 00:20:18,108
in presynaptic layer 4,
we'll see that they make connections

289
00:20:18,804 --> 00:20:23,228
onto postsynaptic cells
in layer 2,3,4,5A,5B

290
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:25,813
and a little bit in layer 6.

291
00:20:26,337 --> 00:20:31,423
So layer 4 neurons send the axons
and make synaptic connections

292
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:35,541
with neurons in all other layers
of the neocortex.

293
00:20:36,973 --> 00:20:40,290
On the other hand, if we think
postsynaptically about neurons

294
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:43,224
in layer 4, we'll see
that they don't receive

295
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:50,760
any input from layer 2,3,5 or 6
and they almost exclusively

296
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:53,835
receive their input
from other layer 4 neurons

297
00:20:53,988 --> 00:20:57,657
So layer 4 is a very tight
local processing area

298
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,871
where neurons within layer 4
like to talk to each other

299
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,659
and they also like to send signals
to other parts of the neocortical column

300
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:08,762
but they don't want to receive information
from these other layers.

301
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:15,971
We can also see that there's a strong
diagonal component where neurons

302
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:21,936
within layer 2, within layer 3,
within layer 4, 5A and within layer 5B

303
00:21:21,936 --> 00:21:24,014
like to talk to each other.
They like to talk

304
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:27,073
to their neighboring cells
that are sitting right next to each other.

305
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,774
That's one of the ways in which they
make connections,

306
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,804
simply by being close to each other.

307
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,640
Beyond that, there's further specificity.

308
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:41,191
The superficial postsynaptic neurons,
they get information

309
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:45,839
from presynaptic layers 4, 3 and 2.

310
00:21:46,611 --> 00:21:48,924
And so here, you'll see 
that the layer 2 and 3 neurons

311
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:52,163
are receiving information
from these circuits here.

312
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:55,777
Probabilistically, that's where
they're most likely to be getting

313
00:21:55,892 --> 00:21:57,088
their synaptic input from.

314
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:02,113
On the other hand, if we look here
in the deeper layers, in layer 5,

315
00:22:02,268 --> 00:22:07,110
you'll see that they get synaptic inputs
from almost all other layers,

316
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:12,807
they get information from layer 2,3,4,5
and perhaps a little bit from layer 6.

317
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:17,171
So these neurons here are integrators,
they receive information

318
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,405
from all other parts of the cortex
and presumably, they use that information

319
00:22:21,547 --> 00:22:27,149
to distribute some further processed
signals to other parts of the brain.

320
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:31,828
So there is a high degree of specificity
in the directions of which

321
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,281
sensory information gets distributed
to different cells in the neocortex

322
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:40,822
and what remains to be learned
from further experiments

323
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:46,074
is what the purpose of that computation is
within the neocortex.

324
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,842
If we now look at the amplitudes
of the postsynaptic potentials

325
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:56,565
that are found inside the C2 microcircuit,
we find that there's a rather interesting

326
00:22:56,717 --> 00:22:59,889
distribution of unitary EPSPs.

327
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,637
Most of the synaptic connections
are very small in amplitude.

328
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:10,543
They're sitting there somewhere
at around 100 or 200 microvolts.

329
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:17,367
So, an action potential in a presynaptic
neuron on the whole gives a rise

330
00:23:17,408 --> 00:23:21,071
to a relatively small
postsynaptic potential

331
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:25,640
of the postsynaptic neuron.
It's just a few hundred microvolts.

332
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:30,438
Almost nothing compared to the amount
of depolarization that's necessary

333
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,606
in order to get this postsynaptic cell
to fire an action potential,

334
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:40,294
it needs some 30 mV of depolarization,
and that 100 microvolts is going

335
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,336
to make a small impact.

336
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:50,302
However there are also some rare synapses 
within the neocortical microcircuit

337
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:53,688
that are much, much larger
and so we can get synapses

338
00:23:53,833 --> 00:24:00,445
that are at 5 and even 10 mV in amplitude
in response to a single action potential.

339
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:05,407
These synapses then could give rise
to a considerable impact,

340
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:10,127
postsynaptically, and contribute strongly
to driving postsynaptic

341
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,637
action potential firing.

342
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,233
And so we are left
in an interesting situation

343
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,691
where there's a few very strong synapses

344
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:23,463
and there are very many,
very weak synapses

345
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,147
and at this time,
it's still not completely clear

346
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:32,251
which synapses are most important
in terms of driving neocortical

347
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:33,550
microcircuit activity.

348
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:39,560
Computational studies suggest
that one can remove

349
00:24:39,634 --> 00:24:43,396
all of these small synapses
and it makes very little impact

350
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,967
upon the neocortical
microcircuit activity.

351
00:24:46,033 --> 00:24:52,641
It may therefore be that larger amplitude
synapses are the main drivers for reliable

352
00:24:52,764 --> 00:24:58,358
sensory processing in the neocortex,
and it may be that a very sparse set

353
00:24:58,482 --> 00:25:02,612
of connections, which are large
in amplitude, might dominate

354
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:06,829
over a sea of very small connections
that make almost no impact

355
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:09,965
upon the larger neocortical microcircuit.

356
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,242
Large unitary EPSPs
might be a fundamental importance

357
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,617
for reliable signaling in the brain.

358
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:23,907
Further indications that some
of reliable processing

359
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:26,816
might occur through these big
amplitude connections,

360
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,959
comes if you're looking at the variance
of the EPSP amplitudes.

361
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:34,777
in here we compute the coefficient
of variation which is equal

362
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:37,660
to the standard deviation over the mean.

363
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:43,850
In terms of the trial by trial
EPSP amplitudes that we measure

364
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,127
for the same connection
in response to a given action potential,

365
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,429
and you'll remember
that there's some variance.

366
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,731
We've already discussed
that large synapses might have

367
00:25:53,787 --> 00:25:58,791
low variance whereas small synapses
have much more variable responses.

368
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:03,294
That then, is another indication
that if you want to have

369
00:26:03,374 --> 00:26:06,002
reliable sensory processing,
you might want to use

370
00:26:06,157 --> 00:26:09,211
these big connections that not only
have a big impact

371
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:12,167
on the postsynaptic neuron
but they're also reliable

372
00:26:12,282 --> 00:26:15,928
with low variance 
from one trial to the next.

373
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,581
So here in this video we've seen
some important aspects

374
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,947
about glutamate synapses.

375
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:26,948
First of all we've seen
how glutamatergic synapses

376
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,957
are essential for relaying
all sorts of sensory information

377
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:35,995
from the periphery to the neocortex
where it's thought that sensory percepts

378
00:26:36,074 --> 00:26:39,976
are generated, so glutamatergic
signaling is essential

379
00:26:40,097 --> 00:26:41,774
for sensory perception.

380
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:45,838
We've also seen
that within the microcircuits

381
00:26:45,903 --> 00:26:50,325
of the neocortex, there are highly specific
circuits that are made

382
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:54,493
where some types of neurons
like to talk to other types of neurons

383
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,737
but might not want to receive information
from other types of neurons,

384
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:02,432
and so there's a great deal of cell type
specificity in terms of

385
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:07,259
where glutamatergic signals
are made and how the sensory processing

386
00:27:07,315 --> 00:27:09,797
is likely to occur within the neocortex.

387
00:27:10,724 --> 00:27:13,999
In addition we've seen that there are
some extremely large amplitude

388
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:19,486
synapses that are one or two orders
of magnitude larger in amplitude

389
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:23,956
compared to the large sea
of small synapses

390
00:27:24,086 --> 00:27:27,211
that are present in the brain
and these larger amplitude synapses

391
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:31,032
might be particularly relevant
for reliable sensory processing

392
00:27:31,158 --> 00:27:33,030
within cortical microcircuits.

393
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:39,382
These synapses may in part
be determined by genetic mechanisms.

394
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,769
The different cell types
express different genes

395
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,824
and so genetically, 
one can distinguish different cell types

396
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:51,420
in the neocortex and there may well be
genetic factors that skew

397
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:55,418
the wiring diagram of the neocortex
in one way or another.

398
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:01,292
It's also very likely that experience
makes a big difference to the wiring

399
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,547
of the neocortex.

400
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,636
We learn how to perceive
the world around us

401
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:08,962
and it's likely that some of that learning
as to how to interpret

402
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:12,263
the sensory information
occurs in the wiring diagram

403
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,374
of the primary sensory areas.

404
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:18,923
So the distribution of large amplitude
and small amplitude

405
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:23,492
synaptic connections in the brain
may in part relate to experience

406
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:24,894
depend on learning.

407
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:28,247
Over the next video,
we're going to see how

408
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,879
synaptic plasticity
through different patterns

409
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,570
of activity can alter the strength
of synaptic connections.
