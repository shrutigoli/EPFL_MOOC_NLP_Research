1
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:10,019
As we've discussed
over the last weeks,

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,807
neurons have extensive
dendritic arborizations.

3
00:00:14,459 --> 00:00:17,428
They grow these protrusions
from the cell body,

4
00:00:17,428 --> 00:00:21,640
extending out, reaching out
to try to make synapses

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,163
and receive information
from presynaptic neurons.

6
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:31,907
This means that there are local
and complicated electrical

7
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:35,975
and presumably also biochemical
interactions occurring

8
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:38,548
at some distance from the soma.

9
00:00:39,447 --> 00:00:43,100
In this lesson, we'll learn
that there's a further level

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,230
of specialization that occurs
on the dendrites,

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,158
where small protrusions grow
from those dendrites

12
00:00:50,158 --> 00:00:53,437
in order to make excitatory synapses.

13
00:00:53,902 --> 00:00:57,528
Those protrusions are called
<i>dendritic spines</i>.

14
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:03,341
For most cells, the excitatory 
glutamatergic inputs that arrive

15
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:08,254
across the dendritic arborization
don't come directly in

16
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:11,086
onto the main parent dendrites.

17
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,475
The main place
where glutamatergic synapses

18
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,886
are found is on these small protrusions,

19
00:01:17,886 --> 00:01:23,998
about one micrometer in size or so,
that grow from the parent dendrite,

20
00:01:23,998 --> 00:01:29,577
reach out and make contacts
with presynaptic specializations.

21
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:35,617
These one-micrometer structures
are the main sites

22
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,910
of where excitatory glutamatergic inputs

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:43,211
arrive onto most types 
of cells in the brain.

24
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,805
They're likely to have
a variety of important functions,

25
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:51,248
and that's what we'll discuss
in this video.

26
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:55,933
First, to get an impression
of what the structure

27
00:01:55,933 --> 00:02:00,792
of neurons looks like, here we have
a recording from a brain slice,

28
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,151
very much like what you saw
in previous weeks.

29
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:07,835
A whole-cell recording electrode
has been introduced

30
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:10,632
onto a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell.

31
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,629
Here you see the soma of that cell.

32
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,266
This glass electrode
makes an intracellular recording

33
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:21,026
of the structure 
and electrophysiological properties

34
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:22,361
of that neuron.

35
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:26,452
Because there's a fluorescent dye
inside the electrode,

36
00:02:26,452 --> 00:02:31,460
we can take a fluorescence image
of that cell — you see the cell body,

37
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,352
the pipette, as you did here,
in the video image of that cell.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,813
Here in addition, through the high contrast
that's given by the fluorescence,

39
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:46,529
you also see the dendritic structure
of the cell where these dendrites

40
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,856
are reaching out, 
trying to get synaptic input.

41
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:53,894
If you would now look more carefully
at these dendrites,

42
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,873
you'll see that there are
little red spots

43
00:02:56,873 --> 00:03:00,895
that are decorating the side
of all of these dendrites.

44
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:06,608
These, then, are the dendritic spines,
the outgrowths that come

45
00:03:06,608 --> 00:03:11,467
and grow out of the main dendrite,
reaching out yet further

46
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,618
to make a synaptic contact
with a presynaptic bouton

47
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,295
that releases glutamate.

48
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:21,551
Each one of these spines receives

49
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,031
at least one glutamatergic input.

50
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:28,834
In mature pyramidal cells,

51
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:33,022
no glutamatergic synapses arrive
on the main dendrite.

52
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:37,036
All glutamatergic synapses
arrive on these spines.

53
00:03:37,036 --> 00:03:43,132
So as a first-order approximation to see 
how many glutamatergic inputs arrive

54
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:48,234
on one of these excitatory pyramidal cells
one can simply go and count

55
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:53,184
the number of spines,
and that amounts to some thousand

56
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:56,019
or so for a typical nerve cell.

57
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,054
If we now want to look
a bit more carefully at the structure

58
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:03,646
of dendritic spines,
because of their small size,

59
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,979
we can't use light microscopy.

60
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,254
Light microscopy gives you
an image like this,

61
00:04:09,254 --> 00:04:13,455
where on this 20-micrometer scale,
we see the cell body,

62
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,441
about ten microns in diameter,
we see the dendrites,

63
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:20,928
which are maybe one or two micrometers
in diameter, and we also see,

64
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,813
just about, these fuzzy protrusions,
but we are unable to resolve

65
00:04:25,813 --> 00:04:29,139
their structure fully,
because light microscopy

66
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,249
has a resolution limit that's set
largely by the wavelength of light.

67
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:39,335
In order to see at higher resolution
the structure of these dendritic spines,

68
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:42,213
we must turn to electron microscopy,

69
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:44,946
that you've already heard about
from Graham Knott.

70
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,992
Here is one of the images
that Graham Knott has taken

71
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:50,233
of a dendritic spine.

72
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,333
In this particular plane,
we see the main dendrite

73
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,604
that has about a one-micrometer diameter

74
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:04,277
and growing out, emanating
from that parent dendrite

75
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:06,132
is the dendritic spine.

76
00:05:06,132 --> 00:05:11,358
That's much narrower, it has something,
a so-called spine neck,

77
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:15,834
on the size of around 100 
or 200 nanometers,

78
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,218
so about a tenth the size of a dendrite,

79
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:25,235
and it might grow for a micron or so,
reaching out, and here it contacts

80
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:30,705
a glutamatergic presynaptic specialization
filled with synaptic vesicles.

81
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,793
When an action potential
invades this presynaptic nerve terminal,

82
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:36,560
it will release glutamate
and it will then affect

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,357
the AMPA and NMDA receptors
that are present here

84
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:44,136
on the postsynaptic density
at the tip of the spine

85
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:47,624
that will then communicate
those electrical currents

86
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,269
through to the parent dendrite

87
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,572
that then in turn signals
through to the soma,

88
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,913
where an action potential
might be initiated.

89
00:05:57,213 --> 00:06:01,753
Now, dendritic spines come
in many shapes and forms.

90
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,271
There are the so-called
large mushroom spines,

91
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:10,822
where there's a large dendritic head
that sticks off the dendrite —

92
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:13,812
here, this is an example of this.

93
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:15,582
The head is perhaps a little bit small,

94
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:19,122
but the heads here 
of these mushroom spines

95
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:22,935
can maybe be a micrometer in diameter.

96
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:28,685
The spine neck here that has
a diameter of around 100 to 200 nanometers

97
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:31,609
can be one or two micrometers long.

98
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,513
There are, however, 
other types of dendritic spines.

99
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:39,633
There's a continuum of these,
and so others just have

100
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,530
thin protrusions like that
and maybe just have

101
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,762
a very small synapse sitting on the end.

102
00:06:45,762 --> 00:06:50,304
These large mushroom spines
might have very large synapses

103
00:06:50,304 --> 00:06:51,688
sitting on them.

104
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:55,824
In between, there are
other small, stubby spines.

105
00:06:56,934 --> 00:07:01,832
If we now zoom in a bit further
on one of these electron micrographs,

106
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:05,708
we can begin to see
further structural specializations

107
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:07,672
inside the dendritic spine.

108
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:12,250
Just to orient you again,
here is a presynaptic nerve terminal

109
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,496
filled with synaptic vesicles.

110
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:17,545
Each one of these contains
a high concentration of glutamate

111
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:21,885
and will be released
upon action potential invasion

112
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:23,665
of the presynaptic bouton.

113
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:27,417
Postsynaptically, we find 
that there's a darker region here

114
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:32,157
that shows up
in the electron-dense staining

115
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:34,593
of the electron micrograph.

116
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:37,825
This is the so-called
post-synaptic density.

117
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:41,316
What this indicates is
that there's an area here

118
00:07:41,316 --> 00:07:45,949
that contains a very dense matrix
of proteins that are present here

119
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,802
on the postsynaptic density.

120
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:53,645
So of course, we already know
that the postsynaptic membrane

121
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:58,967
must contain ligand-gated ion channels,

122
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:02,407
the glutamate receptors,
the AMPA, and the NMDA receptors.

123
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:05,644
In addition, they also have
other molecules

124
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:09,028
that are in part used 
to anchor these molecules,

125
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:12,977
the AMPA and NMDA receptors, in position.

126
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:16,237
So some of these, and perhaps one 
of the most important ones,

127
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:21,992
is called PSD95, 
postsynaptic density molecule

128
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:24,414
with 95 kilodaltons.

129
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:30,177
This is one of the most highly expressed
proteins that are present here

130
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,209
in the postsynaptic density.

131
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,705
This probably provides
a scaffolding molecule

132
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,793
which can link 
to the ligand-gated ion channels,

133
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:43,333
together with a host
of other signaling molecules

134
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:47,009
that help keep 
the ligand-gated ion channels

135
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:50,950
in the right place, right 
next to the presynaptic specialization

136
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,381
where glutamate
is going to get released from.

137
00:08:54,873 --> 00:08:57,736
These molecules 
are of course also involved

138
00:08:57,736 --> 00:08:59,099
in signaling cascades.

139
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:03,014
We've just heard in the last lesson
about the process

140
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:07,269
of synaptic plasticity, 
where we need to be able to recruit

141
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:10,669
receptors that are diffusing
on the plasma membrane

142
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:15,346
into the synapse if it's going to be
a long-term potentiation

143
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,174
or we need to be able
to get rid of these receptors

144
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:21,333
if it's a question
of long-term depression.

145
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,266
So there are many signaling molecules
that are also present

146
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:28,668
and many of them are present right here
at the postsynaptic density

147
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:32,287
where they're being held in place
exactly where they need to be,

148
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:35,319
next to the AMPA and NMDA receptors.

149
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:39,741
If we look a little bit deeper
inside the spine that we can outline here —

150
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:43,829
here's the spine neck, the parent dendrite
begins somewhere down here —

151
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,445
there's another interesting
and prominent feature

152
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,730
called the spine apparatus.

153
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,663
Not all spines have 
a spine apparatus, but many do.

154
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,161
This turns out to be a part
of the endoplasmic reticulum

155
00:09:58,161 --> 00:10:00,894
or a specialization
of endoplasmic reticulum

156
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:03,181
that's present inside spines.

157
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:07,513
So it's quite likely
that proteins are being made

158
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:10,846
in some cases, and so there's
local protein synthesis

159
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:13,257
that might occur inside spines.

160
00:10:14,117 --> 00:10:16,962
The other thing
that the endoplasmic reticulum does

161
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:19,079
is to handle calcium.

162
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,330
So this is likely to be
an intracellular calcium store

163
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,803
that's likely to contribute
to what happens downstream

164
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:32,195
of, say, NMDA receptor activation,
which causes a calcium influx,

165
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:36,196
and that might then be 
buffered or handled

166
00:10:36,196 --> 00:10:40,557
by the endoplasmic reticulum
here in the spine apparatus,

167
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:44,864
and that might contribute
to releasing calcium in some cases,

168
00:10:44,872 --> 00:10:47,804
or sucking calcium up
in other cases,

169
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:52,062
and that might contribute
to regulating synaptic plasticity.

170
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:57,790
So within even these small,
one-micron dendritic spines,

171
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,491
there's an enormous complexity,
a scaffold of signaling molecules

172
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:05,089
linking up to the ligand-gated receptors,

173
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,599
also proteins that stretch 
across there from presynaptic

174
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:12,167
to postsynaptic densities, and there's

175
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:18,001
also interesting endoplasmic reticulum
for perhaps manufacturing new proteins

176
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:20,517
and also for dealing with calcium signals.

177
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,628
What might the function 
of these spines be?

178
00:11:24,628 --> 00:11:30,378
At one level, the narrow constriction
of the spine neck provides

179
00:11:30,378 --> 00:11:33,580
a diffusional barrier where we
can imagine having

180
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:39,092
biochemical reactions taking place
in this one-micron spine head

181
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:41,793
that might be localized
and it might be difficult

182
00:11:41,793 --> 00:11:44,968
for those proteins
or other signaling molecules

183
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,967
to diffuse out of the spine.

184
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:52,182
There's simply a very narrow spine neck
of say 100 nanometers

185
00:11:52,182 --> 00:11:57,340
that will then restrict the diffusion
of various different signaling molecules.

186
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,508
Perhaps the first signaling molecule
we might think of, coming

187
00:12:01,508 --> 00:12:06,577
through the NMDA receptor and thinking 
about synaptic plasticity, is calcium.

188
00:12:07,462 --> 00:12:11,515
Calcium will enter
during spike-timing-dependent plasticity

189
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:15,699
or long term potentiation,
the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized,

190
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,383
the magnesium comes out
of the NMDA receptor,

191
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:21,949
gluatamate is released,
and now calcium can flood

192
00:12:21,953 --> 00:12:24,874
into the post-synaptic spine.

193
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:31,189
The local concentration
inside this spine can rise

194
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:36,429
quite strongly because it's a small volume
and so only a few calcium ions

195
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,853
are needed in order to increase
the calcium concentration

196
00:12:39,853 --> 00:12:42,416
quite dramatically in this small volume.

197
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,917
It's difficult for the calcium to leave
because the spine neck is restricted

198
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:52,473
in diameter and so diffusion
of the calcium out is rather difficult

199
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:55,402
and indeed there are
many calcium-binding molecules

200
00:12:55,402 --> 00:12:59,970
and it may be that the spine apparatus,
the endoplasmic reticulum,

201
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,961
further restricts the diffusion
of calcium out of spine heads.

202
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,384
This then means that we 
can have calcium signals

203
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:11,318
that are entirely localized
to a single dendritic spine —

204
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:13,702
to a single synapse.

205
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:19,324
That, then, might help synaptic plasticity
remain synapse-specific.

206
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:24,098
In addition, it's possible,
and there's some discussion of this point

207
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:28,009
in research at the moment,
that there's some resistance

208
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:34,048
for the currents flowing in here
through the ligand-gated ion channels.

209
00:13:34,826 --> 00:13:37,825
In order for them to get
to the soma and signal through,

210
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:40,196
there must of course be some current flow.

211
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:45,330
If there's a strong resistance here,
then it's more difficult

212
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:49,577
for that synaptic current
to flow to the parent dendrite

213
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:52,527
and of course subsequently
to reach the soma.

214
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,329
There are measurements
that suggest that, at least

215
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,717
at some synapses, 
the spine neck resistance

216
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,595
might be on the order of 1 gigaohm.

217
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:08,657
That's the type of resistance
that makes it relatively difficult

218
00:14:08,657 --> 00:14:13,988
for currents to flow from the spine head
to the parent dendrite.

219
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:20,116
So it may be that the potential 
here at the spine head

220
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:25,098
might be quite different
from the potential at the parent dendrite.

221
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,918
The final point that I'd like to make
about spines is that they are

222
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:33,094
highly motile — they move around.

223
00:14:33,592 --> 00:14:38,191
The reason that they move
is because of actin.

224
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:43,380
If we now look at a piece of dendrite
that's schematically drawn here

225
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,056
and we imagine it's stained
for microtubules — MAP2 —

226
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:52,482
or for actin, then we see
that the main parent dendrite

227
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:56,666
is full of microtubules,
stained here with MAP2.

228
00:14:56,666 --> 00:15:01,722
But the spines that decorate this
are full of actin,

229
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:04,146
and actin is an extremely
interesting substance.

230
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:08,445
It's a protein that readily polymerizes
and depolymerizes

231
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,393
and it's the reason that cells —

232
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:14,180
all types of cells 
across biology — can move.

233
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,269
They do so by extending —
in a treadmill-type fashion,

234
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,813
they can get rid of actin
at one end of a filament

235
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:26,629
and they can add 
additional actin molecules

236
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:31,169
to grow and thus
they can push the membrane around

237
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,849
in interesting ways.

238
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:38,493
Now this is particularly interesting
because this also underlies,

239
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,841
or at least is thought to underlie,
the formation of the dendritic spine.

240
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:48,090
<i>De novo</i>, under conditions,
for example, of where one tries

241
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,974
to induce long-term potentiation,
there are conditions

242
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:55,822
where new spines can appear
where there used to not be any.

243
00:15:55,822 --> 00:16:00,402
Here we are looking at a piece
of dendrite — some manipulation

244
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:03,774
has been done, there may be
a change in sensory experience

245
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:07,985
to the animal, or we might be thinking
about a brain-slice dish experiment

246
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:11,163
where some glutamate
has been released in this area,

247
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:16,332
and that then induces a signaling process
where a spine might grow.

248
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:20,956
So the polymerization of actin
will then push out a membrane here

249
00:16:20,956 --> 00:16:25,622
and would then begin the process
of forming a synapse

250
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:29,612
which may be reaching out
to the presynaptic nerve terminal.

251
00:16:29,612 --> 00:16:33,353
If that synapse turns out to be
successful and useful

252
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:38,212
and is perhaps further strengthened
by additional long-term potentiation,

253
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,390
there would then be
a spine growth process,

254
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,155
where more actin polymerization
would induce an enlargement of that spine.

255
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:49,196
So we move from the thin,
filamentous type of spines,

256
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:52,867
to the mushroom, 
large type of spine here,

257
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:56,234
where we can have a large
postsynaptic density

258
00:16:56,234 --> 00:17:00,884
with very many glutamate receptors
sitting here, and a major important impact

259
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:04,026
of this synapse, whereas this one
might just have one

260
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:09,255
or two ligand-gated glutamate receptors
and so this might just be

261
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:13,955
more an exploratory type of synapse
that has a relatively small impact

262
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:15,526
upon the soma.

263
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:21,410
This type of <i>de novo</i> spine growth
is extremely interesting

264
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,728
because it implies
that one might be able to rewire

265
00:17:24,728 --> 00:17:27,663
neuronal networks
through sensory experience.

266
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:32,417
This is the type of theory
that people are thinking about.

267
00:17:32,894 --> 00:17:35,558
We imagine that there's 
a presynaptic neuron

268
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,256
that sends off its axon into an area here
where there are dendrites

269
00:17:40,256 --> 00:17:43,278
from two other postsynaptic neurons.

270
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:46,117
The axon has a bouton

271
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:51,797
and in the basal state there's a synapse
that's been formed here

272
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:54,129
onto the red postsynaptic cell.

273
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,900
It has a spine that grows out here

274
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,204
and makes a synapse
with the gray axon.

275
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:03,604
So the action potentials
release glutamate,

276
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:06,673
activate AMPA and NMDA receptors,

277
00:18:06,673 --> 00:18:09,828
causing postsynaptic potentials
in the red neuron.

278
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:11,731
That's what you see here:

279
00:18:11,731 --> 00:18:15,206
An action potential in the gray cell —
here's the action potential —

280
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:17,833
releases glutamate onto the red cell,

281
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:22,126
then we have a postsynaptic potential
in the red cell. In the blue cell

282
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:24,504
there's no synaptic connection
so there's obviously

283
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:28,043
no depolarization in response
to that action potential.

284
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:31,715
So there's a synaptic connection
from the black to the red cell

285
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:35,391
and there's no synaptic connection
from the black to the blue cell.

286
00:18:36,255 --> 00:18:39,155
Then we envisage some sort
of learning experience.

287
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:43,524
The animal has learned something,
and something in the brain must change.

288
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:48,338
In this example we imagine
that there's a change in the wiring.

289
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:52,173
The black cell now 
needs to talk to the blue cell.

290
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:57,704
The synapse from the red cell
may not be useful anymore.

291
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,896
It may retract and disappear.

292
00:18:59,896 --> 00:19:04,088
So spines can both appear <i>de novo</i>
and they can also disappear.

293
00:19:04,088 --> 00:19:08,068
In general, there's a turnover
where spines are appearing

294
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:12,421
and disappearing at a certain rate,
and during learning experiences

295
00:19:12,421 --> 00:19:14,729
the rate of change of synapses,

296
00:19:14,729 --> 00:19:17,719
or at least of spines,
changes dramatically.

297
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,794
So we can increase the amount
of turnover of spines

298
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,760
during learning experiences.

299
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,125
Here we imagine that the black cell
needs to communicate now

300
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,575
with the blue cell, 
so the blue cell grows the spine,

301
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:35,383
perhaps even to the same bouton
as was there already,

302
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,449
senses the glutamate, and forms a synapse.

303
00:19:38,449 --> 00:19:42,356
Now the black cell,
when an action potential is fired,

304
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:45,207
causes a postsynaptic potential
in the blue cell,

305
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:49,935
and the red cell — where it used to be
connected to — is now unconnected.

306
00:19:49,935 --> 00:19:53,278
So we've changed 
the wiring diagram of the brain

307
00:19:53,278 --> 00:19:56,326
in an experience-dependent manner
during learning.

308
00:19:57,242 --> 00:20:01,241
So we've seen that dendrites
of many cells in the mammalian brain

309
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,883
are decorated with spines
at a very high density.

310
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:08,728
These spines grow one,
maybe two micrometers out

311
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:12,475
from the parent dendrite
and they form specializations

312
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,954
where glutamatergic synapses are made.

313
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:21,033
The spines likely have
several important functional roles.

314
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:26,507
One important role is that they may form
isolated biochemical compartments

315
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:31,146
where signaling can occur
in a synapse-specific way

316
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:35,854
so that signals that result
from, say, synaptic plasticity,

317
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:38,282
can be confined
to that individual synapse,

318
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:40,905
and we don't change
all the nearby synapses

319
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:44,326
on the dendrite, 
but just that one specific synapse

320
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,006
that wants to be altered.

321
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:49,902
So the spine neck provides
an important diffusional barrier

322
00:20:49,902 --> 00:20:55,042
where signalling can be confined
to the dendritic spine of interest.

323
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,560
The other important aspect
about dendritic spines

324
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,176
is that they provide us
enormous flexibility

325
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:04,015
in terms of rewiring.

326
00:21:04,551 --> 00:21:10,511
There are many axons in the immediate
one-to-two-micron vicinity

327
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:15,099
of every dendrite,
and by simply growing out

328
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:19,223
a small dendritic protrusion,
the spine, you can rewire

329
00:21:19,223 --> 00:21:23,887
and get signals from different axons
from many different cells,

330
00:21:23,887 --> 00:21:28,557
and that can then reconfigure
how a neuronal network functions.
