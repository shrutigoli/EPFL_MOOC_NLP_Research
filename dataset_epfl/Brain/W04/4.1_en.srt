00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,455
Welcome back to week four 
of cellular mechanisms of brain function.

2
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:13,232
This week, 
we're going to talk about

3
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:16,737
glutamatergic excitatory 
synaptic transmission.

4
00:00:17,657 --> 00:00:21,872
We've already studied the basics 
of membrane biophysics and excitability

5
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:24,530
and we've talked about 
synaptic transmission

6
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,755
as the most important way in which 
neurons can communicate with each other.

7
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:33,570
Now, neurons, or most neurons 
from the mammalian brain,

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,541
are not spontaneously active.

9
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:38,847
That is in the absence of synaptic input,

10
00:00:38,847 --> 00:00:42,331
they are hyperpolarized 
in terms of their membrane potential,

11
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:44,966
maybe being at -70 mV,

12
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,674
so they are many 
tens of millivolts hyperpolarized

13
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:51,351
relative to the 
action potential threshold,

14
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,792
which is at around -40 mV.

15
00:00:54,192 --> 00:00:57,441
In order for the nerve cells 
to begin to become active

16
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:01,621
to fire action potentials 
and to participate in brain function

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,906
and the processing of information,

18
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:07,237
it's essential that these neurons 
become depolarized,

19
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:10,751
that they become excited, 
and begin to find action potentials.

20
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,771
The way in which neurons 
become excited

21
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:16,827
is through 
excitatory synaptic transmission,

22
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:21,360
and by far, the most important 
excitatory neurotransmitter

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,003
in the mammalian brain is glutamate.

24
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:29,445
Something like 80% of all the synapses 
in the mammalian brain

25
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:34,025
rely upon glutamate and so 
glutamatergic synaptic transmission

26
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,410
is a fundamental importance

27
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,933
and that's what we'll study 
during this week.

28
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:45,401
If an action potential occurs 
in a glutamatergic neuron,

29
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:49,440
that action potential 
will propagate down the axon

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,644
and it'll reach 
presynaptic specializations,

31
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:57,223
boutons, which are filled with 
synaptic vesicles,

32
00:01:57,653 --> 00:02:00,605
each of which is packaged 
with glutamate,

33
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:06,440
probably at a concentration of around 
100 mM of glutamate in each vesicle

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,378
and that glutamate 
has been put in there

35
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,783
specifically by the 
vesicular glutamate transporter

36
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:15,553
that's present 
on every synaptic vesicle.

37
00:02:16,113 --> 00:02:20,019
Some of these synaptic vesicles 
will be docked and release-ready

38
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:27,342
and when the action potential invades, 
the bouton calcium influx occurs

39
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:32,560
thereâ€™s then the exocytosis of the contents 
of that synaptic vesicle.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,802
The glutamate diffuses 
across the synaptic cleft

41
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,709
and there, it can bind onto 
postsynaptic receptors

42
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,129
causing excitatory 
postsynaptic potentials.

43
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:49,004
The fusion of a single vesicle 
is thought to increase

44
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:52,583
the concentration of glutamate 
in the synaptic cleft

45
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:58,280
to about 1 mM 
for a period of about 1 ms.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,730
So we're thinking about brief, 
transient pulses of glutamate

47
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,680
as a major way in which neurons 
communicate with each other.

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,769
And that's what the postsynaptic cell 
then needs to be sensitive to.

49
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,626
A 1 mM puff of glutamate 
that then needs to act

50
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:17,919
on ligand-gated 
neurotransmitter receptors,

51
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,690
glutamate receptors, 
and for the glutamate receptors,

52
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,880
we have two major subtypes.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,335
We have the AMPA receptor 
and NMDA receptor,

54
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:31,570
and we'll discuss more details 
about the similarities and differences

55
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:36,361
of these two ligand-gated 
ionotropic glutamate receptors.

56
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:41,130
Both the AMPA and NMDA receptors

57
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,419
are so-called 
ionotopic glutamate receptors.

58
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,072
That means that they're 
intrinsically ion channels

59
00:03:48,072 --> 00:03:51,761
and the open probability 
of the ion channel

60
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:56,029
depends upon the binding 
of the neurotransmitter glutamate.

61
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,536
They are of course, 
transmembrane proteins

62
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:04,280
and of course, 
made of a sequence of amino acids,

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,760
starting from an N terminal,

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,917
running through 
transmembrane alpha helixes regions,

65
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,313
as in first transmembrane alpha helix,

66
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:16,812
there's a second alpha helix that 
doesn't cross the membrane all the way,

67
00:04:16,812 --> 00:04:21,222
there's a third, 
and a fourth transmembrane helix.

68
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,147
Because there are only 
three alpha helixes

69
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:27,690
that completely cross the 
plasma membrane

70
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:28,981
from outside to inside,

71
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,700
the N terminal 
and the C terminal domains

72
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,714
are on different sides 
of the membrane

73
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:38,960
and the N terminal domain 
has a large extra cellular region

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,914
and that is also where the 
glutamate binding domain is encoded,

75
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:48,262
somewhere in this area 
circled here in red.

76
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:55,087
So the binding of glutamate 
changes the structure of the ion channel

77
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:59,466
and causes an increase in 
the open probability of the ion channel

78
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:04,043
and the ion channel itself 
is made from four subunits

79
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,054
that come together 
and look a bit like this.

80
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,931
So there are four different subunits--

81
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:11,868
come together, 
are sitting in the plasma membrane,

82
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,361
this is now a top view 
of the plasma membrane,

83
00:05:14,361 --> 00:05:19,050
and down the middle we have 
the pore-forming ion channel

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,798
which then gets activated 
as glutamate binds

85
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:27,729
to a number of these different subunits 
that increases the open probability,

86
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:31,440
and we then have a cation channel 
that's permeable

87
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,747
to sodium, potassium, 
and in some cases, also to calcium.

88
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:41,300
There are these two major subtypes 
of ionotropic glutamate receptors,

89
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,243
the AMPA receptors 
and the NMDA receptors,

90
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:48,559
and they are encoded 
by different gene families

91
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,689
and so there are four genes

92
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,106
that are responsible 
for coding AMPA receptors

93
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,740
and there are seven genes

94
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,075
that are responsible 
for coding NMDA receptors.

95
00:05:58,805 --> 00:06:01,715
When glutamate binds 
to an AMPA receptor,

96
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:03,865
that increases it's open probability

97
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:09,486
and the AMPA receptor is permeable 
to both sodium and potassium ions,

98
00:06:09,486 --> 00:06:11,610
a little bit more permeable to sodium,

99
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,127
and it has a reversal potential 
of somewhere around 0 mV.

100
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,644
The single channel conductance 
is relatively small,

101
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:25,220
at around 5 pS, but that depends heavily 
upon the precise molecular details

102
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,284
of which subtypes of AMPA receptors 
are part of that ion channel.

103
00:06:31,954 --> 00:06:35,120
NMDA receptors are also activated 
by glutamate.

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,226
So glutamate binds 
the NMDA receptor

105
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:41,268
and that increases the open probability 
of the NMDA receptor,

106
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:46,511
but only if co-agonists are present 
in the extra cellular fluid

107
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:51,402
and so either glycine or d-serine 
need to be present

108
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:53,041
in the extra cellular space

109
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,503
in order for glutamate 
to activate the NMDA receptor.

110
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:57,694
And usually they are,

111
00:06:57,694 --> 00:07:01,220
and so usually this is not thought 
to be an important regulator,

112
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,518
but there may well be circumstances 
where this really works

113
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:08,050
as a co-agonist together with glutamate

114
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,630
in order to activate 
the NMDA conductance.

115
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,947
When activated, 
the NMDA receptor is permeable

116
00:07:14,947 --> 00:07:18,070
to both sodium, potassium, 
and importantly,

117
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,448
is also permeable to calcium,

118
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:24,080
something that most of the AMPA receptors 
aren't able to do.

119
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,770
Calcium permeability 
is extremely important

120
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,414
because postsynaptically,

121
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:32,780
it'll turn out that calcium 
has important signaling properties

122
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,147
just as it does 
in the presynaptic terminal

123
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:39,467
where calcium is a final signal 
that causes neurotransmitter release.

124
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:42,959
Calcium postsynaptically will turn out 
to have an important role

125
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,224
in governing synaptic plasticity.

126
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:49,151
The overall reversal potential 
of the NMDA receptor

127
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:51,483
is also around 0 mV.

128
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:55,434
So both of the ionotropic 
glutamate receptors in the end,

129
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,765
try to bring the membrane potential 
close to 0 mV,

130
00:07:58,765 --> 00:08:03,034
that's clearly depolarized 
relative to action potential threshold

131
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:07,580
and so both the AMPA 
and the NMDA receptors are excitatory

132
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,617
and they form the major 
excitatory neurotransmitter receptors

133
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,139
in the mammalian brain.

134
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:18,071
NMDA receptors have a considerably 
larger single channel conductance

135
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:19,700
compared to AMPA receptors.

136
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,189
And so they're distinguishable 
upon many, many features,

137
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:26,693
their ion channel permeability, 
single channel conductance,

138
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:31,480
and molecularly, they're of course 
encoded by distinct gene families.

139
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,269
There are also very important 
differences in the kinetics

140
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:39,401
of the currents that are activated.

141
00:08:40,111 --> 00:08:44,680
And it's important to study the kinetics 
of the AMPA and NMDA receptors

142
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,720
under as close as possible 
physiological conditions.

143
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,976
And so, what we think 
might be interesting,

144
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:53,533
in terms of thinking about 
synaptic transmission,

145
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:58,479
are brief pulses of glutamate 
that last about 1 ms

146
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:02,510
and have an amplitude 
of around 1 mM.

147
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,544
Now in order to make brief pulses 
like this, of glutamate,

148
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:10,805
experimenters have designed 
an interesting way

149
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:15,275
where one has a laminar flow 
of two different fluids:

150
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:19,304
one fluid that contains 
0 mM of glutamate,

151
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:23,080
and another one that contains 
1 mM of glutamate,

152
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,441
otherwise containing 
identical concentrations

153
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,787
of the other components 
of the extra cellular fluid.

154
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:37,029
By having these two laminar flows 
on a piezo actuator,

155
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:39,800
one can then rapidly move 
this laminar flow

156
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,434
and then cause 
different concentrations

157
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:45,981
to be hitting upon 
a given region of space.

158
00:09:45,981 --> 00:09:49,798
And so one can imagine moving 
this piezo actuator

159
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:54,002
and giving a 1 ms pulse 
of 1mM of glutamate,

160
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:59,120
to a small patch of membrane 
that's sitting on a patch-clamp electrode.

161
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,682
And this membrane here,

162
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:05,351
then should preferably have 
glutamate receptors on it.

163
00:10:06,101 --> 00:10:08,041
And glutamate receptors, we know,

164
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,938
of course are sitting 
on dendrites of neurons,

165
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:14,763
and so if we imagine 
a dendrite of a neuron here,

166
00:10:14,763 --> 00:10:17,714
there might be glutamate receptors 
and synapses present

167
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:20,193
on one part of this membrane

168
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:23,644
and so let's zoom in 
and look at this in some more detail

169
00:10:23,644 --> 00:10:25,996
and so here's 
the plasma membrane.

170
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:30,383
We bring in the patch electrode 
onto this piece of dendrite,

171
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:34,942
we can then suck 
a bit of the membrane

172
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:37,561
into the glass electrode.

173
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:41,152
This is our standard 
patch-clamp recording method

174
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:43,782
invented by Neher and Sakmann,

175
00:10:43,782 --> 00:10:46,040
we get the gigaohm electrical seal

176
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,521
of the patch of membrane 
around the electrode,

177
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,283
we can then rupture this membrane,

178
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,562
in the so-called 
whole-cell recording method

179
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:57,593
by a brief pulse of pressure, 
so we suck the membrane

180
00:10:57,593 --> 00:10:59,116
and that ruptures this membrane.

181
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,690
We now have access 
to the inside of the membrane

182
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,566
through the recording electrode,

183
00:11:04,546 --> 00:11:07,646
and if you now retract 
this electrode a little bit,

184
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:10,210
the dendrite stays 
in the same location,

185
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,942
but a bit of the membrane 
gets pulled out towards the membrane.

186
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:16,780
And if you keep pulling 
on the electrode,

187
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,789
eventually, this breaks

188
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,898
and you're left with 
a small patch of membrane

189
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:25,952
attached to your electrode 
with the outside of this membrane

190
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:29,656
being on the outside 
relative to your patch electrode.

191
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,528
And so here,

192
00:11:30,528 --> 00:11:32,464
if there are glutamate receptors 
present,

193
00:11:32,464 --> 00:11:36,575
then they have the glutamate binding site 
in the correct orientation.

194
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:41,158
You can give the 1 ms pulse of glutamate 
through the piezo transducer

195
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,063
and we can then measure 
on your patch electrode

196
00:11:44,063 --> 00:11:47,110
the AMPA receptor 
or the NMDA receptors here,

197
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,980
we voltage-clamp the electrode,

198
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,059
and we can then measure 
the currents

199
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:54,064
flowing through these 
glutamate-gated--

200
00:11:54,064 --> 00:11:56,071
ligand-gated ion channels.

201
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:01,642
So, if we do this for patches of membrane 
that contain AMPA receptors

202
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:04,840
and we give this 
a 1 ms pulse of glutamate

203
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,184
with an amplitude of 1 mM,

204
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,664
we find that the AMPA receptor 
responds very rapidly.

205
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:15,700
We get rapid activation 
of a glutamate-gated current

206
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,200
that then also rapidly turns off

207
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,598
in response to this 1 ms pulse 
of glutamate.

208
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:25,050
We get, maybe, a couple of milliseconds 
of AMPA current.

209
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,344
So AMPA receptors are activated 
extremely quickly

210
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:30,559
and they also turn off 
extremely quickly.

211
00:12:30,999 --> 00:12:34,328
And in fact, 
it turns out that it's very difficult

212
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:36,902
to have long lasting 
AMPA receptor currents

213
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:40,030
because even if the glutamate 
is prolonged,

214
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,947
it turns out that the AMPA current 
doesn't extend in time.

215
00:12:44,947 --> 00:12:47,233
And there's a very strong 
desensitization

216
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:51,830
that takes place where, 
in the presence of glutamate,

217
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,000
the AMPA receptors desensitize

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,140
and are only able to give 
transient currents

219
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,254
lasting for a few milliseconds.

220
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:03,710
The situation for NMDA receptors 
is rather different.

221
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,680
Again, we give the same 1 mM, 
1 ms pulse of glutamate,

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,321
and we activate NMDA currents,

223
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,441
but as you will see here,

224
00:13:14,441 --> 00:13:16,806
the time scale is very different here,

225
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:20,431
we're looking at 100 ms, 
here we were looking at 1 ms

226
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,557
and in fact, it takes some time

227
00:13:22,557 --> 00:13:26,100
before the NMDA current maximizes.

228
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,029
It maybe takes some 20 ms 
before the NMDA conductance

229
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:31,673
is maximally opened,

230
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:35,039
long after the glutamate 
has already gone.

231
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,295
And the NMDA receptor currents 
remain active

232
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:43,534
for hundreds of milliseconds 
after the glutamate pulse.

233
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:47,920
And so it's clear that the 
temporal kinetics of AMPA conductance

234
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,721
and NMDA conductance 
are extremely different,

235
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:55,647
with one or two orders of magnitudes 
slower activity in NMDA receptors,

236
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:58,688
compared to the extremely fast 
AMPA receptors.

237
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:03,811
There are also important differences 
in the voltage dependence

238
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:07,734
of the currents generated by 
AMPA and NMDA receptors.

239
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:12,751
AMPA receptors are basically 
voltage insensitive,

240
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,913
in at least, most of the forms 
of AMPA receptors.

241
00:14:15,913 --> 00:14:20,124
And so if we think about the conductance 
activated by a pulse of glutamate,

242
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:22,312
this is independent to voltage,

243
00:14:22,312 --> 00:14:26,322
and that then gives rise 
to a linear current voltage relationship.

244
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:31,220
For NMDA receptors, 
the situation's rather different.

245
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,544
At hyperpolarized potentials,

246
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:38,200
and that's something 
hyperpolarized say to -40 mV,

247
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,876
the conductance of the NMDA receptor 
is strongly reduced.

248
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:45,526
The open probability 
that the amount of current flow

249
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:48,352
is blocked here at negative potentials,

250
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:52,642
and at positive potentials, 
we come here with a full activation.

251
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,610
And so we get these 
current-voltage relationships

252
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,060
that look very similar 
to what we saw before

253
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,160
for voltage-gated sodium,
and voltage-gated potassium,

254
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
and calcium conductances,

255
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,441
but here, the reversal potential here 
is close to 0 mV,

256
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:10,054
of course in both cases, 
for the AMPA and the NMDA receptor,

257
00:15:10,054 --> 00:15:12,909
whereas for the voltage-gated 
sodium conductors,

258
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,449
we of course, 
had reversal and voltage-gated

259
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,506
at the sodium reversal potential.

260
00:15:18,906 --> 00:15:22,700
So there's an obvious difference here 
under physiological conditions

261
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,039
between the non-voltage dependence 
of AMPA receptors

262
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,781
and a strong voltage dependence 
for NMDA receptors.

263
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:34,842
And although this looks very similar 
to the phenomenology

264
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:37,725
of voltage-gated sodium channels,

265
00:15:37,725 --> 00:15:41,120
in fact, the physical basis 
is very different.

266
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,240
In fact, the NMDA receptors 
aren't intrinsically voltage sensitive,

267
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,498
but they gain that attribute 
because of a magnesium block.

268
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:56,610
And so in the presence of zero magnesium 
in the extra cellular space,

269
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,080
in fact, the NMDA receptor is linear--

270
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,090
voltage and current--

271
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,680
and is only in the presence 
of extra cellular magnesium

272
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,456
that we have a strong dependence 
upon voltage

273
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:15,182
for the NMDA receptor.

274
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:19,200
Now, physiologically, 
magnesium is always present

275
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,600
in the extracellular solution.

276
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,325
And so the voltage-dependent 
magnesium block

277
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,599
of the NMDA receptors 
is extremely relevant,

278
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,223
functionally to the properties
of the NMDA receptor.

279
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:36,812
The fact that the block only occurs 
at negative potentials

280
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,991
is because that's when there's 
an electric field

281
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:43,040
that tries to suck magnesium 
inside the ion channel

282
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,055
and the magnesium is in fact, 
blocking the ion channel

283
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,748
by sitting in the ion channel,

284
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:52,007
binding to a relatively high affinity site

285
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:55,399
and preventing 
the permeation of other ions.

286
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,458
And so the magnesium 
pops in and out

287
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:02,354
in a so-called fast, flickering block 
where it directly blocks the permeation

288
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:06,055
of the other ions and doesn't affect 
the open probability

289
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,607
of the ion channel, 
but is just simply being blocked

290
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,939
by the presence 
or absence of magnesium

291
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,118
and normally with 1 mM magnesium present 
in the extracellular space

292
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,555
and negative membrane potentials 
that confers a very strong block

293
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:23,229
on the conduction 
through the NMDA receptor,

294
00:17:23,229 --> 00:17:26,488
and that's why we have this 
interesting shape

295
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:29,600
where at negative potentials, 
magnesium comes in,

296
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,524
blocks current flow 
through the NMDA receptor,

297
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:36,550
and as we get to more and more 
positive potentials,

298
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,849
then the magnesium gets pushed out 
from this internal binding site

299
00:17:41,849 --> 00:17:46,407
and we get the full current flow 
of the other ions

300
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:48,804
through the NMDA receptor.

301
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:53,876
So there's not a voltage-sensing domain 
of the NMDA receptor,

302
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:57,715
but rather a voltage-dependent block 
by magnesium

303
00:17:57,715 --> 00:18:00,095
in the pore of the ion channel.

304
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,145
So we've seen that there are two

305
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:06,518
very different 
ionotropic glutamate receptors

306
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,442
that are present 
in the mammalian nervous system.

307
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:13,736
We have the AMPA receptors 
that are extremely fast,

308
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,999
giving rise to 
millisecond duration currents

309
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:20,331
in response to a 1 ms pulse 
of glutamate

310
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:24,158
and the AMPA receptors don't depend upon 
the membrane potential.

311
00:18:24,158 --> 00:18:29,800
So at -60 mV or +60 mV, 
the amount of current flow is the same

312
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,694
and the reversal potential 
is somewhere around 0 mV.

313
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:38,093
For the NMDA receptor, 
the situation's really, very different.

314
00:18:38,523 --> 00:18:41,725
We have long lasting, slow currents

315
00:18:41,725 --> 00:18:45,081
in response to just 
millisecond pulses of glutamate.

316
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:49,427
It takes tens of milliseconds 
for the NMDA receptor to open

317
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:52,364
and once the glutamate is bound, 
it remains bound

318
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:56,161
and their ion conductance 
can remain active

319
00:18:56,161 --> 00:19:00,902
for hundreds of milliseconds 
after the glutamate has already long gone

320
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,443
from the synaptic cleft.

321
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,540
The NMDA currents are also interesting

322
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,257
because they're actually blocked 
at resting membrane potentials.

323
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:11,699
So at the resting membrane potential 
of a neuron,

324
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:14,590
at around -70 or -60 mV,

325
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:18,494
if the glutamate is puffed 
onto NMDA receptors,

326
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:20,254
there's actually very little current flow

327
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:24,440
because magnesium 
is blocking that ion channel.

328
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,348
So, NMDA receptors depend upon 
both postsynaptic depolarization

329
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,335
and the presence of glutamate,

330
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:37,087
whereas AMPA receptors are always active 
if glutamate is present.

331
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:40,001
There's considerable diversity

332
00:19:40,001 --> 00:19:43,161
amongst the different types 
of AMPA receptors,

333
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:47,060
and there are in fact, 
four genes that encode AMPA receptors

334
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,786
in the mammalian genome,

335
00:19:48,786 --> 00:19:51,242
and these are then labeled 
in their gene names

336
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:55,345
as glutamate receptor ionotropic ampa

337
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:57,568
and then subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 4.

338
00:19:57,568 --> 00:20:00,571
So that's the gene names 
that then give rise

339
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,876
to the different types of subunits

340
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,706
that are typically labeled 
GluA1, GluA2, 3, and 4.

341
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:11,461
And in older papers, 
you will read a different nomenclature,

342
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,520
whether it's called GluR1-4 or GluRA-D.

343
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,990
So there's a variety 
of different nomenclatures

344
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,484
and this is the most modern one 
that should be used from now on.

345
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:29,964
Now, most AMPA receptors contain 
the so-called GluA2 subunit.

346
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:35,478
And if the AMPA receptor contains 
the GluA2 subunit,

347
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:40,680
then as described,

348
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,790
we have linear 
current-voltage relationships,

349
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,954
and there's no calcium permeability.

350
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:53,167
Now, some AMPA receptors 
don't have the GluA2 subunit.

351
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:57,640
And under those conditions, 
the current-voltage relationship

352
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,333
is really quite different.

353
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:04,285
So now we're thinking about 
GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors

354
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:08,440
and they have a so-called 
inward rectification

355
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,422
where they like current to go 
into the cell and depolarize it,

356
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:15,450
but they don't like current to go 
out of the cell,

357
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,320
in fact, there's an 
intracellular polyamine block

358
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,400
at positive membrane potentials.

359
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:26,360
In addition, GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors 
are permeable to calcium,

360
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,932
and so have interesting signaling roles.

361
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,871
And so whereas most AMPA receptors

362
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:36,412
are composed of combinations of 
GluA2 with GluA1

363
00:21:36,412 --> 00:21:39,103
or GluA3 heteromers,

364
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:42,205
there are some 
which don't contain the GluA2,

365
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:47,503
and are simply GluA1 or 3, 
for example,

366
00:21:47,503 --> 00:21:50,076
as a subunit they lack the GluA2

367
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,499
and then they have these interesting 
voltage dependencies

368
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,862
that again, depend upon 
intracellular components

369
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,746
like polyamines 
that block the ion channel

370
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:02,163
from the inside.

371
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:05,913
So there's some diversity 
in the AMPA receptors

372
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,752
and this is then further regulated

373
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,620
and involved in different types 
of synaptic plasticity

374
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,960
and other signaling features.

375
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,554
In addition to AMPA receptors,

376
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:24,167
there are also Kainate receptors 
that bear some resemblance

377
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:28,210
to the AMPA receptors, but they have 
a much less defined function.

378
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,479
And there are five genes

379
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:32,851
that are encoded by 
the so-called kainate receptor family--

380
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,251
glutamate receptor ionotropic kainate 1-5,

381
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:43,030
GluK1-5, they used to be labeled 
GluR5-7; KA1, 2.

382
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,886
They are ionotropic ligand-gated 
glutamate receptors

383
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:51,981
just like the AMPA receptors 
to which they're more similar

384
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:54,258
compared to, at least, 
the NMDA receptors.

385
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,699
They seem to have smaller currents,

386
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:58,013
they seem to be slower,

387
00:22:58,013 --> 00:23:02,834
in some cases, they may also be located 
on presynaptic specializations

388
00:23:02,834 --> 00:23:04,478
rather than postsynaptically,

389
00:23:04,478 --> 00:23:07,365
but on the whole, 
much less is known

390
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,967
about the function 
of the kainate receptors.

391
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,750
The NMDA receptors 
form the other major family

392
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,485
of ligand-gated glutamate receptors,

393
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:21,662
and they're composed 
of seven different genes.

394
00:23:21,952 --> 00:23:27,333
There's the grin1 gene, grin2A-D, 
and grin3A, and B.

395
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,900
And what's important 
about the NMDA receptors

396
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,909
is that the NR1 subunit, 
the GluN1 subunit,

397
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,507
is absolutely required for function.

398
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:42,556
So all NMDA receptors are thought 
to have the GluN1 subunit

399
00:23:42,556 --> 00:23:47,608
as part of the four subunits.

400
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:53,058
So one of these will be 
the NR1 subunit, at least.

401
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:56,481
This will then combine 
with other subunits,

402
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,656
and the most common combination

403
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:01,986
is with NR1 with 2A

404
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:06,026
or NR1 with 2B.

405
00:24:06,026 --> 00:24:08,648
And that's most of the 
glutamate receptors

406
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,712
in the mammalian brain 
are encoded

407
00:24:10,712 --> 00:24:15,051
by either the NR1 2A 
or the NR1 2B.

408
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:19,800
Both of these combinations 
are very strongly blocked by magnesium

409
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,086
as we've already seen, 
they have an almost complete block

410
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,240
at, let's say, at around -80 mV,

411
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,655
the NMDA receptor's completely blocked 
by the presence of magnesium.

412
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:35,120
However, two other subunits, 
the 2C and the 2D,

413
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,640
have a much weaker block

414
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,537
with respect to magnesium.

415
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:43,473
And so in comparison, 
they would have something this,

416
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:47,810
where there's a substantial amount 
of unblocked NMDA receptor current

417
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,647
even at these very hyperpolarized 
membrane potentials.

418
00:24:52,097 --> 00:24:54,730
So there's differences in the degree 
of magnesium block

419
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,421
comparing across the different subunits 
of the NMDA receptor.

420
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:03,710
Weâ€™ve also discussed the 
very long time constants

421
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,035
where in response to a 
1 ms pulse of glutamate,

422
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:13,028
the 2A subunit might have a time course 
of something like 100 ms,

423
00:25:13,028 --> 00:25:17,970
whereas the slowest of the subunits 
might have times of around 1 s

424
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:20,160
for it's sort of half decay time,

425
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,161
and the 2B and 2C are somewhere 
in the middle.

426
00:25:23,161 --> 00:25:27,920
And so the time constants 
of the conductance activated by glutamate

427
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,190
is extremely different comparing across 
these different subunit combinations.

428
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,447
And so you can get 
a great deal of diversity

429
00:25:34,447 --> 00:25:38,094
in NMDA receptor function 
by having different combinations

430
00:25:38,094 --> 00:25:42,531
of these different NMDA receptor subunits
present at the synapse,

431
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:45,400
and indeed different cells 
and different synapses

432
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,614
have very different features.

433
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:52,760
Finally the GluN3, 
subunits A and B,

434
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,035
have less known functions, 
but might function presynaptically

435
00:25:57,035 --> 00:26:00,629
or play other roles in signaling 
and synaptic plasticity.

436
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:05,287
Finally, of course, 
all though we're primarily interested

437
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:09,107
in the fastest forms of communication

438
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:13,280
between neurons mediated by 
the ionotropic glutamate receptors

439
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,221
that generate postsynaptic potentials 
on the millisecond time scale,

440
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:20,739
we mustn't forget about 
the metabotropic glutamate receptors.

441
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:23,250
These are 7 transmembrane receptors,

442
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,449
they couple through G-proteins,

443
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,720
activate downstream 
signaling pathways,

444
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,219
like phospholipase C
or they inhibit adenylate cyclase,

445
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,020
they affect calcium signaling.

446
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,989
They probably have multiple, 
diverse roles,

447
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:38,304
that are yet to be fully explored.

448
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:42,180
And there's eight genes that encode 
these metabotropic glutamate receptors

449
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,723
and these are likely to have 
slower signaling functions

450
00:26:45,723 --> 00:26:48,263
than the ionotropic glutamate receptors

451
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:50,605
that are working on 
the millisecond time scale.

452
00:26:51,405 --> 00:26:54,456
So the take home message 
from today's lesson,

453
00:26:54,456 --> 00:26:59,424
is that there are two major subtypes 
of ionotropic glutamate receptors.

454
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:01,557
There are the AMPA receptors,

455
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:05,101
that are responsible 
for the millisecond activation

456
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:08,126
of a synaptic conductance 
in response to glutamate,

457
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,035
and there are the NMDA receptors,

458
00:27:10,035 --> 00:27:12,363
that are working on 
the tens of milliseconds

459
00:27:12,363 --> 00:27:14,674
or hundreds of milliseconds time scale.

460
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,677
They're activated more slowly,

461
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:18,941
they last for hundreds of milliseconds,

462
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:24,152
long outlasting that pulse of glutamate 
from the presynaptic specialization.

463
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:28,245
The conductances that are opened,

464
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:32,196
are both excitatory for AMPA 
and NMDA receptors,

465
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:34,387
they reverse at 0 mV,

466
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:38,164
the AMPA conductance being permeable 
to sodium and potassium,

467
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:42,992
and the NMDA conductance, in addition, 
allowing calcium entry

468
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,322
into the postsynaptic specialization,

469
00:27:45,322 --> 00:27:47,982
where it'll turn out 
it has an important role

470
00:27:47,982 --> 00:27:50,604
in controlling synaptic plasticity.

471
00:27:52,434 --> 00:27:57,956
In addition, the NMDA receptor 
has a very important dependence

472
00:27:57,956 --> 00:28:01,114
upon the postsynaptic membrane potential.

473
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:04,604
At negative potentials, 
the extracellular magnesium

474
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:08,852
enters inside the pore 
of the NMDA receptor and blocks it,

475
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:12,770
making the other ions 
impossible for them to permeate.

476
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:17,089
And so through this 
voltage-dependent magnesium block,

477
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:19,127
the NMDA receptor is both sensitive

478
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:21,743
to the state of the postsynaptic cell,

479
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:26,562
it needs to be depolarized 
in order to unblock the magnesium,

480
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:29,978
and it, of course, 
also needs to have glutamate

481
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:31,965
release from it's presynaptic terminal.

482
00:28:31,965 --> 00:28:35,489
So the NMDA receptor 
has an interesting coincidence role,

483
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:38,977
where it's both sensitive 
to the activity of the presynaptic cell,

484
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:42,852
as well as a postsynaptic cell 
in which it's embedded.

485
00:28:42,852 --> 00:28:47,175
And we're going to learn more about the 
importance of that coincidence detection

486
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:51,057
as we consider synaptic plasticity 
in the next lesson.
