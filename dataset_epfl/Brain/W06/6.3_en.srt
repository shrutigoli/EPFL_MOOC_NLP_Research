1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,051
Our first step towards a causal
and mechanistic understanding

2
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,064
of how brain function drives behavior

3
00:00:12,064 --> 00:00:15,998
is to measure neuronal activity
at high resolution,

4
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:19,396
and to correlate that with
the ongoing behavior of the animal.

5
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:24,011
In this video, we're going to see
how imaging approaches are useful

6
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:28,074
at defining the spatial-temporal
dynamics of brain function.

7
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:33,151
Optical imaging approaches
turn out to be particularly useful

8
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,623
for high-resolution imaging

9
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:38,850
of what's going on
in the brain during behavior.

10
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:44,116
In this video we'll explore two different
fluorescence imaging approaches,

11
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:47,241
one which gives large fields of view,

12
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:49,671
and can define neuronal activity

13
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:53,668
at the level of hundreds of microns,
at millisecond temporal resolution,

14
00:00:53,668 --> 00:00:57,787
and another one where we can zoom in
and look at higher resolution,

15
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:02,185
seeing individual nerve cells
with micron and submicron resolution,

16
00:01:02,185 --> 00:01:04,307
but with smaller fields of view.

17
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:07,198
Over the past weeks,
we've discussed how the brain

18
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:10,453
is largely an electrical signaling device.

19
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,845
And so if we want
to image neuronal function,

20
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:18,762
a good starting point is to think about
how we might image membrane potential.

21
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:24,752
Scientists have worked towards developing
voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes

22
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:29,315
for many years, and some of these
have become very important and useful.

23
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:34,644
The voltage-sensitive dye
is typically a lipophilic compound

24
00:01:34,644 --> 00:01:39,127
that can be added either to the inside,
or outside of neurons.

25
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:42,714
It inserts into
the lipophilic cell membrane,

26
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:44,590
it's a fluorescent molecule,

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,089
and so we can put in, say,
blue photons to excite,

28
00:01:48,089 --> 00:01:51,188
and longer wavelength, say green photons,

29
00:01:51,188 --> 00:01:55,348
are emitted in a standard
fluorescence process.

30
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:58,599
For a voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye,

31
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,184
the fluorescence depends
upon the membrane potential.

32
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:05,795
So the electric field,
across the plasma membrane,

33
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:09,001
drives the so-called
electrochromic effect,

34
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,758
and the fluorescence then depends
upon membrane potential.

35
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,961
And for a typical voltage-sensitive dye,

36
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:20,020
the fluorescence is linearly correlated
with membrane potential.

37
00:02:20,313 --> 00:02:25,220
Many fluorescent dyes are responsive
to membrane potential

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,565
on the microsecond timescale,
and so the changes in fluorescence

39
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:33,650
correlate exactly with the change
in membrane potential

40
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,581
at the timescale of neuronal activity.

41
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:40,807
Here's an example
of voltage-sensitive dye imaging

42
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:46,071
from an individual neuron,
located in a brain slice in vitro.

43
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:51,055
The neuron has been filled with
voltage-sensitive dye from the inside,

44
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:55,119
so this dye is now sitting on
the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.

45
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,689
You see the soma.

46
00:02:56,689 --> 00:03:00,627
You probably also see some of
the finer processes, the dendrites,

47
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:02,463
that emerge from the soma.

48
00:03:03,273 --> 00:03:06,003
At the same time that
we're imaging this neuron,

49
00:03:06,003 --> 00:03:08,004
we also have an electrode here

50
00:03:08,004 --> 00:03:11,407
that's recording
the membrane potential of that cell.

51
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:13,387
And through the patch-clamp electrode

52
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:17,453
we can also change the membrane potential
by injecting different currents.

53
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:21,772
And so initially here we can
hyperpolarize the membrane potential,

54
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:23,829
we can depolarize the membrane potential,

55
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,568
and by injecting a bit more current,
we can fire an action potential.

56
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:31,014
And so that's our standard
membrane potential measuring technique

57
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:33,471
that we've been looking at
over the last weeks.

58
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:37,142
Now we've also got
the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye

59
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,544
where we can measure
the fluorescence from this neuron

60
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:42,535
at the same time that we measure
the membrane potential.

61
00:03:42,535 --> 00:03:46,274
And you can see that as we hyperpolarize
a cell, the fluorescence decreases,

62
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:49,509
as we depolarize a cell,
the fluorescence increases again,

63
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:51,856
and as we fire
an action potential in that cell,

64
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,564
we also see a rapid transient
in the fluorescence

65
00:03:55,564 --> 00:03:57,408
of the voltage-sensitive dye.

66
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:01,651
So here you can see an optical method
for measuring membrane potential

67
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:04,872
in individual nerve cells
in a brain slice.

68
00:04:05,928 --> 00:04:09,863
The voltage-sensitive dye is noisy,
the signals are small,

69
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:14,184
and so far it's not been possible
to make these measurements

70
00:04:14,184 --> 00:04:17,864
inside the living animal in vivo.

71
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,358
However, the voltage-sensitive dye
imaging technique has been applied

72
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:25,025
at the level of populations of neurons,

73
00:04:25,025 --> 00:04:29,115
where we can stain many neurons
from the outside,

74
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:32,531
by applying the voltage-sensitive dye
from the top of the brain,

75
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:36,502
allowing it to diffuse inside the brain

76
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:39,806
simply through the extracellular spaces,
the surface of the brain.

77
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:43,091
We have to remove the bone,
we apply the dye to the surface,

78
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:48,728
it diffuses in, and maybe it diffuses
in the top half of the neocortex,

79
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:51,064
so this is the full extent
of the neocortex here,

80
00:04:51,064 --> 00:04:55,463
visualized with DAPI to see where
the cell bodies are, where the DNA is,

81
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,524
of the nuclei of different cells,

82
00:04:57,524 --> 00:05:02,310
and the voltage-sensitive dye
stains roughly the upper half,

83
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,035
500 microns or so,
of the surface of the neocortex.

84
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,825
If we now look from the top of the brain

85
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,822
and image this fluorescence
in a living animal,

86
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:18,410
and we apply a sensory stimulation
like, for example, a whisker deflection,

87
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,638
that then drives a depolarizing
sensory response

88
00:05:22,638 --> 00:05:24,139
in the somatosensory cortex.

89
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,400
We can measure that with
a membrane potential recording,

90
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,012
so we can measure
the membrane potential from a cell.

91
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:34,106
We deflect the whisker, that causes
a depolarization in the neuron,

92
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:37,219
and if simultaneously
we measure the fluorescence

93
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:38,411
from this area of the brain,

94
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:42,644
we see that there's a very similar
time course to the fluorescent changes,

95
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:45,566
and we can again plot linear fluorescence,

96
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:48,106
versus membrane potential traces,

97
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,845
for the in vivo situation.

98
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:55,494
So here we have an optical method
for measuring membrane potential

99
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:59,781
from neuronal populations
at the millisecond timescale,

100
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,110
and this then allows us to examine
the spatial-temporal dynamics

101
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,989
of cortical function in living animals.

102
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:09,205
And so the experiment that
I'd like to show you is one in which

103
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:13,601
we've opened up craniotomies
across a relatively large part

104
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:18,072
of the dorsal surface of the mouse brain,
that's what you see here.

105
00:06:18,072 --> 00:06:19,591
This is a craniotomy,

106
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:22,545
we put voltage-sensitive dye
on top of the brain,

107
00:06:22,545 --> 00:06:25,455
that then causes it to be fluorescent,
and what you see here

108
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:28,531
is the fluorescence from the left
and the right hemispheres

109
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:30,225
of the mouse brain.

110
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:35,643
In the movie that we're going to see
in a second, we deflect the whisker,

111
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,628
that then causes a signaling pathway to be
activated through the trigeminal nerve.

112
00:06:40,628 --> 00:06:43,745
So we give a one millisecond
deflection of the whisker,

113
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:49,262
we get a one millisecond volley of action
potentials down the trigeminal nerve,

114
00:06:49,262 --> 00:06:51,607
glutamate was released in the brainstem,

115
00:06:51,607 --> 00:06:56,160
activates postsynaptic neurons that again
fire a brief volley of action potentials

116
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,088
that are then transmitted to the thalamus.

117
00:06:58,088 --> 00:07:03,129
Again, glutamatergic synaptic transmission
takes place, and that then brings

118
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,963
the sensory information to the neocortex,

119
00:07:04,963 --> 00:07:09,568
where we have a tight localization here
of the C2 whisker

120
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:12,317
to a small, localized region

121
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:16,095
of the primary somatosensory
cortex, the S1.

122
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:20,404
And what we'll see in the movie
is that the information

123
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:22,934
doesn't remain localized
to this area of the brain,

124
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:26,009
but rather spreads
over quite a large area,

125
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,150
activating the nearby
somatosensory cortex,

126
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,083
and also the motor cortex area
of the mouse brain.

127
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:36,216
So let's have a look at the movie.

128
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:37,597
So the stimulus is given.

129
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:40,765
A few milliseconds later,
we get a localized hot spot.

130
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:43,310
It spreads across the primary
somatosensory cortex,

131
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,471
and then activates this frontal area
of the motor cortex.

132
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,411
And at one level,
the spread of sensory information

133
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:56,830
from that highly localized initiation site
makes good sense,

134
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:01,285
in terms of thinking about how an animal
would be exploring its environment.

135
00:08:01,285 --> 00:08:04,012
It has many whiskers,
and the way that it'll detect

136
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,591
the size and shape of an object

137
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:09,048
is by comparing the sensory information

138
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,526
coming from the different whiskers
contacting that object.

139
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:13,701
And so it's essential
that sensory information

140
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,238
spreads from one whisker
representation to its neighbor's.

141
00:08:17,238 --> 00:08:20,993
And so that also explains
the local spread of information

142
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:23,706
across primary somatosensory cortex.

143
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:28,568
It also makes sense that the information
spreads to the motor cortex.

144
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:33,565
We expect our movements to be informed
by ongoing sensory input.

145
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,258
And so what we have here then,
is a visualization

146
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:39,851
of a sensory motor loop,
where sensory information comes in,

147
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:43,237
it gets processed, and then
passed on to the motor cortex

148
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:47,408
to drive the next steps
of the behavior of the animal.

149
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:51,274
Now, there's a highly organized
somatotopic map.

150
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,847
In the primary somatosensory cortex
that we've already considered

151
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:57,720
the layout of the whiskers
is precisely mirrored

152
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,517
by the layout of
the so-called barrel columns

153
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:04,073
in the primary somatosensory cortex.

154
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:06,727
So the C2 whisker representation

155
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,825
is mapped onto the C2 barrel column,

156
00:09:09,825 --> 00:09:13,598
and the E2 whisker,
that's located here,

157
00:09:13,598 --> 00:09:18,067
maps onto the E2
barrel column representation

158
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,059
and primary somatosensory cortex.

159
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:24,354
And so by stimulating different whiskers
on the snout of the animal,

160
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:28,171
we'd also expect that the initial
localization of the sensory response

161
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:31,346
should also move around
in a somatotopic manner

162
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:33,163
on the surface of the cortex.

163
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:36,542
And that's exactly what we can see
with voltage-sensitive dyes.

164
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,208
Here on the left,
we deflect the C2 whisker,

165
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,747
we get an early,
localized sensory response,

166
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,663
some ten milliseconds
after whisker deflection.

167
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,848
If instead we deflect the E2 whisker,

168
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:52,684
we see that these also
are localized sensory reponse,

169
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:56,036
but it's moved, relative to
the C2 whisker representation.

170
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:59,628
It's moved by roughly 1 mm
on the surface of the brain.

171
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,551
Of course there's a spread
of the sensory information

172
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:06,593
within the next milliseconds
after the initiation.

173
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:10,259
That's what we saw in the video,
and we also see the activation

174
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,610
of this frontal area,
the whisker motor cortex.

175
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,411
Interestingly, there's also
a sensory map here

176
00:10:17,411 --> 00:10:19,652
in this frontal motor cortex area,

177
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,453
so when we stimulate the C2 whisker,

178
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:23,474
we activate one epicenter,

179
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:27,753
and the E2 has a slightly shifted
representation of its whisker.

180
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:31,957
So there's an interesting change
in both the map in sensory cortex,

181
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:35,226
and also the sensory map in motor cortex.

182
00:10:35,226 --> 00:10:37,765
And we can stimulate different whiskers,
and you can see that

183
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:42,716
there's a large gap between different
whisker representations in S1.

184
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,803
And if we move to motor cortex,
these different whiskers

185
00:10:45,803 --> 00:10:49,098
are represented
in a highly compressed map.

186
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,141
And in addition there seems
to be mirror symmetry,

187
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:56,274
where the E2 whisker is represented
close to the line of symmetry,

188
00:10:56,274 --> 00:10:59,644
and the A2 whisker
is relatively far apart.

189
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:02,867
And so we can begin
to build up functional maps

190
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:07,322
of both sensory and motor areas
of the mouse neocortex

191
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:10,321
by using voltage-sensitive dye imaging

192
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,299
in vivo, in awake behaving animals.

193
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:17,706
Now, we would also like
to be able to zoom in

194
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:22,257
and look at higher resolution,
at this particular area here of the brain,

195
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:26,670
and study in more detail what's happening
with cells, neurons, and synapses.

196
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,478
And in order to do
high-resolution optical imaging,

197
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:35,162
we need to face one further major problem
with imaging in the brain,

198
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:38,636
and that is that the brain
is a highly scattering medium.

199
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:43,181
And so if we imagine
our normal microscope optics,

200
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,750
where we have a microscope objective

201
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:48,675
and we send blue light, say,

202
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:52,822
into a non-scattering medium,
we can focus that light

203
00:11:52,822 --> 00:11:56,009
down to a small spot, here,
a diffraction-limited spot

204
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,178
that depends upon wavelength
and numerical aperture of the optics.

205
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:04,407
And the reason we can do that
is because the photons go through,

206
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,535
more or less, without scattering
through this medium,

207
00:12:07,535 --> 00:12:10,991
and so we can send in photons,
all of which will intersect

208
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:15,014
at the focal point of the microscope.

209
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,259
And that we can then use
for exciting fluorescence

210
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,489
at one nice localization spot
in the sample.

211
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,821
Now, the brain turns out
to be highly scattering,

212
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:29,407
and so if we send
blue light into the brain,

213
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:34,752
then within a distance
on average of around 50 micrometers

214
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:37,593
that blue light will get scattered,
it will get deflected

215
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:40,753
in a multitude of different directions,

216
00:12:40,753 --> 00:12:44,981
and it'll then become impossible
to focus a light down to a small spot,

217
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:48,692
which is required in order
to achieve high-resolution imaging.

218
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:54,634
And so scattering is a major problem,
in terms of imaging, in the brain.

219
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:56,374
And if you want to image anything

220
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:59,401
more than 50 micrometers
from the surface of the brain,

221
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,790
then it's extremely difficult to do it

222
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:05,753
with standard one-photon
excitation of fluorescence.

223
00:13:06,142 --> 00:13:11,052
The situation's a little bit better
if you use longer wave-length light.

224
00:13:11,052 --> 00:13:16,480
And so if here we might
have been using 450 nm blue light,

225
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,761
we can instead use much longer
wavelength of light,

226
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,457
maybe 900 nm in the near infrared.

227
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:29,624
And at these longer wavelengths,
the brain scatters much less,

228
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:32,546
and it then becomes possible
to focus a light

229
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,614
at least better than it is
for the short wavelength light,

230
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:41,132
and so for infrared light of around 900 nm
we have a mean path length

231
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:45,270
of something like 300 microns,
and that allows us then to look

232
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:48,050
at least into the upper layers
of the neocortex

233
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,820
with higher resolution than with

234
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,810
the short wavelength blue light.

235
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,360
We have one further major problem

236
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,983
in terms of imaging densely labeled
fluorescing structures in the brain,

237
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:06,425
and that's because of the way that
single-photon excitation typically works.

238
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:10,785
And so in standard
fluorescence microscopy,

239
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:15,001
we send in one high energy photon,

240
00:14:15,001 --> 00:14:18,265
say 450 nm blue light,

241
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:23,043
that is used to excite the fluorophore,
so this is a Jablonski-state diagram.

242
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:26,726
We have the ground state,
we have an excited state,

243
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:30,219
and we have the initial excitation state,

244
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:32,498
after absorption of the blue photon.

245
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,386
There's then some rotational energy
that's given off.

246
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:37,917
It settles into an excited state.

247
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,099
It remains there for some nanoseconds,

248
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:43,761
and then emits
the green fluorescent photon.

249
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:47,746
And if we now imagine having a cuvette

250
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:51,557
filled with a fluorescent dye
in the solution,

251
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:56,517
and we put blue light in, again,
through our objective, we focus it in.

252
00:14:56,517 --> 00:15:00,287
Now, it's a non-scattering medium,
so we focus a blue light in

253
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:05,084
and the blue light then traverses
this fluorescing medium.

254
00:15:05,191 --> 00:15:08,421
And of course the density
of photons is low here,

255
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,791
and it gets much higher around here.

256
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:15,133
And so the amount of fluorescence
in single-photon excitation

257
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:19,905
is directly proportional
to the photon density.

258
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,829
And so as we concentrate the photons here,

259
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,022
we of course get more fluorescence here,

260
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:28,902
emitted from the middle,
where we have a high photon density,

261
00:15:28,902 --> 00:15:32,425
but the number of photons
up here is quite considerable,

262
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:36,185
and indeed every photon
that ends up here, at the focal point,

263
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,030
had to come through this cone of light.

264
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,325
And so the total number of photons
that are being absorbed

265
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:45,538
and creating fluorescence here
is just as high as it is here,

266
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:48,280
it's just that here
it's spread over a large area,

267
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,484
and here it's highly concentrated.

268
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,937
And so you can imagine
that if we're trying to image

269
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,462
into a densely fluorescent sample,

270
00:15:56,462 --> 00:16:00,071
the amount of fluorescence
that comes from here

271
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:03,474
will be, in fact, just as large
as the amount of fluorescence

272
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:05,536
from the focal point, here.

273
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:08,140
And so in densely labeled structures

274
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,470
it's impossible to get
high-resolution imaging

275
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,313
with single-photon excitation,
because each photon is equally able

276
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:20,073
to produce fluorescence
in a single-photon excitation mode,

277
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:22,221
and so the low density of photons here

278
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:26,777
will create a lot of out-of-focus
light, fluorescence.

279
00:16:28,274 --> 00:16:32,312
Two-photon excitation avoids
many of these problems,

280
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,179
by using a non-linear optical technique.

281
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:41,732
In order to excite the fluorophore,
instead of taking one high-energy photon,

282
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,291
as we do in single-photon excitation,

283
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,312
we instead take two low-energy photons.

284
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,577
And so we might, for example,
have two 900 nm photons

285
00:16:52,577 --> 00:16:54,255
that are absorbed,

286
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:59,648
their energy here would be
equivalent to the 450 nm light,

287
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:01,434
in the single-photon case.

288
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:06,535
These two photons need to be absorbed
nearly simultaneously.

289
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:11,315
We go through a virtual state,
here, in the Jablonski diagram.

290
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:15,994
That virtual state has a lifetime
of less than one femtosecond,

291
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:20,678
so basically these two photons
need to be grabbed simultaneously.

292
00:17:20,678 --> 00:17:24,230
That excites the fluorophore,
and again we get the emission

293
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,901
of our standard green fluorescence.

294
00:17:27,726 --> 00:17:32,520
Now, the first advantage
with two-photon excitation, then,

295
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:37,761
is that we're using longer wavelength
photons to excite our fluorophores.

296
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:41,625
And we already just mentioned that there's
less scattering of long-wavelength light,

297
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:46,367
and so it's easier to focus the light
into the scattering medium of the brain.

298
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:49,027
So that's one advantage
of two-photon excitation,

299
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:53,093
is that we start off with
low-energy photons of long wavelength.

300
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:56,387
But the real advantage
of two-photon microscopy

301
00:17:56,387 --> 00:18:00,751
comes in the squaring of
the photon density that's required

302
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,457
to generate the two-photon excitation.

303
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:07,991
So because we need to absorb
two photons near simultaneously,

304
00:18:07,991 --> 00:18:12,310
it turns out that the probability
of generating this two-photon excitation

305
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:16,309
depends upon the square
of the photon density.

306
00:18:16,466 --> 00:18:18,765
It's like multiplying probabilities.

307
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:22,443
The probability of grabbing one photon
depends upon the photon density,

308
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,755
and grabbing two simultaneously

309
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:28,181
will then be the square
of the photon density.

310
00:18:28,468 --> 00:18:33,406
And what that means, in terms
of looking at the emitted excitation,

311
00:18:33,818 --> 00:18:38,039
the fluorescence light under
the two-photon excitation,

312
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,363
is that these areas, here,
that have low photon density,

313
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:45,206
will basically generate no fluorescence,

314
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:50,266
whereas the high photon density
that we get from the focal spot

315
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,465
generates an intense fluorescence.

316
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:57,441
And so we limit the excitation
to a small focal volume

317
00:18:57,441 --> 00:18:59,729
in the two-photon excitation mode.

318
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:03,856
And we then do not have
any out-of-focus fluorescence,

319
00:19:03,856 --> 00:19:09,179
and all the emitted photons
then come from this excitation volume

320
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,863
through two-photon excitation.

321
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:16,199
We can then use this small volume,

322
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:20,118
that gets excited
by the two-photon excitation,

323
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:23,001
to image what's going on in the brain.

324
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:27,044
Now, we only have a small volume
that's getting excited,

325
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:29,669
and so if you now imagine
that this is being focused

326
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,286
into some volume of brain tissue,
we have a small volume

327
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:39,432
that gets excited by our two-photon
excitation beam that we focus in here,

328
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:43,274
and we can then measure
the emitted photons from that,

329
00:19:43,274 --> 00:19:46,611
and the way that we can turn that
into an image is then

330
00:19:46,611 --> 00:19:51,888
by moving this excitation volume
around an X, Y and Z,

331
00:19:51,888 --> 00:19:53,962
and we do that through
different scanning mirrors,

332
00:19:53,962 --> 00:19:58,316
where we can move the beam
in the focal plane here.

333
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:01,613
So we move our focal volume
around inside the sample,

334
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:06,342
and at the same time, where we know
where we're putting that beam,

335
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:09,503
because we drive the scan mirrors,
we can then simultaneously

336
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:12,782
collect the emitted photons
on a photomultiplier tube,

337
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:16,195
we correlate the position of
the X-Y scan mirrors

338
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:19,098
with the amount of fluorescence
that's being detected,

339
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:23,571
and then we then move that focal volume,
scanning it across the focal plane,

340
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:28,468
in X, Y and if we want we can also
change the focal distance,

341
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:31,347
and then we can build up
three-dimensional volumes

342
00:20:31,347 --> 00:20:35,070
of what we're imaging inside the brain.

343
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:41,647
Remarkably, two-photon microscopy
works well in the intact living animal.

344
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:46,238
You can replace the bone
with glass cover slips,

345
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:48,002
making cranial windows,

346
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:51,036
that can remain stable and clear
for months at a time.

347
00:20:51,036 --> 00:20:56,321
So you can keep imaging the brain
of the mouse over long periods of time,

348
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,655
and you can focus your beam down

349
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,890
on individual small structures,
like dendrites.

350
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,457
And here's one example of a dendrite
labeled with green fluorescent protein,

351
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:10,139
imaged in the somatosensory cortex
of a living mouse.

352
00:21:10,341 --> 00:21:13,163
The scale here would be 
roughly one micron,

353
00:21:13,163 --> 00:21:15,985
and here's the dendrite,

354
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,809
and sticking out from that dendrite
are these dendritic spines

355
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,325
that we've already discussed,

356
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:25,069
the sites of where glutamatergic
synaptic input arrives on this dendrite.

357
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,962
So we can study,
at the level of dendrites, spines,

358
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:33,553
the structure of the nervous system
in a living animal.

359
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:36,153
And one of the remarkable observations

360
00:21:36,153 --> 00:21:39,083
that Karel Svoboda
and his collaborators made

361
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:42,618
is that the structure of the brain
isn't completely stable.

362
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:47,156
At the fine-scale level
of individual spines,

363
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,684
it turns out that they come and go,

364
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:53,333
and that also depends upon
the experience of the animal.

365
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:58,056
And so on Day Zero, there might,
for example be two spines

366
00:21:58,686 --> 00:22:00,564
on the dendrite that you're looking at.

367
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:05,140
On the next day,
they might still be there,

368
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:08,276
indicating some form of stability.

369
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:11,914
Then on another day
one of them might disappear,

370
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:15,302
and the other one might stay.

371
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:19,671
And on yet another day, there might be
the appearance of a new spine.

372
00:22:20,544 --> 00:22:23,882
And so one can then measure
the change in spines,

373
00:22:23,882 --> 00:22:26,457
and one can then infer
that there has been changes

374
00:22:26,457 --> 00:22:30,364
in the synaptic wiring diagram
of the brain,

375
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,776
so that some of the inputs to the cell

376
00:22:32,776 --> 00:22:36,528
remain stable for a couple of days,
and then disappear.

377
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:40,361
Others will remain stable
throughout the lifetime of an animal,

378
00:22:40,361 --> 00:22:45,489
and others, new spines
will be made during, perhaps

379
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,413
interesting learning experiences
that the animal has had.

380
00:22:50,185 --> 00:22:53,242
Imaging the structure
of the nervous system

381
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,179
is, of course, extremely interesting.

382
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,639
But even more interesting is to image
the neuronal activity

383
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:04,581
of these cells, and synapses
at high temporal resolution.

384
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:09,487
And one way in which this can be done
is by using calcium imaging.

385
00:23:09,487 --> 00:23:15,078
And so calcium turns out to be
a relatively good thing to study.

386
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:19,187
It's relatively easy to make
calcium-binding molecules

387
00:23:19,187 --> 00:23:20,789
that change their fluorescence,

388
00:23:20,789 --> 00:23:26,629
and Roger Tsien initially developed
small-molecule calcium-fluorescent sensors

389
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:31,232
that would change their fluorescence
depending on calcium concentration.

390
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:33,700
So if this is the calcium concentration,

391
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:36,802
the cytosolic calcium
concentration on the X axis,

392
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:39,232
the fluorescence of an indicator
on the Y axis,

393
00:23:39,232 --> 00:23:43,080
the fluorescence will change,
of these calcium-sensitive dyes,

394
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,407
and you can make them, so it's in
the useful physiological range,

395
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:50,260
where the dye might be relatively

396
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,852
weakly fluorescent,
at resting calcium levels,

397
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:54,603
at around 100 nanomolar,

398
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:58,573
and then might be strongly
fluorescent at one micromolar,

399
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:01,772
which would be a sort of
a typical calcium concentration

400
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:05,003
that might be reached
during neuronal signaling.

401
00:24:05,937 --> 00:24:10,496
So calcium-sensitive dyes have been made
that are both small organic molecules,

402
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,760
and Roger Tsien also designed the first
genetically-encoded proteins

403
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,272
that were calcium-sensitive,
so you can put them inside animals

404
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:23,602
and let those animals live with
the calcium-sensitive fluorescent protein,

405
00:24:23,602 --> 00:24:25,520
and you can then study the dynamics

406
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,892
of these fluorescent calcium
indicators over days,

407
00:24:29,892 --> 00:24:34,176
looking at how neurons,
spines and synapses are behaving.

408
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:37,305
And the interest, of course,
in imaging calcium,

409
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,570
is that calcium is highly dynamic,

410
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,133
and it is a strong regulator
of neuronal activity.

411
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:45,893
We already saw that calcium rises

412
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:49,490
are what drives exocytosis
in the presynaptic terminal,

413
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,394
so neural transmitter release.

414
00:24:51,394 --> 00:24:56,595
Postsynaptically, they're responsible
for driving synaptic plasticity,

415
00:24:57,068 --> 00:25:00,194
and it turns out that
for every action potential,

416
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,265
there's an increase in
the cytosolic calcium concentration

417
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:06,931
that's present both in axons, dendrites
and also in the soma.

418
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:10,642
And the reason, of course, is that
there are voltage-gated calcium channels

419
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,270
present on all the neuronal membranes.

420
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:16,174
And so during the action potential,

421
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:22,025
there's a strong depolarization,
beyond -40 mV,

422
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:24,926
that activates voltage-gated
calcium channels,

423
00:25:24,926 --> 00:25:31,006
and during that action potential,
calcium then floods into the nerve cell,

424
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:36,342
both in the synaptic axons,
but also in the cell bodies.

425
00:25:36,342 --> 00:25:38,595
And so whenever there's a spike in a cell,

426
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:43,275
there's also a cytosolic
calcium rise in those neurons.

427
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:47,074
And so by imaging calcium
you can then infer

428
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:50,199
when cells were firing action potentials,

429
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,021
and that's what
we're going to look at here.

430
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,764
In this movie here, we're looking
inside the neocortex,

431
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:59,743
the primary somatosensory neocortex
of an awake, behaving mouse.

432
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:03,423
The green that you see here
is fluorescence

433
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:06,421
from a genetically-encoded
calcium indicator

434
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:09,640
that's sitting in the cytosol of neurons.

435
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,510
And so here is one neuron,
and the cytosol,

436
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:16,285
this ring of green fluorescence,
surrounds the nucleus,

437
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:20,060
so the nucleus excludes
the fluorescent protein,

438
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,568
and it's just the cytosol that's labeled.

439
00:26:22,568 --> 00:26:25,308
You'll also see other
brightly labeled structures,

440
00:26:25,308 --> 00:26:28,441
and these are dendrites that
are coming out of the plane

441
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:30,525
of the imaging that we're looking at.

442
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:36,517
So the green fluorescence relates to
the calcium-indicator expression.

443
00:26:36,517 --> 00:26:39,386
Blue, in this image here, indicates

444
00:26:39,386 --> 00:26:43,792
genetically-defined populations
of GABAergic neurons,

445
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:48,258
and superimposed on this
we're going to have an orange color,

446
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:52,401
that indicates changes in the fluorescence
of the calcium indicator,

447
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:57,112
that then reveals the function
of these cells in real time.

448
00:26:57,235 --> 00:27:00,176
So here's the image of the brain,

449
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:04,792
and you'll see that cells are lighting up,
flashing, as they fire action potentials.

450
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:07,553
You'll also see that the activity
is relatively sparse,

451
00:27:07,553 --> 00:27:10,122
and that's typical of the neocortex,

452
00:27:10,122 --> 00:27:13,951
that only a few cells are active
at any given time.

453
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:16,235
And you'll also see
that processes are lighting up,

454
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,528
individual little dendrites
are lighting up,

455
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:20,907
and also, together with some of the soma,

456
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,495
you'll see the dendritic structure
of those cells also lighting up.

457
00:27:24,495 --> 00:27:28,332
So whenever there's an action potential
that back propagates into the dendrites,

458
00:27:28,332 --> 00:27:33,277
and you also see dendritic calcium signals
associated with action potential firing.

459
00:27:33,545 --> 00:27:38,410
Optical fluorescence imaging
of brain function is extremely powerful,

460
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,159
and it turns out that
fluorescent probes have been made

461
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,235
that are sensitive to a large number
of different cellular activities.

462
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:50,411
So we've seen voltage, and calcium
as things that drive

463
00:27:50,411 --> 00:27:53,533
change in fluorescence
in different fluorescent probes,

464
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:55,429
but there are other fluorescent probes

465
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,851
that indicate the role
of different second messengers,

466
00:27:57,851 --> 00:28:01,184
so there are probes that are sensitive
to cyclic AMP concentrations

467
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:03,754
that measure different
protein-protein interactions,

468
00:28:03,754 --> 00:28:07,059
pH sensors that measure
synaptic vesicle release,

469
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,619
and you can even bind fluorescent proteins
onto neurotransmitter receptors,

470
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:15,818
and begin studying the opening
and closing of individual ion channels

471
00:28:15,818 --> 00:28:18,231
through fluorescence imaging,

472
00:28:18,231 --> 00:28:22,375
and that's through both organic
and genetically encoded fluorophores.

473
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:27,317
With two-photon microscopy,
one can image cell bodies,

474
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:31,796
axons, boutons, dendrites, and spines
at high resolution.

475
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:34,630
And newer techniques
are even being developed

476
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,803
to get even closer to that
nanometer scale of resolution.

477
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:42,800
In particular, super-resolution
microscopy, or nanoscopy,

478
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,535
is an interesting direction
for future optical imaging in vivo.

479
00:28:48,034 --> 00:28:49,947
So in this movie,
we've seen that there are

480
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:54,998
two interesting approaches
to imaging the brain in action.

481
00:28:54,998 --> 00:28:59,466
There is a wide-field single-photon
epifluorescence approach,

482
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:03,123
where we can image the dorsal surface
of the neocortex of the brain,

483
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:07,918
and we can then get something
like 100-micron spatial resolution.

484
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:10,084
And if we're looking
with voltage-sensitive dyes,

485
00:29:10,084 --> 00:29:13,317
then we have millisecond
spatial-temporal resolution

486
00:29:13,317 --> 00:29:16,617
about the dynamics of activity
in the neocortex,

487
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:20,637
that we can then directly compare
to the behavior of the mouse.

488
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,437
We can also use two-photon microscopy,

489
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:27,269
through these non-linear
optical techniques,

490
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:30,180
that give us optical sectioning
deep in the brain,

491
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,705
get rid of the scattering of the light
and the out-of-focus fluorescence,

492
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:38,447
and then we can image with micrometer
and submicrometer resolution

493
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:39,925
the structure of the brain.

494
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:44,359
And if we put in different indicator
proteins or fluorescent molecules,

495
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:47,967
that change their fluorescence
depending upon activity,

496
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:50,581
we can then, for example,
measure calcium signals

497
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:53,089
in individual neuronal compartments,

498
00:29:53,089 --> 00:29:57,181
fulfilling that dream that we had
of measuring neuronal activity

499
00:29:57,181 --> 00:29:59,393
with cellular resolution,

500
00:29:59,393 --> 00:30:02,109
and also seeing the synaptic activity

501
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:05,924
that links the activity
of different neurons in the brain.

502
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,122
So in this video we've seen how
optical imaging can be extremely useful

503
00:30:11,122 --> 00:30:13,581
in terms of defining brain function.

504
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:16,534
It's of course also extremely limited.

505
00:30:16,534 --> 00:30:18,914
We can only look
at the surface of the brain,

506
00:30:18,914 --> 00:30:23,400
perhaps the top millimeter of the brain
can be explored through optical imaging,

507
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,306
and if we want to look deeper in the brain

508
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:29,768
then we have to become more invasive
with endoscopic techniques.
