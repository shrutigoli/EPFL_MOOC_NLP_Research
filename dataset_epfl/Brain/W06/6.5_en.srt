1
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:09,757
In the last two videos we've seen
that electrophysiological recordings,

2
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:11,858
and optical imaging techniques

3
00:00:11,858 --> 00:00:15,201
are extremely useful
in measuring neuronal activity

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,508
in an awake behaving mouse.

5
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:20,454
These measuring techniques allow us

6
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:23,436
to correlate neuronal activity
with behavior.

7
00:00:23,436 --> 00:00:26,033
But in order to get a causal argument

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,754
linking that neuronal activity
to a specific behavior,

9
00:00:29,754 --> 00:00:32,161
we need to be able
to manipulate those neurons,

10
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:34,077
we need to be able to stimulate them,

11
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:38,554
and inhibit them with high specificity
in terms of time and space

12
00:00:38,554 --> 00:00:42,172
and see how that impacts
the other network effects

13
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:44,383
and the behavior that we're interested in.

14
00:00:45,426 --> 00:00:48,854
Until recently,
to stimulate neuronal activity,

15
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:51,537
the best tool that
neuroscientists have had

16
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:55,559
is to put stimulation electrodes
into the brain,

17
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,331
and by driving brief current pulses
through those stimulation electrodes,

18
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:04,182
one could activate the neurons
close to that stimulation electrode.

19
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:09,349
However, axons of passage,
or neurons in connected brain areas,

20
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,099
would also be stimulated,

21
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:15,122
limiting the specificity
of electrical microstimulation.

22
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:19,008
On the other hand,
to inhibit neuronal activity,

23
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,445
neuroscientists have had
even poorer control.

24
00:01:22,445 --> 00:01:26,330
Typically they've lesioned brain areas
in animal models,

25
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,157
or they've injected pharmacological
agents, like tetrodotoxin,

26
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,108
to block action potential firing,

27
00:01:32,108 --> 00:01:36,778
or CNQX and APV, to block
glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

28
00:01:36,778 --> 00:01:41,624
These reagents certainly block activity
near to the injection site,

29
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:46,320
but they do so on long time scales,
typically involving many minutes,

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,115
and of course they don't have
any cellular specificity.

31
00:01:50,115 --> 00:01:52,157
They inhibit everything nearby,

32
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:55,869
and typically many different types
of neurons are intermingled.

33
00:01:55,869 --> 00:01:58,802
And so, again,
there's a lack of specificity.

34
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:03,782
Over the last decade, neuroscience
has gone through a revolution,

35
00:02:03,782 --> 00:02:09,711
allowing us to deal with causal
interventions in the mammalian brain

36
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:15,183
through genetically expressing actuators
that control neuronal activity.

37
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:18,996
And so that allows us
the specificity of mouse genetics

38
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:22,543
to decide which cells
we're stimulating or inhibiting,

39
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:27,464
and to have these actuators
under optical control.

40
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:30,661
And that means we can
point light at specific cells

41
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:34,096
that might express
our optogenetic actuator,

42
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,623
and then take control
of that cell, for example,

43
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,728
making it depolarize
and fire an action potential.

44
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:42,507
And we can then utilize
the specificity of light,

45
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:46,729
being able to turn light on and off
with millisecond temporal resolution,

46
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,705
and being able to point it
at specific parts of the brain

47
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:55,336
in order to take a highly specific control
of the mouse brain during behavior.

48
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,439
Let's see how that works.

49
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:03,349
The optogenetic revolution begins
with the cloning and identification

50
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,411
of light-activated cation channels,
and in particular

51
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:12,538
the identification of channelrhodopsin-2
as a light-activated cation channel

52
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:17,860
in this seminal paper here
from Nagel et al. in 2003

53
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:22,907
began the optogenetic revolution
for the neuroscientists.

54
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:27,706
Channelrhodopsin-2
is a transmembrane protein

55
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:31,830
that was cloned from the green algae
<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</i>

56
00:03:32,696 --> 00:03:35,572
It's a plasma membrane ion channel,

57
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:40,099
and bound to it is the molecule retinal,

58
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,059
which is an aldehyde
derived from Vitamin A,

59
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:47,895
and that's covalently bound
to the channelrhodopsin protein.

60
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:51,913
And it's the retinal itself
that interacts with light.

61
00:03:51,913 --> 00:03:56,242
And so retinal
is a relatively small molecule.

62
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:59,215
It absorbs a photon,

63
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:05,217
and that then drives a conformational
change in the retinal,

64
00:04:05,217 --> 00:04:08,534
changing it from a <i>trans</i> to a <i>cis</i> motif,

65
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:11,497
so it changes its structure, the retinal.

66
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:15,682
The retinal is bound into
the channelrhodopsin channel,

67
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:20,223
and causes a conformational change
of the channel protein,

68
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:23,298
and increases its open probability.

69
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:28,043
And so in that way,
light directly gates the cation channel,

70
00:04:28,043 --> 00:04:30,337
encoded by channelrhodopsin-2.

71
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:33,826
So we've already seen other ion channels
that are gated, for example,

72
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:36,775
by neurotransmitter,
like the glutamate receptors,

73
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,840
or by voltage, like the voltage-gated
sodium channels.

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,546
Here we now have a light-activated channel
where absorption of a photon

75
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:50,020
on the millisecond time scale
causes an increase in open probability.

76
00:04:50,429 --> 00:04:53,279
And it's a relatively
non-selective cation channel,

77
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,727
so it's permeable to potassium,
sodium, calcium and also protons,

78
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,648
and under physiological conditions
the major conductance

79
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:05,722
is an inward sodium and calcium current,

80
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:10,179
that then has a reversal potential
of somewhere around 0 mV.

81
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,618
So in terms of putting it inside neurons,

82
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:17,001
this is an excitatory
light-activated channel.

83
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,988
The next important step
in the optogenetic revolution

84
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,158
was to put channelrhodopsin into neurons,

85
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:26,646
and that was successfully
done by Ed Boyden,

86
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:29,248
when he was
in Karl Deisseroth's laboratory,

87
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,955
in the seminal paper from 2006.

88
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,904
What they found was that
they could express channelrhodopsin

89
00:05:34,904 --> 00:05:37,915
in cultured hippocampal neurons in a dish,

90
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:40,751
and the cells that expressed
channelrhodopsin

91
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,674
turned out to be light-sensitive,

92
00:05:42,674 --> 00:05:46,598
and brief pulses of blue light
would drive action potential firing

93
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:49,340
with millisecond temporal precision.

94
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,785
So they gave 10 ms light pulses,
and action potential firing,

95
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:57,074
in cells that were expressing
channelrhodopsin

96
00:05:57,074 --> 00:06:01,161
occurred with very low jitter
and highly reproducible,

97
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:03,135
every time there's a blue light flash,

98
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,608
an action potential
was driven in these neurons.

99
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:10,169
And they found that they could drive
the neurons at different frequencies,

100
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,248
so they could stimulate at 5 Hz, at 10 Hz,

101
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,671
and even at 20 Hz,

102
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,769
and they could reliably
drive action potential firing

103
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,422
with every blue light flash.

104
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,310
This is remarkable, because there were
many things that were uncertain.

105
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,948
It was unclear, for example,
whether retinal would be sufficient

106
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,229
in mammalian neurons,

107
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,325
to allow the single expression
of channelrhodopsin

108
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,785
to be sufficient to drive
neuronal action potential firing.

109
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:45,245
And so this caused
the beginning of a revolution,

110
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:48,330
and it's really the robustness
of channelrhodopsin

111
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,184
that's made it used widely,
across the neuroscience community.

112
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:57,956
An important question, of course, was
how well channelrhodopsin-2 works <i>in vivo</i>,

113
00:06:57,956 --> 00:07:00,071
in the living mammalian brain.

114
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:03,454
And so here we've expressed
channelrhodopsin-2

115
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:05,912
in the primary somatosensory cortex.

116
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:09,763
We come in with a whole-cell
membrane potential recording

117
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,762
from one of the neurons
that's expressing channelrhodopsin,

118
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:16,831
and <i>in vivo</i> there are
membrane potential fluctuations

119
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:21,005
that are large in amplitude,
and occurring on a variety of time scales,

120
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,277
and so it's interesting to see
to what extent

121
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:26,816
we can get reliable control
of action potential firing

122
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:30,567
under these conditions
of high variability <i>in vivo</i>.

123
00:07:30,939 --> 00:07:34,377
And it turns out that, at least under
some experimental conditions,

124
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:38,815
brief blue light flashes
applied to cells <i>in vivo</i>

125
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:41,852
cause extremely reliable
action potential firing,

126
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,756
just like it had been described

127
00:07:43,756 --> 00:07:46,994
in the cultured hippocampal
neurons by Ed Boyden.

128
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:52,415
So irrespective of the membrane potential
at the time of stimulus,

129
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:56,385
each time a blue light flash,
here 3 ms in duration,

130
00:07:56,385 --> 00:08:00,504
was delivered to the cell,
it would cause a depolarization,

131
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,628
it would reach action potential threshold,

132
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:05,383
and an action potential would be evoked.

133
00:08:05,383 --> 00:08:08,232
This occurred in response
to every blue light flash,

134
00:08:08,232 --> 00:08:12,843
but there was some variability
in the timing of the action potential

135
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:15,654
with respect to the onset
of the blue light.

136
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:20,520
As you'll see, in the membrane potential
there are spontaneous fluctuations

137
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,485
in the pre-stimulus membrane potential.

138
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:28,218
So sometimes the blue light is delivered
when the neuron is hyperpolarized,

139
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:31,461
and at other times
the blue light is delivered

140
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:34,403
when the neuron
is spontaneously depolarized.

141
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:36,807
And it turns out that
that makes a difference

142
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,748
to the precise timing
of the action potential.

143
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:44,186
If the neuron is spontaneously
hyperpolarized, when the blue light comes on,

144
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:48,188
we need to depolarize by a long distance,
and that takes some time

145
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,362
before we reach
action potential threshold.

146
00:08:51,025 --> 00:08:54,067
On the other hand,
if we're spontaneously depolarized,

147
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,430
we turn the blue light on,

148
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,992
the depolarization begins
at the same point,

149
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:01,393
but now there's less depolarization
that needs to happen

150
00:09:01,393 --> 00:09:03,023
before we hit AP threshold,

151
00:09:03,023 --> 00:09:06,398
and the action potential,
therefore, occurs earlier.

152
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:11,171
And so every blue light stimulus
gives a single action potential output,

153
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:15,002
but the precise timing varies
by a millisecond or so,

154
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:18,181
depending upon the exact depolarization,

155
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:21,169
the state of the cell
that we're recording from.

156
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:26,687
And so channelrhodopsin-2 turns out
to work extremely robustly <i>in vivo</i>.

157
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:30,820
A next question one might ask
is whether stimulation of neurons

158
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,125
with channelrhodopsin-2 can drive
a behavioral output in the mouse.

159
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:41,180
And an obvious place to look, then,
for optogenetic influence on behavior

160
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,852
is by stimulating the motor cortex.

161
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:50,938
So, we investigated here, in a system
that we've already studied in some detail,

162
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,684
the somatosensory
whisker signaling pathway

163
00:09:53,684 --> 00:09:57,911
where if we stimulate a whisker
we can image neuronal activity

164
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:02,856
across the dorsal surface of the neocortex
with voltage-sensitive dyes.

165
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,455
We stimulate the whisker,
and the first thing that happens,

166
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:10,046
if we look in the neocortex,
is that there's depolarization

167
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:13,301
and sensory processing
in the primary somatosensory cortex.

168
00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:18,590
Some 5-6 ms later there's
an additional hotspot of activity,

169
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,289
sensory processing, in the motor cortex,

170
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,672
and so we can localize
the whisker motor cortex in the mouse

171
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:26,854
through voltage-sensitive dye imaging.

172
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,012
We can then express channelrhodopsin,
specifically in this area of the brain,

173
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,237
by injecting a virus to express
channelrhodopsin

174
00:10:35,237 --> 00:10:37,342
in the whisker motor cortex,

175
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:41,734
and then in our head-restrained mice
we can then turn on the blue light

176
00:10:41,734 --> 00:10:47,529
and see what happens when
we stimulate the whisker motor cortex.

177
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,867
And perhaps not surprisingly,
this causes the whisker to move,

178
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,631
and we get into this
what appears to be something like

179
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:57,486
the exploratory movement of the mouse,

180
00:10:57,486 --> 00:10:59,874
as it's exploring
its immediate environment,

181
00:10:59,874 --> 00:11:02,744
the whisker going backwards
and forwards rhythmically,

182
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:08,368
as we maintain the blue light stimulus
here on the motor cortex area.

183
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:12,305
This occurs with very short latencies,
and is extremely robust.

184
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:16,832
Every time you turn the blue light on,
about 20-30 ms later,

185
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:21,225
the animal begins to move its whiskers
in this exploratory way,

186
00:11:21,225 --> 00:11:24,892
searching for something
in its immediate environment.

187
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,788
And so channelrhodopsin-2
works <i>in vivo</i>,

188
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,952
it can drive action potential firing,

189
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,919
and it can also drive behavior,

190
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,284
here visualized
in the whisker motor system.

191
00:11:37,006 --> 00:11:40,793
A major drawback of the way in which
we were stimulating

192
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:44,334
the whisker motor cortex
with channelrhodopsin,

193
00:11:44,334 --> 00:11:47,519
was that we don't know
exactly how many cells,

194
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,243
or exactly which cell types it is
that we're stimulating.

195
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:54,795
We're simply applying blue light
to the whisker motor cortex,

196
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:59,037
and many neurons, thousands of neurons,
were expressing channelrhodopsin,

197
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:02,444
and probably subsets of those
were firing action potentials.

198
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,578
In order to get to that level of detail,

199
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:09,097
where we can stimulate individual neurons,

200
00:12:09,097 --> 00:12:13,458
we then need to start
putting light beams on specific cells,

201
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:14,943
and stimulating those.

202
00:12:15,256 --> 00:12:19,302
We've already seen that it's difficult
to focus blue light into the brain,

203
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:22,839
because the brain
is a highly scattering medium.

204
00:12:23,675 --> 00:12:26,521
We also saw, when we are thinking
about high-resolution imaging,

205
00:12:26,521 --> 00:12:30,196
that two-photon excitation
offered an interesting way out

206
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:34,466
for fluorescence imaging, and we can
use exactly the same phenomonology

207
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,090
of two-photon excitation
of channelrhodopsin

208
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,682
to get optical Z-sectioning,

209
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,381
and get around the scattering
problems of the brain.

210
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,778
So if we imagine that this is
the energy diagram

211
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:50,361
of the channelrhodopsin,
and so we have a ground state,

212
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,994
and normally we would
give a single blue photon

213
00:12:53,994 --> 00:12:55,729
to activate the channelrhodopsin.

214
00:12:55,729 --> 00:13:00,796
We can, instead of the blue photon,
deliver two infrared photons,

215
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:04,623
go through the virtual states,
and now we have two low-energy photons,

216
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:07,223
and that's good in itself,
they scatter less inside the brain,

217
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:11,584
so we've got a better chance of focusing
our infrared beam into the brain.

218
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,649
And in addition we have
this nice phenomenon,

219
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,540
this non-linearity
of two-photon excitation,

220
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,971
where in order for us to go through this,

221
00:13:19,971 --> 00:13:22,760
these two photons need
to arrive at the fluorophore

222
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,877
within a femtosecond of each other,

223
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,968
so we need a very high density of photons

224
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:30,046
in order to get the two-photon activation,

225
00:13:30,046 --> 00:13:33,778
and that's only present here
at the center of the focal spot,

226
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:37,370
and these other areas,
as we try to focus this beam of light

227
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,476
into a small area here,
has a low-photon density,

228
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:45,413
and that's then insufficient
to be able to drive two-photon excitation.

229
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:49,560
And so we can confine
the excitation of channelrhodopsin

230
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,716
through two-photon phenomena,

231
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:54,529
and we can imagine that
we express channelrhodopsin

232
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,981
in, say, all the cells
of a given brain region,

233
00:13:58,496 --> 00:14:01,888
and then we simply point
our laser beam at different neurons,

234
00:14:02,543 --> 00:14:04,889
and we excite them
through two-photon excitation,

235
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:08,381
the specific neurons in the specific
temporal sequence that we want,

236
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,896
and we can then gain control,
at a single-cell level,

237
00:14:11,896 --> 00:14:14,611
with millisecond temporal resolution.

238
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:20,964
This is still largely being developed,
but it's clear that this can work

239
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:24,346
if the conditions
are sufficiently well controlled.

240
00:14:24,346 --> 00:14:26,465
And so there's a great deal
of hope for the future,

241
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,560
that this type of methodology,
two-photon excitation,

242
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,631
will allow us to take control
of neurons and neuronal networks

243
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:38,845
at the required level of single cells
and millisecond temporal precision.

244
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:43,258
Remarkably, in addition to
the optogenetic tools

245
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,693
for stimulating neuronal activity,

246
00:14:45,693 --> 00:14:48,569
optogenetic tools
for inhibiting neuronal activity

247
00:14:48,569 --> 00:14:52,090
have also been developed
over the last decade.

248
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:58,789
The first protein that was identified
is the so-called <i>halorhodopsin</i> molecule,

249
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:02,576
which encodes
a light-driven chloride pump.

250
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,500
Absorption of a photon into halorhodopsin

251
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,480
moves one chloride ion
from the outside to the inside of a cell,

252
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,314
and so that causes
a hyperpolarization of the neuron.

253
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,644
Another molecule, called <i>archaerhodopsin</i>
or <i>Arch</i>, is a proton pump,

254
00:15:20,644 --> 00:15:26,030
and absorption of a green photon,
by Arch, removes a proton

255
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,740
from the inside of a cell
and moves it to the outside,

256
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,560
again causing hyperpolarization.

257
00:15:33,637 --> 00:15:38,061
For each yellow or green photon
absorbed by these pumps,

258
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,734
one ion is moved.

259
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:44,947
And so it's clear that this is
a much less efficient process

260
00:15:44,947 --> 00:15:47,313
than the opening of an ion channel,

261
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,644
where you can imagine
that a single photon,

262
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:52,924
causing the opening of an ion channel,
lets many ions through,

263
00:15:52,924 --> 00:15:56,770
and so there's a drop in efficiency,
and in general, of course,

264
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,382
pumps are known to be
much slower than ion channels.

265
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:03,869
And so there's considerable excitement
about the recent development

266
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:07,178
of a light-activated chloride channel

267
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:11,488
through genetic engineering
of the channelrhodopsin ion channel.

268
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:15,149
The normal channelrhodopsin-2 ion channel

269
00:16:16,885 --> 00:16:20,230
has some negative glutamate residues

270
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,587
sitting here along
the pore-forming region,

271
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:26,970
and that's then presumably the reason
that it's a cation-selective channel.

272
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,680
The cations like to interact
with the negative charges.

273
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:34,604
What these two papers managed to do

274
00:16:34,604 --> 00:16:38,864
was to convert the cation channel
of channelrhodopsin

275
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,294
into a chloride channel,
and in part this was done

276
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:46,117
by putting positive charges
here in the pore-forming region,

277
00:16:46,117 --> 00:16:49,311
and that then allows
chloride ions to permeate,

278
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:53,052
and they then made
a light-activated chloride channel.

279
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,913
And it's possible that this is going to be

280
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:57,713
a much more efficient way
of inhibiting neurons,

281
00:16:57,713 --> 00:17:00,660
compared to the light-activated pumps.

282
00:17:01,442 --> 00:17:05,030
The light-activated pumps do,
nonetheless, work, to some extent,

283
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,237
at least in some cell types.

284
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:10,668
And here's an experiment
in which halorhodopsin,

285
00:17:10,668 --> 00:17:14,170
the light-activated chloride pump,
is expressed in a specific type

286
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,719
of GABAergic neuron in the neocortex,

287
00:17:16,719 --> 00:17:18,484
one that we've already talked about.

288
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:21,867
This is the somatostatin
expressing GABAergic neuron,

289
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:24,265
and what's special about these cells

290
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:27,059
is that they have
a very high input resistance,

291
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:29,183
something like 200 megaOhm,

292
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:31,751
and that means that
small currents in these cells

293
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,574
create a big difference
in membrane potential.

294
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:38,911
And so even though the halorhodopsin
may not be the most efficient way

295
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:41,647
of delivering an optogenetic inhibition,

296
00:17:41,647 --> 00:17:44,931
it nonetheless worked very well
in this cell type.

297
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:48,299
And so here in an awake behaving mouse

298
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:54,217
the somatostatin cell is firing away
during normal quiet wakefulness.

299
00:17:54,217 --> 00:17:55,498
We turn the yellow light on,

300
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:58,997
that activates the light-activated
chloride pump, and it causes

301
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:02,558
an important hyperpolarization
of the membrane potential,

302
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,988
and a complete shutdown
of action potential firing.

303
00:18:05,988 --> 00:18:09,935
The light goes off,
and action potential firing returns.

304
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,280
The inhibition can last many seconds,

305
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,719
and for this particular cell type,
it's complete.

306
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,062
However, it has to be said
that halorhodopsin

307
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:22,229
hasn't worked equally efficiently
in all cell types,

308
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:25,056
and so it's good that further
genetic engineering goes on,

309
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:29,375
to improve the efficacy
of the optogenetic inhibitory molecules.

310
00:18:29,954 --> 00:18:34,127
Indeed, optogenetic tool development
is something that's ongoing

311
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,804
in many neuroscience laboratories.

312
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:41,343
Researchers are working on making
higher conductance ion channels

313
00:18:41,343 --> 00:18:44,514
that would allow greater ion permeability,

314
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:48,372
and thus a more potent
optogenetic actuator,

315
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:51,273
or they're trying to change
the ion selectivity,

316
00:18:51,273 --> 00:18:55,079
making calcium-permeable
light-activated channels,

317
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,786
or potassium-selective ones,

318
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:59,987
in addition to improving
the chloride selectivity

319
00:18:59,987 --> 00:19:02,323
of the newly developed ion channels.

320
00:19:02,753 --> 00:19:05,534
Changing the kinetics
is also extremely interesting,

321
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:09,950
making the channelrhodopsin faster
would be something extremely helpful.

322
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,093
Right now, if one gives
a 1 ms pulse of light,

323
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:19,190
the channelrhodopsin turns on rapidly,
but it also stays on

324
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:22,258
for considerably longer
than one might want.

325
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:25,055
And so it might be nice
to have optogenetic actuators

326
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,742
that followed the light pulses
more accurately.

327
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:33,092
And so faster off variants
of channelrhodopsin

328
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:34,849
would be extremely welcome.

329
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:36,959
It's also interesting
to think about slower variants

330
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:38,954
that would stay on
for longer periods of time,

331
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:42,226
where one pulse of light would leave it on
for a long period of time.

332
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:45,302
And, indeed, switchable channelrhodopsins
have already been developed,

333
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:49,044
where one color of light
would turn the channelrhodopsin on,

334
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:52,522
and a different wavelength of light
would turn the molecule off.

335
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:55,030
Further spectral variants
are being developed

336
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,137
so that channelrhodopsins
are not just activated by blue light,

337
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:01,489
but by red light, infrared light,
ultraviolet light, blue light,

338
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:04,707
and you can imagine a day
when there will be

339
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:06,476
different types of channelrhodopsins

340
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:09,464
expressed in many different
genetically defined neurons,

341
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:12,303
and we'll be able to separately
control their activities

342
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:15,224
through different spectral variants
of channelrhodopsins.

343
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:18,111
One could also imagine
targeting the channelrhodopsins,

344
00:20:18,111 --> 00:20:21,465
or other optogenetic actuators
to different neuronal compartments

345
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:24,694
or sub-cellular compartments,
that might all provide

346
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,894
interesting information
about how neurons function.

347
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:31,168
Finally, we've been discussing
optogenetic tools

348
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:32,954
for changing membrane potential,

349
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,616
but there are many other
cellular and molecular processes

350
00:20:35,616 --> 00:20:38,193
that are open to optogenetic actuators,

351
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,638
including gene expression,
synaptic transmission,

352
00:20:41,638 --> 00:20:44,622
and a whole variety
of other signaling pathways

353
00:20:44,622 --> 00:20:47,723
within neurons and cells in general.

354
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:51,169
So in this video we've seen
that channelrhodopsin-2

355
00:20:51,169 --> 00:20:54,222
is a powerful tool for the neuroscientist.

356
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:59,803
Channelrhodopsin-2 encodes an intrinsic
light-activated cation channel

357
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:03,859
that when expressed in neurons
allows us to control their firing

358
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:06,057
with millisecond precision.

359
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:09,742
This then allows us
to ask causal questions

360
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:14,698
about what the stimulation or activity
of a specific group of neurons,

361
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:18,766
that are genetically-defined,
contributes to a given behavior.

362
00:21:19,655 --> 00:21:22,664
We've also seen that
new optogenetic actuators

363
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:24,614
are being developed to inhibit neurons

364
00:21:24,614 --> 00:21:27,359
with high temporal
precision and specificity,

365
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:30,055
and further optogenetic tools
have been made

366
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,392
to inhibit neurotransmission,

367
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:35,330
or to affect different signaling pathways.

368
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:41,815
So altogether, this week we've seen that
there are interesting and useful ways

369
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:45,945
in which we can measure and manipulate
the mouse brain activity

370
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:48,931
in awake behaving animals,

371
00:21:48,931 --> 00:21:50,953
and what we'll look at next week

372
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:55,248
is how we can use these tools
to address specific questions

373
00:21:55,248 --> 00:21:59,436
relating to sensory perception
and sensory motor integration.
