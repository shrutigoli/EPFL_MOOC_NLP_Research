1
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,289
In the last video,

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:11,006
we set an important goal
for modern neuroscience:

3
00:00:11,006 --> 00:00:13,406
to determine the causal mechanisms

4
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:17,459
through which brain function
drives mammalian behavior.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,121
We thought that there were

6
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:23,224
three key aspects
that needed to be done.

7
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:26,805
We need to measure neuronal activity

8
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:31,702
and the synaptic connections
between neurons during behavior.

9
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:34,212
We need to be able
to manipulate those neurons

10
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:37,661
and monitor the impact
upon other neurons in the brain

11
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:41,187
and also, of course, see
what impact that has upon behavior.

12
00:00:41,404 --> 00:00:45,395
And if we can combine
that measurement and manipulation

13
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:50,873
of neuronal activity with sufficient
resolution in time and space,

14
00:00:50,873 --> 00:00:53,089
then it would be important
to quantitatively see

15
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:58,403
to what extent we've really understood
how event A causes event B

16
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:01,558
that then finally causes
the animal to move,

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:03,178
driving a behavior.

18
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,995
So how are we going to do that?

19
00:01:07,306 --> 00:01:08,490
Many of us, of course,

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,838
dream of understanding
the thought processes of the human brain.

21
00:01:13,213 --> 00:01:17,224
We have obvious questions:
How do we perceive the world?

22
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:18,861
How do we remember?

23
00:01:19,248 --> 00:01:22,907
How do we do the things we like to do?

24
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:26,882
And of course, we're also interested

25
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:31,655
in curing the many brain diseases
that affect large populations.

26
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,035
Now, it's likely
that it'll take a long time

27
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,953
before we understand the details
of how the human brain works.

28
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,588
On the other hand, neuroscientists
have high hopes

29
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:46,780
that we'll get a detailed causal
and mechanistic understanding

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,603
of how the mouse brain works,

31
00:01:48,603 --> 00:01:53,308
perhaps in our lifetimes,
and likely within the 21st century.

32
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:57,725
So let's have a look and see
how close the mouse brain is

33
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,955
to the human brain, and how likely it is

34
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:04,285
that we'll be able to learn from the mouse
and translate that into anything

35
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:07,185
that relates to what goes on
in the human brain.

36
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,581
A good starting point,
in terms of thinking about man

37
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:13,473
in the context of other animals

38
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,225
is to think about evolution.

39
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:21,193
So here we have man
that diverged from its common ancestor

40
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:24,083
with the apes,
the chimpanzee, for example,

41
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:26,186
some tens of millions of years ago.

42
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:30,272
If we go back some further
tens of millions of years ago,

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,534
we diverge from the monkeys,

44
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:35,240
and here we have
within the primates, of course,

45
00:02:35,348 --> 00:02:37,321
our closest relatives,

46
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,414
and of course, it's extremely
interesting to understand

47
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:43,966
the behavior of monkeys and apes

48
00:02:43,966 --> 00:02:47,119
and of course, in the context 
of their brain activity.

49
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:52,008
But, of course, detailed 
mechanistic investigations

50
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:55,913
into brain function in monkeys and apes

51
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,686
is extremely difficult to do.

52
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:04,375
The mouse, on the other hand, diverged
some 80 million years ago from man.

53
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,058
That's when we had
our last common ancestor,

54
00:03:07,058 --> 00:03:10,725
and within at least
the context of evolution,

55
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:13,487
mouse and man are close to each other

56
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,125
compared, for example,
to birds and reptiles

57
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:19,646
where the mammals diverge
from the rest of the vertebrates

58
00:03:19,646 --> 00:03:21,618
some 300 million years ago.

59
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:24,436
So on an evolutionary timescale,

60
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,399
mouse and man are relatively 
close to each other.

61
00:03:28,364 --> 00:03:32,385
If we look in terms of the genes
that code for the various proteins

62
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:35,355
that carry out functional roles
inside our cells,

63
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:39,931
about 99 percent of the genes
that are found in man

64
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,725
have homologues in mouse.

65
00:03:42,716 --> 00:03:46,727
So if there's a given
genetic mutation in man

66
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,607
that's linked to some disease,

67
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,993
there's a 99 percent chance 
that we can find

68
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:53,466
a homologous protein in a mouse

69
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:58,304
and because of its strong homology
in terms of the genetic sequence,

70
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,501
it's likely that it's going to be
carrying out a related function.

71
00:04:02,044 --> 00:04:04,071
So at least from a genetic perspective,

72
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:06,237
mouse and man are very close to each other

73
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:09,246
and we may be able to learn
a lot at that level of detail

74
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,121
comparing mouse and man.

75
00:04:12,233 --> 00:04:17,031
The mouse brain is, of course,
different from the human brain.

76
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:20,351
The most obvious difference
is in its size.

77
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,832
So very much like the overall size 
of the mouse

78
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:25,585
is much smaller than man's.

79
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:29,110
So mouse typically has a weight
of around 30 grams,

80
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,055
and a human might have
a weight of around 60 kg

81
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,029
so there's about
three orders of magnitude

82
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,194
in terms of the difference in their size

83
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,805
of man and mouse.

84
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,847
There's also about three
orders of magnitude difference

85
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:44,662
in the size of brain,

86
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:48,539
and so the human brain
is about 1.5 kg in weight,

87
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,977
has some ten to the power of 11 neurons,

88
00:04:50,977 --> 00:04:53,649
whereas the mouse brain is much smaller.

89
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,456
It's about one centimeter
in length dimensions,

90
00:04:56,456 --> 00:04:57,835
weighs about one gram,

91
00:04:57,835 --> 00:05:01,872
and has some ten to the eighth
neurons present in it.

92
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:04,592
So there's about three
orders of magnitude difference

93
00:05:04,592 --> 00:05:07,330
comparing mouse and man brains,

94
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,118
and in the midst of this
is the monkey brain

95
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:14,087
that's also used
in neurophysiological experiments,

96
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,667
and of course, is much closer
to the human brain

97
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,939
in both size and number of neurons.

98
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:23,484
So there are big differences
in the size of the mouse brain,

99
00:05:23,484 --> 00:05:27,928
and that scales more or less
with the size of the body of the animals.

100
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:31,991
Now in the same way
that there's a strong homology

101
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,106
in terms of the overall layout
of the human body and the mouse body,

102
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:39,923
we have four limbs, we have lungs,
heart, kidneys, livers,

103
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,858
the internal organs are all the same.

104
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:46,573
There's also strong similarities
in terms of the organizing principles

105
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:49,048
of the human brain
compared to the mouse brain.

106
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:52,736
So if we now expand the mouse brain

107
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:55,629
and make it look like it's
the same size as the human brain,

108
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,300
we'll see that many
of the parts are the same.

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,190
So here we have the spinal cord
and of course the human brain sits

110
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,387
here on top of the spinal cord also.

111
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:07,049
We have the brain stem and the brain stem,

112
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:10,200
we have the cerebellum of the mouse
and the cerebellum of man,

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,820
and here with a large
cerebral hemisphere of human,

114
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,307
that also is there in the mouse
in the form of a large neocortex.

115
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:22,358
If we now look at the different
subdivisions of the neocortex,

116
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:25,793
we also see that the organization there
is strikingly similar.

117
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:29,047
At the posterior pole of the human brain

118
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,798
we have the visual cortex,

119
00:06:30,798 --> 00:06:34,029
and that's also where
the visual cortex of the mouse is.

120
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:37,415
Our feeling of touch, somatosensation,

121
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,924
is located around here in the human brain,

122
00:06:39,924 --> 00:06:43,830
and it's also somewhere
centrally placed here in the mouse brain.

123
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:49,036
Hearing, the auditory cortex
is located somewhere around here,

124
00:06:49,036 --> 00:06:54,244
in similarly placed locations
in mouse and man,

125
00:06:54,244 --> 00:07:00,528
and the motor areas of the human
and the mouse are also similar,

126
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:05,697
with their motor areas being in front
of the somatosensory areas in both cases.

127
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,753
The human brain has
a vastly expanded prefrontal cortex

128
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,957
that's relatively small in the mouse.

129
00:07:12,342 --> 00:07:16,449
On the other hand, the mouse has
a relatively large olfactory bulb

130
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:21,379
that's only much smaller in the man,
and only just drawn in here, sketched

131
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,741
in this particular diagram now by me.

132
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:28,554
So the overall organization
of the brain is extremely similar,

133
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:31,084
even at the level of where
different brain areas

134
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,954
are processing different forms
of sensory information.

135
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,651
If we look at the subcortical areas.

136
00:07:37,651 --> 00:07:39,834
So here we have the outer layers
of the mouse brain,

137
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,601
the neocortex, and that's
also how it is in the man.

138
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,721
The outer layers forming
the neocortex.

139
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:48,875
Below that we have the striatum,
we have the thalamus in the mouse,

140
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:53,466
and similarly in man we have the striatum
and we have the thalamus located here

141
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:57,062
and there are many
other subcortical nuclei

142
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,853
that are organized in similar locations,

143
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:02,849
express similar genes,
have the same receptors,

144
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,783
and apparently, play
highly homologous roles

145
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,755
comparing mouse and man.

146
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:13,273
So the large scale organization
of man and mouse brain is very similar.

147
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,474
But even if we look at the details,

148
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:18,717
if we say, zoom in
on a patch of neocortex,

149
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:21,404
we find that there are
very similar features.

150
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:25,329
So there are different layers,
so the mouse brain is divided

151
00:08:25,329 --> 00:08:29,690
into layers that are very obviously
different from each other,

152
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,150
and you see the same layers
in the human brain

153
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,638
and the cells that are present there
have a very similar structure.

154
00:08:35,638 --> 00:08:37,722
So there are large
pyramidal cells in layer five

155
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:39,404
in both mouse and man,

156
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:42,671
with big apical dendrites
and big dendrites here,

157
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:44,448
tufts, in layer one.

158
00:08:44,726 --> 00:08:49,413
Equally, there's GABAergic interneurons
present in both man and mouse

159
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:52,940
and there are strong similarities
in the organization then,

160
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,980
both of cells and at the large scale

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,495
comparing man and mouse.

162
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,660
So by studying the mouse brain,

163
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,025
it's likely that we'll learn a lot
about how the human brain is organized.

164
00:09:06,327 --> 00:09:11,366
Studying the mouse has been greatly
helped by a number of large-scale projects

165
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:13,119
that have been undertaken.

166
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:16,246
The Mouse Genome
Sequencing Consortium

167
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:19,593
published the mouse genome in 2002

168
00:09:19,593 --> 00:09:22,698
and the entire mouse genome
is freely available

169
00:09:22,698 --> 00:09:25,178
on a variety of internet websites.

170
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:27,658
And so here from the NCBI,

171
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,103
the National Center
for Biotechnology Information,

172
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,780
you can, for example,
search for your favorite gene,

173
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,369
perhaps the AMPA Type II receptor

174
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,289
is what I've searched for here,

175
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:41,056
and if you do that search you find out
that this glutamate receptor

176
00:09:41,056 --> 00:09:43,967
is located on chromosome three
of the mouse genome.

177
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:47,285
You can click on this
and you get the entire DNA sequence

178
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:51,252
for the coding region,
as well as the surrounding introns

179
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,647
that then gives the promoter
sequences for this gene

180
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:58,133
and determine where
it's expressed in the mouse brain.

181
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,280
So we've learned a lot about
the genome sequence of the mouse,

182
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,515
and of course, molecular biologists
are being able to use that sequence

183
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:14,235
in order to introduce mutations
and transgenes into the mouse genome,

184
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,612
and so, we can also change
that mouse genome.

185
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,943
So, for example, if we know
of a mutation in a human

186
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:21,675
that's linked to a genetic disease,

187
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:24,179
we can insert that mutation
into the mouse genome

188
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:25,876
and study the effects of it.

189
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:28,313
There are of course,
many different mouse mutants

190
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:30,589
that have been made
for many different purposes

191
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,600
to try and help the advances
in medical research.

192
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,315
Typically, when investigators
make mutant mice,

193
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:43,018
they then donate those mice
to different repositories

194
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:46,632
which then serve as mouse libraries,
and one of the most important ones

195
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:50,074
is the Jackson Laboratory in America, JAX,

196
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:53,248
and if you go to this website
you'll be able to see a complete list

197
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:54,760
of the mice that they have.

198
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,572
You can search by different
genetic mutations

199
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:01,063
or insertions that have been made,
and these mice are then a good way

200
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:03,648
in which different researchers
can share their resources.

201
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:08,885
So typically when a mutant mouse
is made, it's deposited here,

202
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:12,051
and then other investigators
can take those mutant mice

203
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,711
and investigate them
for their own particular purposes.

204
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:17,524
So that's a way in which
resources are being shared

205
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,859
amongst mouse investigators

206
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:23,145
and that then helps
advance research dramatically.

207
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:30,731
One of the key ways in which we can
differentiate different parts of the brain

208
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,208
is through gene expression.

209
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:37,930
So in early development
as the fertilized egg divides

210
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,517
and gradually forms the different
specializations of the body,

211
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,974
our different organs,
our different tissues,

212
00:11:44,974 --> 00:11:48,036
that is accompanied
by differential gene expression

213
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:50,755
so that's one of the things
that differentiates a cell

214
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:54,718
in the kidney from muscle, from brain,
is that they express different proteins.

215
00:11:54,718 --> 00:11:58,235
They need to do different jobs,
and so they express different proteins.

216
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:02,654
And within the brain,
there are many different cell types

217
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:04,438
and in part, they can be differentiated

218
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:07,579
through their expression
of different proteins

219
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:11,311
and an important advance
and tool for investigators

220
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:15,250
looking at the mouse brain
has been the Gene Expression Atlas

221
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,424
carried out through
the Allen Brain Institute

222
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:19,905
and again, freely available
on the internet.

223
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,997
You can go to this address,
you can search for your favorite gene,

224
00:12:22,997 --> 00:12:26,016
and you will then see
throughout the entire mouse brain

225
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,916
where that gene is expressed.

226
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:32,309
So here I've searched
for the dopamine type I receptor gene

227
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:35,219
it's stained here through 
in-situ hybridisation

228
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,699
of saggital sections of the mouse brain.

229
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:40,180
I'm showing you
one particular section here,

230
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,040
and you'll see that these black dots
here correspond to individual cells

231
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,465
that express the dopamine I receptor.

232
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:51,542
That turns out to be
largely restricted to the striatum,

233
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,832
something that we already
discussed last week

234
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:56,212
with the GABAergic projection neurons

235
00:12:56,212 --> 00:12:58,282
located here in the striatum.

236
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,061
This, of course,
is just one section of the brain.

237
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:02,784
You can look at many other sections

238
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:07,241
and they have the entire 3D structure
reconstructed quantitatively

239
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:11,285
in terms of the density
of the in-situ hybridisation signal

240
00:13:11,285 --> 00:13:14,123
and if you go to the internet
you'll be able to spin this around

241
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:15,586
and get a very good feel

242
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,545
for the expression pattern
of this particular gene.

243
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:22,159
That's, of course, extremely important
in terms of understanding the anatomy

244
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,678
of the mouse brain, and in terms
of thinking about interventions,

245
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:30,546
treatments and molecules
that will affect brain function.

246
00:13:30,546 --> 00:13:31,645
It's extremely important to know

247
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,395
what different proteins
are actually expressed,

248
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:39,573
so this Mouse Gene Expression Atlas
is serving an extremely important role

249
00:13:39,573 --> 00:13:41,672
for neuroscience research.

250
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:47,795
The expression of different proteins
and different cell types of the brain

251
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:51,918
is clearly extremely important
in order to understand the function

252
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,802
of these different cell types.

253
00:13:53,802 --> 00:13:57,313
So one thing that we can do
through mouse genetics

254
00:13:57,313 --> 00:13:59,494
is to label these different cells

255
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:01,864
through expressing
different types of proteins.

256
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:05,065
So for example, we can take
green fluorescent protein

257
00:14:05,065 --> 00:14:09,905
and put it next to the dopamine
Type I receptor in the mouse genome

258
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:13,235
and then the cells that express
green fluorescent protein

259
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:16,604
are the same ones that express
the Type I dopamine receptor.

260
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:20,713
So we can then cut brain sections
and study their electrophysiology

261
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:25,128
and the synaptic inputs
onto these D1 expressing neurons.

262
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,938
That's an extremely important thing
in terms of understanding the role

263
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:31,411
of different cell types
in the mouse brain.

264
00:14:32,609 --> 00:14:36,870
Even more interesting is the possibility
to express other proteins

265
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,233
that might be functional reporters,
or perhaps enzymes

266
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:44,048
that might act upon 
other genetic elements,

267
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,407
and a great deal of advances
have been made

268
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:49,141
through the expression of recombinases

269
00:14:49,141 --> 00:14:52,844
that combine different DNA elements
and then you can make

270
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:56,519
different genetic manipulations
in a highly targeted way.

271
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,766
So I'll briefly describe
the so-called Cre-LoxP system

272
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:06,227
that has become extremely powerful
for making precise genetic manipulations

273
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:07,967
in the mouse genome.

274
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:12,888
This is something that was first
developed from bacteriophage P1

275
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:16,456
but it doesn't have
an endogenous counterpart

276
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,449
in the mammalian genome.

277
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:23,467
So we can exogenously insert LoxP sites

278
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:29,010
which are simply DNA sequences
of 34 nucleotides long,

279
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,584
highly specific sequences,

280
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:33,831
you can insert those into,
say, intron sequences

281
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,766
that surround a gene

282
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,241
of interest, so if this is the genome,

283
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,098
and we have a gene
of interest located here.

284
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:47,913
We can, in intron regions,
put LoxP sites surrounding that gene,

285
00:15:48,483 --> 00:15:52,177
so that's simply inserting these 34
nucleotide sequences

286
00:15:52,276 --> 00:15:57,575
in surrounding elements around
where the gene is normally expressed,

287
00:15:57,575 --> 00:16:02,097
and doing that, hopefully wouldn't affect
the expression pattern of that gene.

288
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:04,025
So the mouse by itself would be wild type

289
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:08,493
and the only thing we've done is
to introduce these small genetic elements

290
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:11,288
into regions that flank
our gene of interest.

291
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:14,338
Now, what Cre-recombinase will do

292
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:17,680
is to recombine between 
these two LoxP sites

293
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,329
and then remove the gene of interest,
creating a knockout.

294
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:27,547
We can do that in specific cells because
we can express Cre-recombinase

295
00:16:27,547 --> 00:16:30,941
under promoters that express
in specific cell types,

296
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:34,226
for example, like in the 
D1 receptor expressing cells.

297
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:40,455
So we can cross one mouse
that has these so-called floxed genes

298
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:46,552
flanked by LoxP sites,
we can cross that by another mouse

299
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:50,034
that expresses Cre-recombinase
in specific cell types,

300
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,614
and in those cell types, but not
in the other cell types of that mouse,

301
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:59,515
we'll then create a situation
where the LoxP sites recombine

302
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:03,185
and the gene sitting
in between those is removed

303
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:05,316
and degraded and knocked out.

304
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:09,786
So we can make very precise,
highly specific genetic manipulations

305
00:17:09,786 --> 00:17:11,199
in well-defined cell types,

306
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,979
and that's something
that's really essential

307
00:17:12,979 --> 00:17:16,356
for causal and mechanistic
understanding of brain function.

308
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:20,030
One of the interesting things
is that the Cre-LoxP system

309
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,715
isn't the only one,
but rather there are many.

310
00:17:22,715 --> 00:17:27,034
So for example this Flp-FRT system
which is very similar,

311
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:31,045
but acting on different genetic elements
and one can then combine

312
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,247
the different types
of genetic manipulations

313
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,497
to get that combinatorial specificity

314
00:17:37,497 --> 00:17:41,492
in which one can make multiple
independent genetic manipulations,

315
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,565
perhaps even in different cell types.

316
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:50,244
In addition to these interesting advances
in the genome manipulation of the mouse,

317
00:17:50,244 --> 00:17:54,469
there's also increasing data
relating to the connectivity

318
00:17:54,469 --> 00:17:57,126
of different brain areas
inside the mouse.

319
00:17:57,262 --> 00:18:00,542
Again, the Allen Brain Atlas
has take the lead here

320
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,445
in providing online data

321
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:06,204
for where different cells
project in the mouse brain.

322
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:09,112
Here I'm showing you
one particular example,

323
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:12,981
where they're looking 
at the injection site here

324
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:15,401
in the primary somatosensory cortex

325
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:17,478
and injecting their tracer, they then see

326
00:18:17,478 --> 00:18:21,755
where axons from neurons located
in this particular area of the brain,

327
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,564
where they project to, in terms
of other parts of the brain.

328
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:27,648
They've made injections of many
different parts of the mouse brain.

329
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,246
Each one of these dots here
corresponds to an injection site

330
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:35,660
from where they're mapping
where the axons go from that brain area.

331
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,245
And I've selected
the primary somatosensory cortex,

332
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:41,377
that barrel field,
the whisker representation

333
00:18:41,377 --> 00:18:44,769
that we've already thought
a bit about in previous weeks.

334
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,220
So here's what the data looks like.

335
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,567
They've made an injection of their tracer

336
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,222
into this area here, the primary
somatosensory cortex of the mouse,

337
00:18:53,222 --> 00:18:58,294
and in this coronal section of the mouse,
you see that the axons go to the striatum,

338
00:18:58,294 --> 00:18:59,605
they go to the thalamus,

339
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:02,314
they go to the contralateral
somatosensory cortex,

340
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:05,612
and if we now look at some
of the whole brain view,

341
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,490
and again, if you go to the website

342
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,553
you'll be able to spin this around
in three dimensions

343
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:13,728
and get really quite a good impression
of where these axons are going,

344
00:19:13,728 --> 00:19:15,736
you'll see that the primary
somatosensory cortex

345
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,286
projects to motor cortex,
contralateral cortex,

346
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:21,300
striatum, thalamus, and also
there are descending projections

347
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,533
down here to brain stem.

348
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:26,691
So we're beginning
to get quite a good idea

349
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:29,902
about which brain areas are connected
to which other brain areas,

350
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,924
and that's obviously of key importance

351
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:34,681
to get a causal
and mechanistic understanding

352
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:37,914
about how the mouse brain
processes sensory information

353
00:19:37,914 --> 00:19:40,071
and how that might lead to behavior.

354
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:46,295
So in order to link what we've learned
about the mouse brain with behavior,

355
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:49,628
we clearly need to study
mouse behavior in quite some detail.

356
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:53,046
One of the more interesting things
that the brain can do

357
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,431
is to learn and remember things,

358
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:58,538
and an important
behavioral paradigm, then,

359
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,210
tests learning and memory,

360
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,734
and one of them is the Morris Water Maze.

361
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,665
In the Morris Water Maze experiments,

362
00:20:05,665 --> 00:20:08,417
a mouse is put inside a swimming pool

363
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,781
that's been filled with opaque water.

364
00:20:10,978 --> 00:20:14,526
The mouse will then swim around
and eventually it finds

365
00:20:14,526 --> 00:20:16,270
that there's actually a hidden platform

366
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:21,202
where it can stand on, and swimming
is a rather exhausting task for a mouse,

367
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:25,761
so it's rather happy when it gets here
to the submerged platform

368
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:27,749
where it can then stand and relax,

369
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:31,727
and gradually, over days,
as the mouse is put in

370
00:20:31,727 --> 00:20:35,194
it learns to swim more and more directly
to this hidden platform

371
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,050
guided by visual cues
that are placed around it.

372
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,432
So in this example, it'll learn
to swim more and more directly

373
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:46,225
towards the star, and that's how
it'll locate the hidden platform.

374
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:50,418
On a transfer test day,
the platform's removed

375
00:20:50,418 --> 00:20:53,132
and the mouse is again placed
inside the swimming pool

376
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:55,959
and it swims around,
and if it's learned correctly

377
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:59,689
that the platform's located here,
in this environment around the star,

378
00:20:59,737 --> 00:21:01,831
it'll swim around in this area here

379
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:04,340
searching for where
that platform might be.

380
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:07,322
So one can then quantify
the amount of time

381
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:10,225
that the animal spends
in this target platform

382
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:13,718
relative to the other quadrants,
so you see okay,

383
00:21:13,718 --> 00:21:16,419
it might spend a lot of time
here in the target quadrant

384
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,290
and much less time
in the three other quadrants,

385
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,879
and then we can quantify to what degree
the mouse has learned the behavior

386
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:24,865
and remembered it.

387
00:21:24,865 --> 00:21:28,903
So that's a way in which we can test
learning and memory in mice.

388
00:21:29,898 --> 00:21:31,273
Now, we can connect that

389
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:34,563
to the specificity of the genetics
that we've been talking about

390
00:21:34,563 --> 00:21:39,149
and in 1996 Susumu Tonegawa
and his laboratory

391
00:21:39,224 --> 00:21:41,132
created a rather interesting mouse

392
00:21:41,132 --> 00:21:43,747
that tested some of the things
that we've been discussing.

393
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:46,506
When we were discussing
glutamate receptors,

394
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:50,554
we had time to think about 
long term synaptic plasticity

395
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:54,991
and at that time we said that probably
was the basis for learning and memory.

396
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,759
One of the key experiments
that supported that

397
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,827
has been this experiment here,
where genetic knockouts,

398
00:22:01,827 --> 00:22:04,344
deletions of NMDA receptors
have being carried out

399
00:22:04,344 --> 00:22:06,526
in highly specific brain areas.

400
00:22:06,635 --> 00:22:12,320
So we discussed that the NMDA receptor
during the concomitant activity

401
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,416
of presynaptic release of glutamate
and postsynaptic depolarization,

402
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:19,520
the magnesium popped
off the NMDA receptor

403
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,263
allowing calcium to enter, and that
would then start off plasticity processes

404
00:22:23,263 --> 00:22:25,584
that might then encode memories.

405
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:31,294
In this particular experiment,
the Tonagawa lab created mice

406
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:38,652
where the LoxP sites were surrounding
the NMDA receptor type I gene.

407
00:22:38,652 --> 00:22:43,070
So this is the one that's absolutely
critical for NMDA receptor function.

408
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,952
They put LoxP sites
surrounding the NR1 gene,

409
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:50,265
in the presence of Cre-recombinase that
would then knock out the NMDA receptor

410
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:53,440
but in other cells that were not
expressing Cre-recombinase,

411
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,607
this would be wild type
because the LoxP site

412
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:58,375
is in introns, and doesn't
affect the expression

413
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:00,315
of the native NMDA receptor.

414
00:23:00,923 --> 00:23:05,537
The Cre-recombinase was expressed
in a highly specific way inside the brain.

415
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:09,934
It was expressed post-natally
and only in a small part of the brain

416
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:12,074
called the hippocampus,

417
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,931
so there's a so-called
CA1 region of the hippocampus

418
00:23:14,931 --> 00:23:20,264
that's located around here, and cells
in this area are known to encode space.

419
00:23:20,264 --> 00:23:22,100
So they are so-called play cells

420
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,384
that were discovered
by the 2014 Nobel Prize winner,

421
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:30,561
John O'Keefe, that encoded the location
of where the animal is in space,

422
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:33,044
and it's thought that the reason
that the animal learns

423
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:38,387
these place representations
is through long-term synaptic plasticity.

424
00:23:39,156 --> 00:23:42,694
They can then use that
spatial information to navigate

425
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:48,667
and find where it is in terms
of carrying out this spatial memory task.

426
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:53,607
So when the Tonagawa lab
made these CA1 specific

427
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:56,060
NMDA receptor knockout animals,

428
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,355
they put them through
the Morris Water Maze learning

429
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:01,509
and on the transfer test day,
the animal would swim around

430
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:06,399
and have no recollection that the platform
would be near its supposed location

431
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:08,352
here, in this example, by the star.

432
00:24:08,712 --> 00:24:12,643
So learning and memory was disrupted
by knocking out NMDA receptors

433
00:24:12,643 --> 00:24:16,102
in this highly specific
area of the mouse brain

434
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:19,387
thought to encode the spatial location

435
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:22,346
and that then gives us
strong genetic evidence

436
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:26,655
for the role of synaptic plasticity
in NMDA receptor function

437
00:24:26,655 --> 00:24:28,176
in forming memories.

438
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,612
So that's one interesting behavior

439
00:24:30,612 --> 00:24:32,714
that's been studied
in some detail in the mouse,

440
00:24:32,714 --> 00:24:35,891
and begins to give us confidence
that we are on the right tracks

441
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:40,783
in terms of understanding simple aspects
of mouse learning and behavior.

442
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:45,829
Making neurophysiological measurements
while mice are swimming

443
00:24:45,829 --> 00:24:48,522
in the Morris Water Maze
is relatively difficult,

444
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:53,502
so investigators have also been working
on simplifying the behavioral tasks

445
00:24:53,502 --> 00:24:56,897
and also providing a more 
highly-controlled environment

446
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,795
in terms of the sensory inputs
that the mouse will receive.

447
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:04,574
One of the key steps has been to develop
head restrained mouse behavior

448
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:07,991
where metal implants are placed
on the head of the mouse

449
00:25:07,991 --> 00:25:11,840
and that then stabilizes the mouse brain
to the level that there are only

450
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,291
micrometer level movements
of individual nerve cells.

451
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,612
So we can make high quality
neurophysiological measurements,

452
00:25:18,612 --> 00:25:21,643
electrophysiology and imaging
of the mouse brain

453
00:25:21,643 --> 00:25:25,810
and the mice rapidly adapt
to this head restrained behavior

454
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,482
and they show no obvious
signs of discomfort.

455
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:34,181
So in one particular paradigm
we've investigated sensory perception

456
00:25:34,181 --> 00:25:35,511
through these whiskers.

457
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,241
So we put small pieces
of metal on the whisker.

458
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,251
The animal is placed on top
of an electromagnetic coil,

459
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:44,312
and we can give one second
pulses onto this whisker,

460
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:48,504
and the animal learns that those
one millisecond deflections of the whisker

461
00:25:48,504 --> 00:25:52,881
predict reward availability
if the animal licks a reward spout.

462
00:25:53,662 --> 00:25:57,193
So here we can begin to study
mechanisms of motivation,

463
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:59,759
reward-based learning,
and sensory perception

464
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,345
in a highly controlled manner.

465
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:04,536
And we can get to that causal
and mechanistic understanding

466
00:26:04,536 --> 00:26:07,704
of simple behaviors
in a head restrained mouse.

467
00:26:08,405 --> 00:26:09,931
Other laboratories are making

468
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:12,916
more sophisticated
head restrained mouse behaviors

469
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:16,343
where an animal might be
running on a floating trackball

470
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:19,859
and navigating
a virtual visual environment.

471
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:23,249
So there's a great deal of excitement
in the neuroscience community right now

472
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:29,091
about the head restrained mouse
as a way of linking genes, behavior

473
00:26:29,091 --> 00:26:32,621
and neurophysiology at that level
where we might get

474
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:36,565
a causal mechanistic insight
as to how the brain really works.

475
00:26:37,242 --> 00:26:40,792
So there's a great deal of interest
in understanding the mouse brain

476
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:43,024
from a purely scientific point of view

477
00:26:43,024 --> 00:26:47,285
where we're really addressing one
of the main frontiers of human knowledge.

478
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:52,001
Another major reason
for studying the mouse brain, of course,

479
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:56,005
is to try and understand
the mechanisms of brain dysfunction

480
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,776
with the hopes that we might
be able to provide cures

481
00:26:58,776 --> 00:27:00,565
or at least new treatments,

482
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:03,461
so brain diseases make
a big impact on the world,

483
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:07,102
both at the level of individuals
and for society as a whole.

484
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:10,038
So a key goal for neuroscientists
is to develop better treatments

485
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,591
for brain diseases,

486
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:14,929
and clearly, in order to improve
our ability to repair the brain,

487
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:19,046
it's really helpful to understand
what's going on inside the brain.

488
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,815
So a challenge for many neuroscientists

489
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:25,597
is to see if we can develop
rational therapies for brain diseases.

490
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:29,656
So in the field of so-called
translational neuroscience research

491
00:27:29,656 --> 00:27:34,060
we might have a genetic mutation
that is linked to a human brain disease

492
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:37,270
and you put that genetic mutation
inside the mouse.

493
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:42,135
There we can study the causal impact
of that genetic lesion

494
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:46,102
and see what difference
it makes to the brain cells,

495
00:27:46,102 --> 00:27:49,495
their connectivity, and also
their function during behavior.

496
00:27:50,118 --> 00:27:53,387
One can then begin to develop therapies
that in the first instance

497
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:57,462
work for that mouse model of the disease,

498
00:27:57,462 --> 00:28:00,887
and if that works in the mouse,
one might then think of seeing

499
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:06,389
whether that also works as a therapy
in monkey models of the same disease,

500
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:12,138
and if we have these two scales
over which that treatment works,

501
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:14,109
then, of course, it becomes
extremely interesting

502
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:17,013
to try and see if we
can translate that to humans

503
00:28:17,013 --> 00:28:20,942
and the hope, of course, is then
that we provide rational therapies

504
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:26,500
for the large number of brain diseases
that cause such trouble for mankind.

505
00:28:28,408 --> 00:28:32,128
And so in this video we've seen
that understanding the mouse brain

506
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:36,280
might provide clues
as to how the human brain works.

507
00:28:37,018 --> 00:28:41,854
Investigating the mouse brain
has been helped by large scale efforts

508
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:46,154
in terms of molecular biology,
gene expression patterns,

509
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:51,203
also in terms of connectivity and general
organization of the mouse brain.

510
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:56,762
And so, research in the mouse
is developing at a rapid rate

511
00:28:56,762 --> 00:29:00,642
and there's now growing excitement
about the ability to connect

512
00:29:00,642 --> 00:29:05,806
that basic fundamental knowledge
about proteins, molecules, cells,

513
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:08,461
wiring diagrams,
with the behavior of the mouse.

514
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:12,801
We're now beginning to see the causal
and mechanistic underpinnings

515
00:29:12,801 --> 00:29:17,605
of behavior at the level
of cells and synapses

516
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:19,472
by studying the mouse.

517
00:29:20,518 --> 00:29:27,373
Over the next videos we'll look at more
of the details about how, technically,

518
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:29,994
we make measurements
from the mouse brain during behavior

519
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:32,431
and how we can also
manipulate and control

520
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:34,893
the neurons in the mouse
during behavior.
