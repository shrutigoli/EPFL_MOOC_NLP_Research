1
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:09,114
In the last video we discussed
optical techniques

2
00:00:09,114 --> 00:00:10,789
for measuring brain function.

3
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:14,881
And we found that this provided
many exciting opportunities

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:19,772
for measuring neuronal activity
at a large number of different scales.

5
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:22,488
There are however, 
also many limitations

6
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:25,534
to optical measurements
of neuronal activity,

7
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:27,756
perhaps the most obvious one

8
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:30,512
is that light doesn't penetrate
very far into the brain,

9
00:00:30,512 --> 00:00:34,334
and so, imaging below 
1 millimeter depth inside the brain,

10
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,117
is extremely difficult 
unless one is prepared to take

11
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:40,947
some more invasive techniques
like endoscopy.

12
00:00:41,514 --> 00:00:45,208
Equally, if we think about
two-photon calcium imaging

13
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:48,102
as a way to resolve 
action potential firing

14
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:49,937
in individual neurons,

15
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,446
it turns out that the temporal resolution,

16
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,296
because it's a scanning technique,

17
00:00:54,296 --> 00:00:55,765
is relatively low.

18
00:00:55,765 --> 00:00:59,716
And typically one has something like
100 millisecond temporal resolution

19
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:03,096
and perhaps not even the ability
to see every spike.

20
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,499
Most of the calcium signals 
that are reported at the moment,

21
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,940
are probably from bursts 
of action potentials.

22
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,018
So although there's enormous 
excitement about

23
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,982
imaging the brain in action,

24
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:17,493
there are also many limitations.

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,738
Whereas, electrophysiology
is a much more invasive technique

26
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:26,125
that involves the introduction
of an electrode into the brain,

27
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,426
it also has a number of advantages.

28
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:33,813
The temporal resolution 
of electrophysiology is unsurpassed,

29
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:37,066
and it's easy to record 
signals at several kHz,

30
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,017
and so, we can define neuronal activity

31
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,155
with millisecond and 
submillisecond resolution.

32
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:45,081
Equally, it's relatively easy 
to insert electrodes

33
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:47,626
into any desired part of the brain,

34
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:50,256
and so, we're not limited to studying

35
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:53,444
the upper layers of the neocortex.

36
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,606
If we insert an electrode into the brain,

37
00:01:56,606 --> 00:01:59,243
it could land either inside a cell,

38
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:01,696
in which case we'd have 
an intracellular recording

39
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,200
of membrane potential.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,699
Or, it could land in the
extracellular space.

41
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:10,499
And it turns out that are interesting
electrophysiological signals

42
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,816
in both of these compartments.

43
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,679
It turns out that 
intracellular recording

44
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:18,686
is much more difficult
than extracellular recording.

45
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:23,325
And we begin by thinking about
extracellular signals in this video.

46
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:27,435
If we imagine taking 
either a glass electrode

47
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:29,899
filled with extracellular fluid,

48
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:34,037
or perhaps a metal electrode
that has a small metal tip,

49
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,070
then we insert that into the brain,

50
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,022
and if it lands in 
the extracellular space,

51
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,823
then we'll record
an extracellular potential.

52
00:02:41,823 --> 00:02:45,116
Now to date we've considered
the extracellular space

53
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:49,528
as being at zero millivolts 
and isopotential.

54
00:02:49,528 --> 00:02:51,948
It turns out that that's not quite true.

55
00:02:51,948 --> 00:02:56,047
And the reason is somehow 
intuitively gathered

56
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:59,401
if we look at this electron micrograph.

57
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:02,789
The extracellular space 
that's drawn in here blue,

58
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,307
and surrounding 
the cell compartments,

59
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:10,139
has actually got relatively 
narrow diameters.

60
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,968
Of course, it extends 
throughout the entire brain

61
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:16,658
and so the blue forms one
single extracellular compartment

62
00:03:16,658 --> 00:03:21,023
that accounts for about 20 percent 
of the volume of the neuropil.

63
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:24,009
But nonetheless, 
the individual conduits

64
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:27,130
through which extracellular
currents need to flow,

65
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,119
is actually relatively small.

66
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:31,013
And so, there's some 
resistance involved

67
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,030
in terms of extracellular currents.

68
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,698
And if there's a resistance in currents

69
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:38,425
then there must also be
potential differences

70
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:41,700
across space in the extracellular field.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,990
And so if we insert this electrode
into the extracellular space,

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,731
and we measure the potential
relative to some remote area of the brain,

73
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:53,831
it turns out that we'll see potentials
that change over time.

74
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,920
And there are two different 
types of potentials

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,271
that are measured extracellularly.

76
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:03,053
One type of potential results 
from synaptic transmission.

77
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:05,076
And so here we see a synapse,

78
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:06,980
and if glutamate is being released here,

79
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,553
this will then activate AMPA receptors,

80
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:12,202
and there'll be synaptic 
currents that flow in.

81
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,068
And that synaptic current of course,

82
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,943
needs to come from 
the extracellular space.

83
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:21,898
And so there's a flow of current
from the extracellular space

84
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,086
into the cell,

85
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:25,217
and so that could then be measured

86
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:30,037
through a change in potential
in the extracellular field.

87
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:33,223
If many synapses 
are active simultaneously,

88
00:04:33,223 --> 00:04:38,028
then we'll see something on
our extracellular recording electrode

89
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:42,723
that samples a volume 
of something like 50 micrometers

90
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,207
from around the recording tip.

91
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,309
So that's one type of potential
that's measured

92
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,778
in the so called 
local field potential.

93
00:04:51,778 --> 00:04:54,956
And that's dominated
by synaptic potentials.

94
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:59,380
Another type of signal is when
the cell fires an action potential.

95
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,618
And particularly around the soma,

96
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:06,212
there's a large number of 
voltage-gated sodium channels

97
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:07,762
and potassium channels,

98
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:10,178
because the surface area is so large,

99
00:05:10,178 --> 00:05:13,884
this creates a large, fast,
inward current.

100
00:05:13,884 --> 00:05:16,312
On the rising phase 
of the action potential,

101
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:18,064
sodium floods into the cell

102
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:22,467
and again, those potentials
are coming from extracelluar space

103
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,675
and can be detected here in our
extracellular recording electrode.

104
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:30,822
Again, on the repolarizing phase,
potassium leaves the cell,

105
00:05:30,822 --> 00:05:34,184
and again, that creates current flow
in the extracellular space,

106
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:35,644
causing potentials,

107
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,909
and we see small signals 
in the extracellular space

108
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:44,225
typically around 
1 millivolt in amplitude

109
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:47,746
but that depends very heavily
on where that tip of the electrode is,

110
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,450
relative to the somatic location.

111
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:54,411
So extracellularly, we can record
local field potentials

112
00:05:54,411 --> 00:05:58,962
that are summated, averaged
synaptic potentials

113
00:05:58,962 --> 00:06:01,818
within a given volume of the brain.

114
00:06:01,818 --> 00:06:06,325
And action potentials that 
relate to the firing of spikes,

115
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:09,419
and individual nerve cells
that are very close

116
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,189
to the recording tip 
of your electrode.

117
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,091
Here is an example 
of an extracellular recording

118
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:19,956
of action potential firing
in an awake behaving mouse.

119
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:22,129
Similar to the imaging situation,

120
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:25,047
it's easiest to record 
in head-restrained mice.

121
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:27,632
And so here is the implanted 
metal head holder

122
00:06:27,632 --> 00:06:29,848
the head of the mouse is held still,

123
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:34,131
the neurons are moving 
less than a few microns inside

124
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:36,176
this awake behaving animal,

125
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,668
We can insert our electrode,
in this case a glass electrode,

126
00:06:39,668 --> 00:06:41,621
that we move into the brain,

127
00:06:41,621 --> 00:06:44,115
we touch some cellular membranes,

128
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:48,070
we move around until we find cells
that fire action potentials.

129
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,350
That can typically take
a bit of searching.

130
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,203
The local field potential
is always there

131
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:55,366
as soon as you put 
the electrode into the brain.

132
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:57,616
But finding cells
that fire action potentials

133
00:06:57,616 --> 00:07:00,283
can sometimes take a bit of hunting.

134
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:05,853
The animal here is trained to perform
a very simple sensory motor task.

135
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,128
We stimulate the whisker,

136
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,614
that's at this orange time,

137
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,207
that drives some action 
potential firing in the brain,

138
00:07:14,207 --> 00:07:17,157
we're recording in the 
somatosensory barrel cortex,

139
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:21,173
where the whisker pathway 
signals to in the neocortex.

140
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,007
Some action potentials are fired.

141
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,015
And we can resolve 
these action potentials

142
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,411
with millisecond temporal resolution.

143
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:31,410
And so we can follow here, 
a series of five action potentials

144
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,322
that are evoked by 
the whisker stimulation

145
00:07:34,322 --> 00:07:38,731
and at some later time,
the animal licks from this reward spout,

146
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,414
when monitoring movements
of this with piezo film

147
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:43,568
and we see the tongue 
contacting here

148
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:46,007
and reward is being delivered.

149
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,393
This is what this animal 
was trained to perform,

150
00:07:48,393 --> 00:07:51,995
and so we can correlate 
the spiking activity in the brain

151
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:54,585
with the behavioral 
performance of the animal.

152
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:56,887
And sometimes the animal won't lick,

153
00:07:56,887 --> 00:08:01,804
and it turns out less spikes 
are fired in the brain at that time.

154
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:06,008
And so we can begin to correlate
the action potential firing in the brain

155
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:07,832
with the behavior from the animal,

156
00:08:07,832 --> 00:08:10,147
fulfilling one of our needs,

157
00:08:10,147 --> 00:08:12,970
in terms of getting a causal 
and mechanistic understanding

158
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,216
of how the brain works.

159
00:08:15,216 --> 00:08:18,496
Now because extracellular 
recordings are technically,

160
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:21,093
relatively easy to carry out,

161
00:08:21,093 --> 00:08:26,124
it's possible to record in parallel
from many individual electrodes.

162
00:08:26,124 --> 00:08:29,296
And so scientists have 
developed electrode arrays

163
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:33,107
where it becomes possible to record
from many individual sites

164
00:08:33,107 --> 00:08:34,417
at the same time.

165
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,428
This is the so called Utah array

166
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:42,846
that has 10 by 10 electrodes
spaced at 400 micrometers apart,

167
00:08:42,846 --> 00:08:48,050
so each electrode tip here,
is 400 micrometers away from each other.

168
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,740
And the exposed metal surface here,
on the tip of the electrode,

169
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,270
is where the potentials 
are being recorded.

170
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,640
And of course, each one of these
is then being fed into an amplifier

171
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,286
and out come action potential waveforms

172
00:09:03,286 --> 00:09:06,131
with millisecond temporal precision.

173
00:09:06,131 --> 00:09:10,282
And so we can now measure across
many millimeters of brain activity

174
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:15,123
the action potential firing of cells
near to these recording tips.

175
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:21,193
And this recording technology,
has already been tested in humans,

176
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,282
in patients that have Tetraplegia.

177
00:09:24,282 --> 00:09:28,073
and there's a remarkable video
that I encourage you to look at

178
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:32,633
associated with the publication
of Hochberg et al. in 2012,

179
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:36,861
where they explain how they use
this electrode array

180
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:40,485
as a neuroprosthesis
for driving a robotic arm.

181
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:43,715
And a Tetraplegic woman
has her first drink of coffee

182
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,399
by controlling the robot 
through her neuronal activity

183
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,686
and without any of her own 
muscle activity.

184
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:54,041
So do have a look at this video 
if you have time.

185
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:58,247
The electrode spacing here,
is relatively far.

186
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:02,315
400 micrometers means 
there's a lot of neuronal tissue

187
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,693
in-between these electrode sites
that we have no access to

188
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:09,090
from the electrophysiological data
from this electrode array.

189
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:11,275
And so, scientists have been 
working to make

190
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:14,051
higher density recording probes

191
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,492
and in particular, 
there's been a focus

192
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:21,288
on silicon wafer probes
where micro wires can be drawn in

193
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,817
and exposed metal recording sites

194
00:10:23,817 --> 00:10:26,553
can be placed 
at relatively high density.

195
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,037
And in this particular probe,

196
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,712
the individual recording sites

197
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,610
are around 50 micrometers
away from each other.

198
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,552
And now we're getting close
to the scale of individual neurons.

199
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,664
You can imagine a nerve cell
being located somewhere around here,

200
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:42,441
it would be a bit smaller 
than I've drawn,

201
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,091
firing an action potential,

202
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,379
and the action potential signal
might be detected

203
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,942
on multiple of these electrodes.

204
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:51,888
In fact, that's what you see here.

205
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:55,351
The purple traces here
are recorded simultaneously

206
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,147
and you'll see that there's
an action potential waveform

207
00:10:58,147 --> 00:11:00,291
that's being recorded simultaneously

208
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,252
on multiple different electrodes.

209
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,912
And that allows then, one to triangulate,

210
00:11:04,912 --> 00:11:08,101
and try to decipher the different
action potential waveforms

211
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:09,545
from many different neurons,

212
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:11,653
sitting close to these 
different recording sites.

213
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,343
And then one can then try
and extract information

214
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:17,255
from many neurons
that are sitting in the vicinity

215
00:11:17,255 --> 00:11:19,886
of this silicon recording probe.

216
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:25,557
So using multichannel
extracellular recordings,

217
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:28,953
it's possible to find and define
the spike times

218
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,624
of many different neurons

219
00:11:30,624 --> 00:11:33,153
with millisecond temporal precision

220
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:36,450
in the living and behaving
mammalian brain.

221
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:39,949
Importantly, these technologies
can also be applied

222
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,295
to freely moving animals.

223
00:11:41,295 --> 00:11:44,141
And so one can study a variety
of different behaviors

224
00:11:44,141 --> 00:11:47,547
using these extracellular
recording techniques.

225
00:11:48,316 --> 00:11:50,324
However, if we want 
to get a causal

226
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:53,135
and mechanistic understanding
on how the brain works,

227
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:54,378
we need to understand,

228
00:11:54,378 --> 00:11:57,866
what makes individual nerve cells
fire action potentials.

229
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:01,098
And for that we need access
to the membrane potential.

230
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,797
We need intracellular recordings.

231
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:07,271
In turns out that the whole-cell
recording technique

232
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:10,307
that we've already seen
working in brain slices

233
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:13,195
also turns out to work well in <i>in vivo</i>.

234
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:16,277
And so we can drill holes in the skull,

235
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,827
make a so called craniotomy

236
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,727
lower glass electrodes,

237
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:24,497
filled now with a potassium-filled
intracellular solution.

238
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:28,574
We move that electrode up
onto an individual neuron,

239
00:12:28,574 --> 00:12:29,738
we suck onto it,

240
00:12:29,738 --> 00:12:31,428
we get the gigaseal,

241
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:34,431
we then break into the whole-cell 
recording configuration,

242
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,355
and presumably, because 
of the mechanical stability

243
00:12:38,355 --> 00:12:41,038
of the whole-cell
recording configuration

244
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:43,554
this also turns out 
to work remarkably well

245
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,470
<i>in vivo</i>, in awake, 
behaving animals,

246
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,239
and so, although the brain
is moving around by a few microns,

247
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,634
it's possible to record 
membrane potential

248
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:56,652
with very high quality
in awake, behaving animals.

249
00:12:56,652 --> 00:12:59,994
Another nice feature of the <i>in vivo</i> 
whole-cell recording technique

250
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:03,657
is that we can fill the cell with dye.

251
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,812
And so the intracellular 
solution in the pipette,

252
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:09,764
also fills the cell 
that we're recording from,

253
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:12,352
that means we can 
visualize the structure

254
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:15,632
and identify what cell 
it is we're recording from.

255
00:13:15,632 --> 00:13:18,921
And then this particular example,
we're recording from

256
00:13:18,921 --> 00:13:20,512
a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell

257
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:25,253
located in the C2 barrel column
of mouse primary somatosensory cortex.

258
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:29,289
And it turns out that the membrane
potential fluctuations

259
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:32,604
that are recorded from the cell
when an animal is awake

260
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,702
but not doing anything,

261
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:36,739
not performing any task,

262
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:40,567
there are a variety of interesting 
membrane potential dynamics

263
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,336
that can be recorded.

264
00:13:43,174 --> 00:13:45,161
There are membrane 
potential fluctuations

265
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,111
that are occurring on 
relatively long time scales

266
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:50,417
so it's worth looking here 
at the time scale--

267
00:13:50,417 --> 00:13:51,524
this is one second.

268
00:13:51,524 --> 00:13:53,512
So there are fluctuations 
that are occurring

269
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,165
on several second time scale.

270
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,379
And these are huge in amplitude.

271
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,027
So this is 20 milivolts on the Y axis,

272
00:14:00,027 --> 00:14:01,937
and so the fluctuations here,

273
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:05,087
are from something like
minus 70 to minus 50 millivolts

274
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:08,667
so the membrane potential,
swings some 20 to 30 millivolts

275
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:10,878
on this time scale in seconds.

276
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:14,358
And there are also much faster
changes in membrane potential.

277
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:17,089
So here, the membrane 
potential hyperpolarizes

278
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,629
by more than 20 millivolt
in just a few milliseconds.

279
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:23,887
And so, membrane 
potential fluctuations,

280
00:14:23,887 --> 00:14:27,421
on a large scale of many 
tens of millivolt,

281
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,279
occur on a variety of timescales,

282
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,485
both slow at the second time scale,

283
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:34,270
and also on the millisecond timescale.

284
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,831
These membrane 
potential fluctuations

285
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:40,474
are largely being driven
by the synaptic inputs

286
00:14:40,474 --> 00:14:42,681
that are arriving on these neurons.

287
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,383
And so we know that 
there are many surrounding cells

288
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,547
around the cell,

289
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:50,332
some of which are 
synaptically connected

290
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:52,753
and here would be 
a glutamatergic input,

291
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:54,666
and from previous studies we know

292
00:14:54,666 --> 00:15:00,193
that the unitary EPSPs
that are arriving from nearby cells

293
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:03,713
typically have an amplitude 
of around one millivolt,

294
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:07,177
and they last some 
10 milliseconds or so.

295
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:10,457
We also know that 
there are GABAergic neurons

296
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:14,705
sitting around that release GABA
and inhibit this neuron,

297
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,784
and they typically have
slightly longer time courses,

298
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,210
also of around one millivolt in amplitude

299
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,102
and perhaps some 10 to 20 milliseconds.

300
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:28,896
And these unitary events,
are then arriving across

301
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:31,518
a somatodendritic arborization of the cell

302
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:33,437
driving the membrane potential

303
00:15:33,437 --> 00:15:38,892
up and down through this neuronal
computation of summation

304
00:15:38,892 --> 00:15:41,162
of postsynaptic potentials.

305
00:15:41,162 --> 00:15:44,089
And every now and then,
the membrane potential

306
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,838
reaches the action potential threshold.

307
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:50,380
And when it hits threshold,
an action potential is emitted,

308
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,734
driven by the voltage-gated
sodium channels,

309
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:56,259
repolarized by voltage-gated
potassium channels.

310
00:15:56,259 --> 00:16:00,898
And those action potentials,
in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells

311
00:16:00,898 --> 00:16:03,209
turn out to be relatively rare events.

312
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:07,623
We have a mean 
action potential firing rate,

313
00:16:07,623 --> 00:16:09,360
of a around 1 Hz.

314
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,359
And we have median firing rates
of around 0.1 Hz.

315
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,892
when mice are resting.

316
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:20,735
This implies that there are a few cells

317
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,051
that are firing many action potentials

318
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:27,001
and most of the cells that are firing
very, very few action potentials.

319
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,051
And we'll return 
to thinking a bit about

320
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:33,853
what makes excitatory pyramidal cells
fire an action potential

321
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:38,387
First, we'll think about these 
membrane potential fluctuations

322
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:41,264
that we see here in one individual cell.

323
00:16:41,264 --> 00:16:44,402
And when we see 
this pattern of fluctuations,

324
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,941
we immediately wonder 
what's happening

325
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:48,682
in all the other nearby cells.

326
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:52,496
Are these fluctuations happening 
independently in nearby cells?

327
00:16:52,496 --> 00:16:55,250
Or, is there some degree of synchrony?

328
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,593
In order to resolve that question,
we made dual whole-cell recordings,

329
00:16:59,593 --> 00:17:01,737
where we're recording both
from a black cell,

330
00:17:01,737 --> 00:17:03,103
and a blue cell.

331
00:17:03,103 --> 00:17:05,035
And here, we're filming
the behavior of the animal,

332
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,791
at the beginning of the recording
with the animal sitting still,

333
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:11,405
and now it's beginning to actively
move its whiskers around.

334
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,107
And this is a so-called
active sensing system

335
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,520
where the animal is scanning
its immediate environment

336
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,915
looking for objects to contact.

337
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,925
While the animal sits still,

338
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,582
and is not moving its whiskers here,

339
00:17:24,582 --> 00:17:27,631
at the beginning of the video,
cell one and cell two,

340
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,460
are hyperpolarizing and depolarizing

341
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,367
almost synchronously 
with each other.

342
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,969
While the animal is moving 
its whiskers however,

343
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:39,546
the membrane potential fluctuations
have lower variance,

344
00:17:39,546 --> 00:17:41,577
the slow fluctuations are gone,

345
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,316
and if we now look carefully

346
00:17:43,316 --> 00:17:46,087
at the membrane potential
of the black and blue trace,

347
00:17:46,087 --> 00:17:49,510
you might see that they're 
more independent from each other

348
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,991
during this so called 
whisking period,

349
00:17:51,991 --> 00:17:54,679
compared to when the animal is quiet.

350
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,178
And here, at the end of the video,
the animal stops moving its whiskers,

351
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,129
returns to quiet wakefulness,

352
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:04,096
and the slow, highly synchronous
fluctuations reappear.

353
00:18:04,732 --> 00:18:08,941
Here's that same data 
shown as a still image,

354
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:12,471
and again, you see the two
membrane potential fluctuations

355
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,284
that are highly synchronized.

356
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:17,224
When one cell depolarizes
so does the other.

357
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:20,288
then they both hyperpolarize 
synchronously

358
00:18:20,288 --> 00:18:24,036
action potentials however,
occur independently,

359
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,752
and in this particular trace,

360
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:28,791
only the black cell fires
two action potentials,

361
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,743
and the blue cell didn't 
fire action potentials.

362
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,961
We can look quantitatively
at the correlation

363
00:18:34,961 --> 00:18:36,655
of the membrane potentials.

364
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,484
And here you'll see 
that during the quiet phase,

365
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:43,135
there's a very high cross-correlation
of membrane potentials,

366
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:45,621
sitting at around 0.75,

367
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:48,242
and during this whisking phase,
where it's obvious

368
00:18:48,242 --> 00:18:52,458
that the membrane potential
fluctuations are less synchronized,

369
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:54,502
it's about half of that.

370
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:58,803
So we're down to somewhere around 
.3 in terms of the cross-correlation.

371
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,433
And that's for one particular recording,

372
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:05,307
but this turns out to be true
across many different recordings.

373
00:19:05,836 --> 00:19:08,898
And this looks like 
two different brain states.

374
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:13,025
When the animal is sitting quietly,
we pick any two cells,

375
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,805
and it turns out that they depolarize
and hyperpolarize synchronously.

376
00:19:17,076 --> 00:19:20,348
When the animal is actively 
exploring its environment,

377
00:19:20,348 --> 00:19:21,857
those fluctuations are gone,

378
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:26,459
and we get the so called the so-called
desynchronized active brain state.

379
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:29,152
We think that these measurements
that have been made

380
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:31,718
in the whisker system of the mouse,

381
00:19:31,718 --> 00:19:36,583
may have some relevance
to the very first human recordings

382
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,106
of an electroencephalogram.

383
00:19:39,699 --> 00:19:43,677
Hans Berger in 1929
reported a very interesting pattern

384
00:19:43,677 --> 00:19:47,436
of activity across the occipital cortex
of human subjects.

385
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,379
When the subjects were relaxed
with their eyes closed,

386
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:56,439
he would see large amplitude
slow fluctuations,

387
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:58,571
so-called alpha waves,

388
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:02,861
recorded in the EEG 
of the human subjects.

389
00:20:03,055 --> 00:20:07,322
When the subjects were alert,
looking around with their eyes open,

390
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:09,258
investigating the world around them,

391
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,571
those slow fluctuations disappeared.

392
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:14,145
And you could see rapid transitions

393
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:18,219
comparing situations where
the alert subject

394
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:21,547
went into a relaxed state
with eyes closed.

395
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,013
The fast fluctuations transform

396
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:28,366
into slow, highly 
synchronous alpha waves.

397
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,045
And we think that's similar
to what we're observing

398
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:32,466
in the whisker system.

399
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:35,542
When the animal is siting still,
and not moving its whiskers,

400
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:38,645
we equate this 
to the eyes closed situation.

401
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:40,542
The mouse is siting there relaxed,

402
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,693
not particularly interested
in whisker sensory information.

403
00:20:43,693 --> 00:20:46,964
And the brain goes into
slow, relaxed brain states,

404
00:20:46,964 --> 00:20:50,393
with slow, large amplitude
oscillations in individual neurons,

405
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,534
we now know those are highly 
synchronous with nearby neurons,

406
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:57,255
and that gives rise
to a local field potential

407
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:59,793
because of the highly 
correlated synaptic inputs

408
00:20:59,793 --> 00:21:03,655
arriving on any cell
you care to look at here.

409
00:21:03,655 --> 00:21:06,386
And so we see something
in the local field potential,

410
00:21:06,386 --> 00:21:10,119
and even outside with
the electroencephalogram,

411
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:13,592
we can also record something
that has some correlation

412
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:16,610
to membrane potential
and the local field potential.

413
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,679
When the animal is actively
exploring its world

414
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,529
by moving its whiskers
in the so called whisking state,

415
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:25,555
we think this is similar
to the actively exploring human,

416
00:21:25,555 --> 00:21:28,739
with the eyes open, 
looking at the world around them.

417
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:30,620
In the mouse situation,

418
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,981
this results in a desynchronized state,
low membrane potential variance,

419
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,705
low variance in the local field potential,

420
00:21:37,705 --> 00:21:39,811
the slow oscillations have disappeared,

421
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:42,863
and that's because at
the level of individual cells

422
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:46,101
there is lower fluctuations
in membrane potential

423
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,415
and in addition,
these fluctuations here,

424
00:21:48,415 --> 00:21:51,311
are now less synchronized
with all its surrounding cells,

425
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:54,652
so that tends to cancel out
in the local field potential,

426
00:21:54,652 --> 00:21:57,833
giving rise to a more flat, so-called

427
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,883
desynchronized local field potential 
and electroencephalogram.

428
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:06,877
And so by recording in individual 
and dual recordings of cells

429
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:09,108
in awake, behaving mice,

430
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,912
we think we've come up
with a cellular explanation

431
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,909
for some of the first
human EEG recordings

432
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,515
that reveal profound brain state changes

433
00:22:17,515 --> 00:22:20,342
depending upon the behavior of the human.

434
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:22,973
And we now see 
the same thing in mice

435
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,025
depending on the
behavior of the mice,

436
00:22:25,025 --> 00:22:27,567
there are also obvious
brain state changes.

437
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,479
And now in mice, we can of course
go and look mechanistically

438
00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:33,508
and try to understand 
what's different

439
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,591
about these two 
different brain states.

440
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,163
Using membrane potential recordings,

441
00:22:38,163 --> 00:22:40,488
we can also study what's happening

442
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:42,696
to neuronal membrane potential

443
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,240
that drives action potential firing.

444
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,500
And so here,

445
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,887
we now look in the black cell 
that we're recording from.

446
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,716
We record the action potentials
that occurred in that cell,

447
00:22:53,716 --> 00:22:55,887
and we align them all at time zero,

448
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,894
and we generate the 
spike-triggered average waveform.

449
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:04,458
When we do that we see
that there's a large depolarization

450
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:09,031
in the cell immediately before
it hits action potential threshold.

451
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:14,069
On average, it turns out,
excitatory neurons in layer 2/3

452
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:16,002
of mouse barrel cortex at least,

453
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:20,430
depolarize by 10 millivolts
in the last 20 milliseconds

454
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,985
before they hit action 
potential threshold.

455
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,983
So there's an important
depolarization that arrives

456
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:28,261
immediately before
action potential threshold

457
00:23:28,261 --> 00:23:31,223
on that tens of millisecond timescale.

458
00:23:31,223 --> 00:23:35,403
Now if you look at the second cell
that we're recording simultaneously,

459
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:38,140
it turns out that the 
action potential firing

460
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,554
in the nearby cell is uncorrelated,
and so in general,

461
00:23:42,156 --> 00:23:45,214
although the membrane
potential fluctuations of neurons

462
00:23:45,214 --> 00:23:46,664
are highly correlated,

463
00:23:46,664 --> 00:23:49,532
it turns out that action 
potential firing in the neocortex

464
00:23:49,532 --> 00:23:51,705
is relatively asynchronous,

465
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:56,970
and that there's no obvious correlation
in the action potential firing times.

466
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,334
If you look at the membrane 
potential of the blue cell,

467
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:02,733
it turns out
that the membrane potential here

468
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,377
isn't depolarizing very much

469
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:07,287
at the time when the cell
that fires an action potential

470
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:09,926
depolarizes by some 10 millivolts.

471
00:24:09,926 --> 00:24:12,354
And so there's some 
highly specific input

472
00:24:12,354 --> 00:24:14,113
that arise in the cell that fires,

473
00:24:14,113 --> 00:24:17,625
that doesn't arrive in 
the neighboring nearby cells,

474
00:24:17,806 --> 00:24:22,471
and that's what then drives
highly specific action potential firing

475
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:26,671
with asynchronous firing
in nearby cells.

476
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:29,240
How might that come about?

477
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:34,527
Well, we can return and think
a little bit about neuronal networks

478
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:37,376
that we've already studied
in the neocortex.

479
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:41,477
We know that the synaptic 
connectivity of excitatory cells

480
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:45,164
is something like 10 percent
of its nearest neighbors.

481
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:48,750
And most of the synaptic connections
that we've observed

482
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,581
if we think about the histogram
of the amplitude distributions,

483
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:55,330
most of those synaptic 
connections are very small--

484
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,622
on the order of 100 microvolts or so.

485
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:02,209
And so most of the output
from a given cell

486
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,670
onto its synaptic connected neighbors,
is actually rather small.

487
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:12,665
But, there's a small population
of much larger excitatory potentials.

488
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,730
And if you now imagine that
we're recording from this cell,

489
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,711
and that's our black cell,
and it's firing an action potential,

490
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:23,171
we see that's it's depolarizing
by some 10 millivolts

491
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:25,913
in the 20 milliseconds 
before hitting spike.

492
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:30,551
And that could then result from
the firing of three nearby cells

493
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:34,096
that happen to have
these large, unitary inputs

494
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:36,162
that converge onto the cell here,

495
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:39,187
drive the spiking of that cell.

496
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,805
Now, other cells nearby
won't fire an action potential

497
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:48,156
because they won't have that 
very sparse, large amplitude connection.

498
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:51,913
So we probably only have these small, 
hundred microvolt connections

499
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,393
with the rest of the neuronal circuit.

500
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:59,029
And so other nearby cells,
might just see very little depolarization.

501
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:04,597
And so in this network which has
relatively sparse overall firing

502
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:07,352
of around 1 Hz mean firing rates,

503
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:11,605
we can imagine that the convergence
of just a few, big, unitary EPSPs

504
00:26:11,605 --> 00:26:14,476
could drive highly specific
action potential firing.

505
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:19,086
And that could be one way
in which specific firing of nerve cells

506
00:26:19,086 --> 00:26:24,066
can be driven within 
sparse activity networks.

507
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:27,296
And that's a hypothesis
that's currently being investigated

508
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,948
by a number of different researchers.

509
00:26:30,974 --> 00:26:34,954
In order to learn more about
the membrane potential dynamics

510
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:36,878
of specific cell types,

511
00:26:36,878 --> 00:26:41,273
we can begin to combine 
the power of mouse genetics,

512
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:45,599
two-photon microscopy
and whole-cell recordings.

513
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:49,199
Here we're looking inside 
the brain of a mouse

514
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,171
with a two-photon microscope,

515
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:55,258
and the green blobs that you see
are in fact, GABAergic neurons

516
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:57,926
that are labeled in this
transgenic mouse,

517
00:26:57,926 --> 00:27:02,338
in which all GABAergic neurons
express green fluorescent protein.

518
00:27:02,338 --> 00:27:06,888
So the green blobs are around 
10 micrometers in diameter,

519
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:08,791
and we're focusing up and down,

520
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:12,308
looking inside the brain
of an awake, behaving mouse

521
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,896
with a two-photon microscope.

522
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:18,894
You also see that there 
are two red recording electrodes,

523
00:27:18,894 --> 00:27:21,911
and these are whole-cell 
patch-clamp recording electrodes,

524
00:27:21,911 --> 00:27:24,714
that have been filled
with a red fluorescent dye

525
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,993
so we can see these 
recording electrodes

526
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:28,538
that have been guided in.

527
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:32,554
And two intracellular membrane 
potential recordings

528
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:35,959
have been made with these
patch-clamp recording electrodes,

529
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:39,468
and they're from two nearby
GABAergic neurons.

530
00:27:39,468 --> 00:27:43,374
And so here we can begin to study 
the membrane potential dynamics

531
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:47,594
in correlations of genetically-defined
populations of neurons

532
00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:51,814
in the mammalian cortex
during behavior.

533
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:54,359
We can then target
membrane potential recordings

534
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:00,976
to a variety of genetically-defined 
types of cells in the layer 2/3

535
00:28:00,976 --> 00:28:03,324
of the mouse barrel cortex.

536
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:06,566
And here we compare 
four different types of cells.

537
00:28:06,566 --> 00:28:09,964
Excitatory pyramidal cells
that we've been discussing

538
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:12,195
mainly over this video

539
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:14,633
that has slow membrane
potential fluctuations

540
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:18,197
and relatively low 
action potential firing rates.

541
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:23,873
We can record from parvalbumin-expressing
fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons.

542
00:28:23,873 --> 00:28:26,679
They also have slow membrane 
potential fluctuations

543
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:27,877
during quiet wakefulness.

544
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:30,917
But they now fire action potentials
at much higher rates.

545
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:34,011
There are non-fast spiking
GABAergic neurons

546
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:37,619
that have also slow fluctuations
and intermediate firing rates.

547
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,140
And then there are somatostatin-
expressing GABAergic neurons

548
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,190
that fire at relatively high rates
during quiet wakefulness,

549
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,515
and don't seem to have
the slow fluctuations

550
00:28:46,515 --> 00:28:49,588
that the other 
neuronal cell types have.

551
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,608
And the reason the somatostatin cells

552
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:54,528
might not have these slow oscillations,

553
00:28:54,528 --> 00:28:56,594
might relate to the fact 
that they receive

554
00:28:56,594 --> 00:28:59,756
strongly facilitating
glutamatergic inputs

555
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:02,209
as we discussed a few weeks ago.

556
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,287
Altogether, if we think about
the action potential firing rates

557
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,954
during quiet wakefulness,

558
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,624
we'll see that there's 
a variety of different

559
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:14,184
action potential firing rates
in these different types of cells.

560
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:17,515
The excitatory pyramidal cells,
as I've already mentioned,

561
00:29:17,515 --> 00:29:20,024
fire about 1 Hz action potential rates.

562
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,224
The parvalbumin at around 10 Hz.

563
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:24,555
And the other two types
of GABAergic neurons

564
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,692
are somewhere in between.

565
00:29:27,154 --> 00:29:32,297
Given that the excitatory neurons
make up some 85 percent of the population,

566
00:29:32,297 --> 00:29:36,199
and the GABAergic neurons make up 
only some sort of 15 percent

567
00:29:36,199 --> 00:29:37,395
of the population,

568
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:39,249
it turns out that if we look at this,

569
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:42,290
that the total number 
of glutamatergic spikes,

570
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,655
compared to the number
of GABAergic spikes,

571
00:29:44,655 --> 00:29:46,630
turns out to be roughly the same.

572
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,591
There's about 10 times 
as many excitatory neurons,

573
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:53,316
but the GABAergic neurons
fire about 10 times

574
00:29:53,316 --> 00:29:55,016
as many action potentials.

575
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:57,781
So spike for spike,
it's about the same.

576
00:29:58,449 --> 00:30:01,690
We can also see what happens
when we deliver a sensory stimulus.

577
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:05,295
We're recording in primary
somatosensory whisker cortex,

578
00:30:05,295 --> 00:30:09,013
and so we here deliver a brief 
one millisecond whisker stimulus.

579
00:30:09,013 --> 00:30:12,318
And that drives a depolarization
in excitatory cells,

580
00:30:12,905 --> 00:30:15,628
fast-spiking
parvalbumin-expressing cells,

581
00:30:15,628 --> 00:30:20,352
and also in the 5HT3R-expressing
non-fast-spiking GABAergic cells.

582
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:23,718
They all depolarize in response 
to the sensory stimulus.

583
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:26,835
The somatostatin cells, again,
seem to be the odd ones out.

584
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:30,281
They actually hyperpolarize
and reduce their firing rates

585
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:32,720
in response to this
particular stimulus.

586
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,455
And so it turns out,
that different cell-types

587
00:30:35,455 --> 00:30:37,468
have different types of behaviors,

588
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,381
and we can study that 
in detail by combining

589
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,790
mouse genetics, two-photon microscopy

590
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,593
and whole-cell recordings <i>in vivo</i>.

591
00:30:46,486 --> 00:30:49,967
So in this video we've seen
that there are two important types

592
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:51,607
of electrophysiological measurements

593
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:54,826
that can be made in the
awake, behaving, mammalian brain.

594
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:59,476
We can record extracellularly,
and pick up local field potentials

595
00:30:59,476 --> 00:31:02,405
that represent correlated
synaptic potentials

596
00:31:02,405 --> 00:31:04,518
near to the recording electrode.

597
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:09,213
And we can see spiking activity
of neurons from the outside.

598
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:12,449
And because the extracelluar recordings
are relatively easy to make,

599
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:15,500
we can record in parallel
from many electrodes,

600
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,344
and thus, get a feeling
for the spiking activity

601
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,318
of networks of neurons

602
00:31:20,318 --> 00:31:22,897
with millisecond temporal resolution.

603
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,004
In order to understand 
how those spikes are driven,

604
00:31:26,004 --> 00:31:29,725
we can record intracellularly
with a whole-cell recording technique.

605
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:33,040
And that gives us then
access to synaptic potentials

606
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,159
and some causal 
and mechanistic insight

607
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,175
into what's driving membrane 
potential fluctuations,

608
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:41,042
and what drives action potential firing.

609
00:31:41,042 --> 00:31:46,214
By combining mouse genetics to get
fluorescently-labeled specific cell-types,

610
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:48,681
two-photon microscopy to see them,

611
00:31:48,681 --> 00:31:52,376
and whole-cell recordings that we
can target to individual nerve cells.

612
00:31:52,376 --> 00:31:54,026
We can also begin to see now,

613
00:31:54,026 --> 00:31:58,198
the neuronal activity of 
highly specific, gentically-defined,

614
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:00,309
populations of neurons.

615
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:04,677
So we have now seen that both optically 
and electrophysiologically

616
00:32:04,677 --> 00:32:07,095
we have quite interesting techniques

617
00:32:07,095 --> 00:32:10,613
for measuring brain function
during behavior.

618
00:32:10,613 --> 00:32:12,229
What we now need to do,

619
00:32:12,229 --> 00:32:14,879
if we want to get a causal
and mechanistic insight

620
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,607
into brain function,

621
00:32:16,607 --> 00:32:18,998
is to start taking control
of those neurons.

622
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:22,048
And that's what we'll learn
about in the next video.
