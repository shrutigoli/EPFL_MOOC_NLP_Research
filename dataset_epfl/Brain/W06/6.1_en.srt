1
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:08,094
We've now reached 
a turning point in our studies

2
00:00:08,094 --> 00:00:10,885
of the cellular mechanisms 
of brain function.

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,273
The purpose of brain function
is to govern behavior.

4
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:19,072
We must now see to what extent
the biophysical mechanisms

5
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:23,894
that we've studied over the last five weeks
are able to account for behavior.

6
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:28,754
Let's begin by briefly reviewing
what we've learned.

7
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:34,954
The brain is made of cells, each delimited
by a phospholipid bilayer.

8
00:00:36,313 --> 00:00:40,693
The cell membrane is impermeable to ions

9
00:00:41,443 --> 00:00:46,184
and so we can have charge separation
across the plasma membrane.

10
00:00:46,184 --> 00:00:49,779
The plasma membrane is
about five nanometers thick

11
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:55,244
and so there can be strong electric fields
across this plasma membrane.

12
00:00:55,244 --> 00:00:59,564
That gives rise to membrane potential
and the electrical signals

13
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:01,980
that we know underlie brain function.

14
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,699
Charge movement
across the plasma membrane

15
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:13,142
is mediated by ion channel proteins
that are inserted into the plasma membrane

16
00:01:13,142 --> 00:01:16,716
and they can have 
highly specific conductances

17
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:19,827
for one species of ion, for example.

18
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:27,338
These ion channels are not always open,
but rather, they are tightly regulated,

19
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:30,532
and they have a certain open probability.

20
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:34,016
Sometimes they're closed —
no current flow —

21
00:01:34,016 --> 00:01:37,338
and then they open and close again.

22
00:01:37,338 --> 00:01:40,841
That open probability
of these ion channels

23
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:43,697
determines the net flux of ions

24
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:48,639
and therefore the change in potential
across the plasma membrane.

25
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:54,421
The tight regulation of ion channels
underlies the ability

26
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,134
of electrical signals to occur
across the plasma membrane.

27
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:03,738
In particular, we considered a class
of voltage-gated ion channels

28
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:05,710
that's particularly useful

29
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,862
in terms of making
the brief action potential signals

30
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:13,806
that are an important way
of coding information in the brain.

31
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:19,770
The voltage-gated sodium channel
increases its open probability

32
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,690
steeply as the membrane potential
depolarizes more positive

33
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,812
to around -40 millivolts.

34
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:31,720
As the membrane potential depolarizes,
the open probability

35
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,786
of the voltage-gated sodium channel
increases — that in turn causes

36
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:41,389
more depolarization and that in turn
then increases the open probability

37
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,530
of the voltage-gated sodium channel,

38
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,038
generating the explosive depolarization

39
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:50,189
of the cell towards the 
sodium reversal potential.

40
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:56,682
The brief opening of the sodium channel,
its fast inactivation,

41
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,780
and the delayed activation
of the potassium conductance

42
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,333
drives repolarization and we're left 
with a brief all-or-none unitary signal,

43
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,489
the action potential,
lasting about one millisecond.

44
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:14,763
Nerve cells don't operate on their own;
they communicate with each other.

45
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:19,082
Through the action potential
that propagates down the axon,

46
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:24,273
invades specializations,
boutons, there's a release

47
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:26,521
of a neurotransmitter substance

48
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:31,181
that binds onto ligand-gated ion channels
in the postsynaptic neuron,

49
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:34,871
in turn causing a change
in the membrane potential

50
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,770
of that downstream neuron.

51
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:41,662
So the action potential in one cell,
lasting about one millisecond,

52
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:47,535
conveys a longer-lasting signal,
sub-threshold depolarization

53
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:51,638
or hyperpolarization lasting
some tens of milliseconds

54
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,556
interconnected downstream neurons.

55
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,800
The process of synaptic transmission
is highly plastic.

56
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,745
It depends on the previous history
of activity of that neuron

57
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:06,959
and also depends
upon the overall experience

58
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,690
of the animal.

59
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,123
So there's that interesting
synaptic plasticity

60
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:16,509
that occurs, and that in turn
appears to be the mechanism

61
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,971
underlying learning and memory.

62
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,669
So the individual neurons
communicate with each other

63
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,711
and each neuron receives
inputs from many hundreds of neurons

64
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:31,977
and in turn also delivers messages
to hundreds of neurons,

65
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:37,113
some of which are widely distributed
across the neuronal circuits of the brain.

66
00:04:37,822 --> 00:04:42,337
We thus need to begin to divide
the neurons and the types of neurons.

67
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:45,364
We know that there are 
excitatory glutamatergic neurons

68
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:49,466
that release glutamate and try
to excite their postsynaptic targets.

69
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:53,786
There are inhibitory GABAergic neurons
that release GABA

70
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,658
and try to inhibit their targets.

71
00:04:55,658 --> 00:04:57,910
There are neuromodulatory neurons

72
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:02,342
that release neuromodulators
that affect the dynamics and interactions

73
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:06,396
of the system as well as the plasticity
of these neuronal circuits,

74
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:10,859
and we need to deal then
with a great deal of complexity

75
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:16,423
as to where and how these neurons
communicate in highly specific patterns

76
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:19,095
and how they do so during behavior.

77
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:24,372
So if our goal is to obtain
a causal understanding of behavior,

78
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:28,588
we need to investigate brain function
at the level of individual neurons

79
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:31,929
and their synaptic interactions —
that's how we're going to get

80
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:35,264
a causal, mechanistic understanding —
and we need to do that

81
00:05:35,264 --> 00:05:37,239
within the complex neuronal networks

82
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:41,101
of the living mammalian brain
during behavior.

83
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:45,744
We need to see the action 
of the brain during action.

84
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:48,325
So how are we going to do that?

85
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,036
The first thing we need to be able to do
is to measure neuronal activity

86
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:57,903
in the living brain and to correlate it
directly with ongoing behavior.

87
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,292
At the level of cells and synapses,
there are two methods

88
00:06:04,292 --> 00:06:07,573
that so far have proved to be
extremely useful.

89
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:11,702
One is the electrophysiological approach,

90
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:15,689
where we introduce 
recording electrodes into the brain.

91
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:19,220
We've already seen 
the whole-cell patch-clamp recording

92
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,210
of membrane potential and currents

93
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,454
that has been applied <i>in vitro</i>
in brain slices.

94
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,242
It turns out that this method
can also be applied

95
00:06:29,242 --> 00:06:33,771
with small modifications
to study the brain in action —

96
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:36,070
<i>in vivo</i>, during behavior.

97
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:41,157
It also turns out to be possible
to make extracellular recordings

98
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:42,962
of action potential firing.

99
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:45,592
To date we've thought
of the extracellular solution

100
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:49,886
as being at zero millivolts
isopotential and invariant.

101
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:53,128
In fact, that turns out
not to be completely true,

102
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:56,274
and there are small changes
in the extracellular potentials

103
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,454
that can be recorded,

104
00:06:57,454 --> 00:06:59,971
and they can be recorded
relatively easily.

105
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:03,923
The inference of which cell
is firing action potentials

106
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,249
can also be made.

107
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,924
The extracellular recordings
are technically easier

108
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:13,288
than the intracellular recordings,
and so one can in parallel record

109
00:07:13,288 --> 00:07:16,520
from many neurons at the same time
and study network function

110
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,911
using extracellular recordings.

111
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:24,336
Electrophysiological measurements
are certainly proving useful

112
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,407
in correlating neuronal activity
with behavior.

113
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:31,951
However, in the electrophysiology,
we need to introduce

114
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,279
recording electrodes into the brain.

115
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,148
These recording electrodes
must have some size,

116
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:40,654
and that in turn perturbs the brain.

117
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,901
It's interesting to think
about other techniques

118
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:48,316
that might be less invasive,
and introducing photons

119
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:52,420
into the brain is one
of the most interesting techniques

120
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,921
that is being developed at the moment

121
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,395
for studying brain function
at high resolution.

122
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:03,045
So optical imaging techniques,
and in particular fluorescence microscopy,

123
00:08:03,045 --> 00:08:04,897
is turning out to be extremely interesting

124
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:09,162
in terms of getting high-resolution
structural and functional measurements

125
00:08:09,162 --> 00:08:12,653
of the brain, and at this time
this is possible to do

126
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:15,674
in the living brain
and correlate it with behavior.

127
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:20,028
In later videos of this week,
we'll study how we can apply

128
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:25,355
electrophysiological measurements
in video 6.3 and how we can apply

129
00:08:25,355 --> 00:08:28,502
optical methods for investigating

130
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:32,398
neuronal activity in video 6.4.

131
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,525
So we're beginning to have methods

132
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:39,117
for measuring and correlating
neuronal activity with behavior.

133
00:08:39,117 --> 00:08:42,163
That's absolutely essential
as a starting point.

134
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:46,104
But correlations 
don't necessarily imply causality,

135
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,302
and so if we want to investigate
the causal impact

136
00:08:49,302 --> 00:08:51,337
of a specific neuronal activity,

137
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:54,088
we need to specifically 
perturb that activity.

138
00:08:54,088 --> 00:08:58,640
We need to be able to take control
of the neurons and the neuronal circuits

139
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,786
and see what effect 
that has upon behavior.

140
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:06,082
That's turned out to be
an extremely difficult problem

141
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:09,718
to have highly specific
interventions in the brain.

142
00:09:09,718 --> 00:09:13,162
So typically, one has relied upon lesions,

143
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:18,970
brain damages, diseases, stimulation 
or pharmacological manipulations,

144
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,272
and all of these lack specificity
in space and time.

145
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:28,834
So it's been difficult to get
a real detailed information

146
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:33,134
about the causal impact
of specific types of neuronal activity.

147
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,036
Over the last years, there's been
a revolution in neuroscience

148
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,791
that's been driven by <i>optogenetics</i>,

149
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:44,100
a way in which we can control
neuronal activity by light.

150
00:09:45,124 --> 00:09:49,023
This occurs through expressing
specific light-sensitive proteins

151
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:52,909
that can then affect
the activity of specific nerve cells,

152
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:56,947
we can use genetics to put
these optogentic actuators

153
00:09:56,947 --> 00:09:59,839
in specific cell types, 
and we can then shine light

154
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,867
on specific neurons or parts of neurons
gaining high spatiotemporal resolution.

155
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,915
So there's a great deal of hope now
that we'll be able to make

156
00:10:08,915 --> 00:10:12,839
highly specific perturbations
during behavior,

157
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,191
and then we'll be able
to study the impact of that.

158
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:22,468
So if we're able to make 
measurements and perturbations

159
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,227
of highly specific neuronal activities,

160
00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:27,863
the next step is to try and see

161
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:30,750
how those measurements 
and perturbations fit together.

162
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,123
In order to do that, we need
to quantitatively model the phenomenon

163
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:38,986
and that then will give us
causal mechanistic insight

164
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,669
and allow us to test specific hypotheses.

165
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,390
Unfortunately, we currently have
a very incomplete understanding

166
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,920
of neuronal circuits
in the mammalian brain.

167
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,246
We're very far from having
a quantitative mechanistic understanding

168
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,292
of even the very simplest behaviors.

169
00:10:57,802 --> 00:11:01,811
So the starting point is far
from where we want to be.

170
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:06,829
Of course, the brain 
is highly interconnected,

171
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:10,289
so it's an extremely complex question

172
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:15,368
as to how we can quantitatively model
the neuronal networks of the brain.

173
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:18,939
There's a simplification
that we might be able to make.

174
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,750
Although many brain regions
are highly interconnected,

175
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,521
there's also a high degree of modularity.

176
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:30,284
So there are so-called small world networks
where neurons near to each other

177
00:11:30,284 --> 00:11:33,335
might be highly interconnected 
with each other but they will only have

178
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,359
sparse connections
to another part of the brain.

179
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:40,981
So we can think about local subnetworks
and it may be that we can get

180
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,858
detailed cellular and synaptic modeling
of these selected subnetworks

181
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:47,314
and model that,

182
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:51,651
and that is now becoming feasible
with the increases in computing power.

183
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,469
So there's some hope
that over the next decades —

184
00:11:57,469 --> 00:12:00,376
perhaps in our lifetimes —
we might be able to get

185
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:06,087
quantitative, causal, mechanistic
understanding of at least very simple forms

186
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:09,531
of brain function 
and their link to behavior.

187
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,059
As a cautionary note, I think
it's important to consider the limitations

188
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:16,832
of the scientific method.

189
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:22,607
These were clearly stated
by Karl Popper in his famous treatise

190
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:26,493
of 1934, <i>The logic of scientific discovery.</i>

191
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,103
He pointed out that we
can falsify hypotheses,

192
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:35,358
but we cannot prove them,
and so scientific progress

193
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:40,191
is at best a continual refinement
of our ideas as we make

194
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:43,984
more and more detailed measurements
and perturbations.

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,419
Here we've begun to think
about how we might put together

196
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:55,971
our biophysical knowledge
of how the components of the brain work

197
00:12:55,971 --> 00:13:01,638
in the context of behavior,
and most of the videos of this week

198
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:06,067
will deal with methods as to how
we might approach the problem

199
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:09,337
of linking the biophysics
of brain function

200
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:11,733
with animal behavior.

201
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,950
We've come across three
important steps that we need to make.

202
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,315
First we need to measure brain function,

203
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:22,222
and we need to do so
at the level of cells and synapses

204
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:28,076
and how the membrane potential changes
drives further action potential activity

205
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:30,616
in those neurons 
that we've been recording from.

206
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,498
So we need to make detailed measurements
of brain function at the level

207
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:37,522
of cells and synapses.

208
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,406
These measurements will allow us

209
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:45,310
to correlate neuronal activity 
with behavior.

210
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,107
But in order to reach causality,
we need to perturb brain function

211
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,587
and see what types of effects that causes.

212
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:55,994
We need to take control of the brain
and see what happens

213
00:13:55,994 --> 00:14:00,977
if we stimulate and inhibit
specific neurons within the brain

214
00:14:01,697 --> 00:14:05,044
in a highly controlled
spatiotemporal pattern.

215
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:11,494
If we can take control of these neurons
and measure the effects of the brain

216
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:15,065
and at the same time see
the behavioral consequences,

217
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:18,665
then we're getting to a position
where it becomes extremely interesting

218
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:22,850
to try to quantitatively model
and see to what extent

219
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,976
we've really got the right variables

220
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,825
and that we've made
the correct measurements

221
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:30,511
and that we really have
a causal and mechanistic understanding

222
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:34,282
of brain function,
including its link to behavior.

223
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:38,180
So in this week's videos,
we're going to take a look

224
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,271
at the methodology as to how
one might obtain a causal

225
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:46,941
and mechanistic insight
into brain function during behavior.
