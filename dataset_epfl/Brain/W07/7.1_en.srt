00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:10,017
Welcome to the final week 
of cellular mechanisms of brain function

2
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:13,057
We've come a long way 
since we began this course

3
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:17,809
where we discussed lipid membranes
and protein ion channels

4
00:00:18,097 --> 00:00:20,257
until last week 
when we discussed

5
00:00:20,257 --> 00:00:24,957
the methods for studying 
the mouse brain during behavior.

6
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:27,652
As we think about behavior,

7
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,813
It becomes apparent that we need
to understand motor control.

8
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:34,176
Behavior is nothing 
but muscle contractions

9
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:37,746
and the control of those 
muscular contractions

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,456
is the movement 
that we call behavior.

11
00:00:40,732 --> 00:00:44,332
And so, now we'll begin
thinking about motor control

12
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:46,142
and as we think 
about motor control

13
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:50,692
it becomes apparent 
that sensory input to motor control

14
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:53,132
is one of the major impacts.

15
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,972
We govern our lives,
our movements, our behaviors

16
00:00:56,972 --> 00:01:00,392
by thinking about the incoming 
sensory information.

17
00:01:00,392 --> 00:01:03,582
And so, sensory input 
to motor control centers

18
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:06,542
is a key way 
that determines behavior.

19
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:10,492
Equally important is 
to think about the converse

20
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:15,072
that motor control affects 
sensory input to the brain.

21
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,979
So, for example, if we think about 
how we look at the world around us

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:21,059
we make head and eye movements

23
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:24,729
and we select regions of interest
in the visual field

24
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:26,699
that we'd like to pay attention to.

25
00:01:26,865 --> 00:01:31,685
And so, as a first order approximation 
we choose the visual information,

26
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,683
that falls on the retina 
and that flows into the brain.

27
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:39,844
Equally, if we think about 
our sense of touch, it's very obvious

28
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:42,988
that the way that we move 
our hands and our fingertips

29
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:47,278
determines the tactile sensory 
information that we obtain,

30
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:52,458
so in order to get the information 
about the texture of an object

31
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,998
we need to stroke that object 
with our fingertips

32
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:57,198
and it's the movement of the finger

33
00:01:57,198 --> 00:02:00,558
that generates the flow 
of sensory information.

34
00:02:00,558 --> 00:02:06,228
So the sense of touch and vision 
are dominated to a large extent

35
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,408
by self-generated movements

36
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:12,328
that form the so-called
basis of <i>active sensing</i>

37
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:15,338
where we select the type of 
sensory information

38
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:19,888
we want to obtain by making 
specific goal-directed movements.

39
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:23,821
So we can think
of the basis of behavior

40
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,500
as a sensorimotor loop

41
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,516
which neither has
a beginning nor an end

42
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,860
but we can enter it at 
any point we want.

43
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,230
We can think about neuronal computations
that, of course, are influenced

44
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,094
by sensory information 
that's been gathered

45
00:02:39,094 --> 00:02:42,194
and that generates 
motor output behavior

46
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:46,134
and that motor output, of course, 
interacts with the real world.

47
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:48,284
We might move our hands 
against an object

48
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:51,704
or move our eyes and then 
the visual field will change

49
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,684
and give rise
to different sensory input

50
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:57,444
that then, in turn, influences 
the neuronal computation.

51
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:00,664
And in that way we have 
sensorimotor loops

52
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:04,284
that are the most important 
determinants of behavior.

53
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:08,275
In this video we'll consider
the mouse whisker system

54
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,015
which is one of the key systems 
being analyzed at the moment

55
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:13,785
for active sensing.

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,780
Mice are nocturnal animals,
they live in tunnels

57
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:20,948
and one way in which 
they can obtain spatial information

58
00:03:20,948 --> 00:03:25,018
about their immediate surroundings 
is by using their whiskers

59
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:29,017
which they actively move around 
to explore their environment.

60
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,590
And the first thing I'd like to show you
is a behavioral paradigm

61
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,271
where we can see just how
they use their whiskers

62
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:37,100
to get spatial information.

63
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,693
In the so called gap crossing task

64
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:42,179
that was developed 
by Hutson and Masterton

65
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:45,272
a mouse is placed on 
an elevated plataform.

66
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:48,460
It's in the dark 
under infrared illumination

67
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,550
and what the mouse needs to do

68
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,070
is to identify the location 
of a target platform,

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,620
where it needs to jump over 
and then when it does so,

70
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,800
it receives a reward.

71
00:03:59,924 --> 00:04:04,774
The gap between this two platforms 
is so large that the only way

72
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:08,158
that the mouse can identify 
the location of this target platform

73
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,818
is by using its whiskers 
to reach across this gap.

74
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:15,724
We're going to look at a movie 
where we'll film from above

75
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,094
and we'll see the silhouette 
of the mouse with its whiskers

76
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:22,554
stands on one platform 
and reaches across space

77
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,581
to touch a target platform

78
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:27,865
where it needs to jump to
to obtain its reward.

79
00:04:28,003 --> 00:04:31,113
So, here you see the mouse 
touching the target platform

80
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:33,213
and when it's built up 
sufficient confidence,

81
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:37,463
it jumps and now 
it's enjoying its snack.

82
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:40,827
now that all happened rather quickly, 
so, let's look at that

83
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:45,697
slowed down twenty times 
and zoomed in on this area

84
00:04:45,697 --> 00:04:50,817
where the animal's whiskers 
are contacting the target platform.

85
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:55,907
Now the individual movements 
of the whiskers become obvious

86
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,231
and you'll see that most of the time 
the whiskers move at the same time

87
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:02,941
both left and right and they move 
in concert with each other

88
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:06,410
but sometimes they become out of phase
and they move individually

89
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:09,797
and if one begins to quantify
the movements of the individual whiskers

90
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:12,111
you can actually see that each whisker

91
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,521
is individually under 
its own motor control.

92
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,784
So, clearly, if we're going to understand

93
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,574
how the animal perceives 
its environment here

94
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:23,494
and gets sensory information 
under these conditions

95
00:05:23,494 --> 00:05:28,954
it becomes important to look 
at the mechanisms driving motor control.

96
00:05:29,224 --> 00:05:33,454
So, how <i>does</i> the mouse 
control its whisker movements?

97
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,637
There are two important sets of muscles

98
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,597
that are involved in generating
whisker movements.

99
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:43,517
There are so-called intrinsic muscles 
shown here in green

100
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,949
that are located entirely 
within the whisker pad

101
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:53,196
and attached to each whisker 
is its own individual intrinsic muscle,

102
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:56,106
it attaches at the base of one follicle

103
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:59,796
and at the whisker behind it at the top.

104
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:03,796
When this muscle contracts 
the whisker pivots

105
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,354
around its insertion point
here in the skin

106
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:12,025
and is rotated anteriorly
in a protraction movement,

107
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,286
so the whisker moves forwards

108
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,141
through the contraction 
of this intrinsic muscle

109
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,603
and is pivoting around 
its insertion point.

110
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:25,488
So, the intrinsic muscle here, 
drives whisker protraction

111
00:06:25,566 --> 00:06:29,566
as the animal reaches out 
in front of it to touch an object.

112
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:33,963
The other important group of muscles 
are the so-called extrinsic muscles

113
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:37,713
that are anchored onto bone 
outside the whisker pad

114
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:40,773
and when they contract 
they pull the whiskers backwards.

115
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:43,583
So, these extrinsic muscles here 
are relatively superficial

116
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,111
in the whisker pad,

117
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:47,809
when they contract 
they pull the whiskers backwards

118
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:50,408
causing whisker retraction.

119
00:06:50,408 --> 00:06:54,148
So, we have intrinsic muscle 
that generates protraction

120
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:58,148
and we have extrinsic muscle 
that generates retraction of the whisker.

121
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,500
These muscles are 
under neuronal control.

122
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,780
So, each muscle is innervated by an axon
from a so-called motor neuron

123
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,113
and these motor neurons release
neurotransmitter onto the muscle.

124
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:17,145
And so, the junction between neurons
and muscle is a synapse,

125
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:21,049
a chemical synapse very similar 
to the synapses we've been thinking about

126
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,529
within the central nervous system.

127
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,805
At the neuromuscular junction
the neurotransmitter

128
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:30,705
that's being released 
is called acetylcholine.

129
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:33,534
And acetylcholine 
is released from synaptic vesicles

130
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,794
just like in the nervous system

131
00:07:35,794 --> 00:07:40,634
and it acts upon postsynaptic 
ligand-gated ion channels

132
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,581
so called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

133
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:47,741
So the acetylcholine is released 
from the motor neuron axon,

134
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:53,257
it activates the ligand-gated ion channel,
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.

135
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:58,567
That causes an influx of cations,
Sodium importantly,

136
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:02,958
causes a postsynaptic depolarization 
and muscle is also excitable.

137
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:06,978
So in fact, the muscle gets depolarized
and fires an action potential.

138
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:08,984
Just like a neuron would.

139
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:11,704
That action potential in the muscle

140
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:15,064
causes a rise in cytosolic 
calcium concentration

141
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:17,754
and that rise in calcium 
is what then drives

142
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:22,464
the biochemical reactions 
that cause muscular contraction.

143
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:27,148
So, action potentials here 
in the motor neurons

144
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:30,638
drive muscle contraction 
and can then move the whiskers

145
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:33,538
forwards or backwards 
and of course the same is true

146
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,858
across all the muscles in our body.

147
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:40,646
Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter
at the neuromuscular junction.

148
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:46,026
So now in order to understand 
how these whiskers are moved

149
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,816
we then clearly need to know

150
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,706
where the neurons are 
that innervate these muscles.

151
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:55,112
In order to localize 
where these circled motor neurons are,

152
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:58,222
the ones that directly innervate muscle,

153
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:01,022
we can use viral tools,

154
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:04,512
highly genetically engineered viruses

155
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:08,282
like the rabies virus here
that's been modified

156
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:12,742
through genetic engineering 
by Ian Wickersham and Ed Callaway.

157
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:17,986
If we inject a red variant
of rabies virus,

158
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:21,316
expressing so called 
mCherry fluorescent protein

159
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:26,436
into the extrinsic muscle, that then gets
taken up by the axonal junctions,

160
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:31,076
retrogradely transported along the axon
and then it labels the locations

161
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:35,186
of the neurons that project here 
where the motor neurons are.

162
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,159
We can also inject rabies virus 
into the intrinsic muscle

163
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,569
and label then the motor neurons 
that innervate the intrinsic muscle.

164
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,796
We can have two different variants.

165
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:48,886
We can have a red one for the extrinsic, 
a green one, green fluorescent protein,

166
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:51,846
injected into intrinsic muscle, 
so these are the pictures here:

167
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:55,406
the whisker pad, the injections
of virus here into the whisker pad

168
00:09:55,406 --> 00:09:58,786
labelling the axons here 
of the motor neurons

169
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:03,376
and here into the extrinsic muscle 
labelling again the motor neurons.

170
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:07,596
If we now cut sections here
of the brainstem,

171
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,986
we can then see the location 
of where the motor neurons are.

172
00:10:12,438 --> 00:10:17,308
So here's one of these coronal sections
here taken through the brainstem

173
00:10:17,308 --> 00:10:21,743
and here ipsilateral to the same side
where the muscles are

174
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,510
we see the locations of the cell bodies
of the motor neurons.

175
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:29,298
So these are now cholinergic neurons
so they release acetylcholine

176
00:10:29,298 --> 00:10:30,978
here onto the muscle

177
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:34,398
and this is the cell body and also,
of course, they have dendrites

178
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:36,938
all around here 
that are more difficult to see.

179
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:40,045
You can also see that the location

180
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,975
of the motor neurons 
for the extrinsic muscle

181
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,085
are in a slightly different location

182
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,775
to the motor neurons 
for the intrinsic muscle.

183
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,910
And this is an individual example

184
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,270
and this is a group representation

185
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,532
of where in general 
we find the extrinsic

186
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:58,440
and the intrinsic groups 
of motor neurons.

187
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,526
So here you can see 
one of the general principles

188
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,736
of organization of motor neurons.

189
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:07,736
And that is that the motor neurons 
that innervate a given muscle type

190
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:10,516
are located close 
to each other, in a cluster.

191
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:15,186
So these motor neuron pools 
innervate different muscles

192
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,896
and that's typical throughout 
the spinal cord and brainstem.

193
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:23,086
That the cholinergic motor neurons 
that innervate a given muscle

194
00:11:23,086 --> 00:11:27,098
are located close to each other 
in a tightly segregated region.

195
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:30,767
And here the two different muscles
that cause retraction

196
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:34,487
or protraction of the whisker 
are located in different areas

197
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,107
of the brainstem,

198
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:39,217
in the facial nucleus, 
where all the motor neurons are

199
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:41,887
that govern facial movements.

200
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:46,785
Now, in order to understand 
what controls action potential firing

201
00:11:46,785 --> 00:11:48,355
in these motor neurons,

202
00:11:48,355 --> 00:11:49,795
we need to look and see

203
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:52,305
where do they receive
their synaptic inputs.

204
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:55,405
So, like all other neurons, 
they have dendrites

205
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:59,405
and they receive glutamatergic 
and GABAergic and glycinergic input

206
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:02,825
distributed across 
their somatodendritic arborization

207
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,345
and the reason that these guys
fire action potentials

208
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:07,535
is because of the synaptic input
that they receive.

209
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:11,392
So we need to know 
what are the presynaptic neurons

210
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,142
to these motor neurons.

211
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:15,632
And the presynaptic neurons 
to motor neurons

212
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:17,622
are called premotor neurons.

213
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:21,899
These are the ones that give 
synaptic input onto motor neurons.

214
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,029
And we can use a trick 
with the rabies virus

215
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,689
to label the presynaptic neurons 
of the motor neurons.

216
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:35,649
So, as before, we inject the rabies virus 
to infect the motor neurons

217
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:38,419
and then we complement them 
with the missing factor

218
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:41,739
that allows them to jump 
just one synapse back

219
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:46,199
and then that labels the neurons 
that send synaptic input

220
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,971
onto the motor neurons.

221
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:50,261
And it turns out that 
premotor neurons

222
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:54,261
are widely distributed across the brain 
in many different brain regions.

223
00:12:54,261 --> 00:12:58,101
And that's true for the whisker system 
but it's true for all of our muscles.

224
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:03,111
There are many presynaptic neurons 
to any given motor neuron.

225
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:08,217
One of the hotspots for the location 
of premotor neurons

226
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:11,402
is sitting here, immediately
behind the facial nucleus

227
00:13:11,402 --> 00:13:13,062
where the motor neurons are located.

228
00:13:13,062 --> 00:13:15,752
And here we see 
a couple of sections

229
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:19,752
in coronal sections, 
immediately posterior

230
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,412
to the facial nucleus.

231
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,529
And you'll see that the red dot here 
correspond to the locations

232
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:30,539
of cell bodies of premotor neurons 
that innervate the extrinsic muscles

233
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:33,699
of these, generate retraction movements.

234
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:37,109
And here we've injected the rabies virus 
into the intrinsic muscle

235
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:41,109
and these are then the premotor neurons 
that drive protraction,

236
00:13:41,109 --> 00:13:44,969
contraction of the intrinsic muscles 
and forward movement of the whiskers.

237
00:13:44,969 --> 00:13:46,919
And you'll see there's 
an obvious difference

238
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:50,009
in the lay out 
of the neurons innervating

239
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,889
the retraction and the protraction
whisker muscles.

240
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:56,869
The retraction premotor neurons 
are located here

241
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,399
in the spinal trigeminal nucleus,

242
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,978
whereas the neurons 
that innervate the motor neurons

243
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:04,858
that give rise to protraction movements,

244
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:08,368
are set in here, in the reticular 
formation of the brainstem.

245
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:14,638
And so there are two separate locations 
for where premotor neurons are located.

246
00:14:15,381 --> 00:14:18,761
So one would expect then 
that if we stimulated these neurons

247
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:22,891
that would drive action potential firing 
in the facial nucleus motor neurons

248
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:27,943
that innervate the extrinsic muscle
and cause retraction of the whisker.

249
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,287
And so if we now put 
a stimulation electrode here

250
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:34,587
into the spinal trigeminal nucleus 
and we drive current through that,

251
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:38,571
it turns out indeed, it does cause 
a retraction of the whisker.

252
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:43,467
This is now a horizontal section 
through the brain somewhere around here

253
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:47,459
where we see the horizontal section 
through the reticular formation

254
00:14:47,459 --> 00:14:51,459
and spinal trigeminal here,
more laterally.

255
00:14:51,597 --> 00:14:54,187
We would expect 
that stimulating this area here

256
00:14:54,187 --> 00:14:56,067
might cause whisker protraction.

257
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:59,687
There are many cells here, 
premotor neurons that innervate

258
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:03,147
the intrinsic motor neurons 
that drive protraction of the whisker.

259
00:15:03,178 --> 00:15:05,858
And indeed, if we put 
a stimulation electrode here

260
00:15:05,858 --> 00:15:08,908
in the reticular formation 
and stimulate it electrically

261
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,158
we see that the whisker 
indeed moves forwards.

262
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,770
Compatible with our premotor mapping.

263
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:19,486
Now, there are many sensory motor loops
at the level of the brainstem.

264
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:23,420
So sensory information, 
both from the whisker system

265
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,760
and from many other types 
of sensory inputs

266
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,580
impinge upon these premotor neurons.

267
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,980
And in general, there's a great deal 
of local circuitry

268
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,980
in the brainstem and the spinal cord
that gives rise to reflex movements

269
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,980
and even more complex 
sensorimotor interactions.

270
00:15:41,863 --> 00:15:45,483
However, if we're interested 
in volitional movement

271
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:49,003
then typically this is something 
that results from cortical activity.

272
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:53,431
So, if we're thinking about 
volitional control of whisker movements

273
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:56,154
we might be interested
in the cortical inputs

274
00:15:56,232 --> 00:15:58,098
to these premotor neurons.

275
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:03,275
In general, cortical neurons 
don't connect strongly to motor neurons

276
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:07,129
and most of the impact 
of the neocortex upon movement

277
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:11,259
is indirectly through complex brainstem
and spinal cord circuits

278
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:13,929
through interacting 
with the premotor neurons.

279
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:18,604
So here, we then introduce 
an anterograde label for the axons

280
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:22,577
into the whisker sensory cortex 
and into the whisker motor cortex.

281
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,693
Two areas that we think 
are intimately involved

282
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,823
in processing and generating
whisker movements.

283
00:16:29,258 --> 00:16:32,761
If we inject this virus 
into the sensory cortex,

284
00:16:32,761 --> 00:16:36,245
we can see the axons 
down here in the brainstem.

285
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:40,758
If we cut a coronal section then,
we can look and see that the axons

286
00:16:40,758 --> 00:16:44,608
are coming in here from the sensory cortex
and largely innervating

287
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,608
this spinal trigeminal
interpolaris region,

288
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:52,128
exactly where the extrinsic 
premotor neurons are located.

289
00:16:52,621 --> 00:16:55,551
So you might imagine then 
that if we stimulate sensory cortex

290
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,861
that would release glutamate in this area,
stimulate these neurons here

291
00:16:59,861 --> 00:17:03,154
and that should then cause 
a retraction of the whiskers.

292
00:17:03,835 --> 00:17:08,185
If we now put the virus to label the axons
into the motor cortex,

293
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:12,345
we then cut sections here in the brainstem
and we look and see

294
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:14,677
in these sections 
where the axon's terminating,

295
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:17,807
we see that there's a great deal axon 
that's terminating here,

296
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,347
in the reticular formation.

297
00:17:19,347 --> 00:17:22,907
And that's where there's a high density
of neurons that are involved

298
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,277
in protracting whiskers.

299
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,397
So you might imagine 
that stimulating this area of motor cortex

300
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:30,117
might then cause the whisker
to move forwards.

301
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:33,337
So we can test this hypothesis 
by putting channelrhodopsin

302
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:35,737
in these two different brain areas.

303
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:38,357
Here we've injected a virus 
to express channelrhodopsin

304
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,887
in the sensory cortex.

305
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:43,697
Here we've injected channelrhodopsin
into the motor cortex.

306
00:17:43,697 --> 00:17:46,187
This is now the fixed brains 
that have been removed

307
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:49,383
from the animal after perfusion.

308
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:52,892
While the animal was alive, 
we put blue light

309
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:55,452
onto this spot of the cortex and saw

310
00:17:55,452 --> 00:17:58,072
that indeed generated
a whisker retraction.

311
00:17:58,072 --> 00:18:02,072
So stimulation of sensory cortex 
causes the whisker to move backwards

312
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:05,574
while stimulation of motor cortex 
causes the whisker to move forwards,

313
00:18:05,574 --> 00:18:07,324
but it does so in a more complex way,

314
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,684
it's a rhythmic forwards 
and backwards movement.

315
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:12,764
Very much like what we saw 
during the movie when the animal

316
00:18:12,764 --> 00:18:14,724
was performing the gap crossing task.

317
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:19,534
It's this exploratory rhythmic palpation
of its surroundings.

318
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,989
So as a summary when we think about 
whisker motor control by the cortex,

319
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:28,999
we can see that the sensory cortex
sends axons down to the brainstem,

320
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:32,140
innervates spinal trigeminal 
interpolaris nucleus.

321
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,660
That has premotor neurons that innervate
facial nucleus motor neurons.

322
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,650
And those facial nucleus motor neurons

323
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,620
are the ones that are involved
in retracting the whisker.

324
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,620
So, activity in the sensory cortex 
causes the whisker to move backwards

325
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,955
and that could be viewed 
as a negative feedback signal.

326
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:53,185
And perhaps, that's useful 
if we think about, say ourselves

327
00:18:53,185 --> 00:18:56,525
that are exploring a dark room, 
we're moving our arms around

328
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:59,805
and when we contact the wall 
the first thing we might want to do

329
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,535
is to stop moving our hand forwards.

330
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:06,695
We can't bring that hand through the wall,
so we need a negative feedback signal

331
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:09,035
that prevents or stops that movement.

332
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:14,015
So that might be one of the purposes 
of the sensory signals and sensory cortex,

333
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:18,619
is to cause a feedback signal 
to drive whisker retraction.

334
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,790
On the other hand, 
the whisker motor cortex

335
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,750
does the opposite, it tries to get
more sensory information

336
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,720
and moves the whiskers forwards

337
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,050
to try and get more 
sensory information to flow in.

338
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,700
And the way it does that is by its axons

339
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,050
that project down 
to the reticular formation,

340
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,860
here there are complex neuronal circuits

341
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,220
that probably act 
as central pattern generators

342
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,100
that then innervate the rhythmic
whisker protraction neurons

343
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,030
that are the motor neurons 
for the intrinsic muscle

344
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:52,682
that then drive the whisker 
to move forwards and backwards.

345
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:58,170
So, frontal cortex is involved 
in trying to get more sensory information

346
00:19:58,173 --> 00:20:02,173
and the sensory cortex seems to be 
involved in a negative feedback signal.

347
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:06,033
So there are two distinct types 
of cortical control signals

348
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:07,593
for whisker movements.

349
00:20:07,982 --> 00:20:12,842
So, having seen what the cortex can do
when we artificially stimulate it,

350
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:17,892
it's also interesting to see what types 
of signals occur from the periphery

351
00:20:17,892 --> 00:20:21,522
and whether we can follow 
through sensorimotor loops.

352
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,078
And in particular here, what we do 
is we deliver a stimulus

353
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,858
onto one particular whisker,

354
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,838
the C2 whisker. We have
a piece of metal attached to this

355
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:31,848
and there's a magnetic coil underneath.

356
00:20:31,848 --> 00:20:35,638
We can generate a brief 
one-millisecond pulse onto this whisker

357
00:20:35,638 --> 00:20:38,408
that then activates 
the signalling pathway.

358
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:40,748
First, glutamatergic synapse
in the brainstem.

359
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:43,398
Second, glutamatergic synapse
in the thalamus.

360
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:47,398
Then the information is processed here
in the primary somatosensory cortex.

361
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,799
After we deliver a whisker stimulation, 
some tens of a millisecond later,

362
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:56,089
we can see the activity here in S1,
it spreads within S1,

363
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,279
and it also sends a signal here
to the motor cortex.

364
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:02,769
And we believe that's a direct 
monosynaptic projection

365
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,609
from somatosensory cortex
to motor cortex.

366
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,279
What you see here is that 
we're also filming the behavior

367
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,709
of the animal while we measure 
the activity in the brain here,

368
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,879
with the voltage sensitive dye imaging 
technique that we've described before.

369
00:21:17,146 --> 00:21:20,046
The animal's sitting still 
at the beginning of the trial,

370
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:24,256
when we deliver the stimulus 
but by the time we've seen this activity

371
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:28,391
in sensory and motor cortex,
afterwards the animal in this trial

372
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:30,941
is moving its whisker, 
and what we think is happening

373
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:34,091
is that the animal is sitting here
waiting, waiting and suddenly

374
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:38,091
there's this unexpected sensory input
that arrives on the whisker.

375
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,681
And the animal might wonder 
“What was it in my environment

376
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:43,731
that touched my whisker?" 
and so it starts moving its whisker around

377
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:47,801
actively trying to explore, 
looking for the stimulus

378
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,229
that arrived on its whisker.

379
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:50,329
And of course, there is none

380
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:52,559
because it's an artificial magnetic stimulus

381
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,959
that we've delivered.

382
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:56,519
And it seems that the underlying 
neuronal activity

383
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,359
at least at the level of the cortex, 
is a large response in sensory cortex

384
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,469
that might drive a small whisker

385
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:05,579
retraction, followed by 
activation of motor cortex

386
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:08,269
that might then drive forwards 
and backwards movements

387
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,949
as the animal actively 
explores it's environment

388
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:13,379
looking for what stimulated it.

389
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:19,061
Now it turns out that there's
considerable trial to trial variability

390
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,151
especially in the neocortex.

391
00:22:21,152 --> 00:22:24,164
So even though one gives
the same sensory stimulus

392
00:22:24,164 --> 00:22:26,122
time after time again,

393
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:28,532
each time there's 
a slightly different response

394
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:29,722
on the neocortex.

395
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:32,682
And probably that relates 
to context-dependent processing

396
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,042
of sensory information.

397
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:36,912
So here is another trial
where we stimulate the animal

398
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:39,582
sitting still at the beginning
of the stimulus

399
00:22:39,582 --> 00:22:40,892
but in this case,

400
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,892
the animal doesn't make any exploratory 
self-generated movement afterwards.

401
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:47,542
It simply ignores 
the stimulus and sits still.

402
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:51,322
If we now look and see what happened
in the brain on this trial,

403
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:54,222
we'll see that there's actually
a relatively small response.

404
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:56,582
There's a little bit that happens here
in the sensory cortex

405
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:58,632
and nothing in the motor cortex.

406
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:03,909
These are just two individual trials 
but we can select for all trials

407
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,145
where the animal makes 
a sensory evoked whisker movement,

408
00:23:08,145 --> 00:23:11,391
and we can select for all trials 
where the animal makes no movement

409
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,881
and we can see in general how the pattern
of neuronal activity occurs.

410
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:18,061
And you'll see that on the trials 
where the animal

411
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:20,941
begins to move its whiskers 
and explore its environment,

412
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,025
that's accompanied by large 
activation in sensory cortex

413
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:27,451
and also substantial activation
here in the motor cortex.

414
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:30,681
Whereas on trials where the animal
doesn't make any movements,

415
00:23:30,681 --> 00:23:32,561
it just simply ignores the stimulus,

416
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:37,153
we see that there's a sensory response
in primary somatosensory cortex,

417
00:23:37,153 --> 00:23:38,794
it's smaller in amplitude,

418
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,470
and there's nothing
activating the motor cortex.

419
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:44,782
So, at least at the level 
of correlations, we can see

420
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:47,722
that there's sensorimotor activity 
when the animal begins

421
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:51,392
to actively explore its environment 
driven by a sensory stimulus

422
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:54,302
and there's other trials where the animal
ignores that stimulus

423
00:23:54,302 --> 00:23:58,064
and that's accompanied 
by very little activity in the neocortex.

424
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,772
We can also go and see what happens
from the other perspective.

425
00:24:01,772 --> 00:24:06,793
See what happens as the animal 
moves its whisker and contacts an object.

426
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:11,891
So, here we're tracking whisker position
and looking at membrane potential,

427
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,081
below in black,

428
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:17,521
and at some stage there's going to be
a drop of this pole, it drops down

429
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:21,516
and then the animal's whisker 
is now contacting that object

430
00:24:21,516 --> 00:24:24,516
and as it contacts the object, 
there are obvious

431
00:24:24,516 --> 00:24:28,716
membrane potential fluctuations 
that correlate with sensory responses

432
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:33,914
as the animal touches repeatedly 
this pole that's been put in its way.

433
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,131
And if the animal needs to localize
where this pole is,

434
00:24:37,131 --> 00:24:42,591
clearly it needs to take into account 
the motor position of where the whisker is

435
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:46,941
as well as the timing of that contact 
in order to extract the position

436
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,606
of where that pole is.

437
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,894
Here is another example 
of a different cell

438
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:55,714
recorded where each time 
the whisker is touching an object

439
00:24:55,714 --> 00:25:00,764
it's shaded in gray and you see 
every gray shaded area here

440
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:04,224
correlates with a membrane
potential depolarization

441
00:25:04,224 --> 00:25:05,714
in the cell that's being recorded.

442
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,584
And here there are some action potentials

443
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,284
that are being fired in response 
of this particular contact here.

444
00:25:11,688 --> 00:25:14,928
So we can see that 
there's active encoding

445
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:17,368
of each individual touch response

446
00:25:17,368 --> 00:25:20,338
in the primary somatosensory 
cortex of the mouse.

447
00:25:20,338 --> 00:25:22,378
So there's a clear signal in the brain

448
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:27,778
that corresponds to each active touch 
as the animal contacts its environment.

449
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,088
Now we need to be able

450
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,708
to put those sensory 
and motor signals together

451
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:35,498
in order, for example, to extract 
the position of the object.

452
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:37,354
So it's interesting to note

453
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:41,094
that there's a substantial motor 
input to sensory cortex

454
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:44,524
as well as of course the sensory cortex 
that sends input to motor cortex

455
00:25:44,524 --> 00:25:46,694
so they're bidirectionally coupled.

456
00:25:46,694 --> 00:25:48,227
Here we just look at one aspect,

457
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:51,410
that the motor control signals 
arrive in sensory cortex

458
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,144
this is the axonal innervation

459
00:25:53,144 --> 00:25:54,984
of primary somatosensory cortex.

460
00:25:54,984 --> 00:25:57,134
And it seems to come in two layers,

461
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,814
There's an upper layer 
of innervation here

462
00:25:59,814 --> 00:26:03,044
that arrives at the surface 
of the brain in Layer 1

463
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:05,244
and there's also deeper innervation.

464
00:26:05,244 --> 00:26:09,874
If we now focus our attention here, 
on the superficial innervation of Layer 1

465
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:11,904
that's particularly interesting

466
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:16,524
because it contacts the distal dendrites
of the excitatory neurons in this region

467
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:21,704
and it's actively controlled 
by the GABAergic inhibitory neuron

468
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:24,114
the somatostatin Martinotti cells

469
00:26:24,114 --> 00:26:29,044
that send their axons here
into the upper layer of the neocortex.

470
00:26:29,044 --> 00:26:30,924
So the input from motor cortex

471
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,994
in terms of its impact upon 
the dendritic integration here

472
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,164
on the excitatory neurons 
is regulated by how much GABA

473
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,664
is being released 
by the somatostatin cells.

474
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:42,534
When the animal's sitting still 
and not moving its whiskers,

475
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,914
these somatostatin cells 
are firing quite actively.

476
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:48,364
So they are inhibiting 
these distal dendrites

477
00:26:48,364 --> 00:26:52,174
and it may be that the motor input 
makes relatively little impact

478
00:26:52,174 --> 00:26:53,984
upon the excitatory cells.

479
00:26:54,084 --> 00:26:57,414
However, when the animal 
begins to move its whiskers,

480
00:26:57,414 --> 00:27:02,008
the somatostatin cells hyperpolarize, 
they stop firing action potentials

481
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:06,478
and now, the GABAergic inhibition 
that was strong before,

482
00:27:06,478 --> 00:27:11,658
is now taken out and the motor input
can now make a substantial input

483
00:27:11,658 --> 00:27:13,737
onto the excitatory cells.

484
00:27:13,737 --> 00:27:16,847
So, there's an interesting regulation
of this distal dendritic input

485
00:27:16,847 --> 00:27:18,527
by the somatostatin cells

486
00:27:18,527 --> 00:27:21,697
and that then might allow 
for motor interactions

487
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:23,297
onto the excitatory neurons.

488
00:27:23,297 --> 00:27:27,297
That then might help the animal 
interpret the sensory information

489
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:30,097
coming in during active touch for example,

490
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:34,097
by combining motor signals 
with the upcoming sensory input

491
00:27:34,097 --> 00:27:37,697
that also arrives, of course,
in sensory cortex.

492
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,403
So in this video we've seen

493
00:27:39,403 --> 00:27:42,223
that if we're interested
in understanding behavior,

494
00:27:42,223 --> 00:27:45,403
we absolutely need 
to investigate motor control.

495
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:50,565
Motor control and movements 
are the very basis of any behavior

496
00:27:50,573 --> 00:27:53,483
and so, that's an important 
starting point.

497
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:57,520
We've seen that sensory input
to the motor control systems

498
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,310
is extremely important 
and forms the first way

499
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,780
in which our motor output 
is regulated.

500
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,990
We have various sensorimotor feedbacks 
that drive reflexes for example,

501
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,171
and at higher levels 
we can imagine

502
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:14,171
that sensory input often initiates
our movements and certainly

503
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:19,041
helps us guides us through any action 
that we wish to perform.

504
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:23,014
From the other point of view, 
our movements and motor control

505
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:28,004
make a big difference to the type 
of sensory information that we obtain.

506
00:28:28,004 --> 00:28:32,008
So we actively touch objects, 
we make eye movements

507
00:28:32,008 --> 00:28:36,158
to select things that we want 
to analyse in higher resolution.

508
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:42,118
So active processing of sensory 
information is extremely important

509
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:46,999
both in terms of the information 
that we obtain and also in terms

510
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:50,999
of selecting for specific types 
of sensory information.

511
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:53,214
So in this video we've largely looked

512
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:57,024
at what are probably hardwired 
genetically programmed

513
00:28:57,024 --> 00:29:00,294
sensorimotor loops
and sensory interactions.

514
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:01,814
In the next video,
we're going to see

515
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:03,944
how we can use
reward-based learning

516
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:08,764
to change sensorimotor interactions
and drive goal-directed behaviour.

517
00:29:08,764 --> 00:29:13,995
And that is essential as a starting point
for understanding sensory perception.
