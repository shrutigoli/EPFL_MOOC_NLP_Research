1
00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:08,788
One of the most important features
of animal behavior

2
00:00:08,788 --> 00:00:11,764
is our ability to learn from experience.

3
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:16,258
Such adaptive behavior
is important for survival

4
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,144
in our ever-changing environment.

5
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:21,431
The brain has evolved
many mechanisms of learning

6
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:25,427
which likely contribute differentially
to distinct types of learning.

7
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:29,701
Thus declarative learning, 
procedural learning,

8
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:32,785
as well as fear learning,
spatial learning and motor learning,

9
00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:37,436
may involve different changes
in distinct neuronal circuits

10
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,445
in different parts of the brain.

11
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:45,197
In a previous video,
video 6.2, we briefly discussed

12
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:48,969
evidence that spatial learning
through NMDA receptors

13
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:53,131
in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
might play an important role.

14
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,103
Indeed, the hippocampus and neocortex

15
00:00:56,103 --> 00:00:58,430
are likely to be involved
in many forms of learning,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,531
and this is supported by increasing amounts
of evidence from experiments

17
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,626
both correlating and manipulating
neuronal activity

18
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:08,907
in hippocampus and neocortex.

19
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,219
However, in this video, we'll focus
our attention on other aspects of learning

20
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,071
that might be perhaps more ancient
and thus perhaps more fundamental —

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,329
a form of learning that likely existed
long before the neocortex evolved.

22
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:29,519
Here we will specifically focus
on reward-based learning.

23
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:34,545
Presumably an important motivation
for carrying out various actions

24
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:37,484
is a desire to achieve positive outcomes,

25
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:41,001
accompanied by immediate or future rewards.

26
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,582
Sometimes we're successful,
either by design or chance,

27
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:49,142
and it's important for us to learn
from the outcome of our actions

28
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,395
so that we can maximize our reward.

29
00:01:51,954 --> 00:01:56,003
In this video, we will discuss
one attractive hypothesis

30
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,813
for how reward-based learning might occur
in the mammalian brain.

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,872
However, it's good to bear in mind
that there are many other hypotheses

32
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:09,202
about how learning takes place and this
is a very active field of research.

33
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:14,011
Let's think a bit about how
reward-based learning might work.

34
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:21,314
We imagine there's some sensory input,
there's some sort of context

35
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:28,109
that's provided by sensory input —
that's how we know where we are.

36
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:31,569
That's processed by the brain,

37
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,807
the synaptically connected 
neuronal networks

38
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:36,702
that govern brain function,
and that then gives rise

39
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:40,682
to some form of motor output — an action.

40
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:47,958
That action, that motor output,
might give rise to reward.

41
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,530
It may be a successful action
and we may be rewarded

42
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:56,966
for the performance of that action
in the context of where

43
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,929
that sensory input arrived.

44
00:02:59,904 --> 00:03:04,122
So the basic idea 
behind reward-based learning

45
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:08,546
is to learn that 
in a specific stimulus context

46
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:12,682
we should perform a specific motor output

47
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,794
and that will then lead us to reward.

48
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:19,507
At the level of neuronal networks,
we can begin to think

49
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:23,173
a bit more specifically
about what types of learning

50
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,116
ought to occur in the brain.

51
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:31,094
We again imagine our context 
provided by the sensory input

52
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,718
and of course there are
many different channels

53
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:36,601
and types of sensory input 
that we could have.

54
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,450
That comes in, excites neurons
or groups of neurons

55
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,178
inside the brain and that then forms
these connected neuronal networks

56
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:49,861
where different neurons
in different parts of the brain

57
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,085
talk to each other.

58
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:55,731
They process the information 
and give rise to motor output,

59
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:58,944
and of course there are 
many different motor outputs

60
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,425
that we can imagine.

61
00:04:02,003 --> 00:04:04,572
In one particular behavior,
we might imagine that there's

62
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:08,895
a given sensory stimulus that comes in,
a given context that's provided

63
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:14,105
to the animal that generates activity
in one node of the network,

64
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,904
and in order for the animal 
to receive reward,

65
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:22,285
it needs to carry out a specific action
that it turns out is driven

66
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:25,640
by activity in this motor node
of the network.

67
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,785
So what the animal needs to learn is

68
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:35,338
to convert this sensory input
into this motor output.

69
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:39,966
In terms of how one might do this
at the level of individual neurons,

70
00:04:39,966 --> 00:04:44,136
you might want to strengthen
this most direct pathway

71
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:48,034
that links the sensory stimulation
to the motor output.

72
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:52,034
So we might want to — if we imagine
that these are individual neurons

73
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:56,024
and this might be glutamatergic synapses,
what we'd want to do is

74
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:59,357
to increase the efficacy
of these synapses,

75
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:02,055
perhaps through the process
of synaptic plasticity

76
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,043
and long-term potentiation.

77
00:05:04,043 --> 00:05:07,992
If we could strengthen the link
between this sensory input

78
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:10,354
and that motor output,
then that would give rise

79
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:14,874
to an enhanced sensorimotor transformation
that would then give rise

80
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:16,919
to reward for the animal.

81
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:22,145
So what reward should do, then,
is to drive this form of plasticity

82
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,331
in the sensorimotor networks of the brain.

83
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:31,266
So a key question, obviously,
is how reward is represented in the brain.

84
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:35,029
In the now classic work
of Wolfram Schultz,

85
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:39,823
who recorded dopaminergic neurons
of the midbrain in the monkey,

86
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,080
it seems that there's
an interesting reward signal

87
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,924
that's present there
in the dopamine neurons.

88
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:51,081
What Wolfram Schultz observed
is that when he gave reward

89
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:55,047
to his monkeys, there would be
a brief transient increase

90
00:05:55,047 --> 00:05:58,178
in the action potential firing
of the dopamine neurons,

91
00:05:58,178 --> 00:06:01,250
and that appears, then,
to encode a reward signal.

92
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:06,006
More recently, these experiments
have been repeated in mice

93
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:09,914
by the work of Naoshige Uchida
and in mice, in addition,

94
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:14,904
we have the ability to verify
that these really are dopaminergic neurons

95
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:18,772
through detailed examination
of the properties of these cells.

96
00:06:20,054 --> 00:06:23,290
The work of Naoshige Uchida
and Wolfram Schultz

97
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:27,634
are in close agreement,
and what both of them found

98
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,678
is that when reward 
is delivered to an animal,

99
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:34,259
and typically this is in the form
of a juice, for example,

100
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,669
that's squirted into the mouth
of a thirsty monkey,

101
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,719
some 100 milliseconds or so
afterwards there's a phasic increase

102
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:45,688
in the action potential firing
of the dopaminergic neurons.

103
00:06:45,688 --> 00:06:48,950
So there's an extracellular recording 
electrode that's been lowered

104
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,573
to where the midbrain dopamine neurons are—

105
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:55,901
these are spontaneously active neurons
and so they will fire action potentials

106
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:59,545
every few hundred milliseconds;
maybe they have a basal firing rate

107
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:03,219
of around five Hertz,
but when reward is delivered,

108
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:06,530
some hundred milliseconds later
there's an increase

109
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,230
in the action potential firing
of these dopaminergic neurons

110
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,971
and that's a transient signal that again 
lasts about 100 milliseconds or so.

111
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,362
So reward is associated
with a brief increase

112
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,250
in dopaminergic signalling.

113
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:24,810
Interestingly, if a cue is presented
before the reward

114
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,214
and it's done so on a regular basis —
say it's a one-second interval

115
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:33,627
between the cue — this could be
a sound stimulus or a visual stimulus

116
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:38,771
that predicts reward delivery —
then the dopamingergic neurons fire

117
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:42,308
not so much to the reward
but rather to the cue

118
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:44,098
that predicts the reward.

119
00:07:44,616 --> 00:07:49,691
So in fact the signal here
that drives dopamine signaling

120
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:53,347
is not so much reward
but reward prediction.

121
00:07:55,381 --> 00:08:00,757
So this phasic dopamine signal
seems to move to the earliest predictor

122
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:04,032
of reward coming the way of the animal.

123
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,035
That's clearly a very interesting signal
in terms of learning

124
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:11,730
how the animal should figure out
how it should best behave

125
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,586
in order to achieve more reward.

126
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:18,705
That seems to be then given
by dopaminergic signals

127
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:23,230
that drive the sensorimotor loops
for learning how to behave

128
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,530
and how to get more reward.

129
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:31,011
Having found this reward signal
in the dopamine neurons,

130
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,402
it's obviously interesting to see
where the signal goes in the brain.

131
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:38,519
The midbrain dopaminergic neurons

132
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,806
project most strongly to the striatum.

133
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:46,191
So that's the location where they release
dopamine most prominently in the brain.

134
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:49,752
The striatum is 
a relatively large brain area.

135
00:08:50,407 --> 00:08:54,810
It can be divided into the dorsal
and the ventral <i>striatum</i>,

136
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,298
and the ventral striatum
is sometimes called the <i>nucleus accumbens</i>.

137
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:04,186
The midbrain dopaminergic neurons
can also be divided into two groups.

138
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,882
There's the so-called
<i>ventral tegmental area</i>

139
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,950
that heavily innervates
the nucleus accumbens

140
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,726
and also signals to the frontal cortex

141
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:16,098
and there's the <i>substantia nigra compacta</i>

142
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:19,470
that signals to the dorsal striatum.

143
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,200
The heavy innervation of striatum
by dopamine then suggests

144
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,002
that the dopamine is probably carrying out

145
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:29,413
some important functions in the striatum.

146
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,452
So if you now zoom in
on a small bit of the striatum,

147
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:37,510
we'll see that there are axons,
dopaminergic axons

148
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,148
that have swellings in them,
and at these swellings,

149
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:44,994
there are many synaptic vesicles
that contain dopamine

150
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:48,614
and it's thought that dopamine
is released from these swellings

151
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:52,894
very much like they are
in other synapses of the brain.

152
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:57,056
There are however no immediate 
post-synaptic membranes

153
00:09:57,056 --> 00:09:59,736
that are tightly opposed 
to these release sites,

154
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:03,618
so the dopamine is thought
to diffuse in the extracellular space.

155
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,764
There it can bind to dopamine receptors

156
00:10:08,764 --> 00:10:11,779
that are present on membranes around it.

157
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,981
There are two important types
of dopamine receptors.

158
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,494
There are the dopamine type 1 receptors

159
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:23,401
and there are 
the dopamine type 2 receptors

160
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,509
and both of them are 
seven transmembrane receptors

161
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:30,716
that couple through G proteins,
so the next downstream signal here

162
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:35,316
is G protein activation
after dopamine binding to the receptor.

163
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:38,892
The dopamine type 1 receptor

164
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:43,283
signals via G(s) and G(olf) —

165
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:47,156
these are two different types
of G proteins, and they signal

166
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:51,087
through a variety of different pathways
including the stimulation

167
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:55,297
of adenylate cyclase,
that leads to increased production

168
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,973
of the second messenger, cyclic AMP.

169
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:05,026
The D(2) receptors signal
through other G proteins, G(i) or G(o),

170
00:11:05,026 --> 00:11:08,608
G proteins that have a variety 
of signalling targets

171
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:14,124
including Phospholipase C
but in addition they also inhibit

172
00:11:14,124 --> 00:11:19,472
adenylate cyclase and thus reduce
cyclic AMP concentrations.

173
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,543
Although they probably have
many other functions,

174
00:11:23,543 --> 00:11:28,298
there at least is, at some level,
the dopamine type 1 receptors

175
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:31,860
increase cyclic AMP 
and the dopamine type 2 receptors

176
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,778
decrease cyclic AMP, so they have
in some respects opposing functions.

177
00:11:37,258 --> 00:11:40,281
Interestingly, these dopamine receptors

178
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:45,406
are expressed on distinct neurons
in the striatum.

179
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:50,374
So there are two types
of striatal projection neurons.

180
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:54,657
There are the ones that express
the dopamine type 1 receptors

181
00:11:54,657 --> 00:11:57,901
and there is another type
of neuron that expresses

182
00:11:57,901 --> 00:12:00,165
the dopamine type 2 receptor.

183
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,502
We can look at these specifically
through mouse genetics.

184
00:12:05,008 --> 00:12:07,748
We can express <i>Cre recombinase</i>

185
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:12,206
downstream of the promoter
of the D1 receptor

186
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,351
or we can express Cre recombinase
downstream of the promoter

187
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:17,665
for the D2 receptor.

188
00:12:19,084 --> 00:12:25,048
If we now inject a virus that's activated
by Cre recombinase to express

189
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:28,086
green fluorescent protein,
then we can see where the axons

190
00:12:28,086 --> 00:12:31,493
of these neurons go, and so
that's exactly what we've done here.

191
00:12:31,493 --> 00:12:33,001
So here's the striatum.

192
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,483
This is a sagittal section
of the mouse brain,

193
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:39,201
it's a D1-Cre mouse,
we've injected virus here

194
00:12:39,201 --> 00:12:43,917
into the striatum, so we've 
infected cells and expressed

195
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:47,501
green fluorescent protein
in the D1-Cre animals,

196
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:52,189
and the GFP here is shown
in pink and so here we see

197
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:57,112
the cells that are infected by the virus
and further away we see

198
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,587
the axonal projection of these neurons.

199
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:03,102
So they send axons that go
all the way over here

200
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:06,244
to the <i>substantia nigra reticulata</i>.

201
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:10,161
So that's actually immediately
next to where the dopamine neurons are

202
00:13:10,161 --> 00:13:14,221
of the substantia nigra compacta
that signal back here to the striatum

203
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,502
and release dopamine.

204
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:17,761
Here we're looking
at the reverse projection,

205
00:13:18,377 --> 00:13:22,306
the striatal projection neurons,
the ones that express D1 receptors,

206
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:26,539
they send axons
to the substantia nigra pars reticulata

207
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:31,418
and all the projection neurons here
in the striatum are GABAergic neurons

208
00:13:31,418 --> 00:13:37,038
and so this direct pathway
inhibits substantia nigra reticulata.

209
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:42,321
The indirect pathway we can study

210
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,597
in these D2-Cre expressing mice.

211
00:13:45,597 --> 00:13:50,133
Again, here we have a sagittal section,
we've injected a virus that gets activated

212
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:53,412
by Cre recombinase, we infect
cells in the striatum,

213
00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,139
and now we see that there's
a very different axonal projection

214
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:59,636
that targets an area here
much closer to the striatum,

215
00:13:59,636 --> 00:14:03,044
the so-called <i>globus pallidus</i>
external part.

216
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,657
It's a GABAergic projection
from these D2-expressing neurons

217
00:14:09,657 --> 00:14:12,047
that inhibits the globus pallidus.

218
00:14:12,047 --> 00:14:15,874
The globus pallidus, in turn,
contains GABAergic neurons

219
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:19,334
that then inhibits 
substantia nigra reticulata.

220
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:23,984
So not only do these two pathways
express dopamine receptors

221
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:27,484
that at least at some level
have opposing functions,

222
00:14:27,484 --> 00:14:31,276
where this increases 
cyclic AMP concentration

223
00:14:31,276 --> 00:14:34,634
and this decreases 
cyclic AMP concentration

224
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:38,546
but in terms of the impact
upon the substantia nigra reticulata,

225
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,629
they have opposing functions.

226
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:45,576
The direct pathway directly inhibits
substantia nigra reticulata

227
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:49,094
whereas the indirect pathway
inhibits globus pallidus

228
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:51,610
that then inhibits 
substantia nigra reticulata,

229
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,846
so that's a disinhibitory pathway

230
00:14:53,846 --> 00:14:58,463
that in the end leads to an increase
of reticulata function

231
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:01,363
and here a decrease
of reticulata function.

232
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:04,734
These two pathways are rather interesting

233
00:15:04,734 --> 00:15:07,107
in the sense that they're
very clearly distinct

234
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,599
in their projections, 
their functions, and also in terms

235
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,900
of the dopamine receptors
that they express.

236
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:18,137
How does that help us understand
reward-based learning?

237
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,340
Let's have a look and see
what happens if we imagine

238
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,041
that there's some reward
that causes activation

239
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:30,137
of the dopamine pathway,
release of dopamine

240
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,941
into the striatum, the dopamine
diffuses in the extracellular space,

241
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:38,479
and it then binds to D2 receptors

242
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,357
or D1 receptors,

243
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,210
as we've seen expressed
in different cell types.

244
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:52,062
The action of the dopamine receptors
seems to be particularly involved

245
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:57,351
in regulating synaptic plasticity
at the glutamatergic synapses that arrive

246
00:15:57,351 --> 00:15:59,470
onto the striatal projection neurons.

247
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:01,662
It turns out that a large amount

248
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:04,706
of the excitation 
that arrives in the striatum

249
00:16:04,706 --> 00:16:09,690
comes from the neocortex,
and so cortical projections

250
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,431
come into the striatum
and release glutamate

251
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,741
onto the striatal projection neurons.

252
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:19,575
That's true of both pathways,
both the direct

253
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,490
and the indirect pathways.

254
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:28,751
The action of dopamine in the context
of the glutamatergic synapse here

255
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:33,408
is on the D1 receptors
to promote the insertion

256
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:39,906
of both AMPA and NMDA receptors
onto the postsynaptic membranes

257
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:45,500
and D1 activation appears
to be essential for promoting

258
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,761
long-term potentiation
at this synapse here.

259
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:54,881
So the cortical input here
onto the direct striatal projection neurons

260
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:59,092
appears to be potentiated
by the action of dopamine.

261
00:16:59,092 --> 00:17:02,999
So that's a strengthening of that pathway
in the presence of reward.

262
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:07,508
In contrast, the activation 
of D2 receptors

263
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:10,839
seems to be involved
in just the opposite type

264
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,439
of synaptic plasticity.

265
00:17:13,175 --> 00:17:17,475
Activation of D2 receptors
prevents calcium entry

266
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:23,120
through the NMDA receptor, and also seems
to be involved in potentiating

267
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,218
the long-term depression at this synapse.

268
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:33,661
So D2 activation gives rise
to long-term depression,

269
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,615
here onto the indirect 
striatal projection neurons.

270
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,251
So dopamine seems to have
two opposing functions.

271
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:47,692
It strengthens the direct pathway, cortex
to direct striatal projection neurons,

272
00:17:48,172 --> 00:17:51,281
and it weakens the pathway

273
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:54,222
onto the indirect 
striatal projection neurons.

274
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:56,921
Let's look at that in the context

275
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:00,133
of one goal-directed 
sensorimotor transformation

276
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,486
that we've already been thinking about.

277
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,945
Let's take the whisker detection task
where we stimulate a whisker

278
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:11,053
and the mouse needs to learn
to do a goal-directed motor output

279
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:15,174
involving licking a reward spout
in order to obtain reward.

280
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:21,624
At the level of a circuit diagram,
this is how it might work.

281
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,381
The sensory input arrives
at the periphery,

282
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:27,474
drives excitation 
of somatosensory thalamus

283
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:31,042
that in turn excites
the somatosensory neocortex

284
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:35,881
and we already saw that activity
in the neocortex

285
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:39,811
is essential in order to carry out 
this whisker detection task.

286
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:44,734
The neocortex in turn sends
glutamatergic projections

287
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:49,213
to the striatum, and one interesting place
that could be reinforced

288
00:18:49,213 --> 00:18:53,801
by the reward signal by dopamine
is the glutamatergic input

289
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,353
onto the striatal 
direct projection neurons,

290
00:18:57,353 --> 00:19:00,177
the D1 receptor-expressing pathway.

291
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:04,182
Dopamine might potentiate 
that, drive more activity

292
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:08,065
in the direct pathway downstream
of sensory activity,

293
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:11,636
the activity in these 
direct pathway neurons

294
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:15,893
might then inhibit 
the substantia nigra pars reticulata

295
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:19,696
and that contains GABAergic neurons
that are tonically active

296
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:22,569
and normally they inhibit
the brainstem motor nuclei

297
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:25,925
and prevent the animal from moving
in some sort of random way.

298
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:29,898
So there's a tonic inhibition
of brainstem motor nuclei

299
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:33,218
and that tonic activity
in the substantia nigra

300
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:38,978
might be what's been directly inhibited
by the striatal direct projection neurons.

301
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:46,535
The D2 receptor indirect pathway
spinal projection neurons

302
00:19:46,535 --> 00:19:50,896
might be weakened 
by the dopamine synaptic plasticity.

303
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:56,287
There would then be less inhibition
onto the globus pallidus neurons

304
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:01,331
and they would then in turn inhibit
the substantia nigra pars reticulata more,

305
00:20:01,331 --> 00:20:05,616
and so we would have two ways in which
the basal ganglia circuit

306
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:07,751
via striatum and substantia nigra

307
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:11,133
might contribute 
to the licking motor output

308
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:15,056
in this goal-directed
sensorimotor transformation

309
00:20:15,056 --> 00:20:16,769
of the whisker detection task.

310
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,185
So that's a nice hypothesis.

311
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,528
Let's see if there's any data
that might support it.

312
00:20:22,528 --> 00:20:27,024
So in the first membrane potential
recordings of striatal projection neurons

313
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:30,315
during goal-directed behavior,
we found that there's in fact

314
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:36,689
a brief, transient sensory response
in the direct striatal projection neurons

315
00:20:36,689 --> 00:20:39,776
and that seems to be missing
or at least much weaker

316
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,824
in the indirect striatal 
projection neurons.

317
00:20:43,314 --> 00:20:47,383
So this transient excitation
of the direct pathway

318
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:52,765
could contribute to a go signal
initiating the licking motor response

319
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:55,025
during the whisker detection task.

320
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:00,008
To see if that brief activation
of the direct pathway

321
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:03,271
might be sufficient in order 
to drive licking behavior,

322
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:06,191
we tried an optogenetic 
substitution experiment.

323
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:10,968
So we trained the animals as before
in the whisker detection task,

324
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,620
we stimulate the whisker,
the animal licks,

325
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,481
it gets a reward, and now,
once the animal's learned the whisker task

326
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:23,788
we then start stimulating with blue light
the direct striatal projection neurons

327
00:21:23,788 --> 00:21:27,268
that have been infected
by our virus-expressing channelrhodopsin.

328
00:21:27,268 --> 00:21:30,889
So we can activate
the striatal projection neurons,

329
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:34,421
these dSPSNs that are normally
activated by the sensory stimulus

330
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:36,240
during the whisker detection task.

331
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,176
Now we bypass the sensory stimulus
and we directly stimulate those neurons.

332
00:21:40,176 --> 00:21:43,248
We give them a brief 
few-millisecond blue light flash,

333
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:46,569
and that turns out to drive
the licking motor output.

334
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,540
So apparently this activity
in the direct striatal projection neurons

335
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,838
is sufficient to drive
the licking motor response.

336
00:21:53,838 --> 00:21:58,294
Here you can see the group statistics: 
the stimulation

337
00:21:58,294 --> 00:22:02,196
of the direct striatal projection neurons
is in fact even better

338
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:05,016
than the whisker stimulus
at driving licking, and of course,

339
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:07,924
false alarm rates are low
under these conditions,

340
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:12,440
whereas stimulating
the indirect striatal projection neurons

341
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,446
in no way drives further licking.

342
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:17,389
If anything, it prevents
the animal from licking.

343
00:22:17,389 --> 00:22:20,821
So there's a highly specific pathway

344
00:22:20,821 --> 00:22:23,144
through the direct 
striatal projection neurons

345
00:22:23,144 --> 00:22:27,244
that drives licking 
and the indirect neurons

346
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:29,526
seem to have the opposing function.

347
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:33,945
So if you now put this
at the level of a circuit

348
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:39,314
and synaptic wiring diagram,
we think that the neocortex

349
00:22:39,314 --> 00:22:43,154
is involved in the performance
of this whisker detection task,

350
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:46,103
and one of the outputs of the neocortex

351
00:22:46,103 --> 00:22:49,973
is the glutamatergic innervation
of the striatum.

352
00:22:49,973 --> 00:22:53,234
The dopamine reward signal
that presumably is involved

353
00:22:53,234 --> 00:22:59,333
in the learning of this task
might contribute to long-term potentiation

354
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,428
at the neocortical synapse

355
00:23:01,428 --> 00:23:05,132
onto the direct pathway 
striatal projection neurons

356
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,393
through the activation of D1 receptors.

357
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:11,854
That would then strengthen the go pathway,

358
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:15,953
whereas the glutamatergic input

359
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:18,839
onto the indirect striatal 
projection neurons

360
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,676
might be decreased in efficacy
through long-term depression

361
00:23:23,676 --> 00:23:27,207
driven by the D2 receptors

362
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:34,072
and the depression of this pathway here
might then prevent the no-go signal.

363
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,394
So altogether what we see
is that this pathway could be involved

364
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:40,786
in the reward-based learning

365
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:45,620
of this very simple goal-directed
sensorimotor loop downstream

366
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:47,429
of the whisker stimulus.

367
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:51,778
In this video, we've discussed
one specific hypothesis

368
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:55,558
that attempts to provide
a mechanistic neuronal circuit

369
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,495
and synaptic plasticity mechanisms
underlying reward-based learning.

370
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,523
The basic concept is simple:
reward-based learning should reinforce

371
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:09,784
the synaptic circuits driving 
goal-directed sensorimotor transformations.

372
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:13,515
That way, actions leading to rewards

373
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:16,395
should be carried out
in the appropriate context.

374
00:24:17,014 --> 00:24:20,185
Mechanistically, 
the transient action potential firing

375
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:24,325
of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain
appears to signal reward,

376
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:26,540
or cues that predict reward.

377
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,856
In fact, more formally it's thought to be
reward prediction errors.

378
00:24:31,787 --> 00:24:35,096
This could form the signal
driving synaptic plasticity

379
00:24:35,096 --> 00:24:39,166
at corticostriatal synapses,
which might participate importantly

380
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,707
in reward-based learning.

381
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:46,544
These same circuits that are so useful
for learning goal-directed behavior

382
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:49,627
also go wrong in some brain diseases.

383
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,868
We'll discuss that in the next video.
