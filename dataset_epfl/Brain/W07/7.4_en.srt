1
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:08,598
There are two important reasons
for studying neuroscience.

2
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,901
The first is to get a mechanistic
understanding of how we think,

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,357
feel and act.

4
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:17,758
And that's the main thing 
that we focused on in this course.

5
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:20,670
The second important reason
for studying neuroscience

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,270
is to try and alleviate
the many brain diseases.

7
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:27,609
That's what we're going to focus on
in this video.

8
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:32,152
It turns out that the prevalence
and socio-economic costs

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,604
of brain disorders
are simply staggering.

10
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:41,790
In 2011, in an important publication
in the European

11
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:46,641
Neuropsychopharmacology journal,
Gustavsson et al. estimate

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:52,654
the cost of disorders
of the brain in Europe in 2010.

13
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:59,710
Gustavsson et al. investigated
the overall burden of brain disorders

14
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:04,793
in 30 European countries, 
they have a total population

15
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:12,026
of somewhere over 500 million people
and the total economic gross domestic

16
00:01:12,026 --> 00:01:18,042
product of these European countries
is on the order of 14 trillion euros.

17
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,722
The brain disorders turn out
to have an economic cost

18
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:27,360
of somewhere around 800 billion euros.

19
00:01:27,726 --> 00:01:34,005
That's over 5% of the total GDP
of Europe and that comes out to be

20
00:01:34,122 --> 00:01:37,084
somewhere around 1 trillion U.S. Dollars.

21
00:01:38,586 --> 00:01:44,317
Out of this cost, about 40%
are direct medical costs,

22
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,187
20% are direct non-medical costs, 
and another 40% largely relate

23
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,291
to the lost work hours.

24
00:01:55,212 --> 00:02:00,036
The economic cost is enormous
and perhaps more importantly,

25
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:04,691
the number of people suffering
from brain disorders is simply staggering.

26
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:10,654
It's at around 150 million people
and up, so well over a quarter

27
00:02:10,654 --> 00:02:14,792
of the population of Europe
are in some way affected

28
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:20,877
by brain disorders as estimated
by Gustavsson et al. for the year 2010.

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,395
These numbers for Europe
are comparable and in fact,

30
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:29,326
slightly lower than estimates
for the United States

31
00:02:29,475 --> 00:02:35,737
so there's no hint of exaggeration
and the impression is that

32
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:38,773
with an aging population
across the world

33
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:42,219
and certainly in Europe, 
the number of people

34
00:02:42,297 --> 00:02:45,898
and economic costs
are only going to go up

35
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,019
in the future.

36
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:52,743
So the scale of the problems
of health related to brain disorders

37
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,979
is simply enormous.

38
00:02:55,373 --> 00:03:01,064
Gustavsson et al. divided the analysis
of brain disorders in Europe in 2010

39
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:05,214
into 19 different categories
of brain disorders.

40
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:11,107
Here, I've ranked them according
to their estimated economic costs.

41
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:18,726
On top of the list are mood disorders
that affects some 33 million people

42
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:22,347
and cost some 113 billion euros.

43
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,999
In mood disorders,
this is largely dominated

44
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,407
by depression.

45
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:36,243
Dementia, incorporating such diseases
as Alzheimer's, dementia affects

46
00:03:36,243 --> 00:03:42,065
some 6 million people in Europe
and cost around 105 billion euros

47
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,514
in the year 2010.

48
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:48,394
Psychotic disorders
including schizophrenia

49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,786
affects some 5 million people
and costs some 94 billion euros.

50
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,830
Anxiety disorders 
including panic disorders,

51
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,218
post traumatic stress disorder
affects some 69 million people

52
00:04:01,218 --> 00:04:05,160
and costs 74 billon euros.
And addiction,

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,704
largely drug and alcohol abuse
affects 16 million people,

54
00:04:09,704 --> 00:04:12,769
costing some 66 billion euros.

55
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:18,043
Just these top five 
brain related disorders

56
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,577
affect more than 100 million people
in Europe

57
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:27,371
and cost over 400 billion euros
as estimated by Gustavsson et al.

58
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,277
in the year 2010.

59
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,551
So the scale of the problems
are rather significant.

60
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:38,510
In this video, we're going to take a look
at Parkinson's disease

61
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:42,282
that affects perhaps some
1.2 million people in Europe

62
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:48,698
so that's about 1 in 500 people
and costs around 13.9 billion euros

63
00:04:48,698 --> 00:04:54,527
in terms of the direct and indirect costs
for European countries.

64
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:59,779
Parkinson's disease was well described
by Dr. James Parkinson

65
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:04,471
in 1817 in his <i>Essay on the Shaking Palsy</i>.

66
00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:10,893
He described an age-related, slow,
progressive, neurodegenerative disorder

67
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:15,473
and the early symptoms of Parkinson's
disease include bradykenisia,

68
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:20,393
so that's slowness of movements,
difficulty in initiating movements,

69
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:27,394
a problem with walking and stance,
tremor, shaking.

70
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:31,551
That's the shaking palsy
that Parkinson described

71
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:33,708
in his essay, and rigidity.

72
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:37,968
That's contraction of muscles
in an unwanted way.

73
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,442
These motor symptoms
gradually get worse

74
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:48,119
as the neurodegenerative disease
progresses and at later times,

75
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:52,783
other symptoms also become important
like dementia and depression.

76
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:58,489
These are clearly
very debilitating symptoms

77
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:03,018
and make it impossible
for the Parkinson's patient

78
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,589
to have a normal life.

79
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:08,628
The symptoms of Parkinson's disease
appear to be caused of the degeneration

80
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:13,326
of dopaminergic neurons in the 
<i>substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc)</i>.

81
00:06:13,326 --> 00:06:15,871
So that's a part of the brain
that we've already discussed

82
00:06:15,871 --> 00:06:17,684
in previous videos.

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,803
Here you see it in the mouse brain,
the location of

84
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:25,476
the substantia nigra pars compacta,
the dopaminergic neurons

85
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:28,636
that send their axons to the stratum,
and that's where

86
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,699
they release their dopamine.

87
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:36,112
This seems to be the major place
of neurodegeneration

88
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:39,595
that causes the motor symptoms
of Parkinson's disease.

89
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:45,457
Interestingly, the dopaminergic neurons
of the ventral tegmental area

90
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:48,391
seem to be less affected
and they send their axons

91
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:54,234
to the nucleus accumbens
and to the prefrontal cortex.

92
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,484
They seem to be less affected
by this disease.

93
00:06:57,484 --> 00:07:01,130
So there's some specificity it seems
in the degeneration of the

94
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,453
substantia nigra pars compacta neurons.

95
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:08,117
These dopaminergic neurons
have some cytoplasmic,

96
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,713
protein-rich inclusions
that have been termed

97
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:15,407
Lewy bodies, and they contain
the protein alpha-synuclein

98
00:07:15,407 --> 00:07:17,341
in quite a high concentration.

99
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:22,502
And it may be that alpha-synuclein
aggregates are causally related

100
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:25,267
to the degeneration
of these dopaminergic neurons.

101
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:31,310
By the time of clinical
motor symptoms are diagnosed,

102
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,102
it's estimated that about 60%
of the dopaminergic neurons here

103
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:39,207
in the <i>substantia nigra</i>
are already dead.

104
00:07:40,907 --> 00:07:43,766
In terms of the amount
of dopamine here, in the striatal,

105
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:48,900
it's thought that there's about an 80%
decrease in the dopamine content here

106
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,641
of striatal dopamine.

107
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:57,056
There's a massive loss of dopamine
by the time clinical symptoms

108
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:59,097
of Parkinson's are diagnosed.

109
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,397
It's likely that there will presumably be
earlier symptoms that are more difficult

110
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:08,396
to find by the clinicians
and in the future research,

111
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:11,912
it'll be important to try and study
how early one can diagnose

112
00:08:11,912 --> 00:08:13,650
Parkinson's disease.

113
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,436
In fact it seems that
the neurodegeneration

114
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:20,826
may not begin in the 
substantia nigra pars compacta

115
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:21,976
but might be coming up

116
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,157
from the brainstem
or from other areas

117
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:27,533
of the periphery
and it's thought that maybe

118
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,328
alpha-synuclein in a prion-like process

119
00:08:30,328 --> 00:08:33,587
might actually be spreading
along different synaptic pathways.

120
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,213
By the time at the endstage
of Parkinson's disease,

121
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,348
it's clear that there are Lewy bodies,
and degenerating neurons

122
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:45,248
even in the neocortex,
and so a large part of the brain

123
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,741
is in fact affected
by Parkinson's disease.

124
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:51,864
Nonetheless, the most important symptoms
of Parkinson's disease

125
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,255
are thought to be caused
by the degeneration here

126
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:59,053
of these dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra pars compacta.

127
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:04,835
The disease is probably generated
by a mixture of the environmental

128
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:09,629
influences and genetic susceptibility,
just like most diseases

129
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,398
that one can think of.

130
00:09:11,398 --> 00:09:14,548
It's likely that anything that causes
the degeneration of

131
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:16,818
these substantia nigra pars compacta

132
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:19,878
dopaminergic neurons, will give rise
to the same motor symptoms

133
00:09:19,878 --> 00:09:22,902
that are similar in common
with Parkinson's disease.

134
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,507
In the clearest demonstration
of environmental influences,

135
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:33,598
inducing Parkinsonian symptoms
was through the illicit use

136
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:37,480
of intravenous drugs that were
unfortunately contaminated

137
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,902
with <i>MPTP</i>,

138
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:45,197
<i>Methyl-phenyl-tetrahydropyridine</i>,
<i>MPTP</i> was then injected

139
00:09:45,197 --> 00:09:47,817
intravenously together
with the illicit drug

140
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:52,514
and that relatively rapidly induced
Parkinsonian-like symptoms

141
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:55,722
in quite a number of people
who took this drug.

142
00:09:56,583 --> 00:10:00,950
The mechanism of action of <i>MPTP</i>
has then been investigated.

143
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:05,320
<i>MPTP</i> is lipophilic,
it crosses the blood brain barrier

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,674
so it can enter into the brain
and in the brain, it's metabolized

145
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:14,041
to another compound called
<i>methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)</i>

146
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,346
it's a cation.

147
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:20,649
And this compound, MPP+ is toxic
and it appears to induce

148
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,374
mitochondrial toxicity and in fact,
a great deal of evidence suggests

149
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:30,052
mitochondrial toxicity in the degeneration
of the dopaminergic neurons

150
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:31,975
from different perspectives.

151
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:37,320
In animal models, it turns out that MPTP
causes Parkinson's-like symptoms,

152
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,938
and also a loss of dopaminergic neurons
and indeed that's one of the experimental

153
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:46,121
models that people try to mimic
Parkinson's disease so that they can see

154
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:49,526
what the possible treatments are
that might work.

155
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:53,596
Other environmental influences
that have been recognized

156
00:10:53,596 --> 00:10:58,428
include pesticides and insecticides
and in rural areas,

157
00:10:58,428 --> 00:11:02,396
it seems that there's in general,
often an increase in the prevalence

158
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,010
of Parkinson's disease.

159
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:07,984
Now not everyone who lives
in the environment

160
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:12,652
where pesticides or insecticides
are being used gets Parkinson's disease

161
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:15,052
and so it's probably likely
that it's an interaction

162
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:19,122
between the gene and the environment
that causes the prevalence

163
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:20,416
of Parkinson's disease.

164
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:25,013
Indeed, it's very clear that there are
genetic influences that affect

165
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:26,751
Parkinson's disease.

166
00:11:27,574 --> 00:11:32,827
Somewhere between five and perhaps
up to 50% of Parkinson's disease

167
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:36,252
has some genetic element
associated with it.

168
00:11:36,984 --> 00:11:41,012
And there have been a great number
of studies carrying out

169
00:11:41,012 --> 00:11:46,494
so-called genome wide association studies 
where they look at the prevalence

170
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,910
of Parkinson's disease
with different genetic mutations

171
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,264
in the population.

172
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:59,075
Many different so-called 
susceptibility loci have been identified,

173
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:03,786
regions where there are mutations
that correlate with increased prevalence

174
00:12:03,786 --> 00:12:05,330
of Parkinson's disease.

175
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,651
Here, I'll just highlight
two genomic regions

176
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,027
that have been associated
with increased chances

177
00:12:12,027 --> 00:12:13,378
of Parkinson's disease.

178
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:18,781
The first one is alpha-synuclein
and that's an interesting target

179
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:22,544
that's been identified in these
genome wide association studies

180
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:25,147
because alpha-synuclein
is one of the key proteins

181
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,253
that's sitting inside the Lewy bodies
and might be causally related

182
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:33,892
to the degeneration
of these dopaminergic neurons.

183
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:38,868
So quite a number of different mutations
have independently been found

184
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:43,554
in alpha-synuclein so that it increases
the confidence that this is real

185
00:12:44,214 --> 00:12:49,557
and some of the mutations turn out to be
very powerful so there's a mutation here

186
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:53,541
in Amino Acid 53 of alpha-synuclein
that turns out to be dominant

187
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,816
and that means that it's very likely
that you get Parkinson's disease

188
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,479
if you have this mutation,
whereas other mutations

189
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:02,964
for example REP1, a dinucleotide
repeat expansion,

190
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:05,572
it's sitting somewhere upstream
of alpha-synuclein

191
00:13:05,572 --> 00:13:09,697
so it's a regulatory element
and that has a much smaller effect

192
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:14,799
and might just change the timing
of when Parkinson's disease might happen

193
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,154
or increase the chances in a small way.

194
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:21,794
So there are different mutations
in the genomic area surrounding

195
00:13:21,794 --> 00:13:27,991
the alpha-synuclein gene and that have
varying strengths of influence

196
00:13:27,991 --> 00:13:32,603
upon the probability of a person
getting Parkinson's disease.

197
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:38,986
Another gene that's been implicated
is <i>LRRK2 Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2</i>

198
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:44,115
again, many independent mutations
have been found that associate

199
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,609
with Parkinson's disease
and there's some hints

200
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:49,835
that some aberrant kinase activity
might be responsible

201
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:53,984
for the deficits induced
by <i>LRRK2</i> mutations.

202
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:57,404
However, I think it's important
to point out that we don't know

203
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:01,821
the normal physiological function
of alpha-synuclein or LRRK2

204
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:06,839
and so it's clear that a great deal
of basic research needs to be done

205
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,842
before we can understand
the link between these mutations

206
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,835
and Parkinson's disease.

207
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:16,621
One of the good things
about Parkinson's disease

208
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:22,927
is that there are relatively efficacious
treatments for many of the symptoms.

209
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:31,164
<i>L-DOPA</i> treatment is the first line
of treatment in Parkinson's disease

210
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:35,946
and this was something that was developed
in the 50's by Arvid Carlsson

211
00:14:35,946 --> 00:14:38,703
and in the year 2000
he won the Nobel Prize

212
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:44,667
for his work both in terms of identifying
dopamine as a neurotransmitter

213
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:50,349
and also for developing
what ultimately is still the first

214
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:53,275
and most successful treatment
against Parkinson's disease,

215
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,624
which is <i>L-DOPA</i>.

216
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:00,210
And <i>L-DOPA</i> treatment makes a lot of sense.

217
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,810
We know that Parkinson's disease
results from the degeneration

218
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,164
of dopaminergic neurons
so there's less dopamine in the brain

219
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:12,035
than there should be
and one way which one might go

220
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:14,970
and try to alleviate the symptoms
is to increase the amount

221
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:16,667
of dopamine in the brain.

222
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,834
Now dopamine doesn't pass
the blood brain barrier

223
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:24,406
so you can't just give a patient dopamine
but you can give the natural precursor

224
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:29,747
in the synthetic pathway of dopamine,
<i>L-DOPA</i> that does cross

225
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,580
the blood brain barrier,
it enters into the brain

226
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,543
and the normal enzyme
used in synthesizing dopamine

227
00:15:36,543 --> 00:15:40,172
<i>DOPA decarboxylase</i>
can then act on the <i>L-DOPA</i>

228
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,147
that's been administered
just as a pill that you can take.

229
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:49,763
It releases dopamine into the brain
and it causes a remarkable benefit

230
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:53,727
and alleviates the symptoms
of Parkinson's disease.

231
00:15:54,961 --> 00:15:59,709
However, high doses and long term use
of <i>L-DOPA</i> are associated

232
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,665
with quite serious side effects.

233
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:05,187
Including dyskinesia
where unwanted movements

234
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:11,915
are initiated and in some cases also,
overall changes in character of the person.

235
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:15,362
So when the drug treatments fail,
then some of the symptoms

236
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:20,958
of Parkinson's disease can be alleviated
by so-called deep brain stimulation -

237
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,927
<i>DBS</i>.

238
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:27,092
Deep brain stimulation
consists of implanting

239
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:32,653
electrodes into the brain,
and at the tip of these electrodes

240
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:36,532
one can then drive currents
and stimulate the area of the brain

241
00:16:36,532 --> 00:16:40,784
that's targeted by this electrode
that's implanted into the brain.

242
00:16:41,594 --> 00:16:46,174
What turns out to be successful
in the treatment of Parkinson's disease,

243
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:50,005
is targeting these deep brain
stimulation electrodes to the so-called

244
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:53,741
<i>subthalamic nucleus (STN)</i>
that's colored in red here,

245
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,361
in the schematic coronal section
of the human brain.

246
00:16:59,012 --> 00:17:02,523
Also indicated are other parts
of the basal ganglia.

247
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:05,971
So the subthalamic nucleus
that we haven't discussed yet

248
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:10,077
are the glutamatergic excitatory neurons
of the basal ganglia,

249
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,402
whereas these other
blue colored structures

250
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:16,457
are GABAergic neurons
of the basal ganglia.

251
00:17:16,771 --> 00:17:20,223
So we've already discussed the striatum
and in the human brain

252
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:23,622
this can be divided into two parts
the Caudate and the Putamen

253
00:17:23,622 --> 00:17:27,679
they're both part of the same striatum
and they're just divided in two,

254
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,633
by axonal pathways of the cortical
pyramidal tract

255
00:17:32,553 --> 00:17:36,993
with the internal capsules,
so these are largely the same types

256
00:17:36,993 --> 00:17:40,173
of cells and both are part
of the striatum.

257
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:46,139
The striatum as we know,
projects both to the Globus pallidus

258
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:51,567
and it projects to the substantia nigra
and also the so called internal segment

259
00:17:51,567 --> 00:17:53,542
of the Globus pallidus.

260
00:17:54,941 --> 00:18:00,139
The subthalamic nucleus provides
an excitatory drive onto other parts

261
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:02,166
of the basal ganglia.

262
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:08,840
So these electrodes are implanted
bilaterally into the human brain

263
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,791
where they are placed in the subthalamic
nucleus and a neurophysiologist

264
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,793
helps the neurosurgeon guide
this electrode to the right place

265
00:18:16,793 --> 00:18:20,685
in the brain, this is a small structure,
it's a difficult surgery to do,

266
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:26,829
but when it's successful, the recovery
in terms of alleviating the symptoms

267
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,740
of Parkinson's disease is really
quite remarkable.

268
00:18:30,522 --> 00:18:34,228
So after implantation surgery
and recovery from the surgery,

269
00:18:34,228 --> 00:18:38,843
then high frequency stimulation
is applied to the tips of these electrodes

270
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,655
and there's 100 Hz stimulation,
so every 10 milliseconds

271
00:18:44,732 --> 00:18:48,204
there's a stimulus delivered here
at the tip of these electrodes

272
00:18:48,204 --> 00:18:51,785
and that's done continuously
throughout the life

273
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:53,686
of the Parkinson's patient.

274
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:58,217
That turns out to provide
an almost immediate relief

275
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,040
of the symptoms.

276
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:05,823
You can learn more about Deep Brain
Stimulation from looking at YouTube videos

277
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:09,556
which I think are really quite informative
and one that I like

278
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:13,593
is by Professor Hagai Bergman
of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

279
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:19,922
He's one of the inventors of Deep Brain
Stimulation and a neurophysiologist

280
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:23,409
who's studied Parkinson's disease
and the basal ganglia

281
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:24,763
for a long time.

282
00:19:25,736 --> 00:19:30,893
You may also be interested
in the self report of Andrew Johnson

283
00:19:32,442 --> 00:19:35,989
a patient who has been implanted
with Deep Brain Stimulation electrodes

284
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:40,146
shows how efficacious
the brain stimulation is.

285
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:45,771
What's remarkable about Deep Brain
Stimulation in general is that

286
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:51,210
there are more than 100,000 
patients already implanted

287
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,922
with stimulation electrodes
and so clearly, this is a successful

288
00:19:55,922 --> 00:20:00,081
treatment in late stages
of Parkinson's disease

289
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:02,786
that can help patients dramatically.

290
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:07,612
Unfortunately, the mechanisms
by which Deep Brain Stimulation works

291
00:20:07,612 --> 00:20:09,897
is more or less mysterious.

292
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:16,592
Here we put the neural circuits
that connect the subthalamic nucleus

293
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:22,131
to basal ganglia, Thalamus and Cortex,
to try and put together some idea

294
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:24,201
of how it might be working.

295
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:28,139
So the basic deficit
with Parkinson's disease

296
00:20:28,689 --> 00:20:33,326
is the degeneration of the dopaminergic
inputs to striatum

297
00:20:33,326 --> 00:20:35,599
and also the subthalamic nucleus.

298
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:40,208
Now we've previously noted
that dopaminergic input

299
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:45,837
tries to potentiate the <i>D1</i> pathway,
the pathway from Cortex,

300
00:20:45,837 --> 00:20:50,451
running through the direct striatal
projection neurons but then inhibits

301
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:53,971
Substantia nigra pars reticulata
and the Globus pallidus

302
00:20:54,084 --> 00:20:58,360
internal segment. These are the
output of the basal ganglia.

303
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:06,021
So if we now remove the dopamine
then that'll cause a decrease

304
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:10,076
in the efficacy of this pathway,
so in Parkinson's disease,

305
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:13,446
we think that there's going to be
a deficit in this pathway,

306
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:18,698
and conversely, the <i>D2</i> pathway
may well be up-regulated.

307
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:24,541
So if we remove the inhibition here, 
the Globus pallidus internal neurons

308
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:28,316
and Substantia nigra pars reticulata
neurons are perhaps

309
00:21:28,316 --> 00:21:29,975
going to be overactive.

310
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,684
That means that they're going
to inhibit the thalamus

311
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:35,520
more than they should be doing
and they'll then shut down

312
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,142
the overall motor output.
Equally, of course,

313
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:43,819
Substantia nigra has
descending projections

314
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:49,824
to the brainstem motor areas
and again, this will then

315
00:21:49,824 --> 00:21:52,243
cause a decrease in movement.

316
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:56,447
And that's then consistent with much 
of what we know about Parkinson's disease.

317
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,616
There's Bradykinesia, 
difficulty in initiating

318
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:04,323
movements and that could then,
reflect this decreased importance

319
00:22:04,426 --> 00:22:08,240
of the direct striatal projection
neurons mediated via

320
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,588
a loss of dopamine, 
and then a lack of stimulation

321
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:14,105
of the <i>D1</i> receptors.

322
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:21,472
Now, if we stimulate the subthalamic
nucleus, and that's what we do

323
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,511
with the Deep Brain Stimulation.

324
00:22:23,647 --> 00:22:27,496
The first notion would be
that we stimulate these neurons,

325
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:30,106
cause action potentials
in the subthalamic neurons

326
00:22:30,229 --> 00:22:33,819
and that would then release
glutamate upon it's target structures.

327
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:38,345
That would be stimulating the Globus
pallidus and Substantia nigra

328
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:40,731
and these GABAergic neurons
would then be causing

329
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:46,425
further inhibition and would then
apparently be doing the exact opposite

330
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,276
of what one would want.

331
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:53,224
So apparently that's not how
Deep Brain Stimulation works

332
00:22:53,224 --> 00:22:55,680
and so other ideas have come up.

333
00:22:56,704 --> 00:23:02,253
One idea is that the 100 Hz stimulation
of the subthalamic nucleus,

334
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:06,502
instead of stimulating this nucleus,
actually inactivates it,

335
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:09,928
so high frequency stimulation
might be acting to inactivate

336
00:23:10,508 --> 00:23:16,199
this nucleus and that would then reduce
the excitation of the Globus pallidus

337
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:20,234
and that would then allow
motor output to take place.

338
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,789
And so that's one possible way
in which the Deep Brain Stimulation

339
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,199
might be working.

340
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:30,314
Other hypotheses are that actually
it's not the stimulation

341
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:33,794
of the subthalamic nucleus itself,
but rather of the axons

342
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:37,435
that are terminating in that region
that mediate the positive effects

343
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:39,029
of Deep Brain Stimulation.

344
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:43,405
So it could be that it's actually
stimulation of the cortical neurons

345
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:46,387
that project here that cause
the positive effects

346
00:23:46,387 --> 00:23:49,872
of Deep Brain Stimulation,
or perhaps it's because of

347
00:23:49,872 --> 00:23:53,344
the Globus pallidus axons 
that are being stimulated

348
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,596
or dopaminergic innervation here.

349
00:23:55,956 --> 00:24:00,946
There are many possible ideas
as to how the Deep Brain Stimulation

350
00:24:00,946 --> 00:24:06,291
occurs whether it's an activation
of these neurons or an inactivation

351
00:24:06,291 --> 00:24:10,116
of these neurons, or whether
it's affecting the other components

352
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:16,067
that are sending the axons here
or perhaps it's because there are unusual

353
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:21,841
rhythms in the Parkinsonian patient,
there are high frequency, 10 to 20 Hz,

354
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:24,476
so called beta oscillations
that are prominent

355
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:27,088
in Parkinsonian patients 
and perhaps stimulating

356
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:31,391
subthalamic nucleus disrupts
those beta oscillations

357
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:33,424
and that might be how it works.

358
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:36,535
I think what's clear
is that further research

359
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:40,358
is needed to understand
how Deep Brain Stimulation works,

360
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:43,863
and of course, if one gains
an understanding of that,

361
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:46,749
one may be able to target
better therapies

362
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:50,730
or better stimulation methods
to be more specific,

363
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:54,773
because of course, the Deep Brain
Stimulation also comes

364
00:24:54,773 --> 00:24:56,805
with a variety of side effects.

365
00:24:57,902 --> 00:25:02,047
So in this video we have seen
that there's a variety of brain disorders

366
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:07,210
that make a large socio-economic impact
upon the world.

367
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,780
Neuroscientists are working hard to try 
and understand these brain disorders,

368
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:16,325
try to come up with cures, 
and at least to alleviate the symptoms.

369
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:19,763
That's what we see in the context
of Parkinson's disease

370
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:23,020
where we know some of the things
that go wrong in the brain,

371
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,610
that are associated
with Parkinson's disease.

372
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,472
We know about environmental
influences, we know about genetic

373
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:30,292
susceptibility loci.

374
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:32,762
There's still a lot of work to be done

375
00:25:32,762 --> 00:25:36,104
for Parkinson's disease
and also of course in terms

376
00:25:36,104 --> 00:25:39,447
of alleviating the symptoms, 
and of course, most importantly,

377
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:43,835
would be to try to cure the disease
and prevent the degeneration

378
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,618
of the dopaminergic neurons.

379
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:50,251
The same of course is true for the many
other brain disorders

380
00:25:50,251 --> 00:25:54,524
and I think what's clear
is that the scale of brain disorders

381
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:59,786
in both the social and economic costs
are such that it's really important

382
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:03,815
that a vast amount of brain research
is carried out in the future

383
00:26:03,815 --> 00:26:07,919
so that as rapidly as possible,
we can help those suffering

384
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,644
from various brain diseases.
