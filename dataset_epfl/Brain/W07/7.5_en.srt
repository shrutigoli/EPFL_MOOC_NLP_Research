00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,977
Welcome to the last video
of this course.

2
00:00:08,977 --> 00:00:11,149
I hope you've enjoyed 
learning about

3
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,319
the cellular mechanisms
of brain function.

4
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:16,622
Our goal in this course
was to obtain

5
00:00:16,622 --> 00:00:19,488
a causal and mechanistic 
understanding

6
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:22,733
of how the mammalian
brain works.

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,684
Because the brain is made of cells,

8
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:29,180
in any mechanistic explanation
of brain function,

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,893
it's essential to think 
about the activity

10
00:00:31,893 --> 00:00:36,814
of individual neurons
and their synaptic interactions.

11
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:42,107
The brain is a very large 
synaptically connected neuronal network

12
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:45,345
and the complexity is bewildering.

13
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:48,535
We're only at the beginning
of a great adventure.

14
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:54,199
And clearly we still have much to learn
through further neuroscience research.

15
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,956
However, as we've seen,
modern neuroscience

16
00:00:57,956 --> 00:01:01,981
is beginning to provide answers
about the causal mechanisms

17
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:07,206
underlying simple behaviors,
at least in mice.

18
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:10,423
And much of what we learn
from studying mice,

19
00:01:10,423 --> 00:01:14,290
will have direct implications 
for understanding

20
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,985
human brain function and dysfunction,

21
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,766
and will likely give rise
to novel therapies

22
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:23,714
for various brain disorders.

23
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:27,407
This course has focused on 
the biophysics of brain function

24
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:31,908
seeking to explain the milliscecond
by millisecond processing

25
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:36,178
of sensorimotor information
by neurons, synapses,

26
00:01:36,178 --> 00:01:39,279
and neuronal circuits during behavior.

27
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:43,511
We've tried to bridge different 
spatiotemporal scales

28
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:46,299
of analysis of the mammalian brain.

29
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,579
From nanometer-sized ion channels

30
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:52,879
transitioning between closed
and open states

31
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,391
on the microsecond time scale,

32
00:01:55,391 --> 00:02:00,420
ranging to the investigation of intact
sensorimotor neuronal circuits,

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,650
spanning a centimeter or so
in the mouse brain,

34
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,144
and operating on behaviorally 
relevant time scales

35
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:13,440
from milliseconds to days during
the learning of behavioral tasks.

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
Remarkable technological advances
are driving the discovery

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,739
of new aspects of brain function
through measurement and perturbations

38
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,060
with increasing specificity
in behaving mice.

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,266
It now seems quite likely
that in the next 50 years or so,

40
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:36,807
we'll have a very good understanding
of how the mouse brain works.

41
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,753
Obviously, in a short course 
of seven weeks,

42
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:43,864
it's only possible to cover
some selected topics.

43
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:47,093
I hope this course has provided you
with a good foundation

44
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:51,111
allowing you to think further
about how the brain works.

45
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:55,270
And I hope this course has 
wet your appetite to learn more.

46
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,574
Here we've taken a biophysical, 
bottom up approach

47
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,511
to studying the mammalian brain.

48
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:03,232
But there are many other
important perspectives,

49
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:06,884
many of which we've barely 
touched upon in this course.

50
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:12,121
For example, developmental studies
and comparative studies across species

51
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:15,005
will help us understand the logic
of how the nervous system

52
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,356
is put together,

53
00:03:16,356 --> 00:03:21,692
giving important information
about general, organizing principles.

54
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:26,376
We only briefly mentioned some aspects
of molecular biology and genetics.

55
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:30,319
And there's much more to learn
about molecular neuroscience

56
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,295
both in terms of providing
sophisticated tools

57
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,428
for studying the functioning
of the mammalian brain,

58
00:03:37,428 --> 00:03:42,905
but also in terms of modeling
human genetic brain disorders in mice

59
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:46,320
with the hope of better 
understanding brain diseases

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,593
in order to provide 
rational treatments.

61
00:03:50,593 --> 00:03:55,114
Finally, as we obtain increasingly 
detailed information

62
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:57,098
on how the brain works,

63
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,541
it will become more and more important

64
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:04,346
to quantitatively test these hypotheses
from computational modeling

65
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:07,589
and it is therefore important
for the modern neuroscientist

66
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:12,357
to be intimately familiar
with mathematical modeling methods

67
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:14,611
So I also encourage you to spend time

68
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:19,989
studying computational
and theoretical neuroscience.

69
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:22,432
With these last thoughts in mind,

70
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:25,738
I'd like to thank you for 
your participation in this course

71
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:29,119
and to wish you all 
the best for the future.
