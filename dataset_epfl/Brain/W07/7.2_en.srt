1
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:08,130
When we first think about 
sensory perception,

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,636
it seems trivial.

3
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:12,791
We look at the world around us,
and we see objects.

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,743
We listen and we hear sounds.

5
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:17,533
We sniff, and we smell fragrances.

6
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:21,860
And it all fits together in one
unified world view:

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,546
our perceived reality.

8
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:26,144
However, when we start thinking about

9
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:28,512
the underlying neuronal mechanisms,

10
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:32,640
it turns out that we're only
just beginning to get our first clues

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,626
as to how sensory perception works.

12
00:00:36,346 --> 00:00:41,686
Sensory perception is an active process
in at least two different ways.

13
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:46,630
Firstly, motor control is very important
for sensory perception.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,649
We actively gather sensory information.

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,895
And that's what we discussed
in the last video.

16
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,164
We make eye movements
and head movements

17
00:00:54,164 --> 00:00:57,489
to see specific parts
of the visual field.

18
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:00,684
And we move our hands 
and fingers to touch objects,

19
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:04,858
actively get tactile
sensory information.

20
00:01:06,328 --> 00:01:08,389
It turns out that sensory perception

21
00:01:08,389 --> 00:01:11,535
is active in another way 
of thinking also,

22
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:18,357
in which our neuronal activity
actively generates our sensory percepts.

23
00:01:18,697 --> 00:01:22,035
That sensory percepts are subjective,

24
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:25,558
can easily be seen by
looking at images like this

25
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:29,363
that evoke bistable percepts.

26
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,351
We have one set of photons
that fall upon the retina,

27
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:35,688
but if you stare at 
this image for long enough,

28
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,023
you'll see two alternating percepts.

29
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:42,665
Either you see the two white faces
looking at each other,

30
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:45,223
with their noses almost touching,

31
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:48,728
or you see the black cup
in the middle.

32
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:51,588
And it's one set of light
that falls on the retina,

33
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:55,590
but the brain generates
two distinct percepts from it.

34
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,056
Clearly, sensory percepts are
internal constructs

35
00:01:59,056 --> 00:02:02,530
that are generated by
neuronal activity.

36
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,018
And right now, 
neuroscientists think

37
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:07,774
that it's largely the activity
of neurons in the neocortex

38
00:02:07,774 --> 00:02:10,580
that generate our sensory percepts.

39
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,550
And so for that causal
and mechanistic insight

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,063
into how sensory percepts occur,

41
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:18,649
we need to look at the activity
of individual nerve cells

42
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,444
and how they talk to each other,

43
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:25,365
perhaps with a particular focus
upon what's going on in the neocortex.

44
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:29,457
So sensory percepts are not just 
out there in the world,

45
00:02:29,457 --> 00:02:34,787
but they're actively generated
by the internal activity of our brain.

46
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:40,203
Sensory percepts are also learned
through experience.

47
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,618
And it's because we've seen
many silhouettes before,

48
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:47,639
that we recognize this as 
a silhouette of a human.

49
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:49,738
And so the reason 
we recognize objects

50
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:53,940
is because we've seen many 
closely related images before,

51
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,981
images of faces and people
from many different angles.

52
00:02:57,981 --> 00:03:01,088
And our brain has managed
to extract the appropriate

53
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:04,558
statistics that associate 
that information.

54
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:09,468
And so, as we are all aware of
from watching young babies,

55
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:12,808
we don't immediately know
how to perceive the world,

56
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:16,453
but we learn to see 
the world around us.

57
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:20,333
And the same is true of course,
for all of our other sensory inputs.

58
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:26,181
So how are we going to investigate
subjective, learned, sensory percepts?

59
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:28,549
Well, we clearly need to be
able to deliver

60
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:31,117
well controlled sensory stiumuli.

61
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:35,926
That's then going to evoke
neuronal computations inside the brain.

62
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:39,220
And those are going to depend 
upon context, learning,

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,752
and also the goals 
of the particular moment.

64
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:47,578
And if we're going to experimentally
investigate the subjective percept,

65
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:53,362
then we also need the subject
to report what it is that it's feeling.

66
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:56,097
And so we need to have a motor output

67
00:03:56,097 --> 00:04:00,590
where behavior reports 
the subjective percept.

68
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,708
And so if this were a human
psychophysics experiment,

69
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,263
we would have two buttons.

70
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:11,205
One that the human observer
would push if he sees two faces,

71
00:04:11,205 --> 00:04:13,787
and another button
if he sees the black cup.

72
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,124
And he would then 
be pushing in alternation

73
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,337
these two buttons

74
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,722
as a percept flickered
from one to the other.

75
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:25,639
And so, an important concept
in terms of experimental investigation,

76
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,887
is that sensory percepts must be 
reported through motor ouput.

77
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:35,864
And we might consider this, all together,
as a learned, goal-directed,

78
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:37,859
sensorimotor transformation.

79
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:42,650
And that then, might represent
the minimal, essential core feature

80
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,894
of sensory perception,

81
00:04:43,894 --> 00:04:46,448
that it has to form a learned,

82
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:50,313
perhaps relatively abstract
sensorimotor transform.

83
00:04:50,313 --> 00:04:53,656
Now, sensory perception 
is rather complicated,

84
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:57,436
and it might be a good idea 
to start with very simple forms

85
00:04:57,436 --> 00:04:58,831
of sensory perception,

86
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:03,299
if we want to get to the detailed,
mechanistic and causal insight

87
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,814
into how it actually works.

88
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:09,601
The simplest form 
of sensory perception is detection.

89
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,274
Simply to say, is there a stimulus or not?

90
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:15,202
And that's what we're 
going to investigate here,

91
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,178
in the whisker sensory system.

92
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:23,118
We implant metal head holders
onto the head of mice,

93
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,871
so we can head-restrain them,

94
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,284
make recording chambers
that allows us to do

95
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:31,757
electrophysiological and imaging 
experiments at high resolution.

96
00:05:31,757 --> 00:05:34,720
The animal sits inside a cardboard roll

97
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,785
where it feels relatively comfortable,

98
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:39,219
and in addition, we have 
a plate here in front

99
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:41,713
that restrains the movement 
of its forepaw,

100
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:45,302
so it can't for example,
scratch its nose.

101
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:48,958
Onto the whisker we place
a small piece of metal.

102
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:53,120
And the whole animal site on top
of a electromagnetic coil.

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,078
We can then drive current pulses
through that electromagnetic coil

104
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:00,519
that generates magnetic fields,

105
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,386
and those magnetic fields,
act upon the metal particle

106
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:06,635
and cause a force to be applied.

107
00:06:06,635 --> 00:06:10,085
And we can make these
magnetic pulses relatively short,

108
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:12,440
about one millisecond in duration,

109
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,506
and so a one millisecond impulse
is applied to the whisker,

110
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,666
and that occurs at a random time.

111
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:23,824
The animal has no cue to tell us
when that stimulus is coming.

112
00:06:23,824 --> 00:06:26,587
So the animal is waiting,
waiting, waiting,

113
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:27,911
and every now and then,

114
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:30,847
there's a brief one millisecond 
pulse on the whisker,

115
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,330
and what the animal has 
to learn in this behavior,

116
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,557
is that that one millisecond
whisker stimulus

117
00:06:36,557 --> 00:06:40,990
means that reward is available
from this licking spout.

118
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,282
And if it licks immediately
after the whisker stimulation,

119
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,622
then it gets a droplet
of liquid reward.

120
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:51,784
And we monitor the tongue
contacting the spout here

121
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,694
through so-called piezo film,

122
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:56,569
that then gives us 
a little electrical signal

123
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,499
when the tongue touches the spout.

124
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,367
And we can threshold that,
and use that to open a valve

125
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,749
and deliver liquid water.

126
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,590
And so for the trials 
in which we stimulate,

127
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,644
there are two different outcomes.

128
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:13,027
If the animal licks
during the reward window,

129
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:14,927
which we set at one second,

130
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:19,001
then we open the valve
and the animal gets a reward.

131
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:22,244
On other trials,
we give the same stimulus

132
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,591
but the animal fails to lick.

133
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,876
And this is then a miss trial
and of course,

134
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:28,931
there's no reward that's delivered.

135
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:32,951
And so as the first indicator,
we can quantify performance

136
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,685
as a so-called hit rate--

137
00:07:34,685 --> 00:07:37,325
the fraction of trials
where the animal licks,

138
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:41,499
compared to the total number of trials
where we deliver a stimulus.

139
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:45,860
We can also look at another trial type
where we don't stimulate,

140
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,739
and sometimes the animal
will spontaneously lick.

141
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,873
We can think of those 
as false alarm trials.

142
00:07:50,873 --> 00:07:53,139
And these might also be
very interesting to analyze.

143
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,751
Perhaps the animal is dreaming
of a whisker stimulus being delivered.

144
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,686
And something 
in the neuronal activity

145
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,835
then makes it lick.

146
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,786
And we can think of other trials
where we don't stimulate--

147
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:07,323
the animal doesn't lick,

148
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,317
and those are then 
correct rejection trials.

149
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:14,955
On the first day, when the animal
goes into the behavioral apparatus,

150
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:17,137
the animal knows
that licking is a good thing,

151
00:08:17,137 --> 00:08:19,937
that it sometimes gets 
reward when it licks,

152
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:21,297
but it doesn't know when.

153
00:08:21,297 --> 00:08:28,637
It has no idea that the whisker
stimulation is a cue to initiate licking,

154
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:30,919
and that when there's no stimulation,

155
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:32,598
there's no reward that's
going to happen.

156
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:36,227
And so it licks just as much
on stimulation trials,

157
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:39,032
as on no stimulation trials.

158
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:43,742
Through trial and error
and reward-based learning,

159
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:47,816
the animal learns that licking
after a stimulus is a good thing,

160
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:51,610
and it begins to pick up 
something like 70 to 80 percent

161
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,716
of the trials in which we stimulate,
and licks in response to that stimulus.

162
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:59,577
It also learns that when
there's no stimulation,

163
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:01,516
there's no point in licking.

164
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:04,951
And so it learns to suppress the licking
in the absence of a stimulus.

165
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:07,663
And it 's really the divergence 
of these two curves,

166
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,687
that tells us that the animal
has learned the behavior.

167
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,842
We can also look at 
the psychophysics of this behavior

168
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:17,984
where we plot the stimulus strength
against performance of the animal.

169
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:20,560
And as we turn the stimulus strength down,

170
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,700
the fraction of trials in which
the animal perceives a stimulus

171
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,096
and gives a motor output 
in terms of licking, goes down.

172
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,825
And somewhere here,
we're at about half way in performance,

173
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:35,101
and that's a so-called
psychophysical threshold.

174
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,615
As we decrease the stimulus even further,

175
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:42,099
there's no licking above 
the false alarm rate,

176
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,789
and so here the stimulus
is undetectable.

177
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,973
And so this is a standard
psychometric function

178
00:09:47,973 --> 00:09:50,407
for any given behavior.

179
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,965
Now, we're interested in
the neurobiology of this behavior.

180
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:57,598
What's the neuronal activity
that causally drives

181
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:01,788
this learned, goal-directed
sensorimotor transformation?

182
00:10:01,788 --> 00:10:04,636
We've already looked a bit
at the sensory pathway

183
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:09,548
where whisker deflection causes
depolarization of sensory nerve terminals,

184
00:10:09,548 --> 00:10:12,729
and action potential firing down
the trigeminal nerve,

185
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:16,436
information crosses the glutamatergic
synapses in the brainstem,

186
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:19,726
an action potential takes 
information to the thalamus,

187
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:24,276
and other glutamatergic synapse 
then brings the thalamocortical

188
00:10:24,276 --> 00:10:26,429
action potential to the neocortex

189
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:28,527
in the primary somatosensory cortex.

190
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,323
And then in the primary 
somatosensory cortex,

191
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:32,762
we have this exquisite
one-to-one mapping

192
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,364
of the sensory periphery 
where each whisker

193
00:10:35,364 --> 00:10:38,774
is individually represented
in an anatomical unit,

194
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:40,293
a so-called barrel.

195
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:43,935
And so if we put sensory 
information here on the C2 whisker,

196
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,545
we might then expect 
that if the neocortex is involved,

197
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:50,907
that the C2 barrel column 
might be a key area

198
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:55,290
for where this behavior
might depend upon.

199
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:59,177
So we can test that by 
inactivating this part of the brain,

200
00:10:59,177 --> 00:11:03,336
and see if that makes any impact
upon behavioral performance.

201
00:11:03,336 --> 00:11:07,520
So here we have the animal
sitting in the behavioral apparatus,

202
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,016
it's performing the task,

203
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,476
it's picking up something like
80 percent of the stimuli,

204
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:13,332
and licking in response to them,

205
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:19,051
and at sometime we inject tetrodotoxin
into the C2 barrel column

206
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,156
of the mouse barrel cortex.

207
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:26,191
And that causes a dramatic and rapid 
decrement in behavioral performance.

208
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,724
TTX is a blocker of voltage-gated
sodium channels.

209
00:11:29,724 --> 00:11:31,721
It prevents action potential firing.

210
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:34,491
And so here we've blocked
action potential firing,

211
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:38,683
in the primary somatosensory cortex,
and that's caused a deficit in behavior.

212
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:42,576
So apparently, action potential firing
in the C2 barrel column,

213
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,843
is essential in order 
to perform this task.

214
00:11:45,843 --> 00:11:49,606
We can inject other agents
like CNQX and APV

215
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:52,113
to block AMPA and NMDA receptors.

216
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:54,591
And we see that there's a similar
deficit in performance.

217
00:11:54,591 --> 00:11:57,980
And so apparently, glutamatergic
synaptic transmission,

218
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,470
is also essential 
to carry out this behavior.

219
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,703
As control experiments,
we can inject the Ringer solution

220
00:12:05,703 --> 00:12:08,886
that dissolves these agents
and that has no impact.

221
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:12,091
Or we can inject the tetrodotoxin toxin
into another brain area here,

222
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:15,686
into the primary somatosensory 
forepaw representation

223
00:12:15,686 --> 00:12:19,118
about a millimeter or so away
from the C2 barrel column.

224
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:21,798
And that also doesn't cause a deficit.

225
00:12:21,798 --> 00:12:26,042
So there's some degree of specificity
to these pharmacological inactivations.

226
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:30,626
And it seems that action potential firing
and glutamatergic synaptic transmission

227
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:34,225
are necessary in order to perform
the detection task.

228
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:38,369
We can then see what happens
in the other direction.

229
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:41,303
Can we substitute the whisker stimulation

230
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,712
by directly stimulating 
this area of the brain?

231
00:12:44,712 --> 00:12:47,456
And we can do that by 
expressing channelrhodopsin

232
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:51,409
through injection of viruses
that expressed channelrhodopsin here,

233
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:53,090
coupled with a fluorescent protein,

234
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,509
so we can see where the area
of the brain that's been injected.

235
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,002
Here you see it in post-mortem sections,

236
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:02,455
and there's a small 
localized area of the brain

237
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:04,209
that expresses channelrhodopsin,

238
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,018
and that of course corresponds
to the C2 barrel column.

239
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,818
And here through mouse genetics,
we've expressed the channelrhodopsin

240
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,746
specifically in excitatory neurons.

241
00:13:14,356 --> 00:13:17,112
After injection of the virus,
it takes a few weeks

242
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:20,006
before the channelrhodopsin expresses.

243
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:22,427
And during that time, 
we can train the animal,

244
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,108
in the standard whisker learning task.

245
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:28,194
And so here the animal
never sees blue light flashes

246
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,168
and we just train it exactly as before,

247
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:33,964
we stimulate the whisker,
and the animal learns to lick in response.

248
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:38,323
Then, once the animal performs 
this task at a high rate,

249
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:40,970
then on a given transfer test day,

250
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:44,159
we ask if we now--
instead of stimulating the whisker,

251
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,189
we now make an optogenetic
stimulation of cortex,

252
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:48,244
what happens?

253
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,707
Does the animal interpret that stimulus
as the same as a whisker stimulation?

254
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,585
Does it perceive the same?

255
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,951
Does that generate
the licking motor output?

256
00:13:56,951 --> 00:14:00,842
And remarkably, in most of the animals
in which we tested,

257
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:04,126
the very first, five millisecond
blue light flash

258
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,984
drove licking behavior.

259
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:07,278
Here's the light flash.

260
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,133
Here's what we're seeing 
on the piezo trace--

261
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,449
the animal's tongue contacts the spout,

262
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:14,511
Here we open the valve
and the animal is now

263
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,747
enjoying its reward.

264
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:19,487
This turned out to be 
a robust phenomenon,

265
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:23,214
where we could replace
the sensory peripheral stimulus

266
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:28,703
of whisker with a light stimulation
directed at the neocortex.

267
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:32,293
And so we can directly replace
sensory stimuli at the periphery

268
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:36,402
by internal stimulation 
of neurons in the neocortex.

269
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:40,810
We can also examine the learning
in the opposite direction.

270
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,456
We can train animals first,
in the optogenetic detection task,

271
00:14:45,456 --> 00:14:48,580
where we now deliver 
five millisecond blue light flashes

272
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,594
to stimulate excitatory neurons
in the S1 cortex,

273
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:55,919
the animal learns to lick
in response to the S1 stimulation,

274
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,362
and after the animals learns that,

275
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:01,595
we then give the very first 
whisker stimuli.

276
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:04,025
And we then ask, 
does the animal now

277
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,277
interpret that stimulus in the same way,

278
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:10,811
and transform that into a goal-directed, 
licking motor output?

279
00:15:10,811 --> 00:15:12,962
And again, the answer is "yes".

280
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,853
We stimulate the whisker,
the animal licks,

281
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,695
and the replacement from 
optogenetic stimulation

282
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:21,232
to a real peripheral stimulation
is extremely good.

283
00:15:21,232 --> 00:15:27,414
And so it seems we can optogenetically 
program the behavior from S1 cortex.

284
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:31,532
And so these data then tell us
that activity in S1 cortex

285
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:35,391
is both necessary and sufficient
in order to generate

286
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:39,372
the perception of a whisker stimulus
that then gets transformed

287
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,935
presumably by downstream brain areas,

288
00:15:41,935 --> 00:15:46,725
into a licking motor ouput
in order to obtain a reward.

289
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:49,685
It's therefore clearly interesting
to find out what types

290
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:53,748
of neuronal activity are taking place
in the C2 barrel column

291
00:15:53,748 --> 00:15:56,162
during task execution.

292
00:15:56,162 --> 00:15:59,003
And here we're making
membrane potential recordings

293
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:03,177
from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons
in the C2 barrel column.

294
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,194
We stimulate the whisker,

295
00:16:05,194 --> 00:16:08,905
and this upper trace 
is from a hit trial,

296
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,923
the animal licks, it gets a reward,

297
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,646
and so by definition,
this is a hit trial.

298
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,042
If we now look at
the membrane potential trace,

299
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:21,238
shortly after stimulation we see 
there is a depolarizing sensory response

300
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:24,673
that is presumably 
the sensory response driven by

301
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:27,268
the feedforward thalamocortical circuits

302
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:31,543
then at a later time,
there's a late depolarization here,

303
00:16:31,543 --> 00:16:34,532
with a couple of action potentials
riding on top of it,

304
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:39,330
and that late depolarization,
nonetheless precedes licking

305
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,863
by hundreds of milliseconds.

306
00:16:40,863 --> 00:16:43,091
And so there could be
a causal relationship

307
00:16:43,091 --> 00:16:47,798
between late depolarization
and driving the licking motor output.

308
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,254
Down below we see a miss trial.

309
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:52,523
We give the same identical stimulus,

310
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:55,494
it drives a depolarizing
sensory response,

311
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:59,270
but the late component here
seems to be less obvious,

312
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:02,269
and of course, there's
no licking and no reward.

313
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:03,892
It's a miss trial.

314
00:17:03,892 --> 00:17:06,572
These are just two individual trials.

315
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:10,308
But they turn out to be representative
of the average trials

316
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:12,056
for this particular recording.

317
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:14,140
And so here we take 
all the hit trials together

318
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,928
and average them into
the black trace.

319
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:19,487
We take all the miss trials,
average them together into the red trace,

320
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:23,211
and here at time of stimulus,
you see that both hit and miss trials

321
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:26,364
generate large, obvious
sensory responses,

322
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:30,169
and there's no obvious difference
between the hit and the miss trial.

323
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:33,726
So there's a early, reliable
sensory response

324
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:37,364
And that's probably a good thing,
we are in primary somatosensory cortex

325
00:17:37,364 --> 00:17:41,212
and so you'd expect there to be
a good, reliable representation

326
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,426
of the periphery.

327
00:17:43,426 --> 00:17:46,930
At later times these two traces diverge,

328
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,295
with depolarization being more prominent
on hit trials than miss trials.

329
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:54,445
And that's accompanied by
enhanced action potential firing

330
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,765
on hit trials compared to miss trials,

331
00:17:56,765 --> 00:18:01,561
and all of that precedes the licking
by some hundredths of milliseconds.

332
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:05,426
So here in this late 
component of activity

333
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:09,646
we have something that correlates
with the subjective percept of the animal,

334
00:18:09,646 --> 00:18:11,780
as reported by licking.

335
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:18,166
We think that late depolarization,
correlating with subjective percept,

336
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,427
is interesting, because similar
results have been found in humans.

337
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:25,756
And so here in the work
of Stanislas Dehaene

338
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,027
and coworkers,

339
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:32,177
he has made measurements
of the human EEG signal

340
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:36,337
across early visual cortex,
and has given visual stimuli

341
00:18:36,337 --> 00:18:40,593
that are just at around the threshold 
for conscious perception.

342
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:43,077
And so some trials are perceived,

343
00:18:43,077 --> 00:18:45,295
and that's indicated by the black trace,

344
00:18:45,295 --> 00:18:47,564
and other trials are not perceived,

345
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:50,757
and that's represented as a red trace.

346
00:18:50,757 --> 00:18:53,810
And what Stanislas Dehaene 
and his colleagues suggest,

347
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,813
is that there's an early, reliable,
sensory response in the visual cortex,

348
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:02,430
and that there are late changes
to activity in the human brain

349
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,350
that correlate with consciously perceived,
or not perceived, stimuli.

350
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,600
And so it looks like something
similar might be happening

351
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,309
in the human brain,
compared to what

352
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,270
we've seen in the mouse.

353
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,661
Now, what's difficult
in the human situation,

354
00:19:17,661 --> 00:19:22,933
is to get a causal perspective
on what this late activity might be doing.

355
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,389
And that's something that we can do
in the mouse system.

356
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:30,353
And so what we need to do then,
is specifically inactivate

357
00:19:30,353 --> 00:19:32,148
late periods of activity.

358
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:35,960
And we can do that by using
channelrhodopsin optogenetics,

359
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,209
and stimulating the GABAergic 
inhibitory neurons.

360
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:41,276
And so here we take the parvalbumin-

361
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:43,536
expressing GABAergic neurons
that you might remember

362
00:19:43,536 --> 00:19:46,810
are the ones that inhibit perisomatically.

363
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,965
We put channelrhodopsin specifically
inside those neurons

364
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:52,406
using mouse genetics,

365
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:54,376
we can then give blue light flashes

366
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,442
and then we can stimulate
action potential firing here

367
00:19:57,442 --> 00:20:00,747
in the parvalbumin-expressing
GABAergic neurons.

368
00:20:00,747 --> 00:20:05,744
That's going to then release GABA,
hyperpolarize the post-synaptic cells,

369
00:20:05,744 --> 00:20:09,504
the excitatory pyramidal neurons
and then we'll then get

370
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:11,361
a hyperpolarization in 
the membrane potential

371
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,768
of these excitatory neurons.

372
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:16,107
And so we'll be able to shut down
primary somatosensory cortex

373
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:19,268
by shining blue light
on GABAergic neurons

374
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,514
expressing channelrhodopsin.

375
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:25,229
So let's have a look at that
in the situation of our experiments.

376
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,315
Here's our C2 whisker deflection,

377
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:29,066
here's our sensory response,

378
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:31,850
the black curve is a normal
control condition,

379
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,350
and if we now turn the blue light on,

380
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,361
immediately around the time
of stimulation,

381
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,110
we get this light blue curve here,

382
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,382
we get rid of the early sensory response

383
00:20:42,382 --> 00:20:45,823
So now we shut down S1,
just at the time

384
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:48,671
where sensory processing
of the stimulus occurs,

385
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,588
and when we look at 
the behavioral performance,

386
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:55,432
that causes a deficit in the detection
of the sensory stimulus.

387
00:20:55,432 --> 00:20:57,874
And so that's really very similar 
to what we found

388
00:20:57,874 --> 00:21:00,638
with the pharmacological
inactivation experiments

389
00:21:00,638 --> 00:21:04,705
where we injected TTX
or CNQX and APV into S1 cortex,

390
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:08,068
and found that caused a deficit
in detection performance.

391
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:09,750
Here we see the same thing

392
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,633
except now, we've done the inactivation

393
00:21:11,633 --> 00:21:14,113
on this time scale of 50 milliseconds

394
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:16,440
and so we know that
it's a neuronal activity

395
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,921
immediately surrounding
whisker stimulus

396
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:21,733
that drives sensory perception.

397
00:21:22,773 --> 00:21:24,478
The question that we were
really interested in,

398
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:28,773
is what happens if we leave that
early sensory response intact,

399
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:31,483
and we only hyperpolarize
at late times.

400
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:33,394
And that's what you see
in this purple trace.

401
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:34,818
We turn the blue light on,

402
00:21:34,818 --> 00:21:37,315
we stimulate the channelrhodopsin,

403
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:40,719
after a hundred milliseconds
that causes hyperpolarization

404
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:44,041
at late times, leaving the early
sensory response intact.

405
00:21:44,531 --> 00:21:46,545
And the question now is,
if we just get rid of

406
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,185
the late depolarization

407
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,530
does that make any 
difference in behavior?

408
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,711
And indeed, it does.

409
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:55,142
It causes a significant 
deficit in detection.

410
00:21:55,142 --> 00:21:59,074
And so that late depolarization
not only correlates

411
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,209
with the subjective percept
of the animal,

412
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:05,266
but it also contributes
to driving that sensory percept.

413
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:09,154
And so we're slowly beginning
to understand mechanistically,

414
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:10,940
the types of neuronal activity

415
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,038
that occur in the mouse brain
during subjective sensory percepts.

416
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:19,014
In this video we've seen that
head-restrained mice

417
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:22,709
can be trained to perform
simple, perceptual tasks.

418
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:26,864
And over the coming years,
we'll get a detailed and mechanistic

419
00:22:26,864 --> 00:22:32,224
understanding of how simple, 
sensorimotor loops are performed.

420
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,373
In the case of the detection task,

421
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:38,996
we've seen that there appear to be
two phases to the sensory processing.

422
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:43,420
An early, reliable response,
and a late depolarization

423
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,985
that seems to correlate
with the subjective percept.

424
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,740
In the years to come,
it will be important to understand

425
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,626
the mechanisms that generate
that late depolarization.

426
00:22:52,626 --> 00:22:58,121
And also the learning mechanisms
that are involved in tying together

427
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:02,018
the sensory input, with the 
goal-directed motor output.

428
00:23:02,608 --> 00:23:04,810
In the next video
we'll begin to examine

429
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,696
the basis of the learning process.
