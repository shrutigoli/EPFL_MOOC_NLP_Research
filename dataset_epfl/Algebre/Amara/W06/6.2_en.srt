00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,100
Management of Protected Areas
6.2 Finance

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,441
In this first episode,
we are going to look together

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:13,811
at the basic concept
of financial planning.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,460
This is about assessing several things.

5
00:00:16,928 --> 00:00:19,278
On the one hand,
the needs of a protected area,

6
00:00:19,508 --> 00:00:22,948
identifying possible revenue,
funding deficiencies.

7
00:00:24,098 --> 00:00:27,238
Then studying preconditions
for the creation

8
00:00:27,238 --> 00:00:29,048
of any financial mechanism.

9
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,946
Is this possible? Feasible?

10
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:34,006
Do institutional, legislative conditions,

11
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:36,076
the capacity of a protected area

12
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:38,856
lead it to the establishment
of a certain mechanism?

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,680
And finally to consolidate everything,

14
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,770
it is recommended
to develop a business plan;

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,200
we will look at that
together in part three.

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,670
First and foremost,
let's look at financial requirements.

17
00:00:51,526 --> 00:00:55,056
When identifying requirements,
note that it is important

18
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:58,696
on the one hand, to make the link
between the management plan's goals,

19
00:00:58,696 --> 00:01:01,080
in terms of activity,
required investment,

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,150
and this, based on needs
and priorities at the time,

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,750
and I will come back to this soon.

22
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:12,197
Secondly, to study opportunities
to reduce costs, optimization.

23
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:15,661
Also to take into account the utility

24
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:18,521
of the financial management system
of a protected area,

25
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:22,321
that is the accounts,
the classification of expenditure,

26
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:25,171
good financial management,
transparency of financial data

27
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,761
and the requirements of audits.

28
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,791
I cannot emphasize enough,
the need for good skills

29
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:32,561
when it comes to the financial management
for a protected area.

30
00:01:34,174 --> 00:01:36,138
Also to analyse carefully

31
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:38,118
the actual financial situation
of previous years.

32
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,458
But keep in mind

33
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:42,718
that budgets for protected areas
are generally determined,

34
00:01:42,718 --> 00:01:44,648
depending on available funds

35
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,608
and not on the actual needs
of a protected area.

36
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:50,783
This management by default is
of course a pragmatic one,

37
00:01:51,163 --> 00:01:54,623
but it does not always allow us
to see good results on the ground,

38
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:58,463
hence the need to set up a business plan.

39
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:03,093
And finally, extrapolating future needs.

40
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,170
As I have mentioned,

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,780
the financial needs of a protected area
are to be evaluated

42
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:10,560
depending on the management plan's
goals and activities.

43
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:14,010
But you will have noted
that a protected area's financial needs

44
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,280
are also dependent on its life cycle.

45
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:19,658
Financial needs
and priorities are not the same

46
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,688
throughout the life of a protected area.

47
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:24,368
Let's look at a fictional example

48
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,288
of a protected area's budget
over 20 years.

49
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:32,513
At the very beginning of the life cycle
of the protected area

50
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:35,083
in the identification phase,

51
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:38,494
we note the great financial needs

52
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:40,694
in the follow-up,

53
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,321
in terms of scientific expertise,
to determine reference points.

54
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:45,979
Fairly important requirements

55
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:49,639
also in consultation with the communities,
with all interested parties.

56
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,910
Then, in the creation phase,

57
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,489
often supported by donors,
by projects.

58
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:02,959
It is at this time that the infrastructure
of the protected area is built,

59
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,029
that personnel is recruited,

60
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:07,769
which are important needs.

61
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,019
Then throughout the operations,

62
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,297
of the protected area
in an operational phase,

63
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:19,837
budgets are more or less balanced.

64
00:03:19,837 --> 00:03:22,087
However, you will note the differences.

65
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:24,426
For example, here,

66
00:03:25,686 --> 00:03:27,616
with a tourism project,

67
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,126
a donor project of course.

68
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,446
A little further on, we have
a community development project.

69
00:03:34,336 --> 00:03:35,536
Still a little further on,

70
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:38,356
a conservation project
or a restoration project.

71
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:41,826
You can see that these different projects
involve jumps

72
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,196
in the budget of a protected area.

73
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,548
You will have understood
that on the basis of identifying

74
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,438
the protected area's needs,

75
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,028
the identification
of plausible sources of finance,

76
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:55,718
we remove the shortfall, the funding gap.

77
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:59,468
Before searching for potential funding,

78
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,728
it is important to look at preconditions,

79
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:05,518
on the one hand, in society,
in that country,

80
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:08,208
and also the protected area's
own capacities.

81
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:12,903
Firstly we will look at the preconditions
on a macro level.

82
00:04:13,431 --> 00:04:15,351
Are the roles and the values of the sites

83
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:18,151
and ecosystems included and shared by all?

84
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:23,022
Do general policies fully recognise
the roles and values of the MPA?

85
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,843
And have laws been adopted

86
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,553
that implemented these general policies?

87
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,951
Are there technical capacities, abilities,

88
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:35,281
able to capitalize on financing options?

89
00:04:36,008 --> 00:04:38,978
And finally, is there a system
of governance that provides

90
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:41,288
and emphasizes
the values of transparency,

91
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:43,598
responsibility and confidence?

92
00:04:44,093 --> 00:04:46,373
The key questions to ask.

93
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,083
Firstly a practical question.

94
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:53,042
Which mechanism can be set up
the most efficiently?

95
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:55,532
Then, we look at the current legal

96
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,552
and administrative provisions
of the country

97
00:04:57,762 --> 00:05:00,432
which can allow for the creation
of the new mechanism.

98
00:05:01,608 --> 00:05:03,918
Are difficulties envisaged
in administrating,

99
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,428
implementing, in raising finance
or distributing finance?

100
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,272
Look to see if this new mechanism

101
00:05:10,272 --> 00:05:13,252
will be seen as equitable and legitimate.

102
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,352
And I emphasize this point:

103
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:18,672
the financial collection mechanism
must be seen

104
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:20,832
to be equitable and legitimate

105
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:23,302
by all the interested parties

106
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:28,367
We look at the support
by the interested parties and govenment

107
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,677
for implementation of this new mechanism.

108
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:34,677
And finally, we remain vigilant
to the environmental impact

109
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:38,947
of this mechanism on the protected area's
goods and services.

110
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,400
To consolidate all this information,

111
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,540
we will prepare
what we call a business plan.

112
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
The business plan is used in all sectors
of the economy.

113
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,510
It serves to compare different options

114
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,420
and to study the financial viability
of a certain initiative.

115
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:00,297
Adapted to protected areas,

116
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:04,617
the business plan allows us
to maximize environmental results

117
00:06:04,617 --> 00:06:07,937
with an often limited
financial contribution.

118
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:11,077
It allows the comparison
between different options in the long term

119
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:14,667
and future planning, 
to better plan entries

120
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,457
and financial needs of a protected area.

121
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,019
The business plan must allow
to put into perspective

122
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:23,789
over five to ten years,
on the one hand, expenditure

123
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,439
expected,

124
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:30,079
investments, personnel,
operations, activities,

125
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,749
and on the other hand, expected revenue,

126
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,919
self-financing, national budget, donors

127
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,929
and projects and other mechanisms.

128
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:40,947
Note that is a tool of internal management

129
00:06:41,307 --> 00:06:45,237
which allows us a technical
and financial long term vision.

130
00:06:46,193 --> 00:06:48,323
You will have noted
that protected area budgets

131
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:51,213
are generally determined
based on available funds.

132
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:55,689
A business plan allows us to implement

133
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,219
and identify the actual needs
of a protected area.

134
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:03,721
It allows us to determine
priority investments.

135
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:08,504
Also, don't forget, the management plan--
the business plan, sorry,

136
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:13,184
allows us to communicate
and present a clear and concise view

137
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,034
of the activity of a protected area
in the long term

138
00:07:16,034 --> 00:07:18,514
and to show financial needs.

139
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:23,318
Here you can see a fictional example,
once again, of a business plan.

140
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,967
Don't be concerned about all the numbers,

141
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,017
it's just to give you an idea.

142
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,134
This table has been adapted
from the business plan

143
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:34,054
of the Iwokrama protected area in Guyana.

144
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,854
You will note
that expenditure is organized

145
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,994
based on activity programs.

146
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:43,947
Expenditure, conservation expenses,

147
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:46,297
administration, it's a good thing.

148
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:49,437
This allows us to make the connection
with the management plan.

149
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:53,196
You will note that revenue 
is defined as best possible

150
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,046
according to information, and outlook,

151
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,850
and total revenue,

152
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,260
whether from sales, tourism revenue,

153
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,920
merchandise, and handicrafts,

154
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,230
is recorded and extrapolated
over the coming years.

155
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,550
Finally, you'll note
that we can identify...

156
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,830
the gap, the shortcomings,

157
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,030
throughout the five years
of the business plan.

158
00:08:15,278 --> 00:08:19,768
It's about, for protected areas,
defining actions

159
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:22,798
seeking funds, marketing

160
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,368
and external relations to bridge this gap.

161
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:29,441
The procedure to manage the business plan

162
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,081
is well defined in this guide

163
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,801
which I suggest you take a look at.

164
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:35,531
It is guide on how to formulate
a simplified business plan

165
00:08:35,531 --> 00:08:37,021
for protected areas

166
00:08:37,361 --> 00:08:39,981
written by Benjamin Landreau for the FIBA.

167
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:42,955
Note particularly the different stages.

168
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:47,013
Firstly, define the process
of the business plan.

169
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:50,119
Who is in charge?
What consultations are necessary?

170
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:53,789
Then, analyze past financial execution.

171
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:57,272
Then, determine the medium
and long term needs,

172
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,622
investments, operating expenses,

173
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,512
salaries, staffing requirements.

174
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,562
Then, indicate the existing
sources of finance

175
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,752
and extrapolate potential revenue.

176
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:11,248
Finally, analyze the funding gap
and different possible scenarios

177
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:13,418
and evaluate other sources of finance.

178
00:09:14,256 --> 00:09:19,126
This episode has given you 
the basics on financial planning.

179
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:23,665
Note that searching
for financial sustainability

180
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,655
is essential for a protected area.

181
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:30,555
It is about identifying
financial requirements in the long term,

182
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:35,885
studying and evaluating
the preconditions of the country, the site

183
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,395
and the protected area itself

184
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:42,535
and to define financing options.

185
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:46,165
And all this generally
within the framework of a business plan.

186
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,159
Several reference manuals are available.

187
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,939
I have suggested one of them.

188
00:09:50,939 --> 00:09:56,289
I also suggest you look
at the UNDP's BIOFIN website,

189
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:59,999
the work of the TEEB initiative,

190
00:10:00,981 --> 00:10:02,811
mine is blue, this is green, but...

191
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,881
<i>The Economy of Ecosystems
and Biodiversity</i>,

192
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:09,001
a guide which will be available very soon,

193
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,521
<i>Financial Planning for National Systems
of Protected Areas,</i>

194
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:17,421
and finally, the reference guide,
<i>Sustainable Financing of Protected Areas,</i>

195
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:20,321
<i>A Global Review of Challenges and Options.</i>

196
00:10:21,373 --> 00:10:23,553
We have reached the end of this episode.

197
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:26,083
I suggest you have a look
at the reference materials

198
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,983
and I wish you a good day.
