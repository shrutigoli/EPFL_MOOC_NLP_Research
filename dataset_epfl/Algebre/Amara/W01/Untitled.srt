Chapter 1: Systems of equations 
linear and dies

2
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:09,121
Welcome, in linear algebra, 
we start with the first chapter

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:13,734
where we talk about systems of equations 
linear and dies.

4
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:18,898
And I have to start by giving you 
a definition of

5
00:00:18,898 --> 00:00:22,728
a system of linear equations, and 
why I will first give a definition

6
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:24,638
that it is a linear equation.

7
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:29,593
Definition: a linear equation

8
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:38,325
to unknown <i> x </i> 1 to <i> x </i> <i> n </i>

9
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:43,184
with real coefficients,

10
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:49,017
is an equation of the form:

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:59,540
<i> a </i> 1 <i> x </i> 1 plus 2 <i> x </i> 2 
more <i> an </i> <i> x </i> <i > n </i> equal to <i> b </i>

12
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:06,126
where <i> I </i> and <i> b </i> are real numbers.

13
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:10,747
So that's the first part 
of the definition, part two:

14
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,205
a family of such equations

15
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:24,067
is called a system of equations 
linear to unknown <i> x </i> 1 to <i> n x </i>.

16
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:36,681
And finally, if we have a system 
of equations, we speak of a solution

17
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:47,146
a system of linear equations

18
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:51,835
to unknown <i> x </i> 1 to <i> n x </i>

19
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:58,753
is an ordered sequence of <i> n </i> real numbers

20
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:11,366
α 1 to α <i> n </i>, such that,
