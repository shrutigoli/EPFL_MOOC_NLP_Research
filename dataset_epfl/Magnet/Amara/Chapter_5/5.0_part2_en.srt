1
00:00:05,961 --> 00:00:09,385
Welcome to the second
part of chapter five

2
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:12,838
of basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:16,870
One of the most important
manifestations of longitudinal relaxation

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,697
is the Nuclear Overhauser Effect.

5
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:23,086
Now, Nuclear Overhauser
Effects were postulated

6
00:00:23,086 --> 00:00:28,008
by a theoretician,
Albert Overhauser, in 1953.

7
00:00:28,008 --> 00:00:31,754
So initially, Overhauser
postulated that the effect,

8
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:35,337
that now carries his name,
would occur in solids.

9
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:39,939
And more specifically in conducting
solids, such as lithium metal.

10
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,607
He said that if we have lithium metal,
there are conduction electrons,

11
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:45,759
and some of them
have unpaired spins.

12
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,376
And therefore, there's an
EPR resonance and we can

13
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:52,302
saturate that EPR resonance
by microwave irradiation.

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,866
And Overhauser then predicted
that if you heat up

15
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:59,136
the electrons in this fashion,
you would cool down the nuclei

16
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:05,062
so that the amplitude of the NMR
transitions of lithium-6 or lithium-7

17
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:08,100
would actually be enhanced
by the irradiation.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,170
This is a paradox, and many physicists
of those days did not believe Overhauser

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,466
until Charlie Slichter came along
and actually proved, experimentally,

20
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:19,553
that Overhauser was right.

21
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:22,170
And then it was discovered,
that this was not specific

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,697
to conducting metal,
but also possible in liquids.

23
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:29,751
And it is in fact, Ionel Solomon,
at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris,

24
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:32,573
who proved this to be correct and also

25
00:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,773
developed the appropriate theory.

26
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,464
Now, in this chapter,
we shall not be concerned

27
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:42,140
with the case of metallic
conductors, such as lithium,

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,641
but focus on isolated pairs
of nuclei in a molecule

29
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,638
which is in a liquid, and the
molecule is tumbling

30
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:52,320
with a typical correlation function.

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,276
So, if we have two spins
emmersed in a magnetic field,

32
00:01:56,276 --> 00:01:59,303
as we know, we have in states
where the two spins are

33
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:01,402
parallel with a magnetic field.

34
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:04,342
We have a state where
the two spins are anti-parallel.

35
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:07,602
And we have a case where
one spin is up and the other is down.

36
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:10,470
And of course, the reverse
is also possible.

37
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,826
So between these
four states, we know

38
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:14,880
that we have observable transitions.

39
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,503
In fact, we have two transitions
that belong to the X multiplet.

40
00:02:18,503 --> 00:02:23,118
And we have two transitions
that belong to the A multiplet.

41
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:27,793
That, we discussed in the chapter
dedicated to scalar couplings.

42
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:31,990
But we also have longitudinal
relaxation processes.

43
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,814
And those go with rates,
which are called <i>W</i>.

44
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:39,009
And <i>W</i> in fact
is probability in German.

45
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,835
It comes from the word
Wahrscheinlichkeit.

46
00:02:42,835 --> 00:02:45,967
And in fact, I believe that
it is Wolfgang Pauli

47
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:51,145
who used this <i>W</i> first to explain
relaxation in multi-spin systems

48
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,859
using the so-called master equation.

49
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,532
Now, this in fact is just
a transition probability.

50
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:03,469
And it turns out that you can
distinguish the transition probability

51
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:06,627
where a single spin,
namely spin A is flipping.

52
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:09,516
So from here to here,
only the first spin flips

53
00:03:09,516 --> 00:03:11,273
from beta to alpha.

54
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,532
Whereas the second spin
doesn't move.

55
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:19,941
So this, we call the single quantum
probablity that A is flipping.

56
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:25,029
Likewise, this transition, is in
most cases, has the same probability.

57
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:28,824
Whereas these two transitions
are distinct in that it is now

58
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:32,506
spin X that flips but again,
with the single quantum flip.

59
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:35,996
And therefore,
we call this W1 of X.

60
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:40,200
More surprisingly, there is 
also a probability, very important,

61
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,113
of a so-called flip-flop process,
also known as a zero quantum process

62
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:48,513
because there is no overall
absorption of any quanta.

63
00:03:48,513 --> 00:03:50,979
One quantum is emitted
and one absorbed.

64
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,877
And therefore, we have zero quantum.

65
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:58,787
In this case, both spins A and X
participate, so this is known as a W0^AX.

66
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:02,222
And finally, there is also
the possibility that spins

67
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:06,466
that are in the beta-beta situation,
fall down all the way

68
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:08,901
to the ground state in the
alpha-alpha position.

69
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:11,750
And this is known as
a double quantum process

70
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,574
involving spins A and X.

71
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:17,188
So, the energy levels
for a homonuclear pair

72
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:23,412
of spin 1/2 nuclei, A and X, actually
hide a tremendous wealth of information.

73
00:04:23,412 --> 00:04:27,400
If we wanted to see what happens
with the flow of the populations,

74
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,143
we have this so-called
master equation,

75
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:35,183
where we can write
the populations of these states.

76
00:04:35,183 --> 00:04:41,782
For example, n-beta-beta,
n-beta-alpha, n-alpha-beta,

77
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:45,701
and n-alpha-alpha, we can
make a vector of those.

78
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,191
And we can say that there
must be some time dependence.

79
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:53,617
And then we can make
a matrix here, and look at

80
00:04:53,617 --> 00:04:56,723
the deviations of these
different populations

81
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,884
from their thermal equilibrium.

82
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:02,538
So if these deviations vanish,
then we are in a stationary state

83
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:03,966
and nothing happens.

84
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:09,456
But if somehow, the deviations
are non-vanishing, then we shall have

85
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:14,585
a non-vanishing time derititive
of the populations driven

86
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:18,357
by the deviations from the
thermal equilibrium.

87
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,938
So all of these have delta <i>n</i>ij

88
00:05:21,938 --> 00:05:28,218
is equal to <i>n</i>ij minus <i>n</i>ij equilibrium.

89
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:33,140
And this matrix <i>W</i> is a four-by-four matrix
and you can easily fill

90
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,977
in the different elements here.

91
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,528
You should also know
that the diagonal elements

92
00:05:37,528 --> 00:05:42,919
are equal to minus the sum over
the off- diag elements

93
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,988
on the same row, i different from j.

94
00:05:46,988 --> 00:05:51,206
That means there's a conservation
of populations and if a population

95
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:54,430
is taken out of one of the levels
and put into another level,

96
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,375
overall, it is conserved.

97
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:02,787
So, with reference to
the matirix <i>W</i> of transition probabilities,

98
00:06:02,787 --> 00:06:07,391
there are really only two that matter
to explain the Overhauser effect.

99
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:11,929
There is the double quantum probability,
where both spins A and X

100
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:13,603
flip at the same time.

101
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:18,537
And it turns out that this is
proportional to the spectral density

102
00:06:18,537 --> 00:06:21,183
taken at twice the Larmor frequency.

103
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,243
So you will recall that
the Larmor frequency omega-0

104
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:27,365
would be two <i>pi</i> times
say 400 megahertz.

105
00:06:27,365 --> 00:06:32,657
Then twice, that is 2<i>pi</i>
times 800 megahertz, etc.

106
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:37,851
The Overhauser effect is also
crucially effected by the flip-flop probability,

107
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,950
that is to say the zero
quantum probability.

108
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,974
And this turns out to be proportional
to the spectral density at the origin.

109
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:49,343
Or if you prefer, to the probability
that the molecule does not

110
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:54,166
undergo any rotational
motion at all.

111
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,435
So if we plot the spectral density
on a linear scale,

112
00:06:57,435 --> 00:07:02,383
so not a logarithmic scale now,
then we see different behaviors.

113
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:05,688
A small molecule,
such as for example, H2O,

114
00:07:05,688 --> 00:07:09,722
could rotate at very high speeds
without falling apart.

115
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:13,618
And in fact, it turns out
that the probability of rotational diffusion

116
00:07:13,618 --> 00:07:17,518
is about equal at all sorts of
frequencies in the scale,

117
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:24,004
and we speak of a
white spectrum, an analogy

118
00:07:24,004 --> 00:07:27,058
to the light that comes us
from the sun where all

119
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:29,968
colors are equally represented

120
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:33,719
so that their superposition gives
the feeling that the light is white.

121
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,565
While of course, these
are not visible colors.

122
00:07:35,565 --> 00:07:37,054
These are radio frequencies.

123
00:07:37,054 --> 00:07:42,618
But all colors are equally represented
and the spectrum is again white.

124
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:45,470
If, on the other hand, we look
at a large object,

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,962
such as a protein, for example,
then it is obvious that

126
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:54,045
it cannot undergo rotational
diffusion at very high frequencies

127
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:55,903
because it would fall apart.

128
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,330
It would sort of disintegrate
because of centrifugal forces.

129
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:03,388
And consequently, high frequencies
are essentially forbidden.

130
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:07,579
And the protein is compelled
to be content with slow motions.

131
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,419
And consequently, the likelihood
that it does not move at all,

132
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,580
which is represented by the
spectral density at the origin,

133
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,730
is much higher than it was
for the simple case of water.

134
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,232
Now we see that if we look
at the spectral density

135
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:25,712
at the Larmor frequency, for the
protein is not completely negligible,

136
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:28,658
but for it's much higher for water.

137
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:31,147
And if we look at twice
the Larmor frequency,

138
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:33,829
then it goes essentially to zero
for a large protein.

139
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,963
Whereas for water, it's still
about the same, regardless of frequency.

140
00:08:38,963 --> 00:08:45,484
The dependence of the probability
<i>W</i>2, double quantum probability,

141
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:51,945
and of the zero quantum probability <i>W</i>0,
on the correlation time is as follows.

142
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:57,538
For the zero quantum, the flip-flop rate,
it is simply proportional to J of zero.

143
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,869
And it turns out
that this simply increases.

144
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,678
The bigger the molecule,
the slower the tumbling,

145
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,178
the higher that rate.

146
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,776
For <i>W</i>2, the situation is a bit
more complicated

147
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:12,689
because when we go from
very fast tumbling to slower tumbling,

148
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:16,982
<i>W</i>2 first increases, and then
reaches a maximum,

149
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:22,019
which is in the vicinity
of omega-0 equal to one over tauC.

150
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,327
And then, it drops again
to what's higher,

151
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:28,234
or to a slower tumbling or higher mass.

152
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,502
So clearly, there is a crossover point
where these two things cancel each other.

153
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,280
It turns out that there are
some analogies between

154
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,276
Overhauser effect, as we observe
them today in proteins,

155
00:09:39,276 --> 00:09:42,220
and generally speaking,
in liquids and solutions,

156
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,568
and the Overhauser effect
that was originally predicted

157
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:49,883
to occur in conducting solids
such as lithium metal.

158
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:52,408
And what we see here
is the energy level diagram

159
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:55,059
of a two-spin system in a liquid.

160
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,661
And it turns out that if
the scalar coupling is zero,

161
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:04,590
then the two lines
of the X nucleus,

162
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,683
the two parallel transitions here,
are degenerate.

163
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:12,648
And in fact, we only see one single peak
at the chemical shift of spin X.

164
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:16,560
And likewise, the two transitions
of spin A are degenerate,

165
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,844
and we see only one line
at the chemical shift of spin A.

166
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,973
Now, we can instruct
our radio frequency source

167
00:10:24,973 --> 00:10:29,117
in our NMR spectrometer
to selectively irradiate

168
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:34,653
the resonances of spin X,
the two superimposed resonances.

169
00:10:34,653 --> 00:10:38,472
It turns out that if we do that,
we shall equalize the populations

170
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,740
across the X transitions.

171
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,257
And in fact, demagnetize those transitions.

172
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:49,304
And as a result, the signal
will vanish in all of these cases.

173
00:10:49,304 --> 00:10:53,305
But if we look at what happens
with the A transitions,

174
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:56,338
in some cases, it is amplified,
as we see here.

175
00:10:56,338 --> 00:11:00,913
So in other words, the peak
gets more intense.

176
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:03,870
Whereas, another case,
it's actually reversed.

177
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,010
This depends on the conditions.

178
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,306
And clearly, something very
peculiar happens

179
00:11:09,306 --> 00:11:14,010
because you might expect
that irradiation of spin X

180
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,107
will warm up the spin system,
and therefore also saturate spin A,

181
00:11:19,107 --> 00:11:20,388
but that is not the case.

182
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:26,362
And that is precisely the paradox
that Albert Overhauser discovered.

183
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,325
So the Nuclear Overhauser effect,
actually results from an interplay

184
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:36,733
between relaxation and irradiation.

185
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:41,705
And relaxation tends to drive
us back to the Boltzmann equilibrium.

186
00:11:41,705 --> 00:11:44,727
Before we address the Boltzmann
equilibrium, we should look at

187
00:11:44,727 --> 00:11:49,833
the ways of distributing the population
among the four states.

188
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,258
So, if we look at our two
two coupled spins again,

189
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:58,933
then we should focus attention
on the deviations of the populations

190
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:02,207
with respect to the demagnetized state.

191
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:06,681
If we have a demagnetized state,
then all populations, alpha-alpha,

192
00:12:06,681 --> 00:12:11,716
and alpha-beta, and beta-alpha,
and beta-beta,

193
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:18,406
they would all have 0.25,
that's a demagnetized state.

194
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:21,767
And what we see here,
is these two white balls,

195
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:25,911
tell us that the beta-beta state
is depleted, with respect

196
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,667
to the demagnetized state.

197
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:31,200
Whereas, the alpha-alpha
state is populated

198
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,705
more than in the
demagnetized condition.

199
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:42,445
And if we do some accountancy,
we see that between the alpha-alpha state,

200
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:45,677
which has two black symbols,
and the alpha-beta state,

201
00:12:45,677 --> 00:12:48,361
which has no symbol at all,
there is an advantage

202
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:51,421
of two minus zero, which is 2-delta.

203
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:53,013
The same is true here.

204
00:12:53,013 --> 00:12:54,577
And it turns out the same
is true here.

205
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:59,086
We have zero minus minus two,
which is also plus two.

206
00:12:59,086 --> 00:13:01,676
Now, the next thing
that we have to do

207
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:04,691
is that we have to saturate
the X transitions.

208
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,568
So here again, we have
the thermal equilibrium

209
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:11,823
with a depleted beta-beta state,
and the populated alpha-alpha state.

210
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:15,037
And if we now started
irradiating the X transitions,

211
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:19,376
that means that we deliberately
equalize the populations here.

212
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,831
So basically, what we do
is we promote one of these black balls

213
00:13:22,831 --> 00:13:24,430
to the upper level.

214
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,437
And likewise, we also saturate
these two transitions,

215
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:31,394
which means that we basically
bring down one of these white balls

216
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,623
from the top to the beta-alpha level.

217
00:13:34,623 --> 00:13:38,334
So at this point here, once
the saturation has been achieved,

218
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,496
which can be done
in a few milliseconds or so,

219
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:46,029
then we have a new distribution,
but we still have the simple difference

220
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:48,576
of 2-delta between this level
and this level.

221
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,416
That's plus one minus minus one.

222
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,833
Or here again, plus one,
minus minus one.

223
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:59,179
These transitions of spin A,
have not been changed.

224
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,766
Ok, so we have discussed
that we can go from

225
00:14:01,766 --> 00:14:06,958
the thermal equilibrium situation here
to this partly saturated state,

226
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,364
where the X transitions
have been saturated.

227
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:12,565
That is to say, that their
population differences

228
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,098
have been annihilated
by irradiation.

229
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:18,112
Whereas, these have been preserved.

230
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:21,697
Now the Overhauser effect
comes about because we have

231
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,638
flip-flop of flip-flip transitions.

232
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:29,945
The probability here <i>W</i>0,
that's the zero quantum flip-flop transition

233
00:14:29,945 --> 00:14:35,230
will tend to go from
right to left

234
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,025
in that the excess population
that we have in the alpha-beta state

235
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:44,191
will tend to fill up the deficiency
of the population on the beta-alpha state.

236
00:14:44,191 --> 00:14:46,932
At the same time, of course,
this horizontal process

237
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,873
has no effect whatsoever
on the populations

238
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:51,997
of the top state and the bottom state.

239
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,888
And consequently, these are preserved.

240
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:56,962
Whereas, the central states are depleted.

241
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:01,002
One of the consequences of this
is that the difference in populations

242
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:05,166
between plus one minus zero
is now just 1-delta.

243
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,160
Whereas, it was two 2-delta here.

244
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,152
Whereas, in this case, the population
difference is zero minus minus one,

245
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:15,403
which is also plus one 1-delta,
so, instead of 2-delta.

246
00:15:15,403 --> 00:15:20,273
In other words, we see an attenuation
of the difference in populations

247
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:23,553
across these transitions
compared to what they were

248
00:15:23,553 --> 00:15:28,286
before the <i>W</i>0 process set in.

249
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:33,653
A more puzzling aspect occurs
when the double quantum probability,

250
00:15:33,653 --> 00:15:36,936
<i>W</i>2AX is dominant.

251
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,979
We shall see that this
is only possible for small molecules.

252
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:44,506
So this is a pathway
for small molecules.

253
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:47,757
Whereas, this pathway was
predominant for large molecules,

254
00:15:47,757 --> 00:15:51,015
such as proteins, for example.

255
00:15:51,015 --> 00:15:58,076
As we know, small molecules
have a large flip-flip probability, <i>W</i>2,

256
00:15:58,076 --> 00:16:04,265
and that means that there
will be a tendency for the populations

257
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:07,377
to go from the top level
to the bottom level.

258
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:10,350
Now you might say, "There is already
a difference in populations."

259
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:14,017
"So why should we go to
a larger difference?"

260
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:16,335
Well, the reason is that
in thermal equilibrium,

261
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,226
there was indeed a larger difference.

262
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,555
We had difference
of plus two minus minus two,

263
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:27,086
which is four, from 4-delta
between these two extreme transitions.

264
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:32,842
And since, relaxation tries
to return to thermal equilibrium,

265
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:38,216
the result of <i>W</i>2 relaxation
is to increase the deficit here

266
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:41,339
from one white ball
to two white balls.

267
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,892
And to increase the population
from one black ball to two black balls.

268
00:16:45,892 --> 00:16:50,048
Now this is quite remarkable because
now we see that the difference

269
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:53,840
in population across
the A transition here

270
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,896
is plus two minus minus one,
which is 3-delta.

271
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:02,551
And likewise here, it is
one minus minus two,

272
00:17:02,551 --> 00:17:04,855
which is 3-delta again.

273
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:08,633
So now we have, with respect
to the 2-delta difference here,

274
00:17:08,633 --> 00:17:12,081
we have an amplification here.

275
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:16,482
Amplification of the difference
in populations,

276
00:17:16,482 --> 00:17:19,385
and also of the signal
that we shall observe.

277
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:22,881
Whereas here, we have
a simple attenuation.

278
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:25,742
So the Nuclear Overhauser effect
is often described

279
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,895
by this perimeter eta here,
which is defined

280
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:32,848
as the intensity of the signal
that we observe in the presence of

281
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:37,643
rf irradiation minus the intensity
that we observe in a normal spectrum,

282
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:41,759
normalized by the intensity
that we observe in the normal spectrum.

283
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,069
And it turns out, that if
we have an amplification,

284
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,949
then eta will be 0.5, this is
typically the case

285
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:52,607
for a homonuclear system
in a small molecule.

286
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:56,854
But if there's an attenuation,
then we can go all the way to -1,

287
00:17:56,854 --> 00:18:01,012
and that is the case for
slow tumbling in large molecules.

288
00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,908
We're talking here about
a steady state Overhauser effect

289
00:18:03,908 --> 00:18:07,094
which is somewhat distinct
from the transient Overhauser effect

290
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:10,796
that we shall exploit
in micromolecules.

291
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:15,491
Now it turns out that such things
also exist in heteronuclear systems.

292
00:18:15,491 --> 00:18:19,306
And in that case, eta is
1/2 of the ratio

293
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,776
of the gyromagnetic ratio
of the spin X

294
00:18:23,776 --> 00:18:27,034
that we irradiate, divided by
the gyromagnetic ratio

295
00:18:27,034 --> 00:18:29,904
of the spin that we observe.

296
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:32,494
It turns out that there
are Overhauser effects

297
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:34,122
in heteronuclear systems.

298
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:39,606
In which case, this parameter eta,
is equal to 1/2 of ratio of the gamma,

299
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:43,994
the gyromagnetic ratio of spin X
that we irradiate, saturate,

300
00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:48,706
divided by the gamma,
the gyromagnetic ratio

301
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,496
of the spin that we observe.

302
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:56,448
So, if we consider carbon-13
as an observable nucleus,

303
00:18:56,448 --> 00:19:01,320
then the eta that we obtained
when we irradiate the protons

304
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,418
would be equal to 1/2
of the gamma of the protons

305
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:10,633
divided by the gamma
of the carbon-13.

306
00:19:10,633 --> 00:19:18,440
And this is about 1/2 of roughly
four and this is about two.

307
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,135
And consequently, when you
look at the equation, we have

308
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:28,250
a three-fold enhancement because
the amplitude goes from one to three.

309
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,311
But be careful, if we look at
other nuclei, for example, nitrogen-15,

310
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:36,747
which is very popular in biomolecules,
then the eta that we obtained

311
00:19:36,747 --> 00:19:41,373
when irradiating the protons
is equal to the same ratio.

312
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:48,139
And it turns out that
this is 10/-1, because

313
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:52,121
the gyromagnetic ratio
of nitrogen-15 is negative.

314
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:56,355
So this turns out to be
about -5.

315
00:19:56,355 --> 00:20:00,120
So this means that if we have
a nitrogen-15 spectrum

316
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,983
with a small positive peak,
if we do not irradiate the protons

317
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:08,039
we may observe a large negative peak
if we do irradiate the protons.

318
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,438
Which is rather surprising.

319
00:20:09,438 --> 00:20:11,993
In fact, this is one thing
that I didn't believe myself

320
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:15,181
until I did the experiment
many years ago.

321
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,568
We should remember, by the way,
that the Overhauser effect

322
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,919
is not always 100% efficient.

323
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,256
And sometimes we get
less then the predicted maximum,

324
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:26,788
and sometimes we get exactly zero
if we stick halfway between

325
00:20:26,788 --> 00:20:28,640
positive and negative.

326
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,015
This case, I forgot to say,
that the carbon-13 spectrum

327
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:38,722
goes from this to about this,
which is an enhancement of a factor three.

328
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:43,038
That is very commonly observed
and indeed very welcome.

329
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,192
This concludes part two
of this chapter.

330
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:49,315
Thank you for you attention.
