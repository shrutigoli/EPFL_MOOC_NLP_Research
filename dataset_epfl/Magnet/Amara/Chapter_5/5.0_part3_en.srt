00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:07,781
Welcome back to Part 3 of this chapter.

2
00:00:08,481 --> 00:00:13,830
I have somewhat rearranged
the figures that Peter [Haugh] has chosen

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,801
to illustrate this chapter
by starting with an example

4
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:19,423
taken from proteins.

5
00:00:19,423 --> 00:00:22,676
Indeed, the determination
of the structure of proteins

6
00:00:22,676 --> 00:00:26,676
is one of the principal applications
of the Overhauser Effect today.

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:31,999
Recall that proteins are large molecules
and therefore tumble slowly

8
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,551
and therefore the Overhauser Effect
is predominated

9
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:41,801
by the w0 transition probability
between similar spin states,

10
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,855
that is to say, the flip-flop rate,
and the Overhauser Effect

11
00:00:44,855 --> 00:00:46,906
leads to a loss in signal.

12
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:53,250
Now, proteins, as you know,
are basically polymers of amino acids.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,550
Each amino acid contains
a number of protons

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,708
and these protons can be assigned

15
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,653
by methods that we 
shall discuss in Chapter 6.

16
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:04,010
Since the Overhauser Effect

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,767
is predominantly driven
by w0 flip-flop terms,

18
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,388
it tends to attenuate signals.

19
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:13,496
So, the question really is,
if we irradiate selectively

20
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:16,932
a proton that is attached 
to amino acid number a,

21
00:01:16,932 --> 00:01:21,602
could it be that a proton attached
to amino acid number d

22
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:25,295
is partly attenuated
because of cross-relaxation,

23
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:26,879
because of the Overhauser Effect.

24
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:31,301
If that occurs, we must come 
to the conclusion that amino acid a

25
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:36,946
must be near in space to amino acid d,
because the vehicle that allows

26
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:41,834
the Overhauser Effect to occur is related
to the dipole-dipole interaction,

27
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:46,507
which, as we have seen, decreases
as the sixth power of the distance.

28
00:01:47,121 --> 00:01:50,395
So, we come to the conclusion
that it cannot be a linear chain

29
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:54,676
but in this case that amino acid a and d
must be close in space.

30
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,789
Likewise, we can do an experiment
where we irradiate a proton

31
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:04,535
belonging to amino acid b, and we find
that there is an attenuation of the signal

32
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:08,233
of the proton of amino acid f,
and we come to the conclusion

33
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:11,630
that b and f must be close 
in space, and c and d, etc.

34
00:02:12,278 --> 00:02:15,909
In fact, one can typically determine
hundreds or even thousands

35
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,818
of so-called distance restraints
by concluding that certain pairs

36
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:24,005
of amino acids must be
close together in space.

37
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:29,324
It is one of the merits of Kurt Wüthrich
at the ETH Zürich to have shown

38
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:34,127
that if you have a sufficient number
of such restraints, you can determine

39
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:36,406
a unique structure--
not just one structure

40
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,958
that satisfies all these restraints,
but there is only one good structure

41
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,270
that fulfills all of them
at the same time.

42
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:45,386
This is one of the many reasons

43
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:49,861
why Kurt Wüthrich 
got the Nobel Prize in 2002.

44
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:55,122
Although applications to proteins
are very important nowadays,

45
00:02:55,122 --> 00:03:00,194
we should not forget that we can also use
NOEs very fruitfully in discussing

46
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:03,249
stearyl chemistry in simple molecules.

47
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:08,071
This is a case where the simple molecule
here has been substituted

48
00:03:08,071 --> 00:03:12,526
by introducing 
a trimethylsilane group.

49
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,445
The question that these people ask 
themselves is whether the silane group

50
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:19,268
is attached here at the top
or here at the bottom.

51
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:24,501
It's not so easy to distinguish these two
by any means that is known.

52
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:26,815
Of course, the molecular mass
is exactly the same

53
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:30,102
and many features resemble very much
between these two.

54
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:36,010
But, if we decide to irradiate
the resonances of the methyl groups

55
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,922
of the silane, then we see
in this case an enhancement

56
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:43,422
of this aromatic proton here
and an enhancement

57
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,151
of this aromatic proton here,

58
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:49,697
whereas, if we do the same experiment--
we saturate the transitions

59
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:55,265
of the methyl group attached to the silane
in this isomer, then we would only enhance

60
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:57,026
one aromatic proton.

61
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:01,370
So, the answer is very simply:
if there are two protons enhanced,

62
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,596
we're here, if there is 
one proton enhanced, we're here.

63
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:08,592
We can confirm this by irradiating
this proton here,

64
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:11,882
which stands out in the spectrum,
and again, on the isomer

65
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:17,125
on the left-hand side, we would expect
an amplification of two aromatic protons,

66
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,699
whereas, in an isomer
on the right-hand side,

67
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,659
we would expect an amplification

68
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:24,326
of only one of the aromatic protons.

69
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:29,147
So, this is a very convenient way 
of deciding where the new group

70
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:30,621
has been attached.

71
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:37,769
We don't necessarily have to use
Overhauser Effect to determine structures

72
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:39,300
and assign resonances.

73
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,545
Sometimes it can be useful 
simply to measure

74
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:43,869
the T1 of carbon-13.

75
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,560
What we have here is adamantane,
a famous molecule,

76
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,733
and, in fact, there are
two different carbon-13 here--

77
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:55,698
this is in this position here
and in this position here.

78
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:59,821
The obvious difference is
that this one has one proton

79
00:04:59,821 --> 00:05:02,813
attached to it, whereas this
has two protons.

80
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:06,265
Consequently, this one is exposed
to the fluctuating fields

81
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:10,928
due to the dipolar interaction
between itself and the attached proton,

82
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:16,341
whereas this is exposed
to more intense fluctuating fields

83
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,580
that stem from two neighboring protons.

84
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,335
Consequently, the relaxation 
of this carbon is almost twice as fast

85
00:05:23,335 --> 00:05:26,197
as the relaxation 
of this carbon, or if you prefer,

86
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:30,356
the T1 of this carbon is
almost twice as short

87
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,001
as the T1 of this carbon.

88
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:36,958
So, this is a nice, elegant example
of how you can use T1 of carbon-13

89
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:39,833
in order to determine the assignment.

90
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:46,013
So, sometimes it's useful to measure
both the spin-lattice relaxation times,

91
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:49,167
or T1 relaxation times,
and the Overhauser enahancements

92
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,494
on carbon-13.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,908
Take this molecule here,
where we see that the methine,

94
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:59,273
that is to say, the CH carbons
all have T1s on the order

95
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:02,150
of about two seconds or so,
whereas the quaternary carbons

96
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,269
have far longer T1s.

97
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,119
The obvious reason is that the protons

98
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,001
that are responsible 
for the fluctuating fields

99
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,590
at the sides of these carbons, f to i,
are further away.

100
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,174
The reason is obvious, 
namely that the protons

101
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:20,803
that are responsible for relaxation
of these carbons here

102
00:06:20,803 --> 00:06:25,092
are further away, since the carbons
are quaternary, whereas these have

103
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,939
protons that are 
directly attached to the carbons.

104
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,157
We can also see that
the Overhauser Effect here,

105
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:32,917
which, as you will recall,

106
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,980
η should be at best two,
which is the case here,

107
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,864
somehow vary from one situation
to another depending on the complexity

108
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,873
of the relaxation pattern.

109
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,297
For the quaternary,
the Overhauser Effects are very weak.

110
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:54,163
So, in some cases, T1 relaxation allows us
to get some rather subtle insight

111
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,726
in molecular behavior.

112
00:06:56,726 --> 00:07:02,157
This, for example, refers to measurements
of the longitudinal relaxation

113
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:07,576
or spin-lattice relaxation of carbon-13
in these methyl-substituted benzenes.

114
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:10,719
In this case, the methyls
are not crowded together;

115
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:13,918
they can't touch each other,
they do not interfere with each other,

116
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,862
and as you can see, the T1 relaxation time
of those carbons is rather long.

117
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,755
In this case, however, there is
a steric hindrance

118
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,524
between the two methyl groups.

119
00:07:24,524 --> 00:07:27,424
I wouldn't say that they touch 
each other, but they interfere,

120
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:31,257
and this is sometimes known
as a cog-wheel interaction.

121
00:07:31,257 --> 00:07:34,194
The idea is that the protons
on these two groups

122
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:39,089
almost touch each other, although that's
perhaps more a view of the mind.

123
00:07:39,687 --> 00:07:43,616
Whatever the mechanism is,
it is striking that the relaxation

124
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,024
becomes much shorter.

125
00:07:45,024 --> 00:07:50,486
Clearly, if we plot relaxation times
as a function of correlation time--

126
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:53,837
you will recall that there is a curve
that goes through a minimum--

127
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:57,409
in this case, we go
to shorter T1 relaxation

128
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,668
because the correlation time
of that cogwheel motion

129
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:03,650
is slowed down compared
to the correlation time

130
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,005
of the free motion
of the unhindered rotated methyl group.

131
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:12,886
There are some more exotic effects
which are worth understanding

132
00:08:12,886 --> 00:08:17,121
to prevent misinterpretation
of many observations.

133
00:08:17,765 --> 00:08:22,040
This paper here is concerned
with the T1 relaxation of carbon-13

134
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,160
in this rather strange 
cigar-shaped molecule.

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,148
If you have a molecule like that,
then of course it's much easier

136
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:35,647
to have it rotate around this axis--
or the rotational diffusion coefficient

137
00:08:35,647 --> 00:08:40,657
around that axis will be much faster
than the rotational diffusion coefficient

138
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:42,573
around a perpendicular axis.

139
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:51,074
So, there is in this case an anisotropy
of the rotational diffusion tensor.

140
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:55,549
In this case, the authors
have determined large differences

141
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:59,417
in T1 relaxation times, about one second
and about five seconds,

142
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:02,871
depending on if we are on the para 
or on the ortho and meta positions.

143
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:06,386
We can explain that if we consider
the correlation time,

144
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,654
not of the overall tumbling
of the molecule, but the correlation time

145
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:14,926
that's relevant for the reorientation 
of the carbon-proton vectors

146
00:09:14,926 --> 00:09:19,043
that are either in the para position
or in the meta and ortho position.

147
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:24,320
If we recall this curve, it turns out
that for the para position,

148
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,179
we have a rather long correlation time--
remember that it takes

149
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,567
this slow tumbling here
to move that carbon--

150
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:35,984
whereas for the ortho and meta positions
we have a shorter correlation time,

151
00:09:35,984 --> 00:09:37,890
and therefore a longer T1.

152
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:43,955
It is interesting that T1 relaxation 
of carbon-13 gives us insight

153
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:49,201
not only into the molecular motion
but also the viscosity of the environment,

154
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,686
in particular, when the molecules
are capable of making

155
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:54,576
intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

156
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,827
So, take the simple case of decane.

157
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:59,765
In fact, there are only five
distinguishable carbons

158
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:02,124
because of the symmetry,
and they turn out to have

159
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:04,732
about equal T1s, and that's
not very interesting.

160
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:07,896
But, if we go to decanol, that is to say,

161
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:11,046
where the first carbon

162
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:16,271
has an OH attached to it, then we see
a vast range of T1 relaxation times.

163
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:20,672
The C1 carbon, which is really attached
to a neighboring carbon

164
00:10:20,672 --> 00:10:23,755
through hydrogen bonds, has
a very short relaxation time,

165
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,856
and as we go down the chain,

166
00:10:25,856 --> 00:10:28,269
the relaxation time 
of the carbons increases.

167
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:34,081
There's also C20, which has
a smaller range of relaxation times.

168
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,859
Although there are no hydrogen bonds here,
the bulk of the molecule

169
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:40,298
is immobilized because of its inertia.

170
00:10:42,657 --> 00:10:45,194
Relaxation is not limited to liquids.

171
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:47,173
It can also be studied in solids.

172
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,589
Indeed, Raymond Andrew
and his coworkers have done this

173
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:53,505
a very long time ago, in the '50s--

174
00:10:53,505 --> 00:10:57,011
Raymond Andrew, who, by the way,
also invented magic angle spinning,

175
00:10:57,011 --> 00:11:01,037
which is a remarkable invention
also studied relaxation

176
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:04,303
and line widths in solids
at low temperature.

177
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:10,115
Here, he studied an ordinary molecule
known as benzene and found

178
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:13,980
that if you freeze it, of course,
it looks like a crystal

179
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,734
or a powder or a glass,
but if you're in the temperature range

180
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:22,681
between 200 and 130 or so,
the lines are fairly narrow

181
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,173
because there is a motion, a rotation

182
00:11:26,173 --> 00:11:29,845
around this six-fold axis in the solid.

183
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:33,301
But if you take the temperature
to go below 100 Kelvin or so,

184
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:38,712
you manage to freeze this rotation
and you have a true rigid solid,

185
00:11:38,712 --> 00:11:41,809
at which point the line width
becomes much broader--

186
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,187
so, we're talking
about the proton line width.

187
00:11:44,187 --> 00:11:49,521
Likewise, if you look at the T1 relaxation
of the protons in benzene,

188
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:54,076
you will find that there is a minimum
and that corresponds to a situation

189
00:11:54,076 --> 00:11:57,226
where the rotational motion
has about the same frequency

190
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,978
as the Larmor frequency.

191
00:11:58,978 --> 00:12:02,661
These minima can be shifted about
depending on the spectrometer

192
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:04,735
that you use for their observation.

193
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,225
So far, we have talked

194
00:12:08,225 --> 00:12:11,427
about longitudinal 
or spin-lattice relaxation

195
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:15,780
and in this chapter we now speak briefly
about transverse relaxation,

196
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,944
also known as spin-spin relaxation.

197
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:21,467
The main manifestation
of transverse relaxation

198
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:23,644
is that it leads to line broadening.

199
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:27,247
In fact, it's very simple: if that is
the dominant reason for the line width,

200
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,836
you just measure the line width
at half height and you find

201
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:35,738
that the T2 relaxation time
is inversely proportional

202
00:12:35,738 --> 00:12:37,347
through this simple relationship.

203
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:41,397
It turns out that 
the transverse relaxation rate,

204
00:12:41,397 --> 00:12:45,353
called R2, which is the inverse
of T2, is made up

205
00:12:45,353 --> 00:12:47,181
of two important contributions.

206
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:51,421
This first contribution we have seen 
before, because that is also responsible

207
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:55,636
for longitudinal relaxation,
and it depends on the spectral density

208
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,365
at the Larmor frequency.

209
00:12:57,365 --> 00:13:01,595
But, in T2 relaxation, there is
also a term that corresponds

210
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:04,694
to the spectral density 
at the origin, at zero frequency,

211
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:07,212
or a lack of motion, if you prefer.

212
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:11,783
You will note that these two terms
both come with coefficients of one half,

213
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:17,253
so, if these two spectral densities are 
equal, then you can lump them together,

214
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:20,134
but that is only the case 
in extreme narrowing,

215
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:24,384
when the correlation time is much shorter
than the inverse of the Larmor frequency.

216
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,535
In general, when you go
from fast-tumbling molecules--

217
00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:32,905
remember that 10^-12 seconds
is a picosecond, so that's characteristic

218
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:37,457
for water-- then T1 and T2 are equal,
and as we have seen before,

219
00:13:37,457 --> 00:13:39,995
there is a minimum for T1,
and it goes back up again

220
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:41,939
as we go to large molecules.

221
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,609
That is not so for T2.

222
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:48,471
As you can see from this graph,
T2 inexorably decreases,

223
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,432
becomes shorter and shorter and shorter.

224
00:13:50,432 --> 00:13:53,617
That means that the line widths
become larger and larger and larger,

225
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:57,528
and that means that, unfortunately,
it is impossible to observe

226
00:13:57,528 --> 00:14:01,445
proton and carbon and hydrogen signals
of very large molecules

227
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,354
without doing very smart things.

228
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:09,411
So, to summarize Chapter 5,
we shall look at the bullets

229
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:12,111
that Peter [Haugh] has put
at the end of his chapter.

230
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:15,862
He says nuclear spins attain
thermal equilibrium--

231
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:20,983
that is to say, the Boltzmann equilibrium--
by a process known as spin relaxation.

232
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:25,820
Spin-lattice relaxation, also known
as longitudinal relaxation,

233
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,948
drives the populations
of the energy levels

234
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:31,378
back towards equilibrium.

235
00:14:31,378 --> 00:14:35,127
Spin-spin relaxation, also known
as transverse relaxation,

236
00:14:35,127 --> 00:14:37,707
results in NMR line broadening.

237
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,982
Spin-lattice and spin-spin
relaxation times

238
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,072
are known as T1 and T2.

239
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:49,368
Spin relaxation is caused
by the modulations of interactions

240
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:52,052
between spins due to molecular motions.

241
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:59,970
Dipolar couplings are rendered 
time-dependent by molecular tumbling,

242
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,164
and they are a common source
of spin relaxation.

243
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:07,453
Dipolar couplings also cause
cross-relaxation, which leads

244
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,260
to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect.

245
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:16,045
T1s and T2s and NOEs give information
both on molecular structure and on motion.

246
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,703
Thank you for your attention.
