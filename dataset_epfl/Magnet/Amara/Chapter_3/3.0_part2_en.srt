1
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:08,828
So welcome to our MOOC
on magnetic resonance.

2
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:12,158
This is now the second half
of chapter three

3
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:16,526
where we shall be speaking more
about spin-spin couplings.

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:21,654
We should now address a tricky
issue of equivalent nuclei.

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,617
It turns out-- and this is very nicely
described in Peter Hore's book.

6
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:27,967
I think it's one of the best
books on this subject.

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,405
There are two forms of equivalence.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,915
There is a chemical equivalent
that's fairly easy to understand.

9
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:36,935
That means that you have two nuclei
that cannot be distinguished

10
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,275
in chemical terms.

11
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:41,415
One cannot substitute one
without substituting the other.

12
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,445
One cannot replace one.

13
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,745
One cannot conceive of a reaction
that would affect one

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,055
without affecting the other.

15
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,295
That's one thing.

16
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,285
And then there is the concept
of magnetic equivalence

17
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,395
which is much more subtle
and more difficult to define.

18
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:58,536
Let us start with a simple application.

19
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:02,423
First of all, we have this
magnetic equivalent pair here

20
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:06,278
where these two protons
have the same coupling

21
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,468
with the two fluorine.

22
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,248
So if we take this coupling here
or this coupling here,

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,850
it turns out that by symmetry
of this molecule,

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,590
these two couplings are the same.

25
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:19,313
Likewise if we started
with the two fluorines,

26
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,153
they also have the same
couplings to the two protons.

27
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,123
But this is not so, so these
two here are the same.

28
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,056
But if we look at this coupling here,

29
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,156
which is a cis coupling, it's different.

30
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,696
Different magnitude
perhaps even a different sign

31
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,376
from this long-range coupling here,
the trans coupling.

32
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,736
So this is distinct from this

33
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,015
and therefore, there are
two different cases.

34
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,684
Well, it turns out that Peter Hore
has a wonderful way

35
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,794
of explaining how you
can check for the existence

36
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,534
of magnetic equivalent nuclei.

37
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:57,324
First of all, you define an ensemble
of nuclei A, B, C, etcetra

38
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,285
of nuclei of which you want to decide

39
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,995
whether they are magnetically
equivalent or not,

40
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:06,715
such as in this case
Proton A and Proton B.

41
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,473
And then you define external nuclei,

42
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:13,134
if they exist, like in this case.

43
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,314
This fluorine which we call Z,

44
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,874
or rather Peter Hore
uses that nomenclature.

45
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,644
And then he says,

46
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:23,327
"If the J coupling between A and Z

47
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:26,707
is equal to the J coupling
between B and Z,

48
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:29,277
is equal to the J coupling
between C and Z,

49
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,804
and all similar things,

50
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:34,413
in that case, we have
magnetic equivalence."

51
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,969
And if that is not the case
as in this molecule here,

52
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:41,096
then we have only chemical equivalence.

53
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:44,773
We shall see in spectra
that has dramatic consequences.

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,078
Now this test here, where we compare
the scalar couplings

55
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:52,228
between A, B, C and an
external nucleus Z,

56
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,724
in principle has to be repeated
for different external nuclei.

57
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,584
For example we once do it for Z

58
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:59,634
and then we have to do it
all over again

59
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,424
for the nucleus Z prime.

60
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,465
In practice it turns out that once

61
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,285
you have a negative
answer for one of them

62
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,205
you don't need to check the others.

63
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:11,342
Magnetic equivalence
needs to be reflected about,

64
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,732
thought about carefully.

65
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,739
Now. there are cases
which are not obvious.

66
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,879
For example this is dodecahedron--

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,530
has the molecule or formula C20 H20.

68
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,679
If all carbon are C12,
which is not obvious

69
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,689
but if it's depleted in carbon 13,

70
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,029
then we have no other nuclei

71
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:35,632
than the 20 chemically equivalent protons.

72
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,299
And so there is no Z.

73
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,299
There is no external nucleus Z,

74
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,629
and consequently we can't conduct the test

75
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,359
and it turns out that all 20 protons
are magnetically equivalent

76
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,724
and not only chemically equivalent.

77
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:51,364
The same is true on a much more
mundane molecule

78
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,644
which is that of benzine.

79
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,855
There we have six benzene protons,
as you all know,

80
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,273
and in this case they're all equivalent

81
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,023
because there is no proton Z
or no carbon Z

82
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:05,434
and that could prove that
they are inequivalent.

83
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:10,726
Now, multiplet patterns can be used
to check for molecular symmetry

84
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:14,532
or to confirm or reject a hypothesis

85
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,362
about the symmetry of the molecule.

86
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,722
And Peter Hore has collected
some wonderful examples

87
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,242
for phosphorus 31 NMR spectra

88
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:25,864
in these compounds which contain
only phosphorus and sulphur.

89
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:29,053
So the large spheres represent
the phosphor atoms

90
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,053
and the small spheres the sulphur atoms,

91
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,534
And you can see they can be
different arrangements.

92
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:38,245
And it turns out that sulphur has no spin

93
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:42,835
at least the dominant isotope
has 99% but it has no spin.

94
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,265
And therefore, we can ignore it

95
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,795
and we we only have to worry
about the chemical shifts

96
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:51,509
and about the equivalence,
chemical or magnetic equivalence,

97
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,547
of the phosphorus nuclei.

98
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,628
So it turns out that
in a configuration like this,

99
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,986
again there is no atom Z.

100
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,506
There's no nucleus Z

101
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:06,516
that could conceivably have different
couplings with the different A nuclei

102
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,636
and the four phosphorus nuclei

103
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,467
and therefore it turns out
that these four As

104
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,757
are on the same environment.

105
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,177
They're chemically indistiguishable

106
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,507
and furthermore they are
magnetically equivalent.

107
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,507
And therefore we call them A4.

108
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,945
This system has a different symmetry.

109
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:28,455
You immediately see
that these two nuclei are--

110
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:32,235
these phosphorus are sitting
between three sulphurs,

111
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,951
whereas, these phosphorus nuclei
have another phosphorus

112
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,251
for a neighbor and then only

113
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,861
two sulphurs as a neighbor.

114
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,681
So chemically, they're quite different.

115
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,002
In fact, they also have different
chemical shifts

116
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:47,031
but when it comes to the symmetry,
it turns out that the coupling

117
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:51,031
between one of these As
and the two Xs is equal

118
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:55,074
and so we have an A2X2 system.

119
00:05:55,202 --> 00:06:00,312
And the result of that is that
on the A side we have a triplet

120
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,542
and on the X side we also have a triplet.

121
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,884
This is a more complicated case

122
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,964
where this phosphorus on top here

123
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:09,494
has three sulphurs.

124
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,434
A bit like what we had before

125
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,724
but at the bottom here,

126
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:16,724
we have a phosphorus which is squeezed
between two other phosphorus,

127
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,822
whereas the other phosphorus
are squeezed between

128
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,062
a phosphorus and two sulphurs.

129
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:25,222
So clearly we have three
different chemical environments

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,690
and it turns out that
we have an AMX2 system

131
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,589
because the only equivalence,
the only magnetic equivalence,

132
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:35,649
is between these two X nuclei

133
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,919
and the consequences are as you can see.

134
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:42,691
Example here in the A multiplet,
we have a large triplet

135
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,875
due to the coupling between A and X.

136
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,965
The X are the neighboring
phosphorus nuclei

137
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:54,585
and a smaller coupling JAM between the A
and the distant M nucleus.

138
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:59,437
So this is a wonderful example on how
we can look at the spectra

139
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:03,093
and draw conclusions as to
the symmetry of the molecule.

140
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,314
Now there are also amusing cases

141
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,103
when we look at lithium 7

142
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,371
or lithium 6 is also an interesting case.

143
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:15,971
But lithium 7 has a spin 3 halves.

144
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:20,185
This is a little bit like boron 11
that we have discussed before.

145
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,064
In this case we consider
a strange molecule

146
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,184
which is actually a cluster
comprising four lithium atoms

147
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,952
arranged according to a tetrahedron.

148
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:36,162
And it turns out that you can attach
these tertial butyl group,

149
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:39,562
and that they are not attached
to one of the lithium atoms

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,750
but they tend to attach themselves

151
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,591
to the middle of the triangular surface

152
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:47,011
of one of these sides of the cluster.

153
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:51,532
Very mysterious chemistry
but the NMR is without any doubt

154
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,282
proving that this structure
is the true structure

155
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,942
and not the one that
you might intuitively draw.

156
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:59,543
Well it turns out that
because of this structure

157
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:03,798
if we look at the lithium spectrum,
lithium 7 spectrum,

158
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,838
which as I said has a spin three-halves,

159
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:09,838
we shall see an ordinary binomial quartet

160
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:15,104
because of the splitting
to three equivalent

161
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,954
carbon 13 which are--

162
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,954
so each lithium in effect
sees three carbons.

163
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,170
For example, if you take this lithium
at the top here,

164
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:27,403
it sees this carbon 13 and this carbon 13

165
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,573
and this carbon 13 as equivalent.

166
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:35,447
And therefore, we have
this wonderful quartet.

167
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:39,313
On the other hand,
we could also decide to enrich

168
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,737
this cluster with lithium 6.

169
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:45,807
Lithium 6 has spin one,
so it will split its neighboring

170
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,947
carbon into three equivalent lines

171
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,986
with amplitude one to one to one
but then it turns out

172
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:58,516
that each carbon is coupled

173
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,184
to three lithium nuclei

174
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:05,854
and therefore gives ride to this
very strange non-biominal multiplet

175
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:10,509
which is comprised of three
interleaved triplets.

176
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,499
So I vividly recommend
you to look at this.

177
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:17,499
This is in fact similar to what
you have seen in diborane

178
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:21,199
except that now it's a coupling
to three neighboring nuclei.

179
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:25,157
In four-spin systems we have

180
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:29,253
more complicated structures
as you might expect

181
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,604
but they're fairly easy to rationalize.

182
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,634
In fact, we can simply take
the proton NMR spectrum

183
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,474
of dibromonitrobenzene.

184
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,804
This is of course a very simple molecule.

185
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,374
And we can see that
we have here a proton A

186
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:48,574
which is squeezed between a proton P
and a proton M.

187
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,149
The couplings here, the ortho-couplings
are not exactly equal

188
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,449
but they are similar.

189
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,139
And then we have this X here
which is across the ring,

190
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,509
so to speak, and that
will have a long range

191
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,824
para coupling to the A

192
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:04,835
and medium range to the
meta positions P and M.

193
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:09,813
And as a result, the A multiplet
will be split into what is sometimes

194
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,342
called the pseudo triplet.

195
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:13,285
In fact it's just a doublet of doublets

196
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:15,315
with very closely related couplings.

197
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,925
And there's a fine structure
which is a doublet

198
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,315
which is due to the para position X.

199
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:24,394
The M on the other hand is split
into a large coupling

200
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,279
because of the J A M.

201
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,639
And then each line is split into a doublet

202
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,839
and again into a doublet

203
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,307
first because of P
and then because of X.

204
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:36,315
Likewise, the same logic applies
to spin P which is very similar

205
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:39,455
to spin M as far as the structure
of the multiplet is concerned.

206
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,455
And finally spin X is a pseudo triplet

207
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:46,375
because they're almost equivalent
couplings to P and to M.

208
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,675
Each component is split
into a small doublet

209
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,155
because of the para coupling
between X and M.

210
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,311
This kind of spectrum can
allow you to determine

211
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:59,311
this molecular structure almost
without any other help.

212
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:05,786
There is an interesting phenomenon
in scalar coupled multiplets

213
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,870
and this is known as strong coupling

214
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,170
or sometimes known
as second order coupling.

215
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:16,021
And you can see that we have a system
that evolves from a case

216
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,989
where the splitting here, the J splitting,

217
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:22,596
is much smaller than the
difference in chemical shifts.

218
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,495
In this case we speak of an AX system

219
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,086
but when the chemical shifts come closer,

220
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,435
then we notice that the multiplets
not only become closer

221
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:39,818
as you might expect but also they change
the amplitude ratios here.

222
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,492
The inner lines become stronger

223
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,232
and the outer lines become weaker.

224
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:46,942
And in a case like that, we use
two letters in the alphabet

225
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,432
which are closer together
and we speak of an AB system.

226
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,284
And ultimately, if the two chemical shifts
become degenerate,

227
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:58,175
if fact we have only one line over,
left over, and then

228
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,495
we speak of an A2 system.

229
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:03,973
So to understand strong coupling

230
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,496
we have to use a little bit
of quantum mechanics.

231
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:12,524
This is not treated in any detail
in the first volume of Peter Hore

232
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,004
that I recommended to you

233
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,934
but there is a second book
that you may wish to read

234
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:19,044
in a year from now maybe

235
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,984
that is written by Steve Wimperis
and Jeremy Jones

236
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,684
and the same Peter Hore
in the same series,

237
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:27,174
the Oxford Primer series

238
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:30,535
and that speaks about such
quantum mechanic effects.

239
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:35,803
Well in this case you should know
that we have to explain

240
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,342
the case where we have the AX system

241
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,142
where we have just two doublets

242
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:43,532
we have the AB system where
the two doublets move

243
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,552
close together so that the inner lines
become more intense

244
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,552
and the case of the A2 system.

245
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:54,052
It turns out that all three
can be explained in one equation

246
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,482
by saying that the bottom state,
that's this one here,

247
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:00,979
where the two spins are parallel
with the magnetic field

248
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:03,194
is not affected by this phenomenon

249
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,664
so they're always the same.

250
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:07,414
It's always a simple state
with alpha alpha.

251
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,186
Likewise, the upper state here
where the two spins

252
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,789
are anti-parallel is unaffected.

253
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,829
It doesn't matter whether the system
is strongly or weakly coupled

254
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:23,702
but the intermediate states
called psi2 and psi3

255
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,748
they are mixed.

256
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,905
In fact, they are neither alpha beta
nor beta alpha

257
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:33,515
but there is a wonderful admixture
between these two

258
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,995
and the coefficience are
cosine of an angle chi

259
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,758
and sine of an angle chi.

260
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:43,901
Now this angle actually
is determined by the ratio

261
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,521
of the J coupling and the difference
in chemical shifts.

262
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,020
So to draw this in, sort of,
simple trigonometry,

263
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,720
if we draw the chemical shift
horizontally like this,

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,930
so this would be a number in hertz,

265
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:05,148
and if we draw the scalar coupling
vertically, also a number in hertz,

266
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:09,928
then we can make a little diagram
like this and we can have this

267
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:14,615
line here and this angle here is 2 xi.

268
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:20,822
So you can immediately see
when the J coupling goes to zero

269
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,890
or becomes much smaller
than the difference in chemical shifts

270
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,470
then xi goes to zero.

271
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:31,517
So the limit of xi going to zero

272
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:37,005
means that if we take state xi 2

273
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:41,002
the cosine goes to one
and the sine goes to zero

274
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:45,261
and this is a pure alpha beta.

275
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:50,555
Alpha for spin A and beta for spin B.

276
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:56,193
And likewise if we take the limit
of xi going to zero

277
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:00,532
for xi 3, then only the cosine
term survives

278
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,312
so this would be a pure state
where spin A

279
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,202
is in beta polarization

280
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:08,692
and spin B is in the alpha polarization.

281
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,260
So you can see from this
diagram that the large J

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,900
compared to the difference
in chemical shifts,

283
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,976
the steeper the slope,

284
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:24,162
the closer this angle to xi
approaches 90 degree

285
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:28,072
and therefore the angle xi
turns to 45 degree.

286
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,225
It's therefore interesting
to see the limit.

287
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,859
One xi goes to 45 degree.

288
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,680
We see from this equation that the cosine
and the sine become equal.

289
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:45,432
and so if we take that function
then it's just one over

290
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:50,158
square root of two,
alpha beta plus beta alpha.

291
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:55,788
Likewise, the limit for xi
going to 45 degrees,

292
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,518
so this is still the case where
this J coupling is much larger

293
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:01,528
than the difference in chemical shift
of the other function

294
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,907
goes to one over square root of two

295
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,159
and here we have minus alpha beta
plus beta alpha.

296
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:14,024
Now you notice that the case of the A2,

297
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,303
you see there is this symmetrical
linear combination

298
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,203
which is what we have here.

299
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:22,655
This is symmetrical in the sense
that if you do a permutation

300
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:26,405
of spins A and B, this
wave function doesn't change.

301
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,625
It is invariant to the permutation

302
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,755
and is known as totally symmetric.

303
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,345
Whereas the other wave function,
this one here,

304
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,835
that's the one that I just
concocted up here,

305
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,709
is anti-symmetric with respect to
permutation of the spins.

306
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:44,469
It turns out that this first state
together with the top state

307
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,719
and the bottom state,

308
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:49,019
that these three together
form what is known as a triplet.

309
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:54,486
That is to say three states
of the same symmetry.

310
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:57,366
Whereas this guy here
is known as a singlet.

311
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:02,302
And the remarkable thing is that
now the intensity that we see here

312
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:04,771
in the spectrum is made up of two lines,

313
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:08,501
only two lines, that are degenerate
and occur on top of each other.

314
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,535
One corresponds to this
transition to the middle

315
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,582
component, the triplet,
and the other line

316
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:16,372
corresponds to the top transition
within the triplet.

317
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,971
Whereas the transitions from
the bottom line to the singlet

318
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,251
are forbidden so that's represented
by this dotted line and

319
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,311
I cross it out to show
that these two transitions

320
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,127
are completely forbidden.

321
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,060
In fact, they are here
virtually, so to speak.

322
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,620
If you look at their frequencies,
they are a plus and minus J

323
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,700
away from the central component

324
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,820
but their intensity are vanishingly weak

325
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,730
and that is why we cannot see them.

326
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:44,255
This kind of quantum mechanics
has been known for decades

327
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:49,065
but it has gained some renewed
interest very recently

328
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:53,545
because it turns out that the populations
here flow quite freely

329
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,785
within this triplet manifold
as a result of what we shall call

330
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,755
longitudinal or spin lattice relaxation.

331
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:04,191
Whereas the populations
are locked in the singlet state

332
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:07,481
and cannot flow from the singlet
to the triplet state.

333
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:11,709
So if one can contrive some way
of populating the singlet state,

334
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,879
then the populations
would be locked in there

335
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,919
and one can have
so called long-lived states.

336
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,619
This is the speciality of Malcolm Levitt
in Southampton

337
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,769
and we have done a lot of work in Lausanne

338
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,649
to try to improve techniques
to populate the singlet states.

339
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:32,127
This concludes part two of this chapter.

340
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,477
Thank you for your attention.
