00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:08,542
Welcome back to part three
of this chapter.

2
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:12,729
So, it's also interesting to look at
two-bond coupling constants,

3
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:15,594
so, what we're talking about
typically, here, is the coupling

4
00:00:15,594 --> 00:00:18,036
between a proton
and another proton,

5
00:00:18,036 --> 00:00:22,235
mediated by two bonds attached,
for example, to a common carbon.

6
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:25,896
And in the case here,
if we look at the proton-proton coupling

7
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:28,790
between these two protons
attached to the same carbon,

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,128
because these protons are not equivalent,

9
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:37,816
it turns out that we can measure
the coupling between them,

10
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:42,768
and these couplings, as you see,
are in the vicinity of a few hertz,

11
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:44,981
and they are critically dependent

12
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:48,598
on the question of
if the substituent X here

13
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:52,292
is an electron-donating
or -withdrawing group.

14
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,887
In this case, the dependence
is even more pronounced.

15
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:59,773
We see here, this is a coupling

16
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:02,911
between two of the protons

17
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,501
attached to the same carbon.

18
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,768
This is X, and now we're talking
about this coupling here,

19
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:13,143
and it turns out that these couplings
are generally negative,

20
00:01:13,143 --> 00:01:17,008
and they are in the vicinity
of -10 to -17 hertz.

21
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:21,443
Incidentally, you may not have heard
of negative couplings before;

22
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:25,034
very often, in the literature,
NMR literature,

23
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:27,097
nobody mentions the sign of the coupling,

24
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:30,710
and what people actually report is simply
the absolute value of the coupling.

25
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:34,180
Of course, if you do it that way,
you cannot see the sign.

26
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,025
The fact is that it is rather tricky
to determine the sign,

27
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,029
and it takes a bit
of understanding of NMR,

28
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:41,366
and particuarly
of two-dimensional spectroscopy,

29
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:44,131
of multiple-resonance,
in order to detect the sign.

30
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,608
But, signs have been measured,
and can certainly be calculated.

31
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,639
Now, some people have been looking
for very exotic couplings,

32
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,171
so that they have a chance

33
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:55,501
to get a record in the Guinness Book,

34
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:58,185
and here, for example,
we have a very long-range coupling

35
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:02,585
between two protons separated
by one, two, three, four, five bonds.

36
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:05,597
Because of the delocalized structure
of the electrons,

37
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:08,357
this is about 2.2 hertz--

38
00:02:08,357 --> 00:02:11,968
mind you, all units in this chapter
are given in hertz.

39
00:02:12,738 --> 00:02:14,851
And we can even go to seven bonds,

40
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:18,843
and it turns out that we then have
a negative coupling. Rather strangely.

41
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:20,760
You may wonder how one can measure this,

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,874
because these two protons
are magnetically equivalent.

43
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:26,784
Well, there is no multiplet structure,
but what you do is,

44
00:02:26,784 --> 00:02:31,409
you replace one of them with deuterium,
and then it becomes inequivalent,

45
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,434
and you have a long-range J-coupling,

46
00:02:33,434 --> 00:02:37,196
and in this case, you can see that JHH

47
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:41,966
is proportional to JHD,

48
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:46,676
provided we multiply
by the ratio of γH over γD.

49
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:50,552
So, we measure H-D
in an asymmetric molecule,

50
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:55,866
and then apply this rule in order to draw
a conclusion about the H-H coupling.

51
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:00,170
More straightforward is benzene groups.

52
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,629
It turns out that ortho couplings
between neighboring protons--

53
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,808
so this is an ortho coupling, of course--

54
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:09,843
is somewhere betwen seven and ten hertz,
depending on the substituents.

55
00:03:09,843 --> 00:03:12,221
Meta couplings are smaller,
and para couplings

56
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,568
are typically on the order
of less than one hertz.

57
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:17,437
So, this is smaller,
and this is almost negligible,

58
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,080
although, of course, they can be detected.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,164
Likewise, if we have molecules
that are rigid--

60
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,951
this doesn't work if they are floppy,

61
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:27,817
but if they are rigid, then we can have
long-range couplings,

62
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:32,534
provided the arrangement of the bonds
is in a so-called W structure,

63
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:36,412
that allows one to convey the information
through the electrons.

64
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:41,323
There are some interesting properties
of J-coupling constants

65
00:03:42,293 --> 00:03:44,013
that are worth knowing.

66
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:47,379
Some people have an encyclopedic
knowledge about these things.

67
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,364
First of all, one can distinguish between
proton-proton couplings that are

68
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,636
on the cis-- on the same side
of the double bond-- or trans.

69
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:58,878
So, cis and trans, and these couplings,
as you can see,

70
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,106
the cis are in the vicinity of 10,
and the trans in the vicinity of 15 to 19.

71
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:06,696
It critically depends on the question,

72
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:10,537
whether there is a substituent
here in the third position.

73
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:15,435
So, many people, good chemists,
can know these things by heart,

74
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,943
and just from the knowledge
of the coupling constant,

75
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:21,016
they can tell you what
the substituent X really is.

76
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,447
There are other examples here.

77
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,689
So, this is now the proton-proton
coupling between these protons here--

78
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:31,577
that is to say, between vicinal protons--

79
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:35,884
and they are contained in a smaller range,

80
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:39,614
but also depend on the substituent X.

81
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,088
This kind of observation
is very important

82
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:45,576
in chemistry of cyclohexanes
and their derivatives,

83
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,357
and in particular of sugars,

84
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:51,542
because many sugar molecules
are built on six-membered rings,

85
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,814
with an oxygen,
and, of course, hydroxy groups,

86
00:04:53,814 --> 00:04:56,228
but the basic pattern
is a six-membered ring.

87
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:00,268
It turns out that, here,
we can distinguish axial coupling--

88
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:03,096
so if there's a proton up here
and a proton down here,

89
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,943
then this is an axial-axial coupling,

90
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,215
and that turns out to have
a dihedral angle,

91
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:11,809
if you look at the Newman diagram,
of 180 degrees,

92
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:16,356
and the scalar coupling is quite large,
in the vicinity of 12 hertz.

93
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:19,740
But, if we now consider, for example,

94
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,300
between this equatorial proton here
and this axial here--

95
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,113
so, now, there is
a 60 degree dihedral angle,

96
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:30,130
and the coupling drops
to about four hertz.

97
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,809
Likewise, between the two equatorials--
so, we compare this and this,

98
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:36,084
there is also coupling between these two,

99
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,497
and again, the dihedral angle,

100
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:39,394
although it's not obvious
from this diagram,

101
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:43,411
is only 60 degrees,
and the coupling is 3.9.

102
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,145
So, there are important
lessons to be gained

103
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:48,773
from looking at three-bond
coupling constants.

104
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:54,109
Now, of course, this hasn't escaped
the attention of some theoreticians,

105
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,064
and there is a famous relation

106
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,583
that was invented many years ago
by Martin Karplus.

107
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:04,071
He got a Nobel prize a few years ago,
but that was not for this equation.

108
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,671
His equation explains a relationship--

109
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:11,581
it's actually a partly empirical,
partly theoretical relationship--

110
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:16,142
of which Karplus himself said
that if you use it, it's at your own risk.

111
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,377
But, anyway,
I won't give the equation here,

112
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,198
but the point is that the J-coupling

113
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:23,448
between two protons in vicinal positions

114
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:28,130
is dependent on the intermediate
dihedral angle.

115
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:32,323
In fact, this J-coupling is largest
if the angle is 180 degrees--

116
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:36,075
that is to say, if one proton is sitting
here and the other is sitting there.

117
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:40,211
They are somewhat smaller,
but not dramatically smaller

118
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,876
if the angle is 0-- that is to say,
if the two protons are eclipsed,

119
00:06:43,876 --> 00:06:47,671
if the back proton is hidden behind
the front proton, so to speak.

120
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,264
And, they drop to something like
two hertz or so

121
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:55,598
if the angle is 90 degrees,
which it frequently is.

122
00:06:56,644 --> 00:07:00,591
Such relationships can, again,
be calculated,

123
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,261
using quantum chemistry,

124
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:04,618
but they can also
be observed in molecules,

125
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,608
provided that you fix the angle.

126
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,110
You contrive the molecule

127
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,768
with suitable substituents and rings
and what have you,

128
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:13,359
in order to prevent it from rotating.

129
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:19,244
Karplus postulated a famous equation
which bears his name,

130
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:24,899
and it says that a three-bond coupling
is proportional to a constant,

131
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,104
plus a factor B times cos(θ),
which is the dihedral angle,

132
00:07:32,224 --> 00:07:37,554
plus a factor C times cos^2 (θ).

133
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,158
So, you see

134
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:45,878
that if the limit
that θ is equal to 90 degrees,

135
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:50,090
then, of course, cos and cos^2 disappear,

136
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,970
so 3J becomes equal to A.

137
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,861
In the limit that θ
is equal to 180 degrees,

138
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:03,818
then the cosine is -1
and the cosine squared is +1,

139
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:09,843
so 3J is A-B+C.

140
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,925
And, of course, the limit

141
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:14,755
when the angle tends to zero

142
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:19,305
is 3J = A+B+C.

143
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,246
So, basically, this Karplus equation

144
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:26,088
is a nice way of empirically catching
that complexity.

145
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,206
We see such things
if we look at amino acids.

146
00:08:29,206 --> 00:08:33,008
An amino acid can be represented
in a Newman projection.

147
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,838
So, in front here, we have
what's known as the α carbon,

148
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:40,323
which sustains, or is attached to,
the carboxyl group

149
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:45,067
and the ammonium group
of the amino acid, and then behind it--

150
00:08:45,771 --> 00:08:49,268
behind the disk of Mr. Newman--
is the β carbon,

151
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:53,381
and on the β carbon we find
the "residue," the rest of the chain,

152
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,237
plus a β2 and a β1 proton.

153
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,874
And on the α carbon, of course,
we have the α proton,

154
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:02,850
and so the question is, what is
the coupling between these two,

155
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,190
and what is the coupling
between these two?

156
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,733
It turns out that,
depending on the angle θ,

157
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:13,587
which is the angle through which
these two planes are rotated,

158
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:18,506
that these couplings vary dramatically.

159
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:21,026
For example, in this configuration,

160
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:24,271
between α and β1,
we have about 60 degrees,

161
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,150
and between α and β2, we have 180.

162
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,294
In this configuration, this is about 60
and this is about 180.

163
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:35,690
So, you see that the coupling will vary,
depending on the angle θ.

164
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,468
On average, we shall be observing

165
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:41,116
the weighted average
of the three couplings,

166
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:43,965
and therefore we can draw conclusions

167
00:09:43,965 --> 00:09:48,575
as to the average value of this angle θ.

168
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:51,428
In fact, this is a rather modern subject.

169
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:53,714
We find similar things
in polypeptide chains--

170
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:56,793
that is to say, chains of amino acids--

171
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:58,791
but in a slightly different disguise.

172
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,610
Here, we see there are couplings

173
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:03,610
between the proton attached to the α,

174
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,972
and the proton attached to the nitrogen,
which is part of the amide bond.

175
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:12,589
And here, there is a coupling,
so this is a 3J,

176
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,275
H attached to proton, and H alpha,

177
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:23,685
will tell you about
the dihedral angle here,

178
00:10:23,685 --> 00:10:27,848
which in the language of peptides
is known as the angle φ,

179
00:10:27,848 --> 00:10:31,981
the other one being ψ and χ.

180
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:37,475
The knowledge of these couplings,
which can be determined

181
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:40,945
even in fairly large molecules,
allows you to determine that angle,

182
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:45,078
and if you know such angles
from one peptide bond to the next,

183
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,926
ultimately you can define

184
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,476
the entire three-dimensional
structure of the peptide,

185
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:51,987
and that is a very flashy thing to do.

186
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,430
Now, in this chapter three
of Peter Hore's book,

187
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,050
there is also a brief discussion
of dipolar couplings.

188
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,120
Dipolar couplings do not occur in liquids,
as we shall see,

189
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,924
but they occur in solids,
and are very important as such.

190
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:11,473
They can be seen in solids
in the form of splittings,

191
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,504
but they also influence
spectra in liquids,

192
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:17,947
because they are essential
to drive relaxation.

193
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:21,318
Relaxation, as we shall see, is a process

194
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:25,464
through which the magnetization
returns to its thermal equilibrium,

195
00:11:25,464 --> 00:11:27,460
and as such it's very important,

196
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,990
both to be able to record NMR spectra,

197
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,878
but also to determine

198
00:11:32,878 --> 00:11:35,068
certain molecular properties,

199
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,959
such as internal motion,

200
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,358
or diffusion coefficients--
rotational and translational diffusion.

201
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:47,234
So, dipolar couplings
are a different type of thing.

202
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:51,610
What you see here is doublets
of a spin A, coupled to a spin X,

203
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,178
in a solid, as a function
of the orientation.

204
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:58,393
The reason for these splittings
is that we have a spin A--

205
00:11:58,393 --> 00:12:00,859
so, somewhere here,
let's call this spin A--

206
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:06,177
and then somewhere else in space
there's another spin, call it spin X,

207
00:12:06,947 --> 00:12:11,826
and the direction, the distance,

208
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:14,356
is described by a vector.

209
00:12:14,356 --> 00:12:17,935
This molecule will be placed

210
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:20,235
in an external magnetic field,

211
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,396
which we call B0, as usual,

212
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:26,916
and if we extend this internuclear vector,

213
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,355
we find an angle here.

214
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:31,335
This is the angle called θ.

215
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:35,529
And it turns out
that the energy level diagram

216
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,513
is affected by the dipole-dipole coupling.

217
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:40,531
This has nothing to do
with the J-coupling,

218
00:12:40,531 --> 00:12:46,706
it is nothing to do with electrons,
it is purely mediated through space.

219
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:50,721
So, you see here, that there is

220
00:12:50,721 --> 00:12:53,231
an angular dependence.

221
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,094
In fact, this thing is called

222
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:58,114
the Legendre polynomial of rank two,

223
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:00,265
sometimes just called P2.

224
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:02,633
The peculiar property is that it depends

225
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:05,633
on the orientation of this vector

226
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:08,146
with respect to the magnetic field.

227
00:13:08,146 --> 00:13:11,097
And so, you give an example here,
of the doublet of this--

228
00:13:11,097 --> 00:13:15,604
this is split into a doublet,
it's a large doublet, if θ is zero--

229
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:19,282
that is to say, if this vector is aligned
with the magnetic field.

230
00:13:19,282 --> 00:13:21,643
Then, there comes a point where
it goes through zero,

231
00:13:21,643 --> 00:13:23,630
the doublet collapses to a singlet.

232
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,061
That turns out to be the case

233
00:13:26,061 --> 00:13:29,711
when θ is equal to about 54 degrees,

234
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:32,667
which is the so-called "magic angle."

235
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:38,830
And, if that is the case,
we only have a singlet,

236
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,097
and then the splitting reappears,
and as we go to 90 degrees--

237
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:45,444
that is to say, if this vector
is perpendicular to the external field,

238
00:13:45,444 --> 00:13:47,498
we have a splitting where the magnitude

239
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,329
is one-half the splitting
that we have if it's parallel.

240
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:56,241
It turns out that this splitting,
which the authors call R--

241
00:13:56,241 --> 00:13:58,219
rather un-typically,

242
00:13:58,219 --> 00:14:02,409
most other books call it D--

243
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:07,962
but it's proportional to the product
of the gyromagnetic ratios

244
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,215
of spin A and of spin X,
and most importantly,

245
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:15,759
it's inversely proportional to the third
power of the distance between them.

246
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,161
So, R, in this case, is simply the length,

247
00:14:20,011 --> 00:14:23,350
the modulus of the vector
that we have drawn here.

248
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:28,446
And that vector R, that distance R,
of course, is interesting to chemists,

249
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:31,385
because it allows you to measure
the size of the molecule

250
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:34,412
and the length, the distance,
between two spins.

251
00:14:36,072 --> 00:14:38,649
It turns out that if we consider powder,

252
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,308
then there is no single orientation
of this vector R.

253
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:47,386
So, let me draw the field again,
and remember that we have

254
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,099
an internuclear vector like this,

255
00:14:49,099 --> 00:14:51,142
which subtends an angle θ.

256
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:54,211
If we have a powder, that means
that we have all sorts of particles,

257
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:57,164
a bit like in sugar or in salt,
that have different angles,

258
00:14:57,164 --> 00:15:02,286
and consequently, θ is distributed
over a full range of angles.

259
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:06,561
It turns out that we then
get a powder spectrum--

260
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:09,997
also invented by George Pake,
by the way, in the '50s--

261
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:13,372
discovered for the first time,
and <i>explained</i>, more importantly.

262
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:16,864
And it turns out
that the small splitting here, RAX,

263
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:19,091
which was on the previous transparency,

264
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,400
corresponds to the case

265
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,030
where θ is exactly equal to 90 degrees,

266
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,444
and those crystallites are fairly common,

267
00:15:27,444 --> 00:15:31,156
because it's quite likely
that the vector be perpendicular

268
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:32,796
to the external field.

269
00:15:32,796 --> 00:15:34,949
But this larger splitting, here,

270
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:39,527
corresponds to θ equal to 180 degrees,

271
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:43,730
and the signals are weaker here,
in amplitude,

272
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,411
because the likelihood
that they should be precisely parallel

273
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:50,332
to the magnetic field is much smaller.

274
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,179
In fact, you can see that this Pake
pattern is made up of two halves.

275
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:57,800
It's actually a superposition
of two paths, like this,

276
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,328
and these are the two transitions

277
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:04,678
of the doublets that we talked about.

278
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:08,783
Now, let's recapitulate,
together with Peter Hore,

279
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:12,447
what is to be said about J-couplings
and dipolar couplings.

280
00:16:12,447 --> 00:16:15,867
First of all, J-couplings require bonds.

281
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,947
They are mediated by electrons.

282
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:20,476
If there are no bonds,
then there are no J-couplings.

283
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:23,331
Whereas, dipolar couplings
go directly through space,

284
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:27,603
and therefore can be intermolecular,
whereas these can only be intramolecular.

285
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:30,385
J-couplings are weak,
typically on the order

286
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:32,144
of 100 hertz or something like that--

287
00:16:32,144 --> 00:16:35,443
of course there are some exceptions,
but that's an order of magnitude.

288
00:16:35,443 --> 00:16:38,552
And, dipolar couplings
tend to be much larger.

289
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:42,209
It depends on the γ of the nuclei,
but 100 kilohertz is a good number.

290
00:16:43,374 --> 00:16:45,784
J-couplings are isotropic.

291
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:48,044
That is what scalar coupling means.

292
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:51,477
Isotropic, in the sense
that their magnitude is independent

293
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,064
of the orientation of the molecule
with respect to the magnetic field.

294
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:58,312
Dipolar couplings vary
with the orientation,

295
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:02,147
according to the Legendre polynomial
which is 3cos^2 (θ) - 1,

296
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:06,183
where θ is the angle subtended between
the magnetic field, on the one hand,

297
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:08,469
and the internuclear vector on the other.

298
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:13,126
Then, J-couplings tend to drop
to small numbers

299
00:17:13,126 --> 00:17:16,470
if there are more than three bonds
that separate the nuclei,

300
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,265
whereas dipolar couplings
always are proportional

301
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:22,349
to the inverse of the third power,
and therefore, insensitive.

302
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:28,065
J-couplings cause splittings
in spectra in solution.

303
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:30,611
They also can be seen in solids,

304
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:33,071
but it's more difficult
because they're so small.

305
00:17:33,071 --> 00:17:35,137
Whereas, dipolar couplings lead

306
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,467
to splittings,
large splittings, in solids,

307
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:41,109
and also in more exotic things--
like liquid crystals--

308
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:43,328
such as partially-aligned molecules.

309
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:47,985
J-couplings do not contribute
significantly to relaxation--

310
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:51,366
that is, the return of the magnetization
to its equilibrium,

311
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:54,699
but dipolar couplings
are causing relaxation;

312
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:59,258
in fact, they are driving relaxation,
particularly in the presence of motion,

313
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:03,406
and therefore, they give a way
of determining this motion.

314
00:18:04,826 --> 00:18:06,431
There are some comments here.

315
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:09,021
The strength of the interactions--
both this and this--

316
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,276
depend on the magnetogyric ratios--

317
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:13,758
I call them gyromagnetic,
but that's the same thing--

318
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,650
and on the molecular structure.

319
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,864
The numbers are very approximate,
so this is just to guide the eye.

320
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,286
They can be more complicated
if there is chemical exchange going on,

321
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:28,031
and one has to worry
about internal motion.

322
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:31,749
So, in summary, spin-spin interactions--

323
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,189
they can be either J-couplings in liquids,

324
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:38,458
or dipolar couplings in solids--
give rise to multiplets.

325
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:41,022
So, in liquid-state spectra,
it's only J-couplings,

326
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:44,100
and in solid-state spectra
it's mostly dipolar couplings.

327
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:48,150
J-couplings usaully occur
via chemical bonds,

328
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,679
because they're mediated by electrons,
and are generally small

329
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,733
when the nuclei are more than
three bonds apart.

330
00:18:55,356 --> 00:18:57,687
J-couplings give information

331
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,117
on bonding networks in molecules.

332
00:19:03,677 --> 00:19:07,393
J-couplings within a group
of magnetically equivalent spins

333
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:11,244
do not produce any multiplet splittings.

334
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:14,942
So, as soon as you have identified
an ensemble of spins

335
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,094
that are magnetically equivalent,

336
00:19:17,094 --> 00:19:21,465
there is no evidence that there
are couplings between these spins.

337
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:26,180
Strongly-coupled spins have more
complex spectra than weakly-coupled spins.

338
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,954
Particularly, when we have
a two-spin system,

339
00:19:28,954 --> 00:19:32,253
the inner lines tend to grow
at the expense of the outer lines,

340
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,241
and this is known as a "roof effect,"

341
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,585
and in larger spin systems
they can be very, very complicated.

342
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:40,710
Dipolar couplings occur through space,

343
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,613
and normally do not lead to multiplets
in liquid-state NMR spectra,

344
00:19:44,613 --> 00:19:47,304
unless we happen to be in materials

345
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:50,014
or in molecules like liquid crystals,

346
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:53,576
that are partly aligned
with respect to the magnetic field,

347
00:19:53,576 --> 00:19:55,764
but this is clearly a very exotic subject.

348
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:59,294
Thank you for your attention.
