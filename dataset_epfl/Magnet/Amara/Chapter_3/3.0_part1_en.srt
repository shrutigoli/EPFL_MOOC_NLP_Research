00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,051
Welcome to our MOOC,
massively online open course

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,675
on basic steps on magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:17,997
Today, we shall be talking
about spin-spin couplings

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:23,317
that are the subject of chapter three
of Peter Hore's book.

5
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:27,363
The appearance of multiplets
in NMR spectra is familiar

6
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:33,105
to all practitioners of analytical NMR,
quite familiar to virtually all chemists,

7
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:37,147
to many biologists,
and even to a few physicists.

8
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,715
However, not all of these
are aware of the subtle aspects

9
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,843
of muliplet structures.

10
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,227
Spin-spin couplings were
originally discovered

11
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:52,106
by a serendipity in the 1950s
by Erwin Hahn, in Berkeley.

12
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:56,622
Erwin Hahn noticed that
spin echoes were modulated.

13
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:00,126
This observation came shortly
after Hahn's invention,

14
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,805
or perhaps one should say discovery,
of spin echoes.

15
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,320
More about this in chapter six.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,565
Such echo modulations
can be observed,

17
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:12,752
even when the homogeneity
of the static field is too poor

18
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:15,295
to resolve the multiplet structures.

19
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:19,967
As indeed, was usually the case
in the 1950s.

20
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:23,279
Scalar couplings have a few
important properties.

21
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,265
First of all, there are isotropic.

22
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,069
That means they do not
depend on the orientation

23
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,687
of the molecule, with respect
to the external field.

24
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,020
And they are also field independent.

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,538
That is to say, they have the same
magnitude at say 400 or 800 megahertz.

26
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:43,896
They are mediated by electrons
via the so-called Fermi interaction,

27
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:48,209
and are set to be through-bond
as opposed to through-space.

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,921
It is still a challenge today
to calculate scalar couplings constants

29
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,757
with reasonable accuracy.

30
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:59,298
If the coupling constants are known,
the mutiplets, due to scalar couplings,

31
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,807
can be predicted
with remarkable accuracy

32
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:06,142
by simple diagonalization
of the matrix representation

33
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,508
of the Hamiltonian in the product base.

34
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,629
The agreement between theory
and experiment is viewed by some

35
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,905
as a nice confirmation that
quantum mechanics actually works.

36
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,027
Works perfectly in this case.

37
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,907
This perfection is due to the fact
that Hilbert space,

38
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:27,725
the space that contains
all the states, is a finite dimension.

39
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,646
Multiplets due to scalar couplings
give crucial information

40
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,994
about molecular symmetry.

41
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:38,273
They often great opportunity
to practice group theory.

42
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:42,155
Multiplets, due to scalar couplings,
give unique insight into

43
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,524
populations of rotamers, and into
their inter-conversion.

44
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:50,430
Another fascinating aspect,
where anomer allows the chemists

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,963
to grasp the mobile, flexible,
and generally speaking,

46
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:57,257
dynamic nature of most molecules.

47
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:02,568
Chapter three, of Peter Hore's
little book on nuclear magnetic resonance,

48
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,903
is dedicated to spin-spin couplings.

49
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,653
In a characteristic fashion,
Peter Hore speaks first about

50
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:15,470
the manifestations of these effects
in a sort of empirical fashion.

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,784
And then, proceeds to explain
where they really come from.

52
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:24,146
So, you will see these chapters,
one right after the other as usual.

53
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:27,776
So multiplets, particularly
in proton NMR spectra,

54
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:30,821
are quite familiar
to the practicing chemist.

55
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,196
Particularly to organic chemists
because they allow them

56
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:39,367
to identify the fragments of the
molecules that they are trying to analyze,

57
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:43,263
or that they have synthesized
or hope to synthesize.

58
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:48,583
Now, we shall start with the very
important example of ethenol again,

59
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,300
but now observed in a magnetic field.

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,515
A modern magnet that has
a sufficient homogeneity

61
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,353
so that we can not only
resolve the three chemical shifts

62
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:03,710
of the OH methylene and methyl protons,
but also the fine structure.

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,411
The fine structure which is due
to the scalar couplings.

64
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,106
And as most chemists
will know, the CH2 group

65
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:16,256
is split into, a quartet
because the CH2 group

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,964
has as neighbor the CH3 group.

67
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,914
While the CH3 group
is split into a triplet,

68
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,655
because its neighbor
is a CH2.

69
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,648
This kind of logic is kind of
instinctive for many chemists,

70
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:30,667
but in fact, it's not so easy to explain.

71
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,860
And one of our objectives
is to go into some detail

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,394
in the course of this chapter.

73
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:41,555
Multiplets are perhaps best explained
in so-called heteronuclear systems

74
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:45,065
where we have for example,
one proton, which has a spin 1/2

75
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,792
with two states, alpha and beta.

76
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:51,518
And one carbon-13, also
with two states, alpha and beta.

77
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:55,402
Now we can take a molecule,
which only contains two such spins.

78
00:04:55,402 --> 00:05:01,672
For example, the conjugate base
of formic acid, or formate, if you will,

79
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:05,631
which abut from this proton here,
has a single carbon-13.

80
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:10,278
About 1% in natural abundance,
or up to 100% if we enrich

81
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,743
the material in the upper isotope.

82
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,234
Now, there will be two spectra.

83
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:21,183
There is, if we take a field
of 9.4 tesla,

84
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:26,595
then there will be a chemical shift 
here in the vicinity of 400 megahertz

85
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,968
And another chemical shift
of the carbon-13

86
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,505
in the vicinity of 100 megaghertz.

87
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,607
In both cases, however,
we do not see singlets,

88
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:37,858
but we see doublets.

89
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:40,312
So the proton signal
is split into a doublet

90
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,236
and so is the carbon signal.

91
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,236
And it turns out that
the splitting exactly

92
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,326
is exactly the same.

93
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,554
If we wonder where this comes from,
we have to look

94
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,493
at the energy level diagram.

95
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:54,080
And remember that spectral transitions,
or lines in the spectrum

96
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,738
always correspond
to differences in energies.

97
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:03,172
If we consider a single isolated proton,
than it can be either parallel,

98
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,671
its polarization can be parallel
with the magnetic field.

99
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,800
We sometimes call this the alpha state.

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,420
Or it can be anti-parallel, in which
case, we call it the beta state.

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,022
Of course, between the two energies,
there is only one transition

102
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,124
which is near 400 megahertz.

103
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:21,662
And consequently, we observe
a singlet, like here.

104
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:25,553
But if we now have a carbon-13
in the vicinity, it turns out that

105
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,771
that carbon-13 itself
can be alpha or beta.

106
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:32,115
And in this case, we assume
that the carbon is in the beta,

107
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:35,107
that is to say
the anti-parallel configuration.

108
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:38,248
And remains in the beta
anti-parallel configuration

109
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:42,553
while the proton is
undergoing its transition.

110
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:46,475
It turns out, and this is the 
manifestation of the scalar coupling,

111
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,587
that the splitting between
these two states is larger than

112
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:53,468
the splitting between the two states
in the absence of a carbon.

113
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,944
Conversely, if we consider
a carbon which is polarized

114
00:06:56,944 --> 00:07:01,601
parallel to the magnetic field,
in the alpha configuration like here,

115
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:05,646
then it turns out that the splitting
between the two levels, where the proton

116
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:09,940
goes from parallel
to anti-parallel is reduced.

117
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,168
And if we think of the spectrum,
in this case, the splitting is enhanced

118
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,672
from here to here.

119
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:20,294
And consequently, the line moves from
central frequency to higher frequencies.

120
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:24,045
Remember that high frequencies
in spectra run from right to left,

121
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,731
in anomer anyway.

122
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:30,316
Whereas, the other line here
has a reduced energy splitting

123
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,855
and therefore, a lower frequency.

124
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:36,188
So this line turns out
on the right-hand side.

125
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:41,144
So the effect of the scalar coupling,
we could call it one-bond scalar coupling,

126
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:44,030
because there's only one bond
between these two nuclei.

127
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,569
In formate, is to split the line
of the proton into a doublet.

128
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:55,913
And likewise, weakens difference argument,
split the carbon-13 into this doublet

129
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,982
with this same spacing.

130
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:02,362
Now, we can try to do this argument,
in its likely more general way,

131
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:05,362
and it's more fundamental
so that we can include

132
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:09,894
arbitrary energies and arbitrary
numbers of spins.

133
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:13,172
For example, if we consider
the energy of a state.

134
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:16,797
So we have now many states
and these states are

135
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:21,279
specified by magnetic quantum numbers,
<i>m</i>, lowercase <i>m</i>, which could be

136
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,256
either <i>m</i>A, can be either

137
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:30,746
plus 1/2, or minus 1/2.

138
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:37,100
And so each energy level diagram
is specified by two quantum numbers

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,060
and each of them can be
either plus or minus 1/2.

140
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,525
And having said that,
the energy level diagram

141
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:48,678
is primarily determined by
this expression, <i>h</i> times Nu.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,508
That's the Larmor frequency
of spin A.

143
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:57,775
And then h times NuX, that's
the Larmor frequency of spin X.

144
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:02,779
Each in this case is
Planck's constant, Planck,

145
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,560
because the energy here
is expressed in joule, as it should be

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,573
in the international system.

147
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:14,959
Though, in practice, NMR spectroscopists
often express their frequencies in hertz,

148
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,420
which you can achieve by dividing
the energies by Planck's constant.

149
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,285
So we often write things is hertz,
which amounts to energy divided by Planck.

150
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:30,661
Now anyway, in this equation, it is
written correctly in terms of joules.

151
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:34,121
And you see that the main effect
comes from the offset,

152
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,962
from the chemical shifts, excuse me.

153
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:39,312
But there is this perturbing
term here, which is due to

154
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,221
the scalar coupling between A and X.

155
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:46,343
And it turns out if <i>m</i>A and <i>m</i>X
have the same sign,

156
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:51,375
then we have a positive contribution
of 1/4 times h times A.

157
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:56,414
If they have opposite sign,
then we have a negative contribution.

158
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,047
So we see this
very nicely on this diagram.

159
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,286
First of all, we start with a
molecule in the absence

160
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,775
of a magnetic field.

161
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,952
Then we switch on the field
for the A nucleus, we see a splitting.

162
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:11,399
So this is the Zeeman splitting
across spin A, which could be the proton.

163
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,905
And then we have another
Zeeman splitting for spin X,

164
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,970
typically the carbon-13
by the way of

165
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,063
this ratio splitting to this splitting
should be equal to the ratio

166
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:22,419
of the gamma carbon divided
by gamma protons.

167
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,353
And then we see the effect
of the coupling is

168
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:29,654
to increase this somewhat, because
the two magnetic quantum numbers

169
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:37,111
are minus 1/2 times minus 1/2
is of course, plus 1/4.

170
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,156
So we have an increase here.

171
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:43,906
And here, because we have
a product of minus 1/2 and plus 1/2,

172
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,939
the product will be minus 1/4.

173
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,945
And indeed, the energy
decreases like this.

174
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:54,518
Here, it's again minus 1/4
because the off that product goes down.

175
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:59,198
And here, it's plus 1/4, 
and indeed, the energy goes up.

176
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:04,097
So this is clearly a manifestation
of this equation.

177
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,670
So, in practice, if we look
at the transitions, we see that

178
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,608
the A transitions in the absence
of splitting of a J-coupling,

179
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:17,921
we have just one line for the A,
that would be in this case, the proton.

180
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,072
And one other line for the carbon.

181
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:24,562
But as soon as we introduce
this interaction, the J then the A

182
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:28,071
splits up into doublet,
and the X spectrum splits up

183
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,793
in a doublet with equal spacing.

184
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,082
And in this diagram, you can see
that they have aligned, or Peter Hore

185
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:39,471
has aligned these arrows here
with the line in the spectrum.

186
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:44,142
And this logic has been
used throughout.

187
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,505
It is interesting to notice that
Peter Hore likes to draw

188
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:50,328
energy level diagrams
in this vertical fashion.

189
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:55,086
Many NMR spectroscopists are tempted
to draw a diagram more in this fashion,

190
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:58,007
in the fashion of a lozenge
where these would be

191
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,585
the transitions of one spin.

192
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,394
And this would be the transitions
of another spin.

193
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:06,978
And somehow, some of us
think it's easier to remember this.

194
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:09,871
So this would be for
a homonuclear system.

195
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:13,406
Or for this heteronuclear system,
you would have large transitions

196
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:19,281
for spin A and smaller transitions,
smaller energy differences, for transition

197
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,860
So this would be the A transitions,
and this would be the X transitions.

198
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,516
Some people prefer this
kind of drawing over this sort of

199
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:29,121
vertical, ladder representation.

200
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:34,940
It turns out that in larger spin systems,
with three or more spins,

201
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,221
we have more complicated multiplets.

202
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:42,059
And that these multiplet patterns
can be built up, as it were,

203
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:48,483
from different splittings that are
invoked one after the other

204
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:52,915
in a sort of cascade of splittings,
or sometimes called a 'tree'.

205
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:57,191
And we can see here, that if we
have a given spin that

206
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:01,532
resonates at a chemical shift A,
it will be split into a doublet

207
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,844
if we have a neighboring spin M
with a coupling JAM.

208
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:09,524
And this doublet will again
be separated, split into a sub-doublet

209
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:13,335
by spin X with a coupling AX.

210
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:20,288
And so, if we assign different,

211
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,288
spins different polarizations,

212
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:26,622
it turns out that the left-most
line in the multiplet,

213
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,994
if all the couplings are positive,
corresponds to a situation

214
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,626
where both M and X are negative.

215
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:35,957
Or they could both be
in the beta position.

216
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:42,454
Whereas, in the second line from left,
the spin M is still in the beta position,

217
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,907
but alpha has flipped over
from beta to alpha.

218
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,951
And so, this can be assigned like this.

219
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,295
And so this is a very elaborate
way of interpreting

220
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:58,848
the different components
of a multiplet in terms of states.

221
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:01,562
I should say at this level,
that one cannot circumstrict

222
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,730
energy level diagrams like this.

223
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,808
And for example, for a two-spin system,
it would be like this.

224
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:11,034
And if we have a third system,
then it would be like this.

225
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:15,794
So we have two lozenges,
and we connect them like this.

226
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:21,557
And it turns out that the parallel
transitions of this cube correspond

227
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:24,886
to transitions of spin A
and other parallel transitions.

228
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:29,099
For example, these could be
the transitions of spin A

229
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:33,050
and other transitions would be
those of spin M and spin X.

230
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,422
But one of the purposes
of this particular picture

231
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:41,533
is to show under certain circumstances,
the coupling between AM and AX

232
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,645
may become equivalent.

233
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:49,329
And then we speak of a situation
where spin A is coupled to a spin X,

234
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,779
and another spin X, and in such a way
that the scalar coupling constants

235
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,790
are accidentally, or by symmetry, equal.

236
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,913
In that case, we have only one J,
and it's called JAX.

237
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,160
And you can see
what happens in this diagram,

238
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,563
the central legs of these
two doublets here become

239
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,756
shifted on top of each other
and become degenerate.

240
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:14,106
And this degeneracy means
that the central line is

241
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:18,774
twice as intense as the
individual lines on the left-hand side.

242
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:21,578
And we can take this
one step further.

243
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,602
We can consider the case
where A is coupled

244
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:31,052
to three different nuclei,
all with the same coupling constant.

245
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,864
And so this is known as
an AX3 system.

246
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:38,457
And in that case, we have
a quadruplet with the so-called

247
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,973
binomial intensity distribution.

248
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:46,491
And each line can be assigned to the 
polarization of the neighboring X nuclei.

249
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:51,285
Now it turns out that these
multiplet patterns can be

250
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,929
generalized in terms of so-called
Pascal's triangle.

251
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:00,288
Or this is just a way of rationalizing
in a simple way, a binomial distribution.

252
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,758
You probably know how
the Pascal triangle is built up.

253
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,244
For example, there's three,
number three here

254
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,930
is just the sum of numbers
one and two on the line above.

255
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,108
And you can use that rule
systematically all the way down.

256
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:15,534
And what you see here
are the distributions.

257
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:21,048
So there are line distributions
of different spin systems.

258
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:27,188
This is the isolated A spin,
a two-spin system in AX2, AX3, etc., AX6.

259
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,506
Now you may think this is
purely formal.

260
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,091
Well in fact, it is not.

261
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,465
And it goes a long way further.

262
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:36,985
You could for example,
consider a situation where

263
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:40,282
we have silicon-29,
which has a spin 1/2.

264
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,976
And which is surrounded by
four methyl groups.

265
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:48,456
This substance is called TMS,
tetramethylsilane.

266
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:51,812
And in fact, it turns out
that there are three times four,

267
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,910
12 equivalent protons.

268
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,185
So the system is actually
an AX12 system, and you

269
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:01,649
can imagine that you have
to expand the Pascal triangle

270
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,785
a very long way to go that far.

271
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:08,764
By the way, these intensity rules
are not always easy

272
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,438
to identify on the spectrum
because it turns out

273
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,978
that the outer lines here
are very weak compared

274
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,182
to the central lines.

275
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,873
And sometimes you just
don't see the outer lines.

276
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:21,291
And one way of not being fooled
by the fact that the outer lines

277
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,215
may be drowned in noise,
is to compare these inner lines

278
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,046
of the central components.

279
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,958
In this case, we have 15:20:15,
which is of course, distinct from 1:2:1.

280
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:37,396
And therefore, we can identify on which
level of the Pascal triangle we are,

281
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:45,188
without actually measuring,
numbering out the full list of lines.

282
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:49,483
So, there are many cases
where couplings involve nuclei,

283
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:54,900
so-called quadrupolar nuclei,
which have spin quantum number I,

284
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,803
larger than 1/2.

285
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,665
The simplest example being
the deuterium nucleus, which is a spin one

286
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,183
But there's also the nitrogen-14
nucleus with a spin one.

287
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,700
Or the lithium-6 nucleus
with a spin one and many others.

288
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,073
Not to mention all the higher spins.

289
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,227
Now let's take a simple example
where we consider a carbon.

290
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:18,697
In this case, a carbon-13
attached to a deuterium nucleus.

291
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,404
It turns out that, and we shall
call this carbon nucleus, spin X,

292
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:27,611
and the deuterium nucleus
will be called spin A.

293
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:30,596
Now it turns out that
the energy level diagram

294
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:37,220
is composed of the following,
for the deuteron, which has I equal one.

295
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,842
And therefore, magnetic quantum
numbers of spin A can be either

296
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:45,902
minus one or zero, or plus one.

297
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:48,823
While we find these three
levels corresponding

298
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,897
to the minus one, the zero
and the plus one,

299
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,765
quantum numbers of the deuteron.

300
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,354
And it split be this transition
which actually is

301
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,380
degenerate to this transition
which is just the same

302
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,400
interaction for the deuteron.

303
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,943
If we're in isotropic phase,
these are always deuterons,

304
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,522
so there's actually no evidence
that this is a quadrupolar nucleus.

305
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,555
But if we look at the carbon-13
next door, then we have

306
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:14,968
to take into account that there's also
a splitting for the carbon-13.

307
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:19,008
And we see here that
this one here, has let's call

308
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,471
the quantum number S
to avoid confusion.

309
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,119
And in this case, MX can be
minus 1/2, or plus 1/2.

310
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,536
This is what we call a
beta or alpha state.

311
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:38,363
And you see that now we have
six energy levels, and we have

312
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,638
a certain amount of transitions here.

313
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,462
We see on the carbon side,
let's just say on the X side,

314
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,495
we see these three transitions,
so as before, this is nicely aligned

315
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,282
with this peak and this is
aligned with this peak.

316
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,314
And so you see there's
a relationship between

317
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,732
the energy level diagram
and the spectrum.

318
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,944
Some people say that
a spectrum is nothing else

319
00:19:56,944 --> 00:20:00,490
but a peculiar projection
of the energy level diagram.

320
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,540
On the other hand, if we
look at the A side,

321
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,372
it turns out that this line and this line
are still rigorously degenerate,

322
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,202
have exactly the same frequency.

323
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:13,107
So they end up with a doubly
degenerate line on this side here.

324
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:17,436
And likewise, these two transitions
here are exactly degenerate

325
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:21,920
and pile up on top of each other
and give this doubly degenerate line.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,352
The remarkable thing now
is therefore, that on the X side,

327
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:28,621
it's the carbon-13, we don't
have a binomial triplet,

328
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:33,342
but we have a triplet with
equal intensities, 1:1:1.

329
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:37,515
Now, it turns out that there are more
sophisticated quadrupolar nuclei.

330
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:41,397
And we have an example here
of boron-11, which has

331
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:44,162
spin quantum number <i>I</i> equals 3/2

332
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:49,611
And therefore, the <i>m</i> of the boron
can go from minus 3/2

333
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:55,175
to minus 1/2, to plus 1/2,
to plus 3/2.

334
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:59,450
So there are four distinct
quantum states for each boron.

335
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,569
If we take this peculiar molecule,
known as diborane,

336
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,635
which comes from the condensation
of two BH3 molecules.

337
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:14,403
So we have 2H3, two times,
give a B2H6.

338
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:17,892
And it turns out that
the structure of this B2H6

339
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:21,538
is a rather peculiar assembly
that you see here,

340
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,127
where we have so-called
terminal protons, there are four of those.

341
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:29,124
And each of these terminal protons
only sees one boron-11.

342
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:33,573
Incidentally, we assume that
boron-10 has been eliminated

343
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:38,192
by proper synthesis,
synthetic preparation.

344
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,753
Now each proton sees
just one boron,

345
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:44,089
and consequently the terminal
protons are split up into

346
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:46,240
a quartet of four equal lines.

347
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,499
So we call this a non-binomial
1:1:1 quartet.

348
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:56,629
And that's characteristic of
any spin 1/2 nucleus coupled

349
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,999
to a spin 3/2 nucleus.

350
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:02,160
But more peculiar is what happens
if we look at the bridge protons.

351
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,787
So these protons actually
have equal bonds to two borons,

352
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:07,805
and also equal scalar couplings.

353
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,900
In fact, the whole molecule,
as we shall see,

354
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,263
is completely symmetrical.

355
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:16,482
And these protons and these
borons are magnetically equivalent.

356
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,653
But if we want to understand
the fine structure of the peak,

357
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,733
or the multiplet of that proton,
the bridge proton,

358
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:29,226
then we have to do a division
into four peaks like this.

359
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:34,276
And each of them has to be
subdivided again into four equal peaks.

360
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:37,797
But because the two couplings
are equivalent, like we have seen

361
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:43,318
in AX2 and AX3 systems, you see
that there are now, for example,

362
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,591
at this line here, there are two
ways of getting there.

363
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,913
Either from here, or from here.

364
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:54,255
And therefore, the intensity of that line
is twice as high as the first line.

365
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,731
So we get rather peculiar multiplets.

366
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:04,790
1:2:3:4:3:2:1,

367
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,620
which is
not a binomial multiplet.

368
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,217
This does not fit into
the logic of Pascal's triangle.

369
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,280
But you see where it comes from.

370
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,781
And by way of an exercise,
I would like to encourage you

371
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,299
to think of the next level.

372
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,509
What happens if the proton
were coupled to three boron nuclei?

373
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,110
Then of course, we have
even more complex multiplet,

374
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,934
and the challenge would be
to determine its multiplicity.

375
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,752
This is not an academic question,
since there are actual molecules

376
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:32,885
that have that pattern.

377
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,982
So this concludes part one
of this chapter.

378
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,580
Thank you for you attention.
