Magnetic resonance is
familiar to most of us.

3
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:21,476
In fact, many of us have
experienced an MRI scan

4
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:24,314
or at least know someone who has.

5
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:27,440
Magnetic resonance imaging,
as it is known officially

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,433
allows us not only to view
bones and tendons,

7
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:35,028
but also soft tissues,
nerve bundles, and tumors.

8
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:38,756
Magnetic resonance is not only
good for medical diagnosis,

9
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:42,870
there are many, many applications
to physics, chemistry and biology

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,282
that allow us to get a better
understanding of the world around us.

11
00:00:47,282 --> 00:00:49,513
My name is Geoffrey Bodenhausen.

12
00:00:49,513 --> 00:00:54,004
I'm a professor of chemistry and teach
nuclear magnetic resonance here

13
00:00:54,004 --> 00:00:56,899
at the Ecole Polytechnique
in Lausanne in Switzerland,

14
00:00:56,899 --> 00:01:01,198
and also at the Ecole Normale
Superieure in Paris, in France.

15
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,977
Within the broad field of magnetic
resonance, I have many interests

16
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:09,600
ranging from solids to liquids,
including new methods

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,713
for drug screening and many
other applications.

18
00:01:13,713 --> 00:01:17,305
At both EPFL and ENS,
I have the pleasure

19
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:21,226
of leading two lively research groups.

20
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:26,736
This MOOC is based upon the second
edition of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,

21
00:01:26,736 --> 00:01:30,941
a little book written by
Peter Hore at Oxford University.

22
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:35,003
In the video lectures, I will be
covering the same range of subjects

23
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,053
as Peter has in his book.

24
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:40,942
And I will be following the same
structure, divided into six chapters.

25
00:01:42,182 --> 00:01:45,901
I strongly recommend that you
get a copy of Peter Hore's book,

26
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:50,977
as it goes into much greater detail
than I'm able to do in this MOOC.

27
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:54,546
In addition to the subjects
covered in the book,

28
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:57,787
this MOOC also contains
a few extra lectures

29
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,515
that will be presented
by Sami Jannin.

30
00:02:00,515 --> 00:02:04,591
These cover some cutting-edge,
state-of-the-art applications

31
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,560
of magnetic resonance.

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,636
Throughout the course, we will
be covering subjects like

33
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:14,508
chemical shifts, scalar couplings,
dipolar couplings, chemical reactions,

34
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:17,795
and the return of the
magnetization to its equilibrium,

35
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:20,519
a process that we call relaxation.

36
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:23,533
And also, of course, methods
for recording signals,

37
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:26,343
including Fourier
transforms and the like.

38
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:29,957
The main objective of this course
is to give you a basic understanding

39
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:33,150
of how magnetic resonance
actually works.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,563
This information will be
helpful for a range of fields

41
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:40,236
from physics and chemistry,
to neurosciences.

42
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:43,603
To supplement the video
lectures, we will include

43
00:02:43,603 --> 00:02:48,596
some downloadable information,
and also interactive exercises

44
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:52,153
so that you can test
yourself along the way.

45
00:02:52,153 --> 00:02:55,144
I look forward to receiving
you all for this course

46
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:58,530
on Basic Steps in Magnetic Resonance.
