1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:08,103
So, we've come to the end
of this book

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,181
and it is time to acknowledge
the contributions

3
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:13,993
that many have made to the making
of the book.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,954
Some of them wittingly, 
some of them unwittingly.

5
00:00:16,994 --> 00:00:20,313
The key contributions-- of course--
come from Peter Hore,

6
00:00:20,313 --> 00:00:24,204
who wrote this little book
that we have been using in these lectures.

7
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:27,764
So Peter Hore is 
lecturer at Oxford University,

8
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:31,980
and he has written a book
that I have bought in vast quantities

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,780
to redistribute among my students
over the last 15 years or so.

10
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:41,856
He has made a new addition, 
which you see the cover page,

11
00:00:41,856 --> 00:00:44,403
which actually 
has come out this week

12
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:47,449
this is now in June 2015,
in which I am speaking,

13
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:49,937
and therefore, 
you should be able to get it

14
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:53,026
from your favorite local librarian.

15
00:00:53,107 --> 00:00:58,364
I should say that Peter Hore deserves
a great deal of credit for this book.

16
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:02,864
He came from the world of EPR-- 
Electron paramagnetic resonance--

17
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:06,738
and learned enough about
magnetic resonance of nuclei

18
00:01:06,738 --> 00:01:10,567
to pick out the best 
examples, that I am aware of,

19
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:15,664
of applications of relaxation, 
of chemical exchange of bio molecules,

20
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:19,881
and all of these different branches
of magnetic resonance

21
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,619
that are discussed in the book.

22
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,562
So, the next person
I would like to acknowledge

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,167
is Sami Jannin,
he is here in Lausanne,

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,570
and he has also recorded some videos 
that are part of the book,

25
00:01:33,577 --> 00:01:37,548
in fact the idea that 
these videos would give you some feeling

26
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:41,464
of more recent developments
and modern applications

27
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:46,832
that go beyond the boundaries
of Peter Hore's elementary text.

28
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,898
I should also acknowledge 
the contributions of

29
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:55,270
Basille Vuichoud, 
he is a senior graduate student here,

30
00:01:55,284 --> 00:02:00,409
almost coming towards his PhD, 
at the École polytechnique

31
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:05,092
fédérale de Lausanne,
and he has not been seen on the videos,

32
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:10,996
but he is responsible for the 
preparation of the Power Point material

33
00:02:10,996 --> 00:02:15,708
that you have seen 
and also for uploading questions

34
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:20,470
and multiple answers
on the website of the book system.

35
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:24,877
Finally, I should say, 
that there is an entire team at the

36
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,636
<i>Laboratoire de Résonance 
Magnétique Nucléaire Biomoléculaire</i>

37
00:02:28,636 --> 00:02:32,871
who have, one way or another, 
contributed to making this book possible,

38
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:37,297
and you have seen some of the
laboratory in the teaser.

39
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,797
Here in the learning center
of the EPFL

40
00:02:40,797 --> 00:02:43,747
there are at least two people
who have made this possible,

41
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,733
Mathew Goodman has done
all of the editing,

42
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,497
and I have seen some of it
and I know that

43
00:02:49,497 --> 00:02:52,767
it is a very difficult task
and he is very proficient.

44
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:57,397
Gwenael Bacquet has over seen 
the entire effort

45
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:00,449
and coordinated
whatever needs to be coordinated.

46
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:03,167
So the team
that makes up the

47
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,648
<i>Laboratoire de Résonance 
Magnétique Nucléaire Biomoléculaire</i>

48
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:09,527
here at the 
École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne

49
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,918
of course, changes from 
year to year

50
00:03:11,918 --> 00:03:14,980
but I have taken this picture
from a few years ago

51
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,451
because it shows a nice collection 
of activities and specialties.

52
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:22,544
First of all, 
in the first row you see

53
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:25,821
Diego Carnevale, 
who is an expert of solid state NMR

54
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:28,838
and recently moved to
the University of Neuchâtel,

55
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:32,550
then behind him Sami Jannin, 
in the white shirt.

56
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:35,750
You know him because he 
contributed to the book.

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,009
In front of him-- Pascal Miéville
who is now at the staff of EPFL,

58
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,943
and did his PhD in our group,
then myself.

59
00:03:43,993 --> 00:03:48,789
Next to me, Simone Ulzega
in a red shirt, he is now at the Eawag.

60
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:52,079
Kneeling in front of him is
Roberto Buratto,

61
00:03:52,104 --> 00:03:56,674
who is about to obtain his PhD
here in Lausanne,

62
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:02,285
It is not necessary to kneel to get
a PhD, but he took some precautions.

63
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:06,505
Then standing behind him,
is Jonas Milani,

64
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:12,482
who you will see, 
or you may have seen in the teaser

65
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:16,602
where he is showing how the
samples are put into the spectrometer.

66
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:21,572
And in a dark red shirt, there is
Nicola Salvi,

67
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:25,625
who did his PhD in our group
some years ago.

68
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:30,062
Partly involved in new techniques 
for screening of drugs,

69
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,470
and after his PhD went off to 
Harvard Medical School for a year,

70
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:39,746
and he is now in Grenoble
at the Institut de Biologie Structurale.

71
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:43,218
On the second row you see, 
somewhat in the dark,

72
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:47,518
Takuya Segawa who finished his PhD
at Lausanne,

73
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:53,165
and is now in Zurich,
working on electron spin resonance.

74
00:04:53,165 --> 00:04:57,768
Then the tallest figure of all is the one 
of Veronika Vitzthum

75
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:01,899
who seems like she descended from heaven 
through this circular window

76
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,511
that looks a bit like
a halo above her head,

77
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:09,117
and she is now doing MRI in Bern
at the Inselspital

78
00:05:09,117 --> 00:05:13,508
and also in Solothurn or Soleure--
Northern Switzerland.

79
00:05:13,508 --> 00:05:17,879
Next to her is Marc Caporini
who is an American post-doc

80
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,271
who after few years in Lausanne
returned to Boston

81
00:05:21,271 --> 00:05:25,448
and became involved in 
the American Branch of the Brooker Company

82
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:29,914
and then recently moved into a company
that makes bio-molecules.

83
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:36,592
And finally, Aurelien Bornet
who got his PhD a few weeks ago

84
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:41,715
and will stay in our lab a bit longer
to do dissolution DNP.

85
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:46,067
Now there is a smaller sub-team,
partly composed of the same people,

86
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:50,000
that is specifically active
in the field of

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,376
dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization.

88
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:56,989
You see them here in front of a machine
that can cool samples

89
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,035
to 1.2 Kelvin, now that's very cold, 
as you may realize

90
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:07,387
and that can irradiate these samples
by microwave with about 50 milliwatts.

91
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:11,521
And you see on the right side, 
sitting, Sami Jannin,

92
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:15,737
who is rightly proud of this machine
because he worked on it for many years

93
00:06:15,737 --> 00:06:20,520
and developed it virtually from scratch, 
with all the whistles and bells,

94
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,600
and the pumps and microwave sources
and the wave guides, and everything else.

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,806
Standing in the middle is 
Basile Vuichoud

96
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,470
who is also rightly proud 
of his achievements,

97
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,724
and you can see 
he is not ashamed of what he did.

98
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:40,028
And behind him is Jonas Milani
who made many interesting contributions

99
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:43,240
to this machine. In particular, 
a magnetic tunnel

100
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,917
that runs just above his head
through which we can transfer samples

101
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,608
from the polarizer, 
which you see in this laboratory

102
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:54,413
to another magnet which is in
the laboratory behind the wall.

103
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:58,345
Now to the left of Basile
you see Lyndon Emsley

104
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:02,262
who is going to be my successor 
here at EPFL.

105
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:06,281
In fact he has just been installed here
on June 1st-- about 11 days ago--

106
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:11,278
as of today, together with two people 
that joined him on a trip from

107
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:15,009
the École normale supérieure in Lyon.

108
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,107
So I should also acknowledge the fact
that I spend most of my time in Paris,

109
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:21,413
and I only come to Lausanne 
every other week

110
00:07:21,413 --> 00:07:24,117
to give lectures and record books.

111
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:28,299
And in Paris I am in charge of a team 
which is partly at the

112
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:32,841
École normale supérieure and partly at
the Université Pierre et Marie Curie,

113
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:36,927
and as you can see, 
we meet in regular intervals,

114
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:42,377
about once a week we have group seminar, 
and you see some of the members here

115
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:46,532
freezing in the February cold at the foot

116
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,812
of the Administration building 
of the UPMC.

117
00:07:50,812 --> 00:07:54,754
Actually, many of the important people 
in the group are missing,

118
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:58,517
they are mentioned on the list
on the right hand side.

119
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:03,428
And the whole thing 
is a very lively environment

120
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:08,179
which stimulates and generates
much interest in research,

121
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:13,721
both in methodology,
as well as bio-molecular applications

122
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:16,392
and solid state methods.

123
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,546
Now finally I would like to acknowledge--
so to speak-- the rest of the world,

124
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:30,410
and I suggest starting with a statement
with a quotation from the Talmud,

125
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,739
and I should say that Hebrew 
is not one of the many languages

126
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:37,606
that I tried to learn at school, 
and after that,

127
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:41,816
but I had a friend who tried to teach me
how to pronounce this

128
00:08:41,816 --> 00:08:44,753
and what I remember of this lesson is
roughly like this:

129
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:52,613
(speaks in Hebrew)

130
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,491
Whether my Hebrew friends-- 
or Hebrew speaking friends--

131
00:08:57,491 --> 00:09:02,359
understand that or not, 
I can give you an English translation,

132
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:06,047
or some attempt to translate 
this into English:

133
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,818
"<i>From my teachers 
have I been enlightened,</i>

134
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:15,118
<i>more from my colleagues,
the most I have learned from my Pupils</i>".

135
00:09:15,118 --> 00:09:19,842
Now this statement comes from the Talmud
and was brought to my attention

136
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:24,968
by Dr. Ditsa Pines, who is at 
The University of California at Berkeley

137
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:28,739
where I spent a few months 
as a visiting professor.

138
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:34,808
Now teachers, there are of course,
many I could think of;

139
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,147
my PhD adviser Ray Freeman, 
I could think of Peter Hore,

140
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:42,028
I could think of Richard Ernst, 
and of Kurt Wuthrich in Zurich,

141
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:46,711
with whom I did many interesting things,
or at least things I found interesting.

142
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,955
I can think of Bob Griffin at MIT, 
who taught me much about DNP

143
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:55,131
and about solid state NMR.

144
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:58,190
I can think of Rigitsa Vold
and Bob Vold at UCSD,

145
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,959
with whom I did a post-doc and I learned
a great deal about relaxation from them.

146
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,267
There are many teachers, 
in the narrow sense of the word,

147
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:08,042
but in fact there are many more, 
of course,

148
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,637
there's a vast community of people
whom we come across

149
00:10:11,637 --> 00:10:15,060
when reading papers
and studying brilliant ideas

150
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,732
that have been developed 
over the last 50 years or so.

151
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:25,488
The colleagues-- living colleagues--
are quite numerous.

152
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:28,878
I am not only thinking of
my immediate environment

153
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,998
who are doing chemistry
or physics, or biology--

154
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,908
and of course--
we learn a lot from them.

155
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:38,106
But there are also people
who come to meetings

156
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:40,698
and in my field 
there are so many meetings

157
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:42,511
that you can almost move

158
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,364
from meeting to meeting
without ever going home.

159
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:48,142
Some of these meetings
are held in Europe.

160
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:52,153
There is a series that is called Euromar 
for European Magnetic Resonance

161
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:55,926
which I have been the founding chair
of the board of trustees

162
00:10:55,926 --> 00:11:01,433
for first six years 
that this organization was running,

163
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:05,144
and it's now going to be held-- 
this year-- in July,

164
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:08,839
it will be held in Prague
in the Czech Republic,

165
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,808
and these meetings, which
group about 5-6-700 colleagues,

166
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:15,778
are always an opportunity
to learn from them

167
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:18,936
and to be stimulated 
and to discover new fields.

168
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:22,169
But most of all, 
I learn from my students;

169
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:26,705
when lecturing, when trying to explain
things in a classroom,

170
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:30,670
when trying to advise
my PhD students,

171
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:34,718
when revising the drafts
of papers they may have produced,

172
00:11:34,718 --> 00:11:38,748
when arguing about
the best graphical material

173
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:42,288
and how to present their results
in the most seductive way.

174
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:47,755
All of these things are interactive
between my students and myself,

175
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:50,853
and I believe that
one learns most from students,

176
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:53,541
much more so than from the teachers.

177
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:57,390
Something that was already realized 
at the time the Talmud was written.
