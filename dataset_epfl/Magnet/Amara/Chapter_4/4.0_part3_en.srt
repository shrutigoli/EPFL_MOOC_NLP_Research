1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,513
In the second part of chapter two,
I tried to summarize

2
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:12,727
the mechanics, the mathematics
that underlies the description

3
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,568
of the so-called
McConnell-Bloch equations,

4
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:19,049
which allow one to derive
such things as line broadening

5
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:21,677
line narrowing, coalescence
and all these things

6
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:26,355
on a more serious basis, rather than
that of pure empirical discussions.

7
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:30,899
Now, Peter Hore has collected,
a remarkably well-selected,

8
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,141
set of examples
of chemical exchange.

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,777
I would like to start with
the example that Peter mentions

10
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,957
as one of the last
of his illustrations because I think

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,871
it's one of the
most important ones.

12
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,493
Also, it happens to be
discovered in Switzerland

13
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:51,722
at ETH Zurich by Kurt Wuthrich
whose name I wrote out here.

14
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:56,915
And Kurt Wuthrich got a
Nobel Prize for NMR of biomolecules.

15
00:00:56,915 --> 00:01:00,437
This was in 2002, if I remember correctly.

16
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,969
And he once said, in an
informal lecture, that the effect

17
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,200
that I'm going to explain
to you now, was one of his

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,156
most important discoveries.

19
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,960
And I would tend to agree
with that judgement.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
He has done many, many things,
but this is very intriguing.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,128
So, what we're talking about
is tyrosine, the motion of tyrosine

22
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,294
which occurs in proteins.

23
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:24,384
And in fact, the side chain of a tyrosine,
you have the backbone here.

24
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,274
Then you have the CH2, and you
have a phenyl ring,

25
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:30,501
which is para hydroxy
group, so that's tyrosine.

26
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:35,679
And of course, there are four protons
in positions two, three, five and six.

27
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,469
If the tyrosine is rotating freely,
as it would be in solution,

28
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,230
then you would expect
protons five and three,

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,535
which are in the ortho- position,
to have the same chemical shift.

30
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:51,670
And likewise, you would expect six
and two to have the same chemical shifts.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,475
Now, Wuthrich did not record
these spectra in free solution,

32
00:01:55,475 --> 00:02:00,348
but he considered tyrosine,
actually number 35, which is

33
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:05,627
in this protein, which is called
basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,

34
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:09,591
which has about 70 or so
amino acids and number 35

35
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,319
happens to be a tyrosine.

36
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,972
There are other tyrosines,
but this one is particularly interesting.

37
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,712
As you can see, you can
record spectra BPTI

38
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:20,397
from very low temperatures,
just above freezing,

39
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:21,808
to very high temperatures.

40
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,680
In this case, without significant
denaturation of the protein,

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
which is not obvious,
many proteins would decompose.

42
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,728
But this one is quite happy.

43
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,669
And you see that at high temperature,
you see the effect that

44
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,237
I sort of hinted at, that protons
two and six occur at

45
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:42,808
a given chemical shift,
about 7.2 or so ppm.

46
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:48,470
Whereas, protons three and five
give rise to a single chemical shift

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,831
which is actually split into
a doublet.

48
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:53,723
And a doublet actually comes
from the coupling between

49
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,949
the ortho and the meta positions.

50
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,639
But that's not relevant
to today's discussion.

51
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,836
As you lower the temperature,
which is easy to do,

52
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:07,602
you find that that spectrum
gets more complicated.

53
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:12,270
And the first thing that happens,
going from fast flipping to slow flipping

54
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,401
is that this broadens out,
and then it splits up into

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,806
two distinct resonances.

56
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:21,710
One corresponds to the ortho position,
sorry, the meta position two.

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,723
And the other corresponds
to the meta position six.

58
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:30,560
So these two protons now have
vastly different chemical shifts.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,905
That comes not from
the tyrosine itself,

60
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,006
but from the environment.

61
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,182
It turns out that the protein
environment here is distinct

62
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,538
from the protein environment
on the other side.

63
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:45,214
And therefore, these two protons
are exposed to different local fields,

64
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,308
and have different chemical shifts.

65
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:51,476
Something similar happens
if we look at protons three and five.

66
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:56,246
So those are the two in ortho position,
which I now put in a square box.

67
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:59,624
So at high temperature,
they are simply degenerate.

68
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,270
The doublet structure
as I said is irrelevant now.

69
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,160
And when you go to lower
and lower temperature,

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,396
they broaden and they split up
into two distinct resonances,

71
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:14,132
five and three here,
two distinct doublets.

72
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:16,615
Now the remarkable thing is
that this happens,

73
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,824
although the temperature scale
is the same, you see that

74
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:23,745
the coalescence for the two
protons that are close together

75
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:27,604
at low temperature, occurs
at about 40 degrees or so.

76
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,509
Whereas the coalescence
for the two protons

77
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,249
that are far away from each other
occurs at about 60 degrees or so.

78
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:36,634
That is simply in fact,
a verification of the laws

79
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,816
established by Bloch and McConnell
and can be calculated

80
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:44,593
with the type of theory
that I explained in the previous part.

81
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:49,352
Actually, beyond a simple illustration,
this picture has dramatic implications

82
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:52,918
for protein and the understanding
of protein dynamics

83
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,795
because this interconversion
really supposes that

84
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,499
the protein flips as it is
drawn by this line here--

85
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:06,534
that the aromatic ring of the
tyrosine actually flips over.

86
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:10,198
Now that means that
it must be standing upright

87
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,469
perpendicular to the plane
of the paper,

88
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:14,628
maybe for a very short interval.

89
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,971
But it has to be able
to flip over from

90
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,019
the flat position one way
to the flat position the other way.

91
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,268
so that the positions
of two and six can interchange.

92
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,912
And three and five
likewise, interchange.

93
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:30,050
Now that implies that
the protein must be dynamic,

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,523
that it must be able
to breathe, as it were,

95
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:36,369
in order to leave sufficient room
for such an exchange process.

96
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,362
Indeed, a quite remarkable observation.

97
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:43,274
Now there are more basis examples,
and this one was probably already

98
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,858
discovered in the '50s, 
possibly at CERN

99
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:51,161
by the very early investigations
of Dharmatti and others.

100
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,450
Now we're talking about ethanol.

101
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,183
It turns out that if we take
the multiplets of ethanol at neutral pH.

102
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:02,196
So this is at pH 7 here.

103
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,833
Then, we cannot not only see
the conventional triplet

104
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,205
for the methyl group
that is due to the neighboring CH2,

105
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,838
but the CH2 is not simply
split into a quartet

106
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,337
because of the neighboring CH3,
but it's in addition, split into a doublet

107
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:19,035
because of the neighboring OH.

108
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:22,453
Likewise, we can actually see
this OH proton here.

109
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:27,599
And it is split into a triplet
because it is coupled, scalar coupled,

110
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,820
with a neighboring CH2 row.

111
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,126
Now it turns out that
you only have to do it

112
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:36,848
at a very minute amount,
a trace amount of acid

113
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,820
for this effect to go away.

114
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,861
And then we observe
a singlet here.

115
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:50,555
And the multiplet of the CH2 group
collapses to a simple binomial quartet.

116
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:54,298
So the question is, why do we
observe such a collapse in the spectrum?

117
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:58,768
The answer is, if we consider
a simple molecule,

118
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:02,968
a monomeric form of ethanol,
we may have a proton

119
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:06,902
called "A" attached to it,
which may well have a polarization

120
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:11,320
which is parallel to the magnetic field
which we could call alpha.

121
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,193
And the external proton, the one that
comes from the water or from the acid,

122
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,699
would be called proton B.

123
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,158
And that, in this hypothesis has
the opposite polarization, namely beta.

124
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,468
If these two exchange,
and that is exactly

125
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:28,880
what chemical exchange is all about,
then, of course, the B proton

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,256
will become part of the ethanol molecule.

127
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,985
But it will retain its beta polarization.

128
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:37,214
Whereas the A proton will go out
into the medium

129
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,776
while retaining its alpha polarization.

130
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:44,460
From the point of view
of the CH2 protons here,

131
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,082
that's these ones here,
which that we find here again,

132
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:51,199
it looks as if the neighboring
proton in the hydroxy position

133
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,654
has flipped from alpha to beta.

134
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:56,331
And this flip can occur
at a phenomenal rate

135
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,875
because acid base reactions
are extremely fast and therefore,

136
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:06,492
they can be--they lead to a collapse
of the multiplicity of the CH2 group.

137
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,237
And that is exactly what we see here.

138
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:13,175
You will recall that this line here
can also be broadened

139
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,935
because of exchange between
OH and the environment,

140
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:19,820
so it's not easy to observe
such a sharp line.

141
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,969
But normally, we just see this part here.

142
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:27,927
We should indeed see a quartet here,
and a triplet here.

143
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:32,190
One of the best examples
that Peter Hore has cited in his book,

144
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,759
actually due to David Grant
and others in Salt Lake City,

145
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,042
is the example of cis-decalin.

146
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:42,569
Cis-decalin can be drawn
as a flat molecule.

147
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:47,462
So this is not aromatic,
but it still can be drawn like this.

148
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,956
And if we do it that way,
we can number the postions.

149
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:51,819
So we talk about
the carbons or the protons,

150
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,256
in this case, the carbons.

151
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:01,669
This is the conventional
numbering of this molecule.

152
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,487
And if we draw it like this, it is not
surprising that the symmetry makes

153
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:09,176
that the chemical shifts
of these two sides are identical.

154
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,025
And you can go further,
and you see that

155
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:14,048
the chemical shifts of this side should
be the same as this side.

156
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,645
And this side should be
the same as this side.

157
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,241
And then of course, the other
sides are distinct,

158
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:24,534
so we find that these sides
are all distinct from the previous ones.

159
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:29,035
And then that effect is that
at 46 degrees Celsius,

160
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,845
when the molecule can be
essentially considered

161
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:36,635
as interconverting so fast
that we allow to draw it on a flat plane.

162
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,274
Well, at that temperature,
we only have one peak

163
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:42,429
that corresponds to these two
bridging carbons.

164
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:45,849
We have one peak that
corresponds to the four carbons

165
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:48,235
that I have circled here.

166
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:53,432
And there's one peak for the four carbons
that I have put in square boxes.

167
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,013
So far, so good.

168
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:57,615
Now it turns out that if
we go to lower temperature,

169
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:01,595
from 46 to 16 to -12 to -29,

170
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,876
then the situation becomes
more complicated.

171
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:09,322
And a little bit like, in the case of
Wuthrich's tyrosine, we see

172
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,170
that these lines split up.

173
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,052
And the reason is that at
lower temperature, we now have

174
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:20,375
to consider these molecules as
separate rotamers, or separate confomers.

175
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,023
And that the symmetry is lifted.

176
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,400
So we still have a symmetry
between these two,

177
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,659
and likewise between these two,
that has been preserved.

178
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,234
And indeed that line doesn't move
at all as a function of temperature.

179
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:36,891
But we see now,
that for example, this line,

180
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:41,983
although it's the same as this line,
it is no longer the same as this line.

181
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,978
And no longer the same
from that line.

182
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:48,569
So we see one and five,
which still pile up together,

183
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,952
and we have four and eight,
which are still degenerate.

184
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,484
But they are no longer equal.

185
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:57,572
However, if we warm them up,
so you see that one and five,

186
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,693
and four and eight are here,
and they will tend to coalesce

187
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:05,789
and end up with the positions
that I've indicated previously.

188
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:10,709
Now we see that this,
there's here a two-fold coalescence.

189
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,505
We notice, by the way
that in this case, the coalescence occurs

190
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,991
at about the same temperature.

191
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,270
And that the splitting between
these two and these two, by accident,

192
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,550
happen to be about the same.

193
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,132
This is a very good example.

194
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,915
In fact, at the beginning
of this chapter, I spoke about

195
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:29,482
the interconversion of cyclohexane,
which as I mentioned,

196
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,276
is too fast where you see
when you mix cis-decaline

197
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:37,084
it becomes slow enough so that you
can observe it at room temperature

198
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:39,376
or in the vicinity of room temperature.

199
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,585
The next example is much
more sophisticated.

200
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,633
This is known as bullvalene.

201
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,050
It's one of these molecules
that was probably designed

202
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,307
in order to get into the
Guinness Book of Records

203
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:52,191
for maximum complexity.

204
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,712
And in fact, all we have to remember
is that we have a cyclopropene unit

205
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:02,915
where we have three positions,
Carbon 13 positions, which appear here.

206
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:07,180
And we have a bridging position
which is a long position here.

207
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,071
We have all sorts of rearrangements,
so-called Cope rearrangements

208
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,174
where the double bonds travel

209
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:17,232
and the cyclopropene ring opens up.

210
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,279
I will not give you a lecture
on organic chemistry,

211
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,027
but you see that this cycle here,
it turns up here and so on and so forth.

212
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:29,160
And in doing so, for example,
this site here, which was the isolated D,

213
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,984
now becomes a site A, which is typical
of the environment of cyclopropene.

214
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:39,669
And so indeed, there's an
interconversion between A and D.

215
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,377
And in fact, the entire process
can be summed up

216
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,651
in this sort of topological graph,
showing that D goes to A.

217
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:51,747
A goes to C, C to B, and B remains
in part, equal to itself

218
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:55,641
in the course of this rearrangement,
this Cope rearrangement.

219
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,318
Now we see again that at high
temperature, there's only one position.

220
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,609
But as we lower the temperature
it splits up into many lines.

221
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:06,357
And we can, of course, precisely
determine the exchange rates

222
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:10,971
of these processes by doing
an analysis of these line shapes.

223
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:15,100
So, the next example in Peter Hore's book
should be more to the liking

224
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,762
of people who are interested
in organometallic chemistry.

225
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:21,921
He is interested, so it explains
and cites an example

226
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:25,795
of the ruthenium complex
where you have the tri-carbon ruthenium

227
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:30,714
which is sort of hovering
over this cyclooctatetraene ring.

228
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:34,832
And in doing so, can find itself
attached to different positions.

229
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:39,081
So we have two ordinary double bonds,
in this delocalized affair

230
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:43,945
which is the location where
the ruthenium is most strongly attached.

231
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:48,341
And it turns out that the ruthenium
is not very tightly bound to this

232
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:52,794
and can move a little bit like the hands
of a clock around a circle.

233
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:57,374
And in doing so, at high temperature,
we have a single line in Carbon 13,

234
00:13:57,374 --> 00:14:01,476
but as the temperature is decreased,
it splits up into a manifold.

235
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:05,714
And you can see that again,
we can draw topological diagrams

236
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,958
which show the exchange rates between
these two different, four different forms.

237
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,694
It turns out that the question here
is whether we have a 1-2 shift,

238
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:18,709
or a 1-3 shift, or a 1-4 shift,
or a 1-5 shift?

239
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:24,108
And the spectra allow you
to rule out some of these mechanisms

240
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:29,898
and decide, choose one of the
ones that is correct.

241
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:34,502
So the next example in this chapter
has already been discussed

242
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:39,122
in an earlier chapter about
scalar couplings between

243
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:42,400
spin 1/2, such as Carbon 13,
and quadrapolar spins

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,280
such as Lithium 6, in this case.

245
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,405
So Lithium 6, to remind you,
has a spin of <i>I equal one.</i>

246
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:56,265
And therefore, has three possible states,
<i>M equal plus one, zero or minus one.</i>

247
00:14:56,265 --> 00:15:01,153
And consequently, the neighboring
Carbon 13 here, if there were only

248
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:06,996
one lithium, would be split into
a triplet, with three equal intensities.

249
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,625
So this is known
as a non-binomial triplet.

250
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:15,042
But as we have discussed before,
it turns out that lithium can build

251
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,820
a tetrahedral structure.

252
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,760
And that we have these
tertiary butane molecules,

253
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,888
butanol molecule groups
which can attach

254
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,587
not to the corners of this
tetrahedron, but to these faces

255
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:32,540
in the middle of each
of the triangular faces.

256
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,692
And when that occurs at low temperature,
each Carbon 13 will be coupled

257
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,046
to three Lithium 6.

258
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:46,228
And it results in a rather peculiar
non-binomial multiplet like this

259
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,169
at low temperature.

260
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,409
But the situation gets even
more complex if we heat it up.

261
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,189
So if we go from low
to high temperature

262
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:57,259
because then it turns out
that these groups here

263
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,830
can move about from
one surface to another.

264
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,370
In fact, they can hop from
one triangular surface to another.

265
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,420
Or if you prefer, they stay
where they are.

266
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,211
But it's the lithium cluster
that rotates within the cloud

267
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,211
of the carbon substituents.

268
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:17,185
Whatever this case may be,
it turns out that at 26 degrees Celsius,

269
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:22,814
we find that each Carbon 13 is coupled
not to three lithiums, but four lithiums,

270
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:26,650
because all four lithiums, even this
remote one, will at one point

271
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,732
be close to the Carbon 13,
and have a stronger coupling.

272
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,155
We see two interesting things.

273
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,098
First of all, the multiplet
becomes more complex.

274
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:39,432
And also, the effector scalar coupling,
there is a splitting here

275
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,312
between this and this, is larger
than it is here.

276
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,558
It is actually reduced
because of the average.

277
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:49,518
So I'd like to summarize
chapter four.

278
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:53,837
The chapter that Peter Hore
dedicated to chemical exchange

279
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,341
which seems to be one
of his favorite subjects.

280
00:16:56,341 --> 00:17:02,009
And is indeed, one of the key aspects
of modern magnetic resonance.

281
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,690
So chemical exchange effects in NMR
can arise either

282
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,499
from chemical or from
conformational equilibria.

283
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:15,186
In the slow exchange regime,
NMR lines are simply broadened,

284
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:17,342
and we can measure
that exchange rates by

285
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,722
looking at the line widths.

286
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:24,669
Now, the difference in NMR
frequencies between exchanging spins

287
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:30,594
can be averaged by fast exchange.

288
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:35,423
It is the magnitude of delta nu,
that is to say the difference

289
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,776
in the chemical shifts between
the nuclei that are involved

290
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,632
in exchange processes,

291
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:45,305
relative to the exchange rate constants
that determines whether

292
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:50,529
the exchange process is
in the slow or in the fast regime.

293
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,656
Chemical exchange effects give
information on the rates and mechanisms

294
00:17:55,656 --> 00:18:02,366
of chemical reactions, molecular
rearrangements and internal motions.

295
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:06,822
Now most comments in Peter Hore's book
refer to chemical exchange

296
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:11,658
between sites that are distinct
because of their chemical shifts.

297
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,659
But there are other ways
of distinguishing sites.

298
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,917
And one of them, for example,
is quadrapole interactions in solids.

299
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,292
Here, at the Ecole Polytechnique
in Lausanne, we have spent years

300
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,635
determining the spectra
of Nitrogen 14 which

301
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:28,440
is a quadrupolar nucleus
with a spin one,

302
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,379
and has a quadrupole interaction
that ranges from one

303
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,529
to about five megahertz.

304
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,011
Now in that case, we have observed
exchange broadening effects

305
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:42,648
between different sites that
are interchanging at very high rates.

306
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:46,490
So when the exchange rate
is say one megahertz,

307
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,117
that means the lifetime is
on the order of 10 to the -9.

308
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:53,378
That is to say seconds,
that is to say nanoseconds.

309
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:58,577
And consequently, the n-14 spectra
are sensitive to processes

310
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:02,346
that occur on that timescale
of about a nanosecond.

311
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,783
And it all depends on which
nuclei you look at

312
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,671
and in which environment.

313
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,541
Chemical exchanges are probably
one of the subjects that will live

314
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,184
for many years to come.

315
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,548
There is currently much attention
paid to chemical exchange in proteins

316
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:21,552
and also in DNA, for it has been found
that the well-known double helix

317
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:24,196
is not as static as it appears
and that in fact,

318
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,055
there are many exchange processes
that are worth studying

319
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,945
in large biomolecules.

320
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,976
Thank you for your attention.
