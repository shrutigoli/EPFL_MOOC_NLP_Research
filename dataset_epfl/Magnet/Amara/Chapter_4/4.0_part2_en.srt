1
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:10,761
So far we have simply explained 
in an empirical fashion

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,400
how chemical exchange affects
NMR spectra.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,763
And we have shown you 
some computer simulations

4
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:21,515
without telling you 
how these effects can be calculated.

5
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:25,417
Let me try to explain the basics now.

6
00:00:25,417 --> 00:00:31,726
First of all, we spoke of spectra, 
which in the low exchange regime,

7
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:34,144
comprise at least two lines,

8
00:00:34,144 --> 00:00:40,036
with frequencies 
nu zero B and nu zero A,

9
00:00:40,036 --> 00:00:43,041
so these were two chemical shifts.

10
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,393
It turns out that such a spectrum, 
which typically is drawn

11
00:00:47,393 --> 00:00:50,162
from right to left, by convention,

12
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:54,883
is obtained by an operation 
called the Fourier transformation,

13
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:58,250
which I just write as a black box 
with this italic <i>F</i>,

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,497
and we'll talk more 
about that in Chapter 6.

15
00:01:05,834 --> 00:01:08,183
So, the time domain signal,

16
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:11,109
which Felix Bloch called 
the Free Induction Decay,

17
00:01:11,109 --> 00:01:15,160
we shall see in Chapter 6 
how you can record that.

18
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
This time domain signal is in fact, 
in this simple case,

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,025
composed of a super position 
of two different cosine waves

20
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:27,777
which have two different arguments.
There's a phase for site A which:

21
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:32,571
<i>is equal to two pi 
times nu zero A times Time</i>

22
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:36,467
And there is a phase for 
Site B which is:

23
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:42,334
<i>two pi nu zero B</i>
also proportional to time.

24
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,925
And so we have 
two cosine waves,

25
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:51,126
Simply <i>cos phi A plus cos phi B</i>

26
00:01:51,126 --> 00:01:56,248
So both of these phases
are linearly proportional to time

27
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:01,774
and if you draw them 
then we have a slow beat here,

28
00:02:01,774 --> 00:02:04,405
dotted lines that corresponds
to the lowest frequency

29
00:02:04,405 --> 00:02:07,404
and dotted lines as slow cosine wave.

30
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:11,071
And on top of that, 
a faster cosine wave.

31
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:16,044
Now we can plot the difference
in phase, so this is: <i>Delta phi</i>,

32
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:20,147
and Delta phi is the difference 
between the fast and the slow.

33
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:25,637
So <i>Delta phi is 
equal to phi A minus phi B</i>.

34
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:31,199
And if these equations hold, 
that is to say,

35
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,226
if there is no chemical exchange,
then you expect

36
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:38,136
the difference in phase to be simply 
proportional to time,

37
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:41,526
since both of these factors 
are proportional to time,

38
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:44,706
then consequently
we have a simple line

39
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:49,746
with a slope that is determined
by the difference in chemical shifts.

40
00:02:51,006 --> 00:02:56,686
So the slope would actually be;
<i>two pi times delta nu</i>

41
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,760
which is the difference 
in chemical shifts.

42
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,997
This is applicable if 
there is no exchange,

43
00:03:02,997 --> 00:03:05,807
but if there is hopping 
of the molecules

44
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,456
from one site to the other, 
so A becomes B

45
00:03:08,456 --> 00:03:11,913
and B becomes A, 
then these different signals here

46
00:03:11,913 --> 00:03:16,799
cannot build up a phase difference, 
because we effectively hop

47
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,338
from one curve to another
in a stochastic fashion.

48
00:03:20,338 --> 00:03:26,192
And this haphazard hopping, 
from one site to the other means that

49
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:28,486
chemical shift differences are 
averaged to zero

50
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:32,244
that means that there can be 
no build up of a difference in phase

51
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:36,067
and in fact, if the exchange
is reasonably fast

52
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:39,999
without being infinitely fast,
then we get this rather noisy line

53
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:44,703
in which where the phase difference 
is close to zero degree.

54
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:47,960
If we have a very fast exchange, 
infinitely fast exchange,

55
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,206
then it will be a sharp horizontal line,
without any stochastic excursions.

56
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:58,162
So far, we have discussed
the consequences of chemical exchaange

57
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:02,669
on the line width and line positions
of NMR spectra

58
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,998
in a sort of empirical fashion,
supporting our discussion

59
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:09,366
by numerical simulation,
but without telling you,

60
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:13,301
really, how these 
numerical simulations were made.

61
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:16,916
So to understand that 
we have to go one step beyond

62
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,586
and I would like
to discuss with you what happens

63
00:04:19,586 --> 00:04:22,282
with the magnetization
in a frame

64
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,540
that we shall discuss 
in Chapter Six,

65
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,716
which is known as the rotating frame.

66
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:29,698
It turns out that the magnetization
can be drawn as a vector,

67
00:04:29,698 --> 00:04:33,731
and this vector has an X component
and has a Y component,

68
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,496
and in the course of
the magnetic resonance experiment,

69
00:04:36,496 --> 00:04:42,205
it will undergo both a precession 
and a decay of its magnitude.

70
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:46,553
And the precession angle, here, 
from its initial position

71
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:52,524
to its position at <i>Time T</i>
can be called <i>Phase as a function of T</i>.

72
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:58,236
Now it turns out to be very convenient
to define a complex number,

73
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:03,166
which I call <i>M plus of T</i>, 
and which is defined as

74
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:11,722
<i>M-X of T plus I of M-Y of T</i>.

75
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:16,735
So this is a simple complex notation.
Incidentally, it's modeled after

76
00:05:16,735 --> 00:05:20,781
a so called <i>raising operator</i>
in Quantum Mechanics.

77
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:27,671
Which is defined as 
<i>I plus equal I -X plus i- I- Y</i>.

78
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,126
So this is the model, 
so to speak,

79
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:34,054
Bowery's model for our nu definition.

80
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:38,200
Now if you want to describe procession 
then we can write

81
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,606
<i>M plus of T is equal to 
M plus of T times Zero</i>,

82
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:49,485
incidentally this notation encompasses
both the amplitude

83
00:05:49,485 --> 00:05:52,113
and the phase of Time Zero,

84
00:05:52,113 --> 00:05:54,368
and the precession
can be written like this:

85
00:05:54,368 --> 00:05:58,290
<i>two pi nu Zero</i>,
that's the chemical shift

86
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,086
at which these things precess,
and <i>Time</i>.

87
00:06:01,086 --> 00:06:07,246
If we want can embellish this notation
by taking in to account

88
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:10,497
the decrease of the amplitude
and that can be done

89
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:14,348
by multiplying this 
with a decaying function T2.

90
00:06:14,348 --> 00:06:20,261
Now from this equation
which describes both the precession

91
00:06:20,261 --> 00:06:22,889
and the transverse relaxation
of the magnetization.

92
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:27,831
We can obtain the Time derivative,
which we can write:

93
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,066
<i> D over D-T</i>
of the same complex objects,

94
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,994
which can be written in 
shorthand notation;

95
00:06:32,994 --> 00:06:38,586
<i>M plus of T with a dot over it</i>, 
and this turns out to be the same as

96
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:52,311
<i> M-X of T times-- a minus in front--
 and then we have I-2-Pi nu zero</i>

97
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:58,259
and we have <i>plus 1 over T2</i>.

98
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,404
Now, if we wish to consider
similar things

99
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:07,649
for two different 
magnetization vectors,

100
00:07:07,929 --> 00:07:09,966
we would have them
in different speeds

101
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:12,343
we can change color, 
if you will,

102
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:15,189
so we can have 
another magnetization vector,

103
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:18,672
which would be in green,
and that would have

104
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:22,220
a different phase angle, 
maybe a faster recession,

105
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,639
maybe a phase here,
would be moving faster,

106
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,847
so this would be phase of site B, 
Where of this of T,

107
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:37,225
and then we can rewrite these equations,
both for A and for B.

108
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:47,227
So vector A can be written like this:
<i>A and T2 of A</i>

109
00:07:47,227 --> 00:07:52,606
and this is the 
<i>Time derivative of A, of A, of A and A</i>

110
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:57,342
but I can also do
the same thing for vector B,

111
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:00,157
and of course then,
I have to replace A by B,

112
00:08:00,157 --> 00:08:05,060
replace all of these As by B,
and in this fashion can <i>cook up</i>

113
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,521
an equation that describes 
the magnetization of the other site,

114
00:08:09,611 --> 00:08:13,444
without actually rewriting everything.

115
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,849
So far so good, we will see
in a minute

116
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:19,989
why this is convenient 
to describe chemical exchange.

117
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,609
So in the previous picture 
you have seen

118
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,549
how the precession 
can be described

119
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:29,116
in terms of a
complex magnetization vector

120
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:31,986
with phase and amplitude
and now we shall discuss

121
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:35,209
how chemical kinetics 
can affect this precession.

122
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:40,199
And to prepare the ground, 
lets first start with a simple equation--

123
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,369
chemical transformation of A to B:

124
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:46,049
which is accompanied 
by the reverse reaction, like this.

125
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:51,734
And we know that that means 
that if we take the Time derivative

126
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:56,446
of the concentration of A, 
it will be decreased

127
00:08:56,446 --> 00:09:01,195
with a factor proportional 
going from forward proportional

128
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:07,649
to the initial concentration of A, 
but it will be replenished, as it were,

129
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,848
by the reverse reaction 
from B to A.

130
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:15,849
So now in this notation we have,
<i>K forward and K backward</i>

131
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:23,247
So likewise, the time dependence 
of the concentration of the other form B,

132
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:29,428
will be proportional 
to the concentration of A,

133
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:32,531
and this is--as it were--
fueled by the forward reaction,

134
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,214
at the same time
the concentration of B

135
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:39,368
is depleted by the backward reaction, 
so it looks like this.

136
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:44,589
Now, this is a set 
of two differential equations

137
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:48,645
and it turns out to be convenient 
to write them in the form

138
00:09:48,645 --> 00:09:52,302
of a matrix and a vector, 
so we can say the same thing

139
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:57,269
that we have the Time derivative 
of a vector consisting of

140
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,763
the concentration of A 
and the concentration of B,

141
00:10:00,763 --> 00:10:05,639
both time dependent quantities, 
of course, and we have a matrix

142
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,608
which is made up of the coefficients
that we see here;

143
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:18,829
<i>minus K forward plus K backward 
plus K forward minus K backward</i>

144
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,127
and this multiplies 
another vector,

145
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:26,850
comprising the same concentrations 
of A and B.

146
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:31,170
So this is a-- I would say--

147
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,013
a rather conventional description
of first order chemical kinetics.

148
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:41,675
Now it turns out that 
we can combine the interplay,

149
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:44,510
we can express the interplay 
of these things,

150
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,860
by describing the interconversion
of the magnetization vectors.

151
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,120
And to do that 
we have to take

152
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,159
the Time derivatives
of the magnetization vector,

153
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,046
complex magnetization vector site A

154
00:10:58,046 --> 00:11:00,495
and the complex 
magnetization vector of site B,

155
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:05,732
and we make a vector of these two
and then we make a matrix

156
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:10,684
and in this matrix we have; 
<i>minus K forward </i>

157
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:14,296
that we know from the 
chemical exchange effect,

158
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:16,297
but we also have;

159
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:24,357
<i>minus I-2-Pi nu zero A</i>
for the chemical shift.

160
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:29,802
Then here we have;
<i>plus K backward</i>

161
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:33,308
and here we have;
<i>plus K forward</i>

162
00:11:33,308 --> 00:11:36,600
and here we have;
<i>minus K backward</i>

163
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,610
but we shall add to this;
<i>minus I-2-Pi Nu zero B</i>,

164
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:51,213
and this will then multiply
and effect the M complex vector,

165
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,522
complex number that was describes
the magnetization of site A

166
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:59,662
and the complex number that describes 
the magnetization of site B.

167
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:05,113
So this equation describes 
both the chemical exchange

168
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:10,312
which is in the numbers K--
the symbols K and the precession

169
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:17,322
due to the chemical shift 
of sites A and B.

170
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:21,520
We can, in fact, 
embellish this by putting:

171
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,341
<i> 1 over T-2 of site A</i>
in this diagonal element,

172
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,372
and also by; 
<i> subtracting 1 over t-2 of site B</i>

173
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,249
on the last diagonal element.

174
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:35,642
But the basic idea is that we have a;
<i>2 by 2</i> matrix that describes this.

175
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:38,131
And such a matrix 
can be resolved,

176
00:12:38,131 --> 00:12:40,633
such a differential equation 
can be resolved,

177
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:43,182
essentially by diagonalizing this matrix.

178
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:46,003
Its not a completely trivial matrix 
to diagonalize

179
00:12:46,003 --> 00:12:48,312
because it is not necessarily symmetric,

180
00:12:48,312 --> 00:12:51,402
and also it has imaginary components 
in the diagonal elements,

181
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:54,762
but it can be done-- and moreover-- 
this can be generalized

182
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:59,882
for assisting with N larger than 2 sites.

183
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:05,191
So it is quite remarkable 
that you can handle,

184
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,322
in fact, an arbitrary number of sites--

185
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:12,055
A,B,C,D-- and still set up a matrix 
and diagonalize that matrix.

186
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,801
And this kind of calculation 
forms the foundation of the simulations

187
00:13:15,801 --> 00:13:20,225
that you have seen 
in the first part of this chapter.

188
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,242
This concludes Part 2 of this Chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
