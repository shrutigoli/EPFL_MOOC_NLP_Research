So far we have simply explained in an empirical fashion how chemical exchange affects
NMR spectra.
And we have shown you some computer simulations without telling you how these effects can be calculated.
Let me try to explain the basics now.
First of all, we spoke of spectra, which in the low exchange regime, comprise at least two lines, with frequencies nu zero B and nu zero A, so these were two chemical shifts.
It turns out that such a spectrum, which typically is drawn from right to left, by convention, is obtained by an operation called the Fourier transformation, which I just write as a black box with this italic <i>F</i>, and we'll talk more about that in Chapter 6.
So, the time domain signal, which Felix Bloch called the Free Induction Decay, we shall see in Chapter 6 how you can record that.
This time domain signal is in fact, in this simple case, composed of a super position of two different cosine waves which have two different arguments.
There's a phase for site A which:
<i>is equal to two pi times nu zero A times Time</i>
And there is a phase for 
Site B which is:
<i>two pi nu zero B</i> also proportional to time.
And so we have two cosine waves,
Simply <i>cos phi A plus cos phi B</i>
So both of these phases are linearly proportional to time and if you draw them then we have a slow beat here, dotted lines that corresponds to the lowest frequency and dotted lines as slow cosine wave.
And on top of that, a faster cosine wave.
Now we can plot the difference in phase, so this is: <i>Delta phi</i>, and Delta phi is the difference between the fast and the slow.
So <i>Delta phi is equal to phi A minus phi B</i>.
And if these equations hold, that is to say, if there is no chemical exchange, then you expect the difference in phase to be simply proportional to time, since both of these factors are proportional to time, then consequently we have a simple line with a slope that is determined by the difference in chemical shifts.
So the slope would actually be;
<i>two pi times delta nu</i> which is the difference in chemical shifts.
This is applicable if there is no exchange, but if there is hopping of the molecules from one site to the other, so A becomes B and B becomes A, then these different signals here cannot build up a phase difference, because we effectively hop from one curve to another in a stochastic fashion.
And this haphazard hopping, from one site to the other means that chemical shift differences are averaged to zero that means that there can be no build up of a difference in phase and in fact, if the exchange is reasonably fast without being infinitely fast, then we get this rather noisy line in which where the phase difference is close to zero degree.
If we have a very fast exchange, infinitely fast exchange, then it will be a sharp horizontal line, without any stochastic excursions.
So far, we have discussed the consequences of chemical exchaange on the line width and line positions of NMR spectra in a sort of empirical fashion, supporting our discussion by numerical simulation, but without telling you, really, how these numerical simulations were made.
So to understand that we have to go one step beyond and I would like to discuss with you what happens with the magnetization in a frame that we shall discuss in Chapter Six, which is known as the rotating frame.
It turns out that the magnetization can be drawn as a vector, and this vector has an X component and has a Y component, and in the course of the magnetic resonance experiment, it will undergo both a precession and a decay of its magnitude.
And the precession angle, here, from its initial position to its position at <i>Time T</i> can be called <i>Phase as a function of T</i>.
Now it turns out to be very convenient to define a complex number, which I call <i>M plus of T</i>, and which is defined as
<i>M-X of T plus I of M-Y of T</i>.
So this is a simple complex notation.
Incidentally, it's modeled after a so called <i>raising operator</i> in Quantum Mechanics.
Which is defined as 
<i>I plus equal I -X plus i- I- Y</i>.
So this is the model, so to speak,
Bowery's model for our nu definition.
Now if you want to describe procession then we can write
<i>M plus of T is equal to 
M plus of T times Zero</i>, incidentally this notation encompasses both the amplitude and the phase of Time Zero, and the precession can be written like this:
<i>two pi nu Zero</i>, that's the chemical shift at which these things precess, and <i>Time</i>.
If we want can embellish this notation by taking in to account the decrease of the amplitude and that can be done by multiplying this with a decaying function T2.
Now from this equation which describes both the precession and the transverse relaxation of the magnetization.
We can obtain the Time derivative, which we can write:
<i> D over D-T</i> of the same complex objects, which can be written in shorthand notation;
<i>M plus of T with a dot over it</i>, and this turns out to be the same as
<i> M-X of T times-- a minus in front--
and then we have I-2-Pi nu zero</i> and we have <i>plus 1 over T2</i>.
Now, if we wish to consider similar things for two different magnetization vectors, we would have them in different speeds we can change color, if you will, so we can have another magnetization vector, which would be in green, and that would have a different phase angle, maybe a faster recession, maybe a phase here, would be moving faster, so this would be phase of site B, 
Where of this of T, and then we can rewrite these equations, both for A and for B.
So vector A can be written like this:
<i>A and T2 of A</i> and this is the 
<i>Time derivative of A, of A, of A and A</i> but I can also do the same thing for vector B, and of course then,
I have to replace A by B, replace all of these As by B, and in this fashion can <i>cook up</i> an equation that describes the magnetization of the other site, without actually rewriting everything.
So far so good, we will see in a minute why this is convenient to describe chemical exchange.
So in the previous picture you have seen how the precession can be described in terms of a complex magnetization vector with phase and amplitude and now we shall discuss how chemical kinetics can affect this precession.
And to prepare the ground, lets first start with a simple equation-- chemical transformation of A to B: which is accompanied by the reverse reaction, like this.
And we know that that means that if we take the Time derivative of the concentration of A, it will be decreased with a factor proportional going from forward proportional to the initial concentration of A, but it will be replenished, as it were, by the reverse reaction from B to A.
So now in this notation we have,
<i>K forward and K backward</i>
So likewise, the time dependence of the concentration of the other form B, will be proportional to the concentration of A, and this is--as it were-- fueled by the forward reaction, at the same time the concentration of B is depleted by the backward reaction, so it looks like this.
Now, this is a set of two differential equations and it turns out to be convenient to write them in the form of a matrix and a vector, so we can say the same thing that we have the Time derivative of a vector consisting of the concentration of A and the concentration of B, both time dependent quantities, of course, and we have a matrix which is made up of the coefficients that we see here;
<i>minus K forward plus K backward plus K forward minus K backward</i> and this multiplies another vector, comprising the same concentrations of A and B.
So this is a-- I would say-- a rather conventional description of first order chemical kinetics.
Now it turns out that we can combine the interplay, we can express the interplay of these things, by describing the interconversion of the magnetization vectors.
And to do that we have to take the Time derivatives of the magnetization vector, complex magnetization vector site A and the complex magnetization vector of site B, and we make a vector of these two and then we make a matrix and in this matrix we have; 
<i>minus K forward </i> that we know from the chemical exchange effect, but we also have;
<i>minus I-2-Pi nu zero A</i> for the chemical shift.
Then here we have;
<i>plus K backward</i> and here we have;
<i>plus K forward</i> and here we have;
<i>minus K backward</i> but we shall add to this;
<i>minus I-2-Pi Nu zero B</i>, and this will then multiply and effect the M complex vector, complex number that was describes the magnetization of site A and the complex number that describes the magnetization of site B.
So this equation describes both the chemical exchange which is in the numbers K-- the symbols K and the precession due to the chemical shift of sites A and B.
We can, in fact, embellish this by putting:
<i> 1 over T-2 of site A</i> in this diagonal element, and also by; 
<i> subtracting 1 over t-2 of site B</i> on the last diagonal element.
But the basic idea is that we have a;
<i>2 by 2</i> matrix that describes this.
And such a matrix can be resolved, such a differential equation can be resolved, essentially by diagonalizing this matrix.
Its not a completely trivial matrix to diagonalize because it is not necessarily symmetric, and also it has imaginary components in the diagonal elements, but it can be done-- and moreover-- this can be generalized for assisting with N larger than 2 sites.
So it is quite remarkable that you can handle, in fact, an arbitrary number of sites--
A,B,C,D-- and still set up a matrix and diagonalize that matrix.
And this kind of calculation forms the foundation of the simulations that you have seen in the first part of this chapter.
This concludes Part 2 of this Chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
