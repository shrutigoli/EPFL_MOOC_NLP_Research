00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Welcome to our MOOC, or Massively
Online Open Course

2
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,704
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:12,704 --> 00:00:16,713
Today, we shall be talking about
chemical exchange.

4
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:20,834
That is the subject of chapter 4
of Peter Hore's book.

5
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:24,814
The author has chosen an example
of chemical exchange

6
00:00:24,814 --> 00:00:26,562
for the title page of his book

7
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:32,122
so it is safe to assume that he found
this subject particularly interesting.

8
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:35,434
Like many other basic aspects of 
magnetic resonance,

9
00:00:35,434 --> 00:00:39,504
the effects of chemical exchange 
were discovered in the 1950s.

10
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:44,209
The name of Herb Gutowsky is often
associated with discovery.

11
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:49,874
The theory was initially developed by
Felix Bloch and Harden McConnell.

12
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:53,965
As we shall see, chemical reactions
that occur during the observation

13
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:57,564
of NMR spectra lead to
characteristic effects:

14
00:00:57,564 --> 00:01:01,094
line broadening, coalescence,
and line narrowing,

15
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:04,676
all of which allow us to determine
the rates of reactions.

16
00:01:04,676 --> 00:01:08,527
Typically, one can study rates that
aren't comparable with differences

17
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:09,986
in chemical shifts.

18
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:12,866
The range of applications is
truly staggering.

19
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:15,267
From simple confirmation
of equilibria,

20
00:01:15,267 --> 00:01:20,127
to internal mobility of biomolecules,
such as proteins.

21
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,122
So, the word chemical exchange has
a particular meaning for

22
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:28,899
NMR spectroscopists which is perhaps
not shared by the entire

23
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,559
community of chemists.

24
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:35,583
To explain this point, let's consider
some simple examples.

25
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:41,051
All of us, in first year chemistry,
must have learned that cyclohexane

26
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:46,547
normally looks like this, if it is
drawn as a static molecule,

27
00:01:46,547 --> 00:01:50,907
and that we have protons, or generally
speaking, substituents

28
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:55,557
sticking out from this ring in axial
position and other ones

29
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,681
that are in, sort of,
equatorial positions.

30
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:03,508
Now, we also know that this can
interchange to give another

31
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:07,558
check on formation which we can
draw like this which again

32
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:11,868
has an axial and an equatorial position.

33
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:17,731
Now, what is curious is that, 
in the static molecule,

34
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:21,878
if we could stop it from exchanging,
we would expect a different chemical

35
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:27,338
shift for this axial position here
and this equatorial position.

36
00:02:27,338 --> 00:02:30,646
One would expect them to have
different chemical shifts.

37
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,362
Let's not talk about the fact that
they are also coupled,

38
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,962
that is not currently of interest.

39
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:40,212
Now it turns out that this position
of the actual proton

40
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:43,798
will be transformed, a chemical shift
rather of the actual proton

41
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:48,418
will be transformed into the chemical
shift of an equatorial proton.

42
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,847
Whereas this equatorial proton will
find itself in a position

43
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:56,268
of an axial proton and consequently
there is an interchange

44
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:58,688
between their chemical shifts.

45
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,949
It turns out that this process is
extremely fast and therefore

46
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,250
difficult to measure with NMR,
unless we find some way

47
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,060
of slowing it down, which is actually
rather still a topic of interest.

48
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:14,072
I can take another example, this is
more of a chemical reaction.

49
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:17,590
Let's consider some carboxylic acid,
which looks like this

50
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,230
in the acid form.

51
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,982
And we have all learned that this
can be transformed into the

52
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:32,172
conjugate base by losing a proton,

53
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:34,852
or giving a proton to the environment.

54
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:38,661
Now if we think of the carbon 13 in
this side, which we find on this

55
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:42,708
side as well, we can expect the
chemical shift of this carbon

56
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:47,648
to be different from the chemical
shift in the conjugate base.

57
00:03:47,648 --> 00:03:49,212
And indeed it is.

58
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:53,857
Again, such a process tends to be
very fast, and therefore not easy

59
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:56,469
to measure and appreciate with NMR.

60
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,649
But it turns out that similar processes
can be slowed down considerably.

61
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:05,877
For example, if this carboxylic acid
is hidden in the heart of a protein,

62
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:09,198
belongs to the site chain of a protein,
of one of the amino acids

63
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:13,171
in the protein, in such circumstances
the exchange can be slowed down

64
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:18,722
and can actually become measurable,
of great interest to NMR spectroscopy.

65
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:23,462
Now, in order to support this whole
discussion of chemical exchange,

66
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,774
I invite you to look at chapter four of
Peter Hore's book on

67
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:29,643
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.

68
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:33,833
You will see that he distinguishes
symmetrical two-sided exchange

69
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,875
and unsymmetrical two-sided
exchange.

70
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:40,578
We shall see in a few minutes
what the difference is.

71
00:04:40,578 --> 00:04:44,972
And in this chapter, there is a great
wealth of very interesting examples

72
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:49,711
that I will take some
time to discuss with you.

73
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:55,840
Let's first talk about symmetrical
exchange which I wrote here

74
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,725
as exchange with equal populations.

75
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:03,780
Equal populations you will have if
the two forms in equilibrium

76
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,450
have the same energy.

77
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,269
So, if the energy is a function
of the degree of freedom,

78
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,328
turns out you have the same energy
in the A and B forms.

79
00:05:13,328 --> 00:05:18,578
If that is so, then the populations
will be equal, according to

80
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:23,614
Boltzmann's Law, and also the
interconversion from A into B

81
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:28,017
will be precisely matched by the
reverse interconversion

82
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,717
from B into A.

83
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:34,421
Such systems are very numerous,
but we have an example here

84
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:39,588
of dimethylnitrosamine where we have
two distinct groups here,

85
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:43,918
a methyl group here, which is in the
same side as the oxygen

86
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,668
or cis, if you prefer, and another
methyl group here, which is

87
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,018
on the opposite side or trans,
with respect to the oxygen.

88
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:58,721
And as you can see, there is a
pseudo-rotation around this bond,

89
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:03,971
this single bond, or partly single
bond, then the oxygen will swap

90
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:10,376
and go to the other side, and what
was here, the methyl that was

91
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:13,601
in the cis position now ends up
in the trans position

92
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:16,171
and therefore can be
labelled like this.

93
00:06:16,171 --> 00:06:21,355
So, the point is that while this 
pseudo-rotation is going on,

94
00:06:21,355 --> 00:06:25,561
the methyl groups change their
environments and in doing so

95
00:06:25,561 --> 00:06:29,475
change their chemical shifts
because the energies

96
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:34,733
of these two conformers or rotomers
are exactly the same, the populations

97
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:39,139
are the same and therefore we have
a symmetrical situation where the

98
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,562
forward and backward exchange rates
are exactly the same, or we could

99
00:06:43,562 --> 00:06:49,295
write this as k+ is equal to k-, or 
we could also write the

100
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:53,725
equilibrium constant in this case
is equal to one.

101
00:06:55,535 --> 00:07:01,435
Now, in this particular case, where
we have equal populations,

102
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:04,581
we can distinguish different regimes.

103
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:10,633
And this picture you can also find
on the title page of Peter Hore's book.

104
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,457
First of all, it shows the spectra
that we see for such cases,

105
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:17,397
as a function of the exchange rate.

106
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,948
You will note that this is a
logarithmic scale,

107
00:07:19,948 --> 00:07:23,778
for example, this corresponds to one
jump per second,

108
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:27,135
and this corresponds to a thousand
jumps per second,

109
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:31,187
and of course we go all the way
to 100,000.

110
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:35,591
This corresponds to generally speaking
to an increasing temperature.

111
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:38,734
There are other ways, of course,
of changing or affecting

112
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:42,411
the speed of a chemical reaction but
temperature is certainly

113
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,764
one way of doing that.

114
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,857
And so at low temperatures we have
slow rates, and at slow rates we can

115
00:07:47,857 --> 00:07:52,821
actually distinguish the chemical
shifts of site A and site B

116
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,871
as we have in the previous examples.

117
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:58,986
In this case, at least in these
simulations, they happen to be

118
00:07:58,986 --> 00:08:05,106
separated by a difference in chemical
shifts which the author tells us is

119
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:11,261
50 hertz and which elsewhere he calls
delta nu, written like this with a

120
00:08:11,261 --> 00:08:13,192
lower case delta.

121
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,474
So that's the abstract notation for
the difference in chemical shifts

122
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:25,119
or if you prefer, we could say delta nu
is equal to nu zero of side B

123
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:30,289
minus nu zero of side A.

124
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:34,610
Now, what is interesting is that
if we increase the temperature

125
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,607
or increase the interchange rate,
then we see that the lines

126
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:43,061
begin to broaden, and more surprisingly
they tend to move closer together.

127
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:48,263
It turns out that the distance between
this and this broad hump is smaller

128
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:52,083
than the distance between the two
narrow peaks at low temperature.

129
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:56,009
You see they get broadened to the
point we see at most no signal

130
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:00,131
and then they turn up as a single
hump, the two lines are merged

131
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:03,814
together into a single hump, a
phenomenon that we call

132
00:09:03,814 --> 00:09:06,634
coalescence in our trade.

133
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:11,005
And then, more remarkably, the single
line which is initially rather broad,

134
00:09:11,005 --> 00:09:16,145
will become narrower and narrower as
the exchange rate increases,

135
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:20,022
while at the same time, we end up
with an average chemical shift

136
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:26,052
which is simply halfway between the
two chemical shifts of the separate sides.

137
00:09:26,052 --> 00:09:32,072
So, at the low temperature end of
our picture, we see line-broadening

138
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,958
effects which are due to slow exchange.

139
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,613
Before we speak of line-broadening,
we have to define what exactly we

140
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,678
mean by the width of a line.

141
00:09:41,678 --> 00:09:44,934
There are actually several definitions
in the literature but this is the one

142
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,048
that we shall use.

143
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:49,688
First of all, we can see that the height
of the line, just the peak height,

144
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:55,188
and we call that H, and we divide
that in two and we measure the width

145
00:09:55,188 --> 00:10:00,163
in hertz at the half the height
of the line.

146
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:04,959
Now this quantity we call delta nu,
nu is our Greek letter that we use

147
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,913
for frequencies, and it can be shown
that the line width is simply

148
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:16,853
proportional to the exchange rate, k
divided by the factor pi.

149
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:22,347
Since the exchange rate k is nothing
else but the inverse of the lifetime

150
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:27,830
of a particular conformer, or molecular
form, we can substitute that into

151
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,056
this equation, and come to the
conclusion that the line width

152
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:38,076
delta nu is equal to one over pi times
tau, tau being the lifetime.

153
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:45,551
Now, the width can be rationalized in
terms of the lifetime of the states.

154
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:50,479
Remember that a transition in NMR
is always between a ground state

155
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:55,238
and an excited state, but we have at
the beginning of our book discussed

156
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:59,309
these as stationary states that have
an infinite lifetime.

157
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:04,095
In fact, if the molecule doesn't exist
for very long, the states don't exist

158
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:07,305
very long either, and they get blurred.

159
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,571
The shorter the lifetime,
or the faster the exchange,

160
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,516
the more severe the blurring.

161
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:15,632
And you can see on the left hand side
they are only slightly blurred and

162
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,920
therefore the line is fairly narrow,
but in this case the blurring is

163
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,095
quite severe and of course the
differences in energy is also blurred

164
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,995
and therefore the line becomes
very broad.

165
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:29,651
So, this is a hand-waving way of
explaining line-broadening.

166
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:33,811
There are, of course, more satisfactory
ways of explaining the same thing.

167
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:39,306
So, for a two site problem with equal
populations and equal forward and

168
00:11:39,306 --> 00:11:45,136
backward reaction rates, we have the
following three distinct regimes.

169
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:48,986
In the slow exchange regime, we
simply have line-broadening

170
00:11:48,986 --> 00:11:53,162
which is the same for both A and B
resonances, and in both cases

171
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:58,692
is simply proportional to the exchange
rate k, or if you prefer, inversely

172
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:04,577
proportional to the lifetime of either
of these molecules, or conformers.

173
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:08,566
In the fast exchange rate, we have
an entirely different situation.

174
00:12:08,566 --> 00:12:13,216
In this case, the line width here is
inversely proportional

175
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,768
to the exchange rate.

176
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:20,118
That means that the faster the
exchange rate, the narrower the line.

177
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:23,283
Furthermore, there is a very important
parameter here.

178
00:12:23,283 --> 00:12:28,290
This delta nu is the difference in
chemical shifts, so we wrote that

179
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:36,120
as before, zero a minus nu zero b, that's
the difference in chemical shifts.

180
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,116
And as you can see,
it comes here as the square.

181
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,141
Now that's very important because
that means that the residual

182
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:47,567
line width here will be proportional
to the square of the difference

183
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,467
in chemical shifts.

184
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:53,719
And this difference in chemical shifts
is, among other things, proportional

185
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:59,222
to the magnetic field into which we
immerse our sample, or molecule

186
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:03,652
and consequently if we go from say
a 400 megahertz spectrometer

187
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:08,260
to an 800 megahertz spectrometer,
that is to say, if we double the field,

188
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,637
then we also double the difference in
chemical shifts, and we therefore

189
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:18,889
quadruple the square, that is to say
the line width becomes four times broader.

190
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:22,415
This is one reason why chemists and
physical chemists like to have

191
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:26,975
spectrometers of different fields 
in the laboratory.

192
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:30,798
You can also convert this equation by
saying that the line width here,

193
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:33,536
apart from the square of the
difference in chemical shifts

194
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:38,016
is directly proportional to the
lifetime of the states.

195
00:13:38,016 --> 00:13:42,271
And then we mentioned that halfway
between the two there is a critical

196
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,311
condition called coalescence.

197
00:13:44,312 --> 00:13:48,725
In fact, that's the precise point
where the three extrema of these

198
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:52,864
funny curves merge into a single
extremum, a single maximum,

199
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:57,914
and it turns out that that occurs
when the exchange rate is precisely

200
00:13:57,914 --> 00:14:02,433
2.2 times the difference in
chemical shifts.

201
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:06,336
Now this equation is of limited use
to us because in that vicinity

202
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:11,090
of coalescence the lines are often
so broad that you can barely see them,

203
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:15,780
let alone decide whether they
have been merged or not quite yet.

204
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,491
We have just discussed chemical
exchange between two sides that have

205
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:24,659
equal populations because
they have equal energies.

206
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,442
But the discussion can be broadened
to encompass the more general case

207
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:32,035
where the populations are unequal.

208
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:37,515
So here we have a case where we have
on the one hand the same, an O residue.

209
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:40,265
We have the same methyl group, but
here we have replaced one of the

210
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:47,085
methyl groups by a benzyl group which
is CH2 attached to a phenyl ring.

211
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:51,563
And so these are clearly unequal and
therefore you would expect the molecule

212
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:55,992
to have different energies depending
on whether the oxygen is pointing

213
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:59,409
on the same side as the methyl or
on the opposite side.

214
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:04,566
And indeed, the energies are quite
different between these two forms

215
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:08,050
and therefore the populations are
going to be different so there will

216
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,900
be more molecules in this lower
energy state than in the

217
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,109
upper energy state.

218
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:19,003
We can also say that the likelihood
that we move from left to right

219
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:25,023
is faster, the exchange rate is higher
than the other way around.

220
00:15:25,023 --> 00:15:30,548
So this situation now means that k AB
is different from kB.

221
00:15:30,548 --> 00:15:33,931
This will have some consequences on
the spectra.

222
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:39,967
So, when the populations are unequal,
this has, as you might expect, dramatic

223
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:43,827
consequences on the exchanging spectra.

224
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:49,786
So here we have a case where the minor
isomer A has about half the concentration

225
00:15:49,786 --> 00:15:55,426
of the major isomer B, but they still
have distinct chemical shifts.

226
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:59,773
In this case, the simulations refer
to a difference of 50 hertz

227
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:02,838
so this is again the delta delta,

228
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:09,508
which is nu zero A minus nu zero B

229
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:16,719
and as you can see, when the exchange
process begins to be felt, then the

230
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:23,599
minor isomer broadens actually more
or faster than the major isomer.

231
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:29,006
Furthermore, they tend to coalesce
and then narrow as in the case before,

232
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:33,798
but the narrowed line is not positioned
halfway between the two chemical shifts,

233
00:16:33,798 --> 00:16:37,558
but displaced towards the
major isomer.

234
00:16:37,558 --> 00:16:42,811
In fact, the rule is very simple, the
average chemical shift is a weighted

235
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:46,779
linear combination, or a weighted
average between the two

236
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:51,659
chemical shifts with a population of
the minor isomer and the population

237
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,260
of the major isomer which are applied
as weights to these two chemical shifts.

238
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,950
Remember that the sum of the two
populations is defined to be one,

239
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,448
because these are
probabilities of occupation.

240
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:09,136
As you can also imagine, if the major
isomer becomes very dominant,

241
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:14,920
the minor isomer becomes negligible
and the average line will be essentially

242
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,938
indistinguishable with the position
of the major isomer and that becomes

243
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:25,528
therefore difficult to determine
the exchange effects.

244
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:28,749
It turns out that this picture is 
quite a modern picture.

245
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:32,199
I guess it was first drawn in the '50s
but there has been recent work

246
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:37,309
going on in proteins where one can
now distinguish the dominant major

247
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:41,571
conformation of a protein, and a
minor conformation which might

248
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:46,516
be activated perhaps the conformation
that allows the protein to work

249
00:17:46,516 --> 00:17:51,486
as an enzyme or having fruitful
interaction with its substrate.

250
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:55,828
This kind of argument is now used,
not only for protons but also for

251
00:17:55,828 --> 00:17:59,208
nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 and proteins.

252
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:05,383
And turns out to be a very powerful way
to identify mobility of macromolecules.

253
00:18:06,832 --> 00:18:12,513
Now, if the populations are unequal, 
unequal as opposed to the equal case

254
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:16,031
we treated before, then as I said,
there are two different

255
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,771
line-broadening effects.

256
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:22,735
The line width of side A becomes 
inversely proportional to the

257
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:27,807
lifetime of A and the lifetime of
side B is inversely proportional

258
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,087
to the lifetime of side B.

259
00:18:30,087 --> 00:18:33,528
If side B is dominant, then its lifetime
will be longer and therefore

260
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,925
it's narrower, its line width smaller.

261
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:40,365
If this is a minor conformer, then
tau A will be short and therefore

262
00:18:40,365 --> 00:18:43,184
its width larger.

263
00:18:43,184 --> 00:18:47,410
Furthermore, we have this average
population which as I said, is weighted

264
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,941
by the populations and this is a
somewhat more scary equation

265
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:57,428
where we have the residual line width
in the high temperature limit

266
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,668
in the fast exchange limit.

267
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:04,056
And here we see that, much like in
the case of a symmetrical exchange

268
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:09,100
it is still proportional to the square
of the difference in chemical shifts

269
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,708
and therefore, if we double the field,
this delta nu parameter will be

270
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,448
multiplied by a factor of four,
like before.

271
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:20,311
Furthermore, we see that we have pA
and pB, these are the populations

272
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:23,266
and the sum of the
two exchange rates,

273
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,046
the forward and the
backward exchange rate.

274
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:31,455
Of course, this should converge with
a simple equation if we take pA

275
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,765
and pB to be one half each.

276
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:40,756
To summarize the first part of
chapter 4, we have discussed

277
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:45,958
the pictures that serve as front
cover for Peter Hore's book,

278
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:49,977
and we have discussed the fact that
if there are two isomers

279
00:19:49,977 --> 00:19:54,357
with two molecular forms, or two
partners in a chemical reaction that have

280
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:59,511
different chemical shifts, then these
lines will be broadened by the

281
00:19:59,511 --> 00:20:05,469
chemical exchange and the broadening
can go as far as coalescence and beyond

282
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:11,268
into a line narrowing at an average
position and in line widths of these

283
00:20:11,268 --> 00:20:16,048
different spectra can be used to
extract the chemical exchange rates,

284
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,530
which are, of course, of great interest
to chemists and physical chemists alike.
