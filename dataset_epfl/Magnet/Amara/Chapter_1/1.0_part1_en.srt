00:00:05,883 --> 00:00:11,454
Welcome to our massively online 
open course or MOOC

2
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:15,270
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,626
As we shall see, magnetic resonance
offers a unique way of characterizing

4
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:25,480
matter in all sorts of forms
ranging from solid materials

5
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,813
like medicinal pills or catalysts
for the petroleum industry

6
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:34,346
to solutions of proteins,
suspensions of living cells

7
00:00:34,346 --> 00:00:39,001
or indeed entire organisms,
such as living laboratory animals

8
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:41,732
and of course human beings.

9
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:44,931
MRI or magnetic resonance imaging
as it should be called

10
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:48,289
is perhaps the best known
to the general public

11
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,816
of the many, many applications
of magnetic resonance.

12
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:57,345
MOOC sounds like book,
indeed the two words rhyme,

13
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:59,885
and surely that's not by accident.

14
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:03,775
Now in our particular MOOC,
we have decided to base it

15
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:05,667
on a physical book.

16
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:11,774
The book that we recommend is a short 
introductory text by Peter Hore,

17
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:14,170
lecturer at Oxford University.

18
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:20,059
I have used this book for third and fourth
year students at the École Polytechnique

19
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,601
Fédérale de Lausanne.

20
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:26,319
And for first- and second-year students
at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.

21
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:30,584
Also at the Université Pierre
et Marie Curie.

22
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:35,127
We vividly recommend to all students 
who wish to participate in this MOOC

23
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:40,417
that they actually buy Peter's book,
preferably from an old-fashioned bookstore

24
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:45,690
It should cost you no more than 20 euros
or equivalent in your currency.

25
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,275
It is not our intention to read 
the full text of Peter Hore's book

26
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:55,640
sentence by sentence, for that
would be immensely boring.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,068
To avoid this temptation we shall focus
on the figures drawn

28
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:02,474
from Peter Hore's book
and discuss them one by one.

29
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:08,113
We shall use these pictures as a means
to support our explanations.

30
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:14,404
We are aware of course that most students
who start a MOOC do not necessarily

31
00:02:14,442 --> 00:02:16,293
continue to the bitter end.

32
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:20,534
In France, the percentage of dropouts 
is estimated to be 80 percent;

33
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:24,325
in the United States, perhaps as high
as 90 percent,

34
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:28,489
but how many students actually read 
an old-fashioned book all the way

35
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:29,983
from cover to cover?

36
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,139
Probably not very many.

37
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:39,654
In French a MOOC is also called a CLOM,
<i>a cours en ligne ouvert et massif.</i>

38
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:44,816
But the word CLOM reminds me mostly
of clumsy, so we shall stick to English

39
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:46,468
most of the time.

40
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,997
Let's now get on with it.

41
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:53,403
So this MOOC, 
basic steps in magnetic resonance,

42
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:57,584
will be largely based on this
little book here that Peter Hore

43
00:02:57,584 --> 00:03:02,401
wrote some years ago
and published at Oxford University Press

44
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:06,053
in a particular series 
called Oxford Chemistry Primers.

45
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,549
In fact, there are many issues;
this one is number 32,

46
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,612
and you can find that
from your local bookshop.

47
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:15,174
Don't forget to tell them that
there is a new edition that will

48
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:17,255
come out in 2015.

49
00:03:18,661 --> 00:03:23,461
The lectures that I will be giving here
are actually based on the galley proofs

50
00:03:23,461 --> 00:03:28,181
of the book that has not yet appeared,
so those of you who listen to this

51
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:31,134
will listen to a book 
that does not yet exist.

52
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:37,356
As you can see from the table of contents,
the introduction starts talking about

53
00:03:37,356 --> 00:03:41,782
nuclear magnetism, which is a property 
of all nuclei that is essential,

54
00:03:41,782 --> 00:03:43,833
otherwise NMR would be impossible.

55
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:48,197
Then moves to the chemical shifts,
and it turns out that chemical shifts

56
00:03:48,197 --> 00:03:53,340
are due to the fact that the nuclei
are partly shielded from their environment

57
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,526
by the cloud of electrons that is moving
about the nuclei.

58
00:03:58,526 --> 00:04:03,556
We shall speak about spin-spin couplings,
which as you may know are responsible

59
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:04,684
for multiplets in NMR spectra.

60
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:07,572
And, perhaps, the most important chapter

61
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:10,177
in this book, because it's also referred

62
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:14,217
to on the title page is Chemical Exchange.

63
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:18,376
And it turns out that we can discuss 
two side exchange in some detail

64
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:23,321
and follow this up with a great wealth 
of very interesting examples.

65
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,312
Chapter five is dedicated to relaxation.

66
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:30,451
Relaxation is essentially the return
of the nuclear magnetization

67
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,669
to its equilibrium position.

68
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,908
And the speed or rate at which the spins
return to their equilibrium varies

69
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,992
a great deal from one case to another.

70
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:43,860
And it turns out that in most cases
this is due to rotational motion

71
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,017
in liquids known as rotational diffusion
of molecules.

72
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:51,777
It is that motion that drives relaxation.

73
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:56,785
And one of the important manifestations
is the nuclear overhauser effect

74
00:04:56,785 --> 00:05:01,609
because that will allow us to determine
structures of macromolecules,

75
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:06,016
such as proteins 
and nucleic acids in solution.

76
00:05:06,295 --> 00:05:10,298
But there are many other examples
of relaxation studies that allow you

77
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:14,487
either to determine structures
or to characterize internal dynamics

78
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:15,959
of molecules.

79
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:19,597
And the final chapter
is about NMR experiments,

80
00:05:19,597 --> 00:05:22,482
actually this is closest
to my own specialty.

81
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:26,963
Apart from the principles of experiments
there's a long discussion

82
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:31,318
of the vector model,
which is a way of representing the nuclear

83
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:37,675
magnetization and see how this 
magnetization evolves when we perturb it

84
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:42,261
and apply various perturbations
and excitations.

85
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,980
There's a chapter on
the measurement of relaxation times,

86
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,234
on the enhancement of insensitive nuclei
by polarization transfer,

87
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:54,712
on two-dimensional NMR 
and even a brief chapter

88
00:05:54,712 --> 00:05:56,510
on three-dimensional NMR.

89
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,601
So we shall proceed from here.

90
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:05,122
Now as you can see from the preface 
of the first edition,

91
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:10,208
this book was written some years ago,
and in fact, when I was using it

92
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:14,397
for my lectures at times I thought,
"well, it's about time to update it."

93
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:20,293
And, indeed, Peter Hore has taken 
an independent decision to do that.

94
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:26,183
But before we go to the update,
let me briefly see in this introduction,

95
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:31,526
Keith McLaughlin was a lecturer
at Oxford University and indeed

96
00:06:31,526 --> 00:06:34,728
the PhD advisor of Peter Hore.

97
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:40,298
Now this is relevant because Keith 
is a specialist of EPR spectroscopy,

98
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:44,494
electron paramagnetic resonance,
which is in a way the electron counterpart

99
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:46,603
of nuclear magnetic resonance.

100
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:50,573
And, indeed, Peter Hore still belongs
to a school of thought

101
00:06:50,573 --> 00:06:54,277
that is more concerned with electrons
than with nuclei,

102
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:55,663
and as a result,

103
00:06:55,663 --> 00:06:56,930
when he started writing

104
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,867
his book on nuclear magnetic resonance,

105
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:02,240
he really had to do a lot of homework
to understand how that works.

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,934
And it's precisely because of that effort
that this book is so interesting.

107
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,322
Then there is a second 
name here, Rob Kaptein.

108
00:07:09,322 --> 00:07:13,870
Rob Kaptein is the biomolecular 
NMR spectroscopist

109
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,974
at the University of Utrecht,
and Peter Hore spent some time with him

110
00:07:18,974 --> 00:07:22,285
as a postdoc and this is where 
he got his strong impact,

111
00:07:22,285 --> 00:07:26,600
strong impression of biomolecular
applications of modern NMR.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,717
And the third person he mentions here
is Ray Freeman, also a lecturer

113
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:36,608
at Oxford University in those days,
now emeritus professor at Cambridge.

114
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:40,811
And Ray Freeman not only lectured
to Peter Hore but also to myself

115
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,470
since he was my PhD advisor.

116
00:07:43,694 --> 00:07:48,827
Now the second edition, you will read,
as you might expect, a revision.

117
00:07:48,827 --> 00:07:50,842
Actually it's quite thorough.

118
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:55,133
There are not just errors and inaccuracies
that have been removed,

119
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:59,664
but there have been entire chapters
rewritten extensively.

120
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:04,488
You will notice that Peter Hore
has consulted some of his

121
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:08,120
most faithful readers, 
one of them is myself.

122
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,438
But to be honest, I have only 
pointed out a few errors in sines

123
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:16,488
and things like that,
whereas the person who really carries

124
00:08:16,488 --> 00:08:23,090
the important name is Gareth Morris,
now a professor in Manchester,

125
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,939
who many years ago by the way
was a fellow PhD student

126
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,921
in the laboratory of Ray Freeman
at Oxford and he clearly put a lot

127
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:37,056
of effort into rewriting and suggesting 
to Peter Hore how to improve this book.

128
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,389
Now the book that we recommend
for this MOOC is of course not

129
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,075
the only good book on magnetic resonance.

130
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:48,736
First of all, there is a second volume
which is sometimes called

131
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:54,066
<i>NMR, Peter Hore, Volume Two,</i>
but in fact is called <i>The Toolkit,</i>

132
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:58,379
and it has three authors:
Peter Hore, the same, Jeremy Jones

133
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:00,039
and Steve Wimperis.

134
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,193
Jones is a physicist.

135
00:09:01,193 --> 00:09:07,373
Wimperis is now a professor in Glascow,
and he is an expert of liquid

136
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:09,189
and solid state NMR.

137
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:14,409
This book <i>The Toolkit</i>
is number 92 in the Oxford Chemistry

138
00:09:14,409 --> 00:09:16,010
Primers series.

139
00:09:16,663 --> 00:09:20,354
It also has a second edition that should
come out in 2015,

140
00:09:20,354 --> 00:09:24,436
and maybe at one point I will be doing
another MOOC based on that book

141
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:27,867
because I've also used that book
extensively for undrgraduate

142
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,797
and graduate lecures.

143
00:09:30,385 --> 00:09:32,735
But these books are very thin.

144
00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:34,737
They're only something like 100 pages.

145
00:09:34,737 --> 00:09:38,279
There are more substantial works
and this is a beautiful book,

146
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,108
<i>Understanding NMR Spectroscopy</i>
written by James Keeler,

147
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:47,379
another of Ray Freeman's former students,
now a lecturer at Cambridge University.

148
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:53,560
This contains more basic experimental 
methods for one-dimensional

149
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,645
and two-dimensional NMR 
and importantly contains

150
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,450
extensive exercises.

151
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:06,553
This book has recently been translated 
in 2015 by Pascal Miéville

152
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:10,910
from English into French
and I can vividly recommend this book.

153
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,510
This is undoubtedly the best,
in fact the only modern book

154
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,801
on NMR in French.

155
00:10:17,801 --> 00:10:19,459
There are other famous books.

156
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,647
This one, for example,
is called <i>Spin Choreography</i>,

157
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:27,447
beautiful title because Ray Freeman
used to enjoy inventing ways

158
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:31,335
to make the spins dance together
or not together,

159
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:36,056
and he invented this expression
of basic steps in high resolution NMR

160
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,592
and the basic steps,
as you may have noticed,

161
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:42,858
are also in the title of our MOOC,
and, indeed, Ray Freeman has given me

162
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:45,826
permission for using
those basic steps again.

163
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:49,979
This is, again, a very substantial book,
written by Malcolm Levitt,

164
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:53,676
perhaps one of the most creative
NMR spectroscopists in the world right now

165
00:10:53,676 --> 00:10:59,577
He wrote this book on liquid state NMR,
although at that time, his real emphasis

166
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:02,545
in the laboratory was on solid state NMR.

167
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:05,884
So we again have a case where
someone steps somewhat outside

168
00:11:05,884 --> 00:11:11,777
of his preferred field of interest
and writes a very beautiful textbook.

169
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:16,912
Let's come now back 
to Peter Hore's first volume.

170
00:11:16,912 --> 00:11:19,655
So this is simply called 
<i>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</i>,

171
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:24,249
and as you can see, the key parts of it
are angular momentum, nuclear magnetism

172
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:27,025
and NMR spectroscopy.

173
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:36,260
If we consider some nuclei which have
a spin quantum number equal to ½,

174
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:41,601
and the best examples are 
an isolated proton, an isolated carbon 13

175
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:46,251
an isolated nitrogen 15, 
an isolated phosphorous 31

176
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:47,940
and many others.

177
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,200
Well, then there will be
just two quantum levels

178
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,628
that are accessible.

179
00:11:53,628 --> 00:11:56,693
The spins are either parallel
with the magnetic fields.

180
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,680
In fact, there will be many spins
that are parallel.

181
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,591
But there will also be a few spins
that are anti-parallel.

182
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:08,248
The spins in the ground state
are often referred to as

183
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:10,697
spins in state alpha,
or more properly they have

184
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:15,763
a magnetic quantum number
equal to <i>m = + ½</i>

185
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:20,045
The spins in the excited state
are said to be in the beta state

186
00:12:20,045 --> 00:12:23,650
or more properly with a magnetic
quantum number - ½.

187
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:29,058
In most areas of spectroscopy,
such for example invisible spectroscopy

188
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:33,179
or UV spectroscopy,
the splitting <i>ΔE</i> is so large,

189
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,076
that all molecules are in the ground state

190
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:39,211
In NMR that is not so
because the splitting is very small

191
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:42,057
compared to the thermal noise 
in the environment.

192
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:47,290
Therefore we have to worry about 
the populations in the upper state

193
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,443
and more specifically,
about the difference between

194
00:12:50,443 --> 00:12:53,091
the upper and lower states
because if the populations

195
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:57,330
were equal we would speak of
a demagnetized system

196
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,146
or a saturated system,
and it would be impossible to observe NMR.

197
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:07,022
The observation of NMR is conditional to 
there being a difference in populations.

198
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,906
Now it turns out that the populations--
the ratio of the populations--

199
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:15,522
between the beta and alpha states
is determined by Boltzmann's law.

200
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:19,436
So this is an exponential function,
<i>ΔE</i> is the difference in energy,

201
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:23,072
<i>kB</i> is Boltzmann's constant,
and <i>T</i> is the temperature,

202
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:26,216
more specifically the temperature
of the spins which can be

203
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:29,141
distinct from the temperature 
of the sample.

204
00:13:29,402 --> 00:13:31,933
Now because the argument
is a very small number,

205
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:40,435
we can replace this exponential function
by a simple <i>ΔE</i> over <i>kB</i> of <i>T</i>,

206
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:43,962
and we can neglect higher terms
such as this one here,

207
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:50,865
which would read <i>ΔE</i> square
divided by <i>kBT</i> square.

208
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:54,659
So we can neglect this term.

209
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:57,753
This letter simplification 
actually has a name.

210
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:02,103
It is known as high temperature
approximation.

211
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:06,501
Now this deserves to be set
in quotation marks

212
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,753
because it turns out to be okay.

213
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:12,188
This approximation is okay
as long as the temperature

214
00:14:12,188 --> 00:14:16,077
is about, say, one kelvin,
so that's very, very cold indeed.

215
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:20,145
But technically speaking, 
the approximation can be made

216
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:23,569
because the denominator here
is much larger than the numerator,

217
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:27,736
and that is because the temperature
is technically speaking high.

218
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:32,158
Now if that is the case,
then we can express the polarization,

219
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:36,623
so this quantity here, this <i>p</i>
if nothing else is the polarization.

220
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:40,744
That is at least the way we use 
this word in our laboratory,

221
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:43,936
not universally recognized by everybody.

222
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:47,435
This polarization then is defined
as the difference in populations

223
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:51,830
between <i>nɑ</i> and <i>- nβ</i>
--so you know that the ground state

224
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,193
has normally higher population
than the excited state,

225
00:14:56,193 --> 00:15:00,034
hence this definition--
divided by the sum of the populations,

226
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,094
which is usually one
if we define the "n"s to be

227
00:15:03,094 --> 00:15:04,379
simple fractions.

228
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:07,862
And because of this high temperature
approximation, the polarization

229
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:16,653
is directly proportional to the difference
in energies and divided by <i>kB</i> times <i>T</i>,

230
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:21,113
that is to say Boltzmann's constant
not divide by the actual spin temperature.

231
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:28,398
So nuclei at the heart
of atoms and molecules have a mass.

232
00:15:28,647 --> 00:15:31,563
They have a positive charge,
as you know.

233
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:35,624
They also have a rather 
peculiar property called spin.

234
00:15:36,581 --> 00:15:40,292
Initially, in the early days, 
that is to say in the 1920s

235
00:15:40,292 --> 00:15:44,857
when spin was first discovered,
it was believed that it was sufficient

236
00:15:44,857 --> 00:15:50,551
for a nucleus to rotate about an axis
and a charged particle about an axis

237
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:54,378
if it rotates will generate
a magnetization,

238
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:58,342
and that was believed to be the origin
of nuclear magnetization.

239
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,883
It turns out to be
more complicated than that.

240
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:05,953
For example, it is not sufficient 
to have a large charge in order to

241
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:07,807
have a high magnetization.

242
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:12,318
On the contrary, it's the smaller nuclei,
such as tritium and protons that have

243
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:16,151
high magnetic moments,
whereas heavy nuclei have small

244
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:17,592
magnetic moments.

245
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,112
Also, many nuclei have charge,
such as carbon 12 or oxygen 16

246
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,587
but have no spin at all.

247
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:28,658
So the relationship is not so simple,
and it turns out that we really should

248
00:16:28,658 --> 00:16:33,910
think of spin as an independent 
property in addition to mass and charge.

249
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:40,268
So spins come in different forms,
but many of the most popular ones,

250
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:45,913
from our point of view have a spin quantum
number, which we call <i>I</i>,

251
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:47,612
equal to ½.

252
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:52,636
This is the case for protons 
and for carbon 13 and for many others.

253
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:57,031
And it turns out that if that is the case,
their magnetic quantum numbers

254
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:01,772
can only have two values,
namely <i>m = + ½</i>

255
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,646
or <i>m = - ½</i>.

256
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:08,052
And in a magnetic field,
if the sample is immersed

257
00:17:08,052 --> 00:17:12,919
in a magnetic field, there is a splitting
between these two levels

258
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,109
called the Zeeman splitting.

259
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,234
And this Zeeman splitting
as it turns out is proprtional

260
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,451
to the magnetic field that we apply.

261
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:26,253
So if horizontally we draw <i>B</i> zero,
does the intensity of the external

262
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,158
magnetic field, the static magnetic field.

263
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:33,231
If this <i>B</i> zero were nil,
than the two levels would be

264
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:39,557
exactly degenerate and as the <i>B</i> zero
increases, the difference in energy

265
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:41,274
also increases.

266
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:47,373
It turns out that the slope here
is determined by a parameter called gamma.

267
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:51,728
The gyromagnetic ratio that we shall 
speak about further,

268
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:56,858
which is a property that is distinct
for protons, carbons and all the others.

269
00:17:57,718 --> 00:18:02,930
Now, the test turned out very early on
that there was some remarkable

270
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,411
observations.

271
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,250
This one is interesting from my 
point of view.

272
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:13,224
Arnold, Dharmatti and Packard
were all working with Felix Bloch

273
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:19,134
when Felix Bloch was appointed the first
director general of CERN in Geneva.

274
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,539
He didn't last very long
because he did not like administration

275
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:28,961
and decided to return to his professorship
at Stanford Universty.

276
00:18:28,961 --> 00:18:31,286
And this paper was actually
written at Stanford,

277
00:18:31,286 --> 00:18:35,438
but it's a very important paper,
and also it was written in the year

278
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,835
that I was born.

279
00:18:36,835 --> 00:18:41,538
So what you see here is actually
a proton spectrum of ethanol.

280
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:46,097
Now ethanol is a very popular molecule
in Lausanne and the environment

281
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:50,203
because this is a wine-growing area,
and therefore, it's not surprising

282
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:52,646
that they looked 
at the spectrum of ethanol.

283
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,095
And what do we see?

284
00:18:54,095 --> 00:18:58,249
Well, we see distinct resonances
for the hydroxy proton,

285
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,965
for the CH2 protons and the CH3 protons,

286
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:04,184
and they're in fact displaced
because they have different

287
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,822
chemical shifts.

288
00:19:05,822 --> 00:19:08,524
Also as you can see,
the areas are different.

289
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:13,240
In fact, the areas under these three peaks
are roughly one to two to three

290
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:16,820
and allow one to decide 
that there is only one of these protons,

291
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,111
two of this and three
of the methyl protons.

292
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,665
So that's a very important discovery.

293
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,908
You note that these lines
are rather broad,

294
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:27,920
and that is because scaler couplings
could not yet be resolved

295
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,429
in those days.

296
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:33,178
So this concludes Part One
of this chapter.

297
00:19:33,178 --> 00:19:35,265
Thank-you for your attention.
