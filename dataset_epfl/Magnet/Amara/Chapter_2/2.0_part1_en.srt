00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,659
Welcome to the second chapter of our MOOC,

2
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:13,248
Massively Online Open Course,
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:17,258
Today’s chapter will be called
chemical shifts.

4
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,999
So chemical shifts are indeed
at the heart of magnetic resonance.

5
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,987
More specifically, they are essential

6
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,548
for most applications
of magnetic resonance

7
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,838
to chemistry and to biology.

8
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,222
In physics, they are perhaps
less important,

9
00:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,762
although that can be argued.

10
00:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,534
In fact, the origin of this effect

11
00:00:38,543 --> 00:00:42,673
is what is known in good
English as serendipity

12
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:45,204
and in bad English, sheer luck.

13
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,425
It was, in fact, discovered by mistake

14
00:00:47,898 --> 00:00:50,618
and against the wishes of the inventors,

15
00:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,333
that is Proctor and Wu,

16
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,413
who in the late 40s or early 50s,

17
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:01,253
wanted to measure the
gyromagnetic ratio of nitrogen.

18
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,273
More specifically, Nitrogen 14,

19
00:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,683
which is a dominate isotope of nitrogen,

20
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,514
And to do so, they decided to take
a material that would be full of nitrogen

21
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:14,033
and their choice turned
to ammonium nitrate

22
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,185
which indeed has lots of nitrogen.

23
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,263
And to their distaste, they found,

24
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,618
once they'd identified
the nitrogen resonance,

25
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:25,774
they found that there were
in fact two peaks and not one.

26
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,657
Now we know that one of these
nitrogen peaks

27
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,667
come from the ammonium group
and the other one

28
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,068
from the nitrate group.

29
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,758
But they didn't want that.

30
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:35,028
They wanted just one peak

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,868
and they wanted to measure the Gamma--

32
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,711
the gyromagnetic ratio.

33
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:41,651
The frequency of precession,
the transition frequency

34
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,371
in the absence of environment.

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,032
To them, the environment
was just a nuisance.

36
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,742
So nitrate, ammonium,
that was not their business.

37
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,302
They were not chemists.

38
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,682
And they wrote a paper.

39
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,772
They submitted a paper
where they mentioned this effect

40
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,802
as a dirt effect.

41
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,279
The editor then said, "Dirt effect is not
a very scholarly expression.

42
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:05,933
Would you please propose
another expression?"

43
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,863
And they said, "Well, let's call it
a chemical shift."

44
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,483
And it has been
a chemical shift ever since.

45
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,427
By the way, when I tell you
anecdotes like this,

46
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,589
I'm not too sure that they are genuine,

47
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:20,039
that they can be trusted.

48
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,979
Maybe the story was just made up
by somebody else.

49
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,599
But, you know, 
“Se non è vero, è ben trovato.”

50
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,228
"If it isn't true, at least
it's a nice story."

51
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:33,068
You can find many of such stories
in the books of [Aberg Am],

52
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:37,463
of Casimir, of many other scientists
who have enjoyed themselves

53
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,763
writing up their autobiographies

54
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:43,875
and talking about the
fun aspects of research.

55
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,199
We shall now discuss the second
chapter of the book by Peter Hore,

56
00:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,769
which is dedicated to chemical shifts.

57
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:58,163
So chemical shifts can be discussed
in a purely empirical fashion

58
00:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,108
as a phenomenon that can be observed

59
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,902
without necessarily trying to explain it.

60
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,389
This, in fact, is a very important
approach in chemistry and in biology.

61
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,919
Of course, scientists
like to explain things.

62
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,759
And so they have thought about
the origin of chemical shifts

63
00:03:15,164 --> 00:03:18,114
and they have tried to split
these chemical shifts

64
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,834
into different contributions.

65
00:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,604
And this is known as contribution
to nuclear shielding.

66
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:26,234
In fact, nuclear shielding
is another word for chemical shifts.

67
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:29,865
We’ll have a summary after that
and then some exercises.

68
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,846
Perhaps the simplest explanation
of nuclear shielding

69
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:39,386
and chemical shifts is if we consider
the example of simple gases,

70
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:44,692
noble gases which are basically
mono-atomic molecules

71
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:46,356
such as helium.

72
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,126
In fact, the isotope 3 of Helium

73
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:54,178
happens to have a spin <i>I = ½</i>.

74
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,307
This is a guess, of course.

75
00:03:56,455 --> 00:04:00,455
It can be hyper-polarized
as we shall discuss later.

76
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:05,262
It can actually be used to do
images of human lungs.

77
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:09,543
Likewise, we could also consider 129 Zenon

78
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:13,975
which also has a spin ½ and also is used

79
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:18,565
for imaging of lungs of living humans.

80
00:04:19,244 --> 00:04:23,894
Now, both have a spherical symmetry
and both have a simple nucleus

81
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,185
at the center and a cloud of electrons.

82
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:29,325
Of course, these electrons
move all over the place,

83
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:34,005
but there is a slight preference
for them to move in a plane

84
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:37,945
which is perpendicular to
the external magnetic field.

85
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:42,042
So this field <i>B0</i> here,
is the external magnetic field

86
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:47,734
which is applied to the sample
by the experimentalist

87
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:51,734
usually generated by a large
superconducting magnet

88
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,192
to achieve a sufficiently intense field.

89
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Now it turns out that
this external magnetic field

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
affects the electrons in such a way
that there will be a slight preference

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,470
for the electrons to move around
such a trajectory

92
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,580
which is perpendicular to the field
and where the electrons

93
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:13,254
move in such a way, that
the field that they induce

94
00:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,124
which is this B prime here--

95
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:19,557
this B prime, B prime,
is the induced field--

96
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,895
the field induced by
the circulating electrons.

97
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:28,085
And according to the law of Lenz,
this induced field

98
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,135
has a sign opposite to the external field.

99
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:36,854
The net effect is that the local field,
which is sometimes just called--

100
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,010
this is the local field
at the site of the nucleus--

101
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,329
is proportional to the external field,

102
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:49,023
but there is an attenuation factor here
which is written as <i>1 – σ</i>.

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,270
If sigma is zero, which it
often is in simple cases,

104
00:05:55,713 --> 00:05:59,443
then the local field is equal to
the external field

105
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,893
and there’s no problem.

106
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,434
But in many molecules,
the sigma has different values

107
00:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,284
depending on the environment,

108
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,554
the chemical environment of the nucleus.

109
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,567
The same thing can be expressed
not in terms of field

110
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,777
but in terms of the NMR frequency.

111
00:06:15,777 --> 00:06:19,077
So this the precession frequency
of the transversed magnetization

112
00:06:19,537 --> 00:06:22,407
or also simply the energy
of the transition between

113
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,457
the bottom state and the excited state.

114
00:06:24,457 --> 00:06:28,197
And we can see that this is proportional
to the gyromagnetic ratio,

115
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,330
proportional to the external field
attenuated by the circulated electrons

116
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,988
and this attenuation is again
expressed as <i>1 – σ</i>.

117
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:43,256
We can also look at the same thing
in terms of energy levels

118
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:47,339
where we see that the bare nucleus
has a transition frequency

119
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,849
which is determined only by
the applied magnetic field.

120
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:56,301
But as soon as the nucleus
sits in an electron cloud,

121
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,971
it is partly protected
from the external field.

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,310
And therefore we have
this shielding parameter,

123
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,580
the nuclear shielding expressed by
this attenuation factor here

124
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,690
which precisely comes from
the circulating electrons.

125
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,236
And as you can see, the splitting
between the bottom

126
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,736
and the top level is reduced
because of that.

127
00:07:16,886 --> 00:07:21,936
Now, chemical shifts, as I mentioned
in my introductory remarks,

128
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,804
could be observed in many cases.

129
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:30,034
The one that I mentioned was
14 Nitrogen in an ammonium group

130
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:34,714
and 14 Nitrogen in a nitrate group.

131
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:39,334
And as I said, the physicists
who used this material

132
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,024
were very disappointed to discover
that these two nitrogens

133
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,144
had different chemical shifts,
as we now call them,

134
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:47,624
or different environments.

135
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,594
But for the chemists,
that of course, is wonderful

136
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,174
because that allows us
to distinguish them.

137
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:56,944
Now this is a typical NMR spectrum
and you could imagine

138
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,352
that this is the B and this is the A.

139
00:07:59,506 --> 00:08:02,786
Or it could be any other molecule
that has two distinct

140
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,226
resonance frequencies.

141
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:10,606
In fact, a more popular, a more common
case would be a proton NMR.

142
00:08:10,663 --> 00:08:15,503
A proton NMR is by far the dominant
version of magnetic resonance

143
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:19,283
today in organic labs
and particularly in chemistry.

144
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:22,183
And in proton NMR
we have a range of roughly

145
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,633
eight to ten ppm.

146
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:28,641
So this is the range of chemical shifts
expressed in the parameter delta.

147
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:34,296
And we see that if we have some protons
in different environments,

148
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:38,622
in different solvents,
for example this is benzene--

149
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:42,143
and this is--
well, different environments.

150
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:47,817
Tetramethylsilane is by definition
used so that the origin

151
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:54,318
of the scale is adjusted to be zero
at the frequency of tms.

152
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,529
Now this delta scale here
is defined more properly here.

153
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:02,678
It is simply the frequency
of the transition

154
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,567
minus a reference frequency.

155
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,227
So this would be for example
the frequency of Benzine

156
00:09:08,468 --> 00:09:13,258
minus the frequency of tms
divided by the frequency of the tms.

157
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:17,675
So typically this might be 400MHz
and something minus 4

158
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,505
to 100 MHz a bit below.

159
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,848
Anyway, the reference frequency
and the ratio, of course,

160
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,148
is dimensionless.

161
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:30,098
It turns out that this dimensionless
number tends to be rather small,

162
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,599
on the order of 10 to the -6.

163
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,509
And, therefore, it is usually
by convention

164
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,219
multiplied by 10 to the 6
in order to get reasonable numbers.

165
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:42,078
And this gives you
the definition of delta,

166
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,578
known as the chemical shift to chemists.

167
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,568
And as you can see,
it is a dimensionless number.

168
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:53,668
But it is usually specified
that it is expressed in ppm to clarify.

169
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,908
I should warn you that
in much of the physics literature,

170
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,962
this convention is not the same.

171
00:09:58,962 --> 00:10:01,872
They often use the parameter sigma,

172
00:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,552
the nuclear shielding parameter

173
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,202
and not the parameter delta
defined as in this expression.

174
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,798
So what is true for
the precession frequencies

175
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,228
is also true for the
shielding parameters.

176
00:10:14,228 --> 00:10:17,098
And you can reformulate this equation

177
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,098
by saying that this is now
the sigma of the reference

178
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,913
minus the sigma of the
substance of interest.

179
00:10:23,913 --> 00:10:27,773
And you will notice that this
runs in the opposite direction.

180
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,048
The delta runs in the opposite direction

181
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,134
as the scale of the shielding
parameters, which gave rise

182
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,524
to a great deal of confusion
between the literature of the chemists

183
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,494
and the literature of the physicists.

184
00:10:39,988 --> 00:10:45,028
Now, chemical shifts are very often
considered as empirical parameters

185
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,565
without any attempt to explain them.

186
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,335
And as such, they are very well known.

187
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,755
Particularly to chemists and more
specifically to organic chemists

188
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,315
who have a tremendous ability,
the good ones anyway,

189
00:10:56,315 --> 00:10:59,725
to recognize a molecule when
looking at the NMR spectrum,

190
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,335
the proton NMR spectrum.

191
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,429
This is not such an easy task.

192
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,139
You can see that the scale here
goes from zero to 10.

193
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:10,768
And for example, we find
the aromatic molecules,

194
00:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,418
I mean the protons
attached to aromatic molecules

195
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,412
span a considerable range.

196
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,310
Benzene is somewhere
near seven and a quarter

197
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,610
but depending on the environment,

198
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,567
the shifts can cover quite a range.

199
00:11:24,567 --> 00:11:29,637
It is even worse for
hydroxy-aromatics, so aerials.

200
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:33,147
And you can see different molecules
have different ranges.

201
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,397
We note amusing things.

202
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:39,909
For example, that the acetylenic proton,

203
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:45,259
we shall refer to that later,
is towards lower chemical shifts

204
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:48,943
than the olefinic,
which is kind of surprising.

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,160
This is due to a very peculiar
effect sometimes called

206
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,910
the neighboring group effect
that we shall try to explain later on.

207
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,729
But basically this table is very important

208
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:03,319
because most organic chemists
have this, sort of,

209
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,399
engraved in their brain and
they go around the world

210
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,349
remembering this all the time.

211
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,827
And if you know this very well

212
00:12:10,827 --> 00:12:14,827
and if you’re very familiar with
this kind of empirical material,

213
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:18,358
it allows you to recognize
the fingerprint of your molecule

214
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,198
and determine exactly what it is.

215
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:22,218
Now there are other things.

216
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:24,488
For example, the amplitudes
of the signals,

217
00:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,817
more properly called the integrals,

218
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:31,328
are proportional to the number
of nuclei within the molecule.

219
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,279
Some examples here.

220
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,909
So this is trimethylbenzene.

221
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,599
And of course we have protons here,

222
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,789
which are directly attached
to the aromatic ring,

223
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,720
so there are three of them,

224
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,940
and they’re a total of three times
three or nine methyl protons.

225
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,880
So the ratio of the methyl protons
to the aromatic protons

226
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,400
is three to one.

227
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,890
Nine to three is equal to three to one.

228
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,976
In the NMR spectrum,
we shall see a weak peak here,

229
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,961
close to 7 ppm and a much
more intense peak,

230
00:13:06,961 --> 00:13:10,001
of three times more intense
peak just above 2 ppm.

231
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,733
And the fact that they have
these amplitude ratios

232
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,946
confirms what I just told you,
that there are indeed

233
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:17,546
three aromatic protons.

234
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,976
These three here directly
attached to the ring,

235
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,593
and nine methyl protons.

236
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:29,299
The transition, so you should remember
that we go from nine over three

237
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,723
equal to three over one.

238
00:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,013
What you observe is this

239
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,143
and what the chemist
would like to know is this.

240
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:40,006
And it takes a bit of chemical
intuition to go

241
00:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,586
from three over one to nine over three.

242
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,506
We have another example here.

243
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,866
This is a tetramethylbenzene.

244
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,868
Now, of course, there are
only two aromatic protons

245
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:55,907
that remain and they’re a total
of four times three.

246
00:13:55,907 --> 00:14:01,949
So that’s 12 divided by two
methyl protons.

247
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,900
So 12 methyl protons
and two aromatic protons,

248
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,830
and of course, the ratio is six to one.

249
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,330
And you can see that indeed
we have the amplitude

250
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,560
of the aromatic peak is one-sixth
of the aliphatic peak.

251
00:14:17,305 --> 00:14:21,305
So this kind of reasoning
can be extended to many,

252
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,635
many molecules.

253
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,455
In fact, these examples are
a bit oversimplified.

254
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:26,805
They have been chosen.

255
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:27,985
They are not cheated.

256
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:30,275
They are genuine examples,
but they have been chosen

257
00:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,875
because these particular molecules

258
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,185
do not feature any scale or couplings.

259
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,465
They do not have any
multiplets and therefore,

260
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,955
we can argue purely
on the grounds of chemical shifts.

261
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:43,986
If we have a more serious molecule,
such as a protein,

262
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,180
then of course, we have many,
many different chemical shifts,

263
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,660
many environments.

264
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,830
This particular protein was popular

265
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,850
in Oxford at the days of writing the book.

266
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,831
And it contains, in fact, 129 amino acids,

267
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,391
which is a fairly small protein
by biological standards.

268
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,081
But a large protein from
the point of view of chemists,

269
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:11,071
and also actually for NMR spectroscopists
this represents a challenge.

270
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:16,747
129 amino acids means roughly
that there are about 10 protons

271
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,347
for each amino acid,

272
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,101
sometimes some have more, some have less.

273
00:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,437
But roughly that means
about 1,000 protons.

274
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:25,217
And indeed we have about
1,000 chemical shifts.

275
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:29,267
Some of them pile up so that
you get a very messy profile here.

276
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,567
That means that many have been added
on top of each other.

277
00:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,546
Others are quite nicely isolated.

278
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,146
I presume this is the sum of
a few degenerate methyl groups.

279
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,486
And this looks like a rather
isolated proton attached

280
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:46,056
to a [inaudible], to a proton,
to a nitrogen, excuse me.

281
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,818
Typically, we would write this
something like this.

282
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,148
And this would probably
be something like this.

283
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:53,728
And this is an example of two assignments,

284
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:59,098
that is to say, the relationships
between peaks and chemical units

285
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:03,628
which are one of the great challenges
of protein NMR spectroscopy.

286
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:06,864
But a great deal of progress
has been made in this field,

287
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,460
particularly by combining proton NMR
with Carbon 13 NMR

288
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:16,136
and with Nitrogen 15 NMR,
by enriching the proteins

289
00:16:16,286 --> 00:16:21,596
with these stable isotopes and then
recording so-called two-dimensional

290
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,108
correlation spectra that
allow one to assign--

291
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,808
each and every one of these peaks
can be assigned and identified.

292
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:33,476
The next gives a rather exotic example,
very far from biology,

293
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,036
no proteins at all.

294
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,850
There is a substance.

295
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,570
This is actually a metal cluster,

296
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,460
which contains four cobalt atoms
and a bunch of carbon monoxide.

297
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,680
And the question is, what is the structure
of this strange cluster?

298
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,370
And you could imagine something like this.

299
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:56,871
That we have the four methyls
in a regular tetrahedron

300
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,139
and that each of the four methyl
is surrounded by a local little cloud

301
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,567
of three carbon monoxides.

302
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,597
And the whole thing would have a symmetry,

303
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,167
that of the point group
of a tetrahedron.

304
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,929
If that were the case,
then there would be

305
00:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,488
all sort of symmetry elements,

306
00:17:14,488 --> 00:17:17,198
planes of reflection, rotation,
all sorts of things.

307
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:21,064
And a conclusion of an analysis
of the symmetry of this molecule

308
00:17:21,102 --> 00:17:26,452
is that there should be only one peak
for all oxygens that you see.

309
00:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,892
And by the way, also only one
peak for all the carbons

310
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,199
and one peak for all the metals,

311
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,529
if they happen to have a spin,
cobalt for example.

312
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,454
Now it turns out that if we look at
the Oxygen 17 spectrum,

313
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,801
that there are not one but four peaks.

314
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,999
So we can safely say this is no good.

315
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,539
This can be ruled out because
that particular simple symmetry

316
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,169
is incompatible with the fact
that there are four lines

317
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,759
in the oxygen spectrum.

318
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,559
By the way, oxygen is
a rather unusual nucleus.

319
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,039
It has a large quadrupole
and the lines are rather broad

320
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,419
because of rapid transverse relaxation.

321
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,419
And it’s not your favorite molecule,
your favorite isotope

322
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,209
in the periodic table,
but it’s very nice in this illustration.

323
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,120
Now you can speculate about other systems.

324
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,415
This has a symmetry of D2D.

325
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:22,697
It has some so-called bridging
carbonyls, which are here.

326
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,776
And it also has the so-called
terminal carbonyls,

327
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:28,036
which have a different environment,
as you can see.

328
00:18:28,087 --> 00:18:30,937
And from the structure of this,
you conclude that

329
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:33,657
there should be, I believe,
two different peaks.

330
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,257
And this can also be ruled out.

331
00:18:36,496 --> 00:18:39,536
Now when you look at this
final one here, it turns out

332
00:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,563
that here we have bridging carbonyls.

333
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,243
There are three of those.

334
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:49,061
And then you have some which
are in a sort of apical position.

335
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,901
They point out away from the metal
and they’re isolated.

336
00:18:54,901 --> 00:19:00,811
Whereas, in this case,
we have three carbonyls

337
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:03,568
attached to the same methyl.

338
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:07,908
In this case, we have two carbonyls
attached to the same methyl.

339
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,834
I’m not sure how to draw this but you see.

340
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,804
I should have changed the color actually.

341
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:18,823
Now, this molecule, therefore,
is compatible with a spectrum,

342
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:23,044
an oxygen spectrum, which has four
distinct resonances.

343
00:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,474
It’s not easy to say which of these lines

344
00:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,984
belong to which environment.

345
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,414
That’s a difficult question
and it’s not the purpose

346
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,964
of today’s lecture.

347
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:36,704
Now, this is an interesting case
because it speaks of fullerenes,

348
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,820
sometimes called
buckminsterfullerenes or C60

349
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:46,437
as perhaps the most common expression.

350
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:50,454
And we now know that this is
a icosahedral molecule

351
00:19:50,454 --> 00:19:56,554
where the carbons are arranged
on the pattern of a football,

352
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,060
and there are some surfaces
that have a hexagonal environment

353
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,724
and others a pentagonal environment.

354
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,284
Now what is remarkable about this molecule

355
00:20:06,602 --> 00:20:10,602
is that is has an extremely
simple Carbon 13 spectrum.

356
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:14,304
In fact, you can convince yourself
that it has a very high symmetry,

357
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,069
an icosahedral symmetry,
and that therefore,

358
00:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,269
the chemical shifts of all Cs,

359
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,499
full carbon atoms, should be the same.

360
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,209
And indeed the spectrum
shows just a single line.

361
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,919
So the fact that that is a single line
is a confirmation

362
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:33,925
that the symmetry of the molecule
must indeed be very simple.

363
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,295
Now this was not obvious at all.

364
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,985
When this material was discovered

365
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:41,255
in 1919 by Harry Kroto in his environment,

366
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:45,945
and his co-workers, this was still
an uncertain matter

367
00:20:45,949 --> 00:20:50,149
and it was not at all clear
that carbon could arrange itself

368
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,469
in such a structure,
such a strange molecule.

369
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:56,243
In fact, this molecule went unnoticed

370
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:58,943
for about two centuries
of modern chemistry,

371
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,999
and therefore, it’s quite remarkable

372
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,619
that it was found so late in history.

373
00:21:03,747 --> 00:21:07,347
Kroto, by the way, got a Nobel prize,
probably mostly for this.

374
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:10,787
And if you are interested
in the origin of such things,

375
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,962
I vividly recommend that
you read this in <i>ChemComm</i>.

376
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,774
You can look it up following instructions

377
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,654
that I will give somewhere else.

378
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,209
So let’s take another example,

379
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:27,469
which I think is very well chosen
by Peter Hore from the vast literature

380
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,559
that describes such effects.

381
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,139
And this example uses Phosphorus 31.

382
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,459
That’s a very popular nucleus
because it is very abundant.

383
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,830
In fact, that isotope is 
100 percent abundant.

384
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,329
It’s not radioactive, of course,

385
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,999
stable and it is found almost
everywhere in biology.

386
00:21:46,477 --> 00:21:49,007
But it is also found
in inorganic chemistry.

387
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,391
And the example studied here
by Raymond Andrew,

388
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,611
who is a very famous English NMR
spectroscopist and physicist,

389
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,290
in a paper that I vividly recommend
you should read,

390
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,189
he and his team studied
this very simple molecule.

391
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:09,952
So this is phosphorus pentachloride.

392
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,462
If you consider that in solution,

393
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:17,192
it is a bi-pyramidal affair, like this.

394
00:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,708
The phosphorus, of course,
is in the middle

395
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:23,825
and the five chlorine sit
at the corners of this polygon.

396
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:26,722
And it turns out that there’s
a high degree of symmetry,

397
00:22:26,743 --> 00:22:30,273
and that the phosphorus sits in the middle

398
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,283
and is quite happy to be there.

399
00:22:32,283 --> 00:22:34,223
It has only one chemical shift.

400
00:22:34,671 --> 00:22:38,901
But if you precipitate this material
and make a solid out of it,

401
00:22:39,063 --> 00:22:41,883
then the molecule actually
disproportionates

402
00:22:42,202 --> 00:22:46,622
and gives you this anionic species
and cationic species,

403
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:50,382
so PCL 4 minus and PCL 6 plus.

404
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,375
And they have different chemical shifts.

405
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,145
In fact, it turns out that this one

406
00:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,245
is shielded and this
one is deshielded.

407
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,825
And this is then plotted
on a ppm scale of delta

408
00:23:00,825 --> 00:23:03,045
of Phosphorus 31.

409
00:23:03,738 --> 00:23:06,578
Actually, to record
a Phosphorus 31 spectrum

410
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:09,208
in a solid is not such a simple affair

411
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:13,093
because as we shall see later,
the phosphorus

412
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:16,108
has an anisotropy of the chemical shift,

413
00:23:16,134 --> 00:23:19,674
and therefore, in a solid
tends to give very broad lines.

414
00:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,833
And in order to get rid of
this line broadening,

415
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:26,633
Andrew invented a wonderful experiment
which is known as magic angle

416
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,553
spinning that allows you
to retrieve very narrow lines

417
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,620
from spectra solids that
otherwise would be broadened.

418
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,635
This is a very clever technique
and Andrew deserves

419
00:23:37,635 --> 00:23:39,195
much credit for that.

420
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:41,975
This was one of the first
applications of that technique.

421
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:46,585
Now there are also applications
of Silicone 29 NMR.

422
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,971
And this is one that is
of some industrial interest

423
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,541
because we speak of aluminosilicates.

424
00:23:55,881 --> 00:24:01,971
That is to say, porous solids
that are built of aluminate units,

425
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:07,669
AlO4 and silicate units, SiO4.

426
00:24:08,441 --> 00:24:11,641
In this notation I mean that
the aluminium is surrounded

427
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:16,631
by four oxygen atoms, roughly
in a tetrahedral environment

428
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,381
and a silicone likewise.

429
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,977
But together these make up
a vast array of substances

430
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:25,050
called aluminosilicates.

431
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,620
Some of which are found in nature.

432
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,330
Some of which are only made synthetically.

433
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,838
And many of which
have interesting properties

434
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:36,458
as heterogeneous catalysts
because they have pores

435
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,568
and molecules can enter into these pores
and their chemical reactions

436
00:24:40,568 --> 00:24:44,051
can occur on the inner
surfaces of these pores.

437
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,310
And the characterization
of aluminosilicates

438
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,960
is not an easy matter
because as you can see

439
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,070
at the periodic table,
aluminum and silicone

440
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,110
are very close together
and they have roughly

441
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,720
the same electron density around them.

442
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,330
So that makes it hard to distinguish
them with x-ray spectroscopy.

443
00:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,568
But of course, in NMR, the Aluminum 27,

444
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:08,808
which by the way has a quadrupolar spin,
is completely different

445
00:25:09,195 --> 00:25:11,005
from the Silicone 29.

446
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:14,084
And what you see here,
is a range of Silicone 29

447
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,744
spectra of different zeolites.

448
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:20,894
Zeolites are an important class
of aluminosilicates with different

449
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,710
ratios of silicone to aluminum.

450
00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,709
So in the bottom case,
we have mostly silicone

451
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,129
and very little aluminum.

452
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,466
In the top case, they are about equal.

453
00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:34,339
And what we see here
is a distribution of different

454
00:25:34,347 --> 00:25:37,337
chemical shifts of Silicone 29

455
00:25:38,076 --> 00:25:42,076
where if there is no aluminum
in the neighborhood,

456
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,809
then we have this line here.

457
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,029
If there is one aluminum
next door, we have this line.

458
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,449
If there are two alumina
next door, then we have this line.

459
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:55,732
If there are three, then we have
the line to the left [inaudible].

460
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:58,108
There’s actually one more
over here, which is very weak.

461
00:25:58,451 --> 00:26:02,451
So , the more aluminum,
that is to say, the lower

462
00:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,621
the ratio of silica to aluminum--

463
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,091
So we go up on this list,
the more, of course,

464
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:12,201
the distribution is favouring
the line which corresponds to silica

465
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:19,191
in the environment for alumimate centers.

466
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,141
Now, it’s interesting to look at
these distributions.

467
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:27,661
That is to say, the relative amplitudes
because they give a very refined,

468
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:32,162
a very subtle, very informative way
of characterizing these

469
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:35,963
zeolites or aluminosilicates
that are so important

470
00:26:36,199 --> 00:26:40,369
in heterogeneous catalases
and particularly frequency used

471
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:46,425
in the petroleum industry
for cracking of heavy natural oil

472
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:50,695
to make convenient petrol
or gas as the Americans say.

473
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,830
You can find more about this in this paper

474
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,320
by Jacek Klinowski
and Colin Fyfe and others.

475
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,460
As you can see, we’ll try to provide
the key to that in our supplement.

476
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:07,824
Now, there is here a more
biological application

477
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,059
but it’s not just biological.

478
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,739
It’s really one of universal importance.

479
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:18,559
It was first described by Ian Campbell
and Raymond Dwek.

480
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:23,241
Ian Campbell, incidentally,
was teaching in Oxford

481
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,549
and he was the co-examiner of my PhD.

482
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,199
I wouldn’t say I’ve known him
very well, but he’s a charming person

483
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:32,159
who unfortunately died a few years ago.

484
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:36,721
Raymond Dwek, as far as I’m aware,
is still active in Oxford.

485
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:39,775
Now this discovery was very important.

486
00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,635
This illustration is very important.

487
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,619
They were concerned with
looking at histidine.

488
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,923
Now, histidine comes in two forms.

489
00:27:47,403 --> 00:27:51,553
It can be either protronated,
in which case it’s called HisH+.

490
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:54,893
And what we mean is
that they have a proton

491
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,309
attached to this nitrogen.

492
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,339
In fact, the molecule looks
a bit symmetrical

493
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,979
or nearly symmetrical
when it’s protronated.

494
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,769
But of course, the proton can drop off,
in which case it’s in solution,

495
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,769
and the nitrogen is then naked,
so to speak, with a long pair

496
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:10,514
sticking out here.

497
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,630
But this in itself is not something
we wish to observe.

498
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,630
What we shall observe is
the chemical shift of the proton

499
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,955
which is attached to
the neighboring carbon.

500
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:23,375
So here again, there is a chemical shift,

501
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,809
of the proton attached to
the neighboring carbon.

502
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:31,349
And it turns out that the chemical shift
of this so-called C2 proton,

503
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,330
or H2 proton, which is the one
attached to the C2 carbon,

504
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:42,273
is very sensitive to the question
if it’s protonated or not.

505
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:49,419
Now what you see here is spectra
of histidine in its natural environment

506
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:52,357
which is actually in haemoglobin.

507
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:56,437
So haemoglobin is the molecule protein
that carries the oxygen

508
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:59,287
in our blood and delivers the oxygen
and delivers the oxygen

509
00:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,477
to the organisms where it is needed.

510
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140
And of course, it’s very interesting
to see what happens.

511
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:08,127
If the haemoglobin carries
oxygen, then it’s called oxi.

512
00:29:08,127 --> 00:29:11,347
And if it has lost it’s oxygen,
it’s called deoxi.

513
00:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,127
So they’re two different forms.

514
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,707
But even before we start
about losing oxygen,

515
00:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,177
let’s talk about the deoxi version first.

516
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:23,801
We notice that the chemical shift
of this proton here

517
00:29:23,818 --> 00:29:27,818
depends critically on the pH
of the solution.

518
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:33,018
And we see here that the chemical shift
as a fraction of pH

519
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:36,931
can be used a little bit like
we can use the potential

520
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,690
of an electrode in a pH meter,

521
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,163
in that we see that there is
a sort of a point of inflection

522
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:46,193
in this curve here
and this point of inflection,

523
00:29:46,388 --> 00:29:49,378
that is to say where
the derivative changes sign,

524
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,759
is known as the <i>pk</i>.

525
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,109
And so we can determine
the <i>pk</i> of this particular

526
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,859
histidine but not just one histidine.

527
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,039
It’s in a histidine which is embedded
in haemoglobin.

528
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:09,203
Now it turns out that if
the haemoglobin is oxygenated,

529
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:11,382
that is to say it carries oxygen,

530
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:14,852
which is of course attached
to the iron atom in the haem,

531
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,680
well then it turns out that the <i>pk</i>--

532
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,550
we can do the same experiment again.

533
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,670
And as you can see, the <i>pk</i>
is shifted from 7.9 to 6.8.

534
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,280
That’s quite remarkable.

535
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,200
Now it turns out that
this is an illustration

536
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,350
of a very universal rule, which is
that the average chemical shift,

537
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,780
which is what you see
along the vertical sail,

538
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,850
so this is the average chemical shift,
is made up of a mixture

539
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,820
of the chemical shift
of the protronated version,

540
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,460
of this molecule here,

541
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,560
plus a weighted average
which also involves

542
00:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,076
the chemical shift of
the deprotronated molecule.

543
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:54,136
And this is very simple.

544
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:56,506
The protronated chemical shift is weighted

545
00:30:56,506 --> 00:30:59,996
with the concentration
of the protronated histidine,

546
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,318
and the deprotonated is weighted
with that concentration.

547
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,078
And then you divide it by the sum
of the two concentrations

548
00:31:07,317 --> 00:31:10,197
so that it becomes again
a dimensionless quantity.

549
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,687
And then you have
the average chemical shift,

550
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,307
which is what we measure here.

551
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,507
So this is a weighted average.

552
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,617
Now it’s done here, this equation is shown

553
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,327
specifically for the case of histidine,

554
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,424
but of course, it can be quite universal.

555
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:28,294
It’s true for any acid base equilibrium.

556
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,316
It is also true if we have
multiple equilibria.

557
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:33,916
For example, if you have phosphoric acid,

558
00:31:33,916 --> 00:31:37,916
which can occur as PO4H3,

559
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:41,916
PO4H2, PO4H1, PO43-.

560
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,795
All of these forms have
different chemical shifts

561
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,975
and different concentrations,
and therefore,

562
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:52,755
the weighted average will depend
on the pH and on the <i>pk</i>s

563
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:57,273
and we can determine the <i>pk</i>s
by measuring the chemical shift

564
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,154
as a function of pH.

565
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:02,333
This is a very important observation,

566
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,763
very universal in its applications.

567
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:09,083
So this concludes
part one of this chapter.

568
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,090
Thank you for your attention.
