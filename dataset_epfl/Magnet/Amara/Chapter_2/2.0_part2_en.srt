00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:08,419
Welcome back to part two of this chapter.

2
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:14,057
So chemical shifts are often considered
as imperical quantities

3
00:00:14,068 --> 00:00:17,629
that escape any attempt to explain them.

4
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,538
But of course, that's not true.

5
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:21,392
People, and chemists in particular,

6
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:24,422
physicists as well, would like
to give an explanation.

7
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:29,502
And there are in fact a wide variety
of explanations.

8
00:00:29,502 --> 00:00:31,662
Some of them are conflicting.

9
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:33,592
Sometimes they make sense,

10
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,285
sometimes they dont.

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,165
And one has to be very careful

12
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:38,295
to pick one's way

13
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:41,135
among this minefield of explanations.

14
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:43,186
But let me give you some of the elements,

15
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:45,046
so you can judge yourself

16
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,870
how sound the science is.

17
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,377
So, here we have

18
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:51,016
Pauling's electronegativity.

19
00:00:51,016 --> 00:00:56,039
We all know there is a series from iodine
to Bromine to chlorine to Fluorine,

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,597
where the electronegativity increases;

21
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,658
that is, to say,

22
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:01,917
the electron withdrawing ability.

23
00:01:01,917 --> 00:01:03,115
And it turns out

24
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:06,050
that if we take methyl halides,

25
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,700
Ch3x, where x is one of the above,

26
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,150
then it turns out

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,996
that the chemical shift

28
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:14,266
of the protons of the methyl group

29
00:01:14,266 --> 00:01:16,236
follows a particular trend,

30
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,214
which is roughly linear

31
00:01:18,214 --> 00:01:20,224
with the Pauling definition

32
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:21,514
of electronegativity.

33
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:24,466
So you might say, the stronger

34
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,694
the withdrawal, the larger

35
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:28,354
the chemical shift

36
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,535
of the proton that is attached

37
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:31,855
to the methl group

38
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:32,935
that is neighboring

39
00:01:32,935 --> 00:01:36,195
to the halide. So far, so good.

40
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,315
This makes sense. I wouldn't use it

41
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:40,971
as a way of determining

42
00:01:40,971 --> 00:01:42,701
the electronegativity.

43
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,042
But you could, if you wish.

44
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:45,822
Now, it turns out that

45
00:01:45,822 --> 00:01:48,336
the electronegativity has an effect

46
00:01:48,346 --> 00:01:50,876
beyond the neighboring methyl group.

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,799
In fact, if we take a chlorine

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,109
at the end of a long chain--

49
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,189
so this is now one of the halides

50
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:58,277
at the end of a butane molecule.

51
00:01:58,346 --> 00:02:01,236
You can see that the first

52
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:03,116
protons on the neighboring

53
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:04,312
methelyn group

54
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,082
are shifted all the way to the left

55
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,679
but the second one is affected much less.

56
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:10,839
The third one is hardly affected at all,

57
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,866
and the methyl group is so far away

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,546
that it has essentially the same

59
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:16,666
chemical shift as the methyl group

60
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,656
in a simple propane molecule.

61
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,889
So, this tells you something

62
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:23,002
about the range of this

63
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,999
electronegative electron

64
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:26,446
withdrawing effect.

65
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,956
There is an important aspect

66
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,828
when one tries to rationalize

67
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:32,198
chemical shifts that sometimes

68
00:02:32,198 --> 00:02:34,648
they go hand in hand with the chemist

69
00:02:34,715 --> 00:02:35,955
perception of how

70
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,075
the molecule really looks like.

71
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,319
And when I say "the chemist perception"

72
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,850
I mean the so-called
"resonance structure".

73
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,964
Take this simple aromatic molecule.

74
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:50,284
We know that the NO2 group

75
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:52,633
is an electron withdrawing group.

76
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,986
And the organic chemist rationalizes this

77
00:02:56,055 --> 00:02:59,055
by saying that some small fraction of this

78
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:01,705
is not in fact as drawn here but that

79
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,249
the double bond migrates

80
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,209
to the single bond and becomes therefore

81
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,612
a double bond, and, concommitantly

82
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:09,167
there is a positive charge

83
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:10,883
that appears here on

84
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,480
the neighboring carbon.

85
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:15,942
And you can use one more step,
you can cause this double bond

86
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:19,525
to migrate here and then 
the positive charge appears

87
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:24,031
in para position with respect
to the NO2- group.

88
00:03:24,441 --> 00:03:26,901
Well, these structures are known as

89
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,307
resonance structures 
and they're very familiar

90
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:31,099
to organic chemists because

91
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,772
they allow one to rationalize reactivity,

92
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:36,242
where do certain substituents go,

93
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,812
and questions like that.

94
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,739
And in fact, these pictures

95
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,061
have been developed hand-in-hand

96
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,733
with the observation of

97
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,970
the proton chemical shifts.

98
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,091
And you see an example here.

99
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,624
Nitrobenzene which are

100
00:03:49,624 --> 00:03:50,914
these three molecules here.

101
00:03:50,946 --> 00:03:53,686
Actually there are three different
chemical shifts.

102
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:57,323
There's one that is strongly
de-shielded with respect

103
00:03:57,323 --> 00:03:59,703
to benzene, that is the one in the

104
00:03:59,703 --> 00:04:01,743
ortho position.You can imagine

105
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:03,074
that because the electrons

106
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,099
are being withdrawn there is a lack of

107
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,001
an electron cloud and therefore

108
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,095
it's less shielded, and, likewise

109
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:12,589
in the para position, that is over here

110
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,565
there's a similar effect, although

111
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:16,087
it's much less pronounced.

112
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:17,963
It's a bit paradoxical because

113
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:19,683
in the resonance structures

114
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:22,003
there's really no need to say

115
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:25,413
that the ortho+ is dominant over the para+

116
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:27,551
but you see that, at least empirically,

117
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,901
it turns out that the effect

118
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,538
is most pronounced for the ortho

119
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,448
and very little for the para.

120
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:35,377
Meanwhile, according to this argument

121
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:37,167
the proton in the meta position,

122
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:38,366
that's this one here,

123
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,290
should not be affected at all.

124
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,241
Well, it is also affected somewhat

125
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,709
with respect to benzene

126
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,639
but apparently that's a different effect

127
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,489
than the resonance effect.

128
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:49,805
Now, the beauty of this argument

129
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,052
is the exact opposite

130
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:52,352
to what you see in aniline.

131
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,394
In aniline we have an electron donating

132
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,394
group, so we have the loan pair

133
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,324
on the nitrogen here this loan pair

134
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:02,664
can go here, and then this double bond

135
00:05:02,664 --> 00:05:06,124
will move into this postiton

136
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:08,472
so that we have an excess charge here.

137
00:05:08,662 --> 00:05:10,947
And in the second step, we can decide

138
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,385
to put that charge here

139
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,648
and put this one over here

140
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:15,456
so that we now have an excess charge

141
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,084
in the para position.

142
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,999
And consequently, you expect

143
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,802
the ortho position to be shielded

144
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,562
because there are more electrons

145
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:25,012
than there were before.

146
00:05:25,012 --> 00:05:26,687
You de-localize them and therefore

147
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:27,927
it goes toward the right,

148
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,347
and the para position would be somewhat

149
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:32,087
less shielded, and the meta position

150
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,577
should not be shielded at all

151
00:05:33,577 --> 00:05:36,007
but nevertheless, it is somewhat shielded.

152
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,127
You notice that
it's not exactly symmetrical.

153
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,897
For example, the para is very close

154
00:05:39,897 --> 00:05:40,938
to the ortho here

155
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:43,108
where that's not the case
on the left side.

156
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,168
So, that shows that these arguments

157
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:46,552
are essentially qualitative

158
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:48,562
and you should not give them

159
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:51,082
the status of a serious theory

160
00:05:51,082 --> 00:05:53,732
just more to guide the intuition.

161
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:55,306
But chemistry is a great deal

162
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:57,288
about intuition, so there's nothing wrong

163
00:05:57,288 --> 00:06:00,108
with using that type of thinking.

164
00:06:00,492 --> 00:06:03,302
Here we have an example of carbon 13

165
00:06:03,302 --> 00:06:06,162
chemical shifts of para carbons

166
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,260
in substituted benzenes.

167
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,580
So, with reference to these molecules,

168
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,620
we're talking now about the carbon,

169
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,072
not the proton, the carbon,
that is in para position

170
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:17,092
with respect to the substituent,

171
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,800
and now we vary the substituent,

172
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,771
so we can put this NH2 here,

173
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:23,053
which is like here, the amine,

174
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,383
or, we can put the NO2, like here,

175
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:27,103
the nitro group, but there are

176
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,713
all sorts of things in between,

177
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,565
and we can use this chemical shift

178
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:35,127
scale here as a measure of the ability

179
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,862
of the substituents to donate electrons

180
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:41,282
into the phenol group, or to withdraw them

181
00:06:41,282 --> 00:06:43,332
from the same aromatic ring.

182
00:06:43,354 --> 00:06:45,584
So, this is a very nice way of classifying

183
00:06:45,595 --> 00:06:49,215
the electronegativity of those groups,

184
00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,239
and also, to predict the reactivity

185
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:53,359
which, of course,

186
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:54,759
is essential in chemistry.

187
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:57,129
There is a more exotic example.

188
00:06:57,129 --> 00:07:00,819
In fact this was published many years ago

189
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,142
by Ray Freeman,

190
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,622
Ray Freeman was my PHD advisor

191
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,192
and Rex Richards
was his advisor, so, in a way

192
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:10,478
he is my intellectual grandfather,

193
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,458
if I dare say so, and I vividly recommend

194
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,458
you look up this publication

195
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,528
in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.

196
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:19,622
It's quite a few years ago,

197
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:20,652
but, nevertheless,

198
00:07:20,652 --> 00:07:22,366
of great current interest.

199
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,316
Now, what these people did, they knew

200
00:07:24,316 --> 00:07:27,466
that cobalt complexes, for example

201
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,436
here, with the nitrile group

202
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:32,701
the ethylene diamine, or

203
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,699
the ammonium, and all the others

204
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:36,729
that they have different colors,

205
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,949
and different optical transitions.

206
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:42,303
And these optical transitions are due

207
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,380
to the transition--
the crystal fuel splitting

208
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,850
between the so-called t2g orbitals

209
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:52,316
and the eg orbitals in the cobalt complex

210
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,179
which is in these cases, as always

211
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:56,279
in a hexagonal environment.

212
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,192
And what they found is, they started

213
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:02,203
measuring cobalt 58 chemical shifts.

214
00:08:02,275 --> 00:08:03,792
Something that is not at all

215
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:05,952
common in the literature, but clearly

216
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,722
a heroic attempt to discover

217
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,899
a new correlation, and they found

218
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,989
a wonderful correlation, between

219
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:14,669
the chemical shift of the cobalt

220
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:17,459
and the wavelength in nanometers

221
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:20,049
of the optical transition.

222
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:22,589
So, this is somewhere in the visible
UV visible light.

223
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,309
Then they said, "Aha,

224
00:08:24,309 --> 00:08:26,689
this has something to do with--

225
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:29,369
this is a contribution to
the chemical shift,"

226
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:30,829
which they attibuted

227
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:33,219
to what is now known as a paramagnetic

228
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:35,079
contribution to the shift.

229
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,547
They noticed that it's inversely

230
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,923
proportional to the parameter delta,

231
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,593
which is simply the splitting,

232
00:08:42,593 --> 00:08:44,483
the transition frequency of the

233
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,513
optical transition, and they also

234
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:49,583
considered that it should be relevent

235
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:53,239
to include an average over R3 where R3

236
00:08:53,239 --> 00:08:55,439
is basically the radius of the size of

237
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,769
the electron cloud that is responsible

238
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:59,669
for the chemical shift.

239
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,012
Now this is a really
beautiful observation,

240
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:03,912
very interesting, very stimulating,

241
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,889
but unfortunately, there are not many

242
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,279
molecules that behave in such a clear way,

243
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,715
not many examples of this effect.

244
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:13,245
Now, in the meantime, people have been

245
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,804
trying to split contributions

246
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:17,144
to nuclear shielding

247
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:19,334
into different parameters.

248
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,424
The effect that I spoke about

249
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,974
at the very beginning of chapter two

250
00:09:23,974 --> 00:09:26,314
the one that we find in helium 3 and in

251
00:09:26,353 --> 00:09:31,023
xenon 129 which, by the way, is also known

252
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,936
as the Lamb shift, is more properly

253
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:38,261
known as a diamagnetic shielding.

254
00:09:38,261 --> 00:09:41,001
So, in diamagnetic shielding the induced

255
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,660
magnetic field, induced by the circulation

256
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,070
of the electrons, is anti-parallel

257
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,020
to the external field.

258
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,790
But we also have situations

259
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,340
where the shielding is paramagnetic.

260
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,390
In that case there is a

261
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,070
local field which is actually parallel

262
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,870
to the external field and therefore

263
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,990
adds up to the external field.

264
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,540
Then, there are effects which are due to

265
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,430
remote groups, or remote currents,

266
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,160
or currents in remote groups,

267
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,076
and of course, other sources.

268
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:11,836
Now, it's very nice to make

269
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:14,296
a list of these, but it's very difficult
in practice

270
00:10:14,296 --> 00:10:16,596
to split and observe chemical shift

271
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:19,236
into separate contributions.

272
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:23,717
Now, remember here that the magnitudes

273
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:26,088
of induced diamagnetic and paramagnetic

274
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,428
currents can be related to local

275
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,738
electron densities, and to electronic

276
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,438
excitation energies.

277
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,299
So, this is clearly inspired by the work

278
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,679
of Ray Freeman and Rex Richards on cobalt

279
00:10:39,754 --> 00:10:41,274
but is not necessarily of

280
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,924
universal application.

281
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:46,914
Some of the most important contributions

282
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,974
to chemical shifts are so-called

283
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:52,684
ring-current effects, which are specific

284
00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:55,022
to aromatic compounds.

285
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,460
You see in this scheme here this ring here

286
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,570
is supposed to represent a benzene ring

287
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,500
or, in fact, any aromatic ring.

288
00:11:02,544 --> 00:11:05,844
You see that the induced field, the field

289
00:11:05,844 --> 00:11:08,164
induced by the electrons that circulate

290
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:10,414
in this ring is opposite to

291
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,886
the external field, and if we could have

292
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:14,966
a proton right in the center of the

293
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,220
benzene ring, it would be shielded

294
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,960
because it experiences a field that is

295
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,700
smaller than the external field.

296
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,970
But in fact, protons in benzene rings

297
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:25,960
as you know, are on the outside

298
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,670
of the ring, and therefore,

299
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,097
they experience a local magentic field

300
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,662
an induced field, which adds to the

301
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,002
external field.

302
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:36,062
And the result of that is that they appear

303
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,792
de-shielded.

304
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:40,849
Now, one way of measuring this effect

305
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:43,069
is comparing benzene, where the chemical

306
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,150
shift is about 7.3 ppm with respect to tms

307
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,900
with a form here where one of the three

308
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,760
double bonds has been reduced by addition

309
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,150
of a hydrogen molecule, and consequently

310
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,664
there is no possibility

311
00:11:56,664 --> 00:11:59,074
for these electrons to run around a circle

312
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,714
and they cannot sustain a ring current,

313
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:06,654
and therefore not induce a magnetic dipole

314
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:09,014
that is opposite to the external dipole.

315
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:10,941
Well, you see immediately that

316
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,781
the chemical shift of this proton goes

317
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,814
from 7.3 to 5.9 so it has become shielded

318
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:19,284
or less de-shielded, if you prefer.

319
00:12:19,284 --> 00:12:21,864
A more spectacular example here.

320
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:23,314
This molecule is a rather contrived

321
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,434
piece of chemistry, it was made

322
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,224
in the days when people were trying

323
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:31,004
to find extremes of the most de-shielded

324
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:32,684
or the most shielded compound

325
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:33,954
and the most important part of it

326
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:37,614
is that this methyl group here is just
above the aromatic ring.

327
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:39,604
This is the aromatic ring,
and the methyl group

328
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:41,074
is just above that ring.

329
00:12:41,074 --> 00:12:42,934
And it turns out that it's not just

330
00:12:42,934 --> 00:12:45,898
a bit shielded, but it is more shielded

331
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,408
than Tetramethylsilane,
so it has a negative

332
00:12:49,472 --> 00:12:52,972
value, if you wish, to the right of tms

333
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,662
in an ordinary proton spectrum plotted

334
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:57,372
on the usual scale.

335
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:59,492
At the same time, all the protons

336
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,342
the aromatic protons, which you find here

337
00:13:01,342 --> 00:13:03,262
and there are quite a few of them

338
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,632
they are in this range, that is to say

339
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,542
they are very far to the left

340
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,934
of the spectrum, or strongly de-shielded.

341
00:13:10,325 --> 00:13:13,315
Perhaps a cleaner illustration of this

342
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:18,645
comes from this aniline which has slow

343
00:13:18,645 --> 00:13:21,745
inter-conversion of internal and external

344
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:24,222
protons through reorientation,

345
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:26,622
but the basic thing is that because the

346
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,202
protons are on the inside of the ring

347
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:31,202
where the current is circulating,

348
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,582
they have a negative value

349
00:13:33,582 --> 00:13:36,572
of the chemical shift delta

350
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,752
which means that they are

351
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,042
on the right hand side compared to tms,

352
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:44,156
whereas the other ones here just like

353
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,046
in benzene, they are de-shielded

354
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:50,402
and therefore on the left of the spectrum

355
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:56,182
You notice that one goes form 7.3 to 8.5

356
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:59,229
or so to 9.28, so this goes

357
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:01,069
more and more pronounced.

358
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:03,149
Now there are also interesting things

359
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,229
that happen if we have triple bonds and

360
00:14:06,229 --> 00:14:09,049
other exotic pieces of chemistry

361
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,419
but triple bonds are not exotic at all.

362
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:14,139
In this case we have to worry about

363
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:15,759
something else, and that is about

364
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,179
the orientation of the triple bond

365
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,139
with respect to the external field.

366
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:24,929
And this, in fact, introduces a property

367
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:27,829
of chemical shifts which is very important

368
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,359
when we do solid state NMR, and that is

369
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:32,059
the chemical shift depends

370
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,569
on the orientation of the molecule

371
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,989
with respect to the external field.

372
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:39,371
And it turns out that somewhat against

373
00:14:39,371 --> 00:14:41,531
intuition, as far as mine is concerned,

374
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,825
if the triple bond is perpendicular

375
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:47,889
to the external field, then there are

376
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:52,493
strong currents within this conjugated

377
00:14:52,512 --> 00:14:55,343
by electron system, and the net

378
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:57,508
effect of that is a paramagnetic shift

379
00:14:57,845 --> 00:14:59,795
where there is a strong dipole

380
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,171
which is parallel to the external field.

381
00:15:02,608 --> 00:15:07,158
And therefore, we have these arrows here

382
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:09,167
representing flux, and you can see that

383
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:12,030
they will affect, for example,

384
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,937
the acetylenic protons here and here,

385
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,517
where they have a situation

386
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:21,339
which is actually opposite
to what happens in,

387
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:22,970
for example, benzene.

388
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,711
But the situation is compounded
by the fact that--

389
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,073
the complexity is compounded
by the fact that

390
00:15:29,073 --> 00:15:31,563
if the triple bond parallel to the field,

391
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:34,260
then we have to draw it this way.

392
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,742
It turns out that these electrons

393
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:41,806
circulate less freely in this situation

394
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:43,974
and therefore, the induced

395
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,326
paramagnetic dipole is weaker.

396
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:50,048
If the dipole were equal here and here

397
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:53,387
and if one then invokes isotropic tumbling

398
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:55,515
of the molecules so they can adopt

399
00:15:55,605 --> 00:15:57,331
all possible orientations in space,

400
00:15:57,586 --> 00:15:59,080
then there would be no net effect.

401
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,744
But there is an imbalance, you see.

402
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:02,953
Here the paramagnetic induced dipole

403
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:04,702
is strong and here it is weak.

404
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,650
And therefore, there is no averaging

405
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,092
when it tumbles over

406
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,572
all possible positions.

407
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,140
This has curious effects.

408
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,482
For example, if we take a famous series,

409
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,437
so this is just ethane CH3 CH3.

410
00:16:20,587 --> 00:16:23,185
It is not very far from methane.

411
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,455
And it's on the right hand side,

412
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:27,185
close to 1 ppm.

413
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,997
If we now introduce a double bond,

414
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,012
we jump from here to here.

415
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:34,145
And if we introduce a triple bond,

416
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:36,343
you might think that we go even further.

417
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,623
Well, that's not true

418
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:39,769
in fact, we go back one step, so to speak.

419
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,187
And that is because of the anisotropy

420
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,174
of the triple bond of the electron

421
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:47,094
motion with the triple bond.

422
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:51,330
Such things can be represented in terms of

423
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:54,833
regions of shielding and deshielding.

424
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:58,442
So we can distinguish such cases

425
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:02,835
where the dipole, the paramagnetic dipole

426
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:05,157
for the parallel position is larger

427
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:07,996
than the dipole for the perpendicular

428
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,830
position, in which case we get

429
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,924
a distribution of fields like this

430
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,128
or the opposite case, where of course

431
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,220
we have opposite signs.

432
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:19,091
Notice that these are drawn
on these cones.

433
00:17:19,286 --> 00:17:21,152
In fact these cones are schematic

434
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,411
representations of tensars

435
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:26,178
and they look a bit like orbitals.

436
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,987
You may notice that the angle

437
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,886
subtendance by these cones

438
00:17:30,093 --> 00:17:33,127
is this angle here, we shall refer to that

439
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:35,374
as the magic angle, and in fact it's about

440
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,838
54 degree, and we shall see that if we

441
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,503
somehow orient molecules in a solid

442
00:17:40,661 --> 00:17:42,051
along that line we get

443
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:44,588
a simplified spectrum that is also

444
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:46,561
the basis of magic angle spinning.

445
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:48,178
Now there are some implications of

446
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,686
these neighboring groups.

447
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:51,331
We spoke about acetyline.

448
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,683
We spoke about the proton
which is attached,

449
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,232
the acetylinic proton,

450
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:57,208
but more spectacular effects occur

451
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,568
in molecules such as this.

452
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,590
So this is the simple phenantrene

453
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,162
where this aromatic proton rosonates

454
00:18:04,162 --> 00:18:06,500
at about 8 and something ppm

455
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:08,545
but here it is sort of squeezed

456
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:10,882
very close to the triple bond,

457
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,862
and you see it has a massive affect

458
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,347
of nearly 2 ppm, further deshielded

459
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:18,201
because of the anisotropy of the

460
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:19,588
neighboring group.

461
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,216
This is now the neighboring group,

462
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:23,710
and it has an affect on the chemical shift

463
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,793
which of course, does not occur

464
00:18:25,793 --> 00:18:28,553
if the triple bond is absent.

465
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:30,589
So this is deshielding due to

466
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,389
magnetic anisotropy.

467
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:34,196
Now there are some things which are

468
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:36,086
perhaps more important to the chemist

469
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:38,999
and here we see a case of deshielding

470
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,187
due to hydrogen bonding.

471
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,560
Hydrogen bonding, of course, is essential

472
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,573
in chemistry and also in biology.

473
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,451
Remember that if we think of

474
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,905
double stranded DNA, the two strands

475
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:51,960
are held together by very, very weak

476
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,130
interactions called hydrogen bonds.

477
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,199
It is only because there are
so many of them

478
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:58,062
that these two strands hold together.

479
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,648
So, characterizing hydrogen bonds

480
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,727
is actually quite important in chemistry.

481
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:05,075
And here we see an example,

482
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,616
or two examples, actually;

483
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,965
we see that the proton here, which is

484
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:10,954
sort of sharing it's attention between

485
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,596
two oxygens- I'm not saying it's

486
00:19:12,596 --> 00:19:14,377
symmetrically distributed.

487
00:19:14,377 --> 00:19:16,041
There's a proper bond to this oxygen

488
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,816
and a weaker bond to that oxygen-

489
00:19:17,816 --> 00:19:20,476
but you see that the electron cloud is

490
00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:22,486
very weak and very diminished

491
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:25,346
around that hydrogen, and therefore

492
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,176
it is very much deshielded, and in fact

493
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:30,606
its chemical shift is 11 
and something ppm.

494
00:19:30,621 --> 00:19:32,911
A more simple example here,

495
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,603
we see that this hydrogen really doesn't

496
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:37,189
know where it wants to go,

497
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,995
because the whole molecule can be redrawn

498
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,148
the double bonds can hop around, and

499
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:46,564
the net effect is that this
hydrogen is almost bare.

500
00:19:46,564 --> 00:19:48,056
There are almost no electrons

501
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,352
to shield it, and therefore

502
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:52,546
it turns out very heavily deshielded

503
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:56,215
because there are no 
electrons to shield it.

504
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:58,025
And that, of course, is characteristic

505
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,625
of such hydrogen bonds.

506
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,545
And as I said, we find similar things

507
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:07,865
in DNA, deoxyribonucleic acids, and also

508
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,050
in RNAs which are very popular today

509
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,340
to study by Bio-NMR.

510
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,960
Now, there's another picture which

511
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,630
I think is very instructive, and I must

512
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,980
say that Peter Hall did a tremendous job

513
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,440
in selecting good examples, and this is

514
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,970
the one of ethanol.

515
00:20:23,024 --> 00:20:25,044
Now ethanol, we all know, and some of us

516
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:28,207
know too well, which I can write it

517
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:33,187
like this, and I give it a little bend

518
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:36,167
because next to it, I shall be drawing

519
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:39,937
another ethanol molecule, very similar

520
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:43,937
structure but just drawn head to tail.

521
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:48,668
And this is known as an ethanol dimer.

522
00:20:48,668 --> 00:20:50,518
And it turns out that the dimer

523
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:52,162
holds together with

524
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:54,542
these two hydrogen bonds.

525
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:57,172
And because there are these intermolecular

526
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,172
hydrogen bonds, the electron density

527
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:04,054
around each of these two hydrogens

528
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,284
is very weak, very diminished

529
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,254
and we are, in effect, in a position

530
00:21:08,254 --> 00:21:10,464
similar to this, and so the chemical shift

531
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,514
of the hydrogen is very much to the left.

532
00:21:13,514 --> 00:21:16,004
Or, it's very deshielded.

533
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:18,814
Well, that's why in ordinary ethanol

534
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,724
if we have one mole of ethanol in a

535
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:26,114
product solvent such as tetrachlorocarbon

536
00:21:26,114 --> 00:21:32,304
then we have the OH, which as you can see,

537
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:35,351
appears about near 5 and something ppm.

538
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:39,447
But, as we dilute the ethanol to a tenth

539
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,767
of a mole per liter to a hundredths

540
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:44,337
to a thousandths, we see that the OH

541
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,657
resonance moves to the right.

542
00:21:46,657 --> 00:21:50,377
And that is because, as we dilute

543
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:54,957
we can break up this dimer so that

544
00:21:55,054 --> 00:21:57,234
it falls apart into monomers.

545
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,524
And because the solvent here,

546
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:03,594
the product solvent is unable of making

547
00:22:03,594 --> 00:22:06,014
any hydrogen bonds with either of these

548
00:22:06,014 --> 00:22:11,274
monomers, the hydrogen is less deplenished

549
00:22:11,274 --> 00:22:14,874
or its environment is less depleted

550
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:16,664
of electrons and therefore

551
00:22:16,664 --> 00:22:18,674
it's more shielded, and as you can see

552
00:22:18,674 --> 00:22:21,614
it moves toward lower ppm values,

553
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:23,584
lower chemical shifts.

554
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:25,654
Now, you will notice that this is not

555
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:27,717
an experimental spectrum.

556
00:22:27,717 --> 00:22:30,227
In fact there's no reference
given to it either in the book.

557
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,507
And the reason is that

558
00:22:31,507 --> 00:22:33,577
it's not so easy to observe this

559
00:22:33,577 --> 00:22:36,067
hydrogen because the hydrogen will also

560
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:38,207
exchange by chemical exchange,

561
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:40,347
and therefore, the very least that can

562
00:22:40,347 --> 00:22:42,077
happen is that it would be very broad,

563
00:22:42,077 --> 00:22:44,897
And sometimes it is also at a different chemical shift.

564
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,637
That depends on the entire structure.

565
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:49,487
But it's an interesting principle,

566
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,827
and the demonstration is very nicely done.

567
00:22:51,827 --> 00:22:53,947
Now, let me take you to one of the last

568
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:57,517
examples, and this is unpaired electrons.

569
00:22:57,517 --> 00:23:00,237
There are lots of systems

570
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:02,977
in organic chemistry, where we have

571
00:23:02,977 --> 00:23:05,817
free electrons or unpaired electrons.

572
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,467
In organic chemistry we call them radicals

573
00:23:08,467 --> 00:23:10,687
in metals we don't call them radicals.

574
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,527
Simply, they have electrons that are not

575
00:23:13,527 --> 00:23:16,747
paired up in pairs in individual orbitals.

576
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:20,097
Iron is a good example of an atom,

577
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:22,617
of a metal, that often has

578
00:23:22,617 --> 00:23:25,007
unpaired electrons.

579
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:26,287
Zinc, on the other hand,

580
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,119
has an even number of electrons

581
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:30,399
that are nicely paired up.

582
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:36,149
So, what you see here is a complex spectra

583
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,959
these are proton NMR spectra

584
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,769
of complexes such as this

585
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:44,619
where the four nitrogens hold the metal

586
00:23:44,619 --> 00:23:46,129
ion in the middle,

587
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:49,389
And this metal can be
either zinc or iron.

588
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,209
And what we actually observe is the

589
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:55,829
chemical shifts of this Hx here

590
00:23:55,836 --> 00:23:58,096
and of the Hy.

591
00:23:58,096 --> 00:23:59,946
As you go around the ring you will see

592
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,956
there's really only two chemical shifts-

593
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:05,956
they alternate, so there's 
two Hx's, an Hy--

594
00:24:05,956 --> 00:24:07,768
But that's not important here.

595
00:24:07,768 --> 00:24:09,858
The important part is that if we have zinc

596
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:12,401
in the center, then it's not paramagnetic.

597
00:24:12,401 --> 00:24:14,871
There are no free electrons, and we have

598
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,611
a simple case where all these are

599
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:20,111
aromatic protons and they resonate

600
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:22,411
somewhere between 8 and 9 ppm,

601
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:24,701
which is fine, nothing abnormal.

602
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,220
But, if we replace the zinc by iron-

603
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,326
Iron 2 I believe it's in this case-

604
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:33,698
then, we see tremendous change.

605
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:36,376
They are dramatically shielded,

606
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:38,046
one could say, or shifted

607
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:40,346
towards the right hand side in this scale.

608
00:24:40,346 --> 00:24:42,366
And X and Y no longer similar.

609
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:45,469
The near degeneracy that we have

610
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:47,799
in the zinc case is now lifted.

611
00:24:48,437 --> 00:24:54,407
Now this is due the coupling between
the free electrons and these protons.

612
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,157
A long range coupling which 
in fact is known as

613
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:07,262
hyperfine coupling and which leads

614
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:09,852
to a shift because the distribution

615
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:12,372
of the polarization between alpha and beta

616
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:15,362
states for an electron is not 50/50

617
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:18,102
but it's displaced towards the lowest

618
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,612
energy state following the Boltzmann rule.

619
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,102
And in fact it's the rapid transitions

620
00:25:23,102 --> 00:25:25,032
between electrons in the alpha

621
00:25:25,032 --> 00:25:26,382
and the beta state which

622
00:25:26,412 --> 00:25:28,612
give rise to an average chemical shift,

623
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,382
if you will, or an average position

624
00:25:30,397 --> 00:25:34,397
of the proton lines which depend

625
00:25:34,424 --> 00:25:36,834
on the environment.

626
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:40,834
So, to conclude this second chapter

627
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,994
of Peter Hall's little book, let's look

628
00:25:43,094 --> 00:25:44,804
at the summary that the author

629
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:45,954
has put together

630
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:47,384
at the end of the chapter.

631
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:49,904
First of all, we notice that nuclei

632
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:52,104
such as protons, are embedded

633
00:25:52,104 --> 00:25:54,854
in molecules, and that that they may have

634
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,924
slightly different NMR frequencies

635
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:59,004
depending on the environment,

636
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:00,814
an effect that is known as

637
00:26:00,814 --> 00:26:02,024
the chemical shift.

638
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:03,974
Such effects occur not only for protons,

639
00:26:03,974 --> 00:26:07,184
but also for carbon 13, nitrogen 15

640
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,644
phosphorus 31, and depending on

641
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,994
the sort of system that we're looking at

642
00:26:11,994 --> 00:26:14,534
silicon 29, and many other nuclei

643
00:26:14,534 --> 00:26:16,824
in the periodic table.

644
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:19,064
Chemical shifts arise from

645
00:26:19,064 --> 00:26:21,094
induced electronic currents

646
00:26:21,094 --> 00:26:23,734
which can either shield or deshield

647
00:26:23,734 --> 00:26:25,154
the nuclei from

648
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:27,234
the applied magnetic field.

649
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:29,844
The chemical shift parameter delta

650
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:32,924
is used to quantify the extent,
the degree,

651
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,684
of nuclear shielding or deshielding

652
00:26:35,684 --> 00:26:39,314
with respect to a conventional reference,

653
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:41,864
sometimes detramethylsiline

654
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:44,024
for protons and carbon

655
00:26:44,024 --> 00:26:45,904
and other nuclei have

656
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,064
different standards, of course.

657
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:53,034
So, the magnitudes of induced diamagnetic

658
00:26:53,034 --> 00:26:55,314
and paramagnetic currents

659
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:58,244
can be related to local electron densities

660
00:26:58,244 --> 00:27:01,504
and electronic excitation energies.

661
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,064
Chemical shifts can often be understood by

662
00:27:05,064 --> 00:27:06,594
considering the effects of

663
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:07,974
electron donating

664
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,394
and electron withdrawing groups

665
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,114
by looking at the effects

666
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:15,074
of induced currents in neighboring groups

667
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:17,704
such as triple bonds or aromatic rings,

668
00:27:17,704 --> 00:27:20,474
looking at charged or polar groups

669
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:22,894
at the role of hydrogen bonds

670
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:25,694
and of unpaired electrons

671
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:27,654
which have hyperfine couplings

672
00:27:27,654 --> 00:27:30,044
to the nuclei that we are looking at.

673
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:32,754
Chemical shifts distinguish nuclei

674
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:35,274
in different environments in molecules

675
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,554
and therefore give information

676
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:39,454
both on the molecular identity

677
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:42,254
and on the molecular structure.
