Welcome to the second chapter of our MOOC,
Massively Online Open Course, on basic steps in magnetic resonance.
Todayâ€™s chapter will be called chemical shifts.
So chemical shifts are indeed at the heart of magnetic resonance.
More specifically, they are essential for most applications of magnetic resonance to chemistry and to biology.
In physics, they are perhaps less important, although that can be argued.
In fact, the origin of this effect is what is known in good
English as serendipity and in bad English, sheer luck.
It was, in fact, discovered by mistake and against the wishes of the inventors, that is Proctor and Wu, who in the late 40s or early 50s, wanted to measure the gyromagnetic ratio of nitrogen.
More specifically, Nitrogen 14, which is a dominate isotope of nitrogen,
And to do so, they decided to take a material that would be full of nitrogen and their choice turned to ammonium nitrate which indeed has lots of nitrogen.
And to their distaste, they found, once they'd identified the nitrogen resonance, they found that there were in fact two peaks and not one.
Now we know that one of these nitrogen peaks come from the ammonium group and the other one from the nitrate group.
But they didn't want that.
They wanted just one peak and they wanted to measure the Gamma-- the gyromagnetic ratio.
The frequency of precession, the transition frequency in the absence of environment.
To them, the environment was just a nuisance.
So nitrate, ammonium, that was not their business.
They were not chemists.
And they wrote a paper.
They submitted a paper where they mentioned this effect as a dirt effect.
The editor then said, "Dirt effect is not a very scholarly expression.
Would you please propose another expression?"
And they said, "Well, let's call it a chemical shift."
And it has been a chemical shift ever since.
By the way, when I tell you anecdotes like this,
I'm not too sure that they are genuine, that they can be trusted.
Maybe the story was just made up by somebody else.
But, you know, â€œSe non Ã¨ vero, Ã¨ ben trovato.â€�
"If it isn't true, at least it's a nice story."
You can find many of such stories in the books of [Aberg Am], of Casimir, of many other scientists who have enjoyed themselves writing up their autobiographies and talking about the fun aspects of research.
We shall now discuss the second chapter of the book by Peter Hore, which is dedicated to chemical shifts.
So chemical shifts can be discussed in a purely empirical fashion as a phenomenon that can be observed without necessarily trying to explain it.
This, in fact, is a very important approach in chemistry and in biology.
Of course, scientists like to explain things.
And so they have thought about the origin of chemical shifts and they have tried to split these chemical shifts into different contributions.
And this is known as contribution to nuclear shielding.
In fact, nuclear shielding is another word for chemical shifts.
Weâ€™ll have a summary after that and then some exercises.
Perhaps the simplest explanation of nuclear shielding and chemical shifts is if we consider the example of simple gases, noble gases which are basically mono-atomic molecules such as helium.
In fact, the isotope 3 of Helium happens to have a spin <i>I = Â½</i>.
This is a guess, of course.
It can be hyper-polarized as we shall discuss later.
It can actually be used to do images of human lungs.
Likewise, we could also consider 129 Zenon which also has a spin Â½ and also is used for imaging of lungs of living humans.
Now, both have a spherical symmetry and both have a simple nucleus at the center and a cloud of electrons.
Of course, these electrons move all over the place, but there is a slight preference for them to move in a plane which is perpendicular to the external magnetic field.
So this field <i>B0</i> here, is the external magnetic field which is applied to the sample by the experimentalist usually generated by a large superconducting magnet to achieve a sufficiently intense field.
Now it turns out that this external magnetic field affects the electrons in such a way that there will be a slight preference for the electrons to move around such a trajectory which is perpendicular to the field and where the electrons move in such a way, that the field that they induce which is this B prime here-- this B prime, B prime, is the induced field-- the field induced by the circulating electrons.
And according to the law of Lenz, this induced field has a sign opposite to the external field.
The net effect is that the local field, which is sometimes just called-- this is the local field at the site of the nucleus-- is proportional to the external field, but there is an attenuation factor here which is written as <i>1 â€“ Ïƒ</i>.
If sigma is zero, which it often is in simple cases, then the local field is equal to the external field and thereâ€™s no problem.
But in many molecules, the sigma has different values depending on the environment, the chemical environment of the nucleus.
The same thing can be expressed not in terms of field but in terms of the NMR frequency.
So this the precession frequency of the transversed magnetization or also simply the energy of the transition between the bottom state and the excited state.
And we can see that this is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio, proportional to the external field attenuated by the circulated electrons and this attenuation is again expressed as <i>1 â€“ Ïƒ</i>.
We can also look at the same thing in terms of energy levels where we see that the bare nucleus has a transition frequency which is determined only by the applied magnetic field.
But as soon as the nucleus sits in an electron cloud, it is partly protected from the external field.
And therefore we have this shielding parameter, the nuclear shielding expressed by this attenuation factor here which precisely comes from the circulating electrons.
And as you can see, the splitting between the bottom and the top level is reduced because of that.
Now, chemical shifts, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, could be observed in many cases.
The one that I mentioned was
14 Nitrogen in an ammonium group and 14 Nitrogen in a nitrate group.
And as I said, the physicists who used this material were very disappointed to discover that these two nitrogens had different chemical shifts, as we now call them, or different environments.
But for the chemists, that of course, is wonderful because that allows us to distinguish them.
Now this is a typical NMR spectrum and you could imagine that this is the B and this is the A.
Or it could be any other molecule that has two distinct resonance frequencies.
In fact, a more popular, a more common case would be a proton NMR.
A proton NMR is by far the dominant version of magnetic resonance today in organic labs and particularly in chemistry.
And in proton NMR we have a range of roughly eight to ten ppm.
So this is the range of chemical shifts expressed in the parameter delta.
And we see that if we have some protons in different environments, in different solvents, for example this is benzene-- and this is-- well, different environments.
Tetramethylsilane is by definition used so that the origin of the scale is adjusted to be zero at the frequency of tms.
Now this delta scale here is defined more properly here.
It is simply the frequency of the transition minus a reference frequency.
So this would be for example the frequency of Benzine minus the frequency of tms divided by the frequency of the tms.
So typically this might be 400MHz and something minus 4 to 100 MHz a bit below.
Anyway, the reference frequency and the ratio, of course, is dimensionless.
It turns out that this dimensionless number tends to be rather small, on the order of 10 to the -6.
And, therefore, it is usually by convention multiplied by 10 to the 6 in order to get reasonable numbers.
And this gives you the definition of delta, known as the chemical shift to chemists.
And as you can see, it is a dimensionless number.
But it is usually specified that it is expressed in ppm to clarify.
I should warn you that in much of the physics literature, this convention is not the same.
They often use the parameter sigma, the nuclear shielding parameter and not the parameter delta defined as in this expression.
So what is true for the precession frequencies is also true for the shielding parameters.
And you can reformulate this equation by saying that this is now the sigma of the reference minus the sigma of the substance of interest.
And you will notice that this runs in the opposite direction.
The delta runs in the opposite direction as the scale of the shielding parameters, which gave rise to a great deal of confusion between the literature of the chemists and the literature of the physicists.
Now, chemical shifts are very often considered as empirical parameters without any attempt to explain them.
And as such, they are very well known.
Particularly to chemists and more specifically to organic chemists who have a tremendous ability, the good ones anyway, to recognize a molecule when looking at the NMR spectrum, the proton NMR spectrum.
This is not such an easy task.
You can see that the scale here goes from zero to 10.
And for example, we find the aromatic molecules,
I mean the protons attached to aromatic molecules span a considerable range.
Benzene is somewhere near seven and a quarter but depending on the environment, the shifts can cover quite a range.
It is even worse for hydroxy-aromatics, so aerials.
And you can see different molecules have different ranges.
We note amusing things.
For example, that the acetylenic proton, we shall refer to that later, is towards lower chemical shifts than the olefinic, which is kind of surprising.
This is due to a very peculiar effect sometimes called the neighboring group effect that we shall try to explain later on.
But basically this table is very important because most organic chemists have this, sort of, engraved in their brain and they go around the world remembering this all the time.
And if you know this very well and if youâ€™re very familiar with this kind of empirical material, it allows you to recognize the fingerprint of your molecule and determine exactly what it is.
Now there are other things.
For example, the amplitudes of the signals, more properly called the integrals, are proportional to the number of nuclei within the molecule.
Some examples here.
So this is trimethylbenzene.
And of course we have protons here, which are directly attached to the aromatic ring, so there are three of them, and theyâ€™re a total of three times three or nine methyl protons.
So the ratio of the methyl protons to the aromatic protons is three to one.
Nine to three is equal to three to one.
In the NMR spectrum, we shall see a weak peak here, close to 7 ppm and a much more intense peak, of three times more intense peak just above 2 ppm.
And the fact that they have these amplitude ratios confirms what I just told you, that there are indeed three aromatic protons.
These three here directly attached to the ring, and nine methyl protons.
The transition, so you should remember that we go from nine over three equal to three over one.
What you observe is this and what the chemist would like to know is this.
And it takes a bit of chemical intuition to go from three over one to nine over three.
We have another example here.
This is a tetramethylbenzene.
Now, of course, there are only two aromatic protons that remain and theyâ€™re a total of four times three.
So thatâ€™s 12 divided by two methyl protons.
So 12 methyl protons and two aromatic protons, and of course, the ratio is six to one.
And you can see that indeed we have the amplitude of the aromatic peak is one-sixth of the aliphatic peak.
So this kind of reasoning can be extended to many, many molecules.
In fact, these examples are a bit oversimplified.
They have been chosen.
They are not cheated.
They are genuine examples, but they have been chosen because these particular molecules do not feature any scale or couplings.
They do not have any multiplets and therefore, we can argue purely on the grounds of chemical shifts.
If we have a more serious molecule, such as a protein, then of course, we have many, many different chemical shifts, many environments.
This particular protein was popular in Oxford at the days of writing the book.
And it contains, in fact, 129 amino acids, which is a fairly small protein by biological standards.
But a large protein from the point of view of chemists, and also actually for NMR spectroscopists this represents a challenge.
129 amino acids means roughly that there are about 10 protons for each amino acid, sometimes some have more, some have less.
But roughly that means about 1,000 protons.
And indeed we have about
1,000 chemical shifts.
Some of them pile up so that you get a very messy profile here.
That means that many have been added on top of each other.
Others are quite nicely isolated.
I presume this is the sum of a few degenerate methyl groups.
And this looks like a rather isolated proton attached to a [inaudible], to a proton, to a nitrogen, excuse me.
Typically, we would write this something like this.
And this would probably be something like this.
And this is an example of two assignments, that is to say, the relationships between peaks and chemical units which are one of the great challenges of protein NMR spectroscopy.
But a great deal of progress has been made in this field, particularly by combining proton NMR with Carbon 13 NMR and with Nitrogen 15 NMR, by enriching the proteins with these stable isotopes and then recording so-called two-dimensional correlation spectra that allow one to assign-- each and every one of these peaks can be assigned and identified.
The next gives a rather exotic example, very far from biology, no proteins at all.
There is a substance.
This is actually a metal cluster, which contains four cobalt atoms and a bunch of carbon monoxide.
And the question is, what is the structure of this strange cluster?
And you could imagine something like this.
That we have the four methyls in a regular tetrahedron and that each of the four methyl is surrounded by a local little cloud of three carbon monoxides.
And the whole thing would have a symmetry, that of the point group of a tetrahedron.
If that were the case, then there would be all sort of symmetry elements, planes of reflection, rotation, all sorts of things.
And a conclusion of an analysis of the symmetry of this molecule is that there should be only one peak for all oxygens that you see.
And by the way, also only one peak for all the carbons and one peak for all the metals, if they happen to have a spin, cobalt for example.
Now it turns out that if we look at the Oxygen 17 spectrum, that there are not one but four peaks.
So we can safely say this is no good.
This can be ruled out because that particular simple symmetry is incompatible with the fact that there are four lines in the oxygen spectrum.
By the way, oxygen is a rather unusual nucleus.
It has a large quadrupole and the lines are rather broad because of rapid transverse relaxation.
And itâ€™s not your favorite molecule, your favorite isotope in the periodic table, but itâ€™s very nice in this illustration.
Now you can speculate about other systems.
This has a symmetry of D2D.
It has some so-called bridging carbonyls, which are here.
And it also has the so-called terminal carbonyls, which have a different environment, as you can see.
And from the structure of this, you conclude that there should be, I believe, two different peaks.
And this can also be ruled out.
Now when you look at this final one here, it turns out that here we have bridging carbonyls.
There are three of those.
And then you have some which are in a sort of apical position.
They point out away from the metal and theyâ€™re isolated.
Whereas, in this case, we have three carbonyls attached to the same methyl.
In this case, we have two carbonyls attached to the same methyl.
Iâ€™m not sure how to draw this but you see.
I should have changed the color actually.
Now, this molecule, therefore, is compatible with a spectrum, an oxygen spectrum, which has four distinct resonances.
Itâ€™s not easy to say which of these lines belong to which environment.
Thatâ€™s a difficult question and itâ€™s not the purpose of todayâ€™s lecture.
Now, this is an interesting case because it speaks of fullerenes, sometimes called buckminsterfullerenes or C60 as perhaps the most common expression.
And we now know that this is a icosahedral molecule where the carbons are arranged on the pattern of a football, and there are some surfaces that have a hexagonal environment and others a pentagonal environment.
Now what is remarkable about this molecule is that is has an extremely simple Carbon 13 spectrum.
In fact, you can convince yourself that it has a very high symmetry, an icosahedral symmetry, and that therefore, the chemical shifts of all Cs, full carbon atoms, should be the same.
And indeed the spectrum shows just a single line.
So the fact that that is a single line is a confirmation that the symmetry of the molecule must indeed be very simple.
Now this was not obvious at all.
When this material was discovered in 1919 by Harry Kroto in his environment, and his co-workers, this was still an uncertain matter and it was not at all clear that carbon could arrange itself in such a structure, such a strange molecule.
In fact, this molecule went unnoticed for about two centuries of modern chemistry, and therefore, itâ€™s quite remarkable that it was found so late in history.
Kroto, by the way, got a Nobel prize, probably mostly for this.
And if you are interested in the origin of such things,
I vividly recommend that you read this in <i>ChemComm</i>.
You can look it up following instructions that I will give somewhere else.
So letâ€™s take another example, which I think is very well chosen by Peter Hore from the vast literature that describes such effects.
And this example uses Phosphorus 31.
Thatâ€™s a very popular nucleus because it is very abundant.
In fact, that isotope is 
100 percent abundant.
Itâ€™s not radioactive, of course, stable and it is found almost everywhere in biology.
But it is also found in inorganic chemistry.
And the example studied here by Raymond Andrew, who is a very famous English NMR spectroscopist and physicist, in a paper that I vividly recommend you should read, he and his team studied this very simple molecule.
So this is phosphorus pentachloride.
If you consider that in solution, it is a bi-pyramidal affair, like this.
The phosphorus, of course, is in the middle and the five chlorine sit at the corners of this polygon.
And it turns out that thereâ€™s a high degree of symmetry, and that the phosphorus sits in the middle and is quite happy to be there.
It has only one chemical shift.
But if you precipitate this material and make a solid out of it, then the molecule actually disproportionates and gives you this anionic species and cationic species, so PCL 4 minus and PCL 6 plus.
And they have different chemical shifts.
In fact, it turns out that this one is shielded and this one is deshielded.
And this is then plotted on a ppm scale of delta of Phosphorus 31.
Actually, to record a Phosphorus 31 spectrum in a solid is not such a simple affair because as we shall see later, the phosphorus has an anisotropy of the chemical shift, and therefore, in a solid tends to give very broad lines.
And in order to get rid of this line broadening,
Andrew invented a wonderful experiment which is known as magic angle spinning that allows you to retrieve very narrow lines from spectra solids that otherwise would be broadened.
This is a very clever technique and Andrew deserves much credit for that.
This was one of the first applications of that technique.
Now there are also applications of Silicone 29 NMR.
And this is one that is of some industrial interest because we speak of aluminosilicates.
That is to say, porous solids that are built of aluminate units,
AlO4 and silicate units, SiO4.
In this notation I mean that the aluminium is surrounded by four oxygen atoms, roughly in a tetrahedral environment and a silicone likewise.
But together these make up a vast array of substances called aluminosilicates.
Some of which are found in nature.
Some of which are only made synthetically.
And many of which have interesting properties as heterogeneous catalysts because they have pores and molecules can enter into these pores and their chemical reactions can occur on the inner surfaces of these pores.
And the characterization of aluminosilicates is not an easy matter because as you can see at the periodic table, aluminum and silicone are very close together and they have roughly the same electron density around them.
So that makes it hard to distinguish them with x-ray spectroscopy.
But of course, in NMR, the Aluminum 27, which by the way has a quadrupolar spin, is completely different from the Silicone 29.
And what you see here, is a range of Silicone 29 spectra of different zeolites.
Zeolites are an important class of aluminosilicates with different ratios of silicone to aluminum.
So in the bottom case, we have mostly silicone and very little aluminum.
In the top case, they are about equal.
And what we see here is a distribution of different chemical shifts of Silicone 29 where if there is no aluminum in the neighborhood, then we have this line here.
If there is one aluminum next door, we have this line.
If there are two alumina next door, then we have this line.
If there are three, then we have the line to the left [inaudible].
Thereâ€™s actually one more over here, which is very weak.
So , the more aluminum, that is to say, the lower the ratio of silica to aluminum--
So we go up on this list, the more, of course, the distribution is favouring the line which corresponds to silica in the environment for alumimate centers.
Now, itâ€™s interesting to look at these distributions.
That is to say, the relative amplitudes because they give a very refined, a very subtle, very informative way of characterizing these zeolites or aluminosilicates that are so important in heterogeneous catalases and particularly frequency used in the petroleum industry for cracking of heavy natural oil to make convenient petrol or gas as the Americans say.
You can find more about this in this paper by Jacek Klinowski and Colin Fyfe and others.
As you can see, weâ€™ll try to provide the key to that in our supplement.
Now, there is here a more biological application but itâ€™s not just biological.
Itâ€™s really one of universal importance.
It was first described by Ian Campbell and Raymond Dwek.
Ian Campbell, incidentally, was teaching in Oxford and he was the co-examiner of my PhD.
I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve known him very well, but heâ€™s a charming person who unfortunately died a few years ago.
Raymond Dwek, as far as Iâ€™m aware, is still active in Oxford.
Now this discovery was very important.
This illustration is very important.
They were concerned with looking at histidine.
Now, histidine comes in two forms.
It can be either protronated, in which case itâ€™s called HisH+.
And what we mean is that they have a proton attached to this nitrogen.
In fact, the molecule looks a bit symmetrical or nearly symmetrical when itâ€™s protronated.
But of course, the proton can drop off, in which case itâ€™s in solution, and the nitrogen is then naked, so to speak, with a long pair sticking out here.
But this in itself is not something we wish to observe.
What we shall observe is the chemical shift of the proton which is attached to the neighboring carbon.
So here again, there is a chemical shift, of the proton attached to the neighboring carbon.
And it turns out that the chemical shift of this so-called C2 proton, or H2 proton, which is the one attached to the C2 carbon, is very sensitive to the question if itâ€™s protonated or not.
Now what you see here is spectra of histidine in its natural environment which is actually in haemoglobin.
So haemoglobin is the molecule protein that carries the oxygen in our blood and delivers the oxygen and delivers the oxygen to the organisms where it is needed.
And of course, itâ€™s very interesting to see what happens.
If the haemoglobin carries oxygen, then itâ€™s called oxi.
And if it has lost itâ€™s oxygen, itâ€™s called deoxi.
So theyâ€™re two different forms.
But even before we start about losing oxygen, letâ€™s talk about the deoxi version first.
We notice that the chemical shift of this proton here depends critically on the pH of the solution.
And we see here that the chemical shift as a fraction of pH can be used a little bit like we can use the potential of an electrode in a pH meter, in that we see that there is a sort of a point of inflection in this curve here and this point of inflection, that is to say where the derivative changes sign, is known as the <i>pk</i>.
And so we can determine the <i>pk</i> of this particular histidine but not just one histidine.
Itâ€™s in a histidine which is embedded in haemoglobin.
Now it turns out that if the haemoglobin is oxygenated, that is to say it carries oxygen, which is of course attached to the iron atom in the haem, well then it turns out that the <i>pk</i>-- we can do the same experiment again.
And as you can see, the <i>pk</i> is shifted from 7.9 to 6.8.
Thatâ€™s quite remarkable.
Now it turns out that this is an illustration of a very universal rule, which is that the average chemical shift, which is what you see along the vertical sail, so this is the average chemical shift, is made up of a mixture of the chemical shift of the protronated version, of this molecule here, plus a weighted average which also involves the chemical shift of the deprotronated molecule.
And this is very simple.
The protronated chemical shift is weighted with the concentration of the protronated histidine, and the deprotonated is weighted with that concentration.
And then you divide it by the sum of the two concentrations so that it becomes again a dimensionless quantity.
And then you have the average chemical shift, which is what we measure here.
So this is a weighted average.
Now itâ€™s done here, this equation is shown specifically for the case of histidine, but of course, it can be quite universal.
Itâ€™s true for any acid base equilibrium.
It is also true if we have multiple equilibria.
For example, if you have phosphoric acid, which can occur as PO4H3,
PO4H2, PO4H1, PO43-.
All of these forms have different chemical shifts and different concentrations, and therefore, the weighted average will depend on the pH and on the <i>pk</i>s and we can determine the <i>pk</i>s by measuring the chemical shift as a function of pH.
This is a very important observation, very universal in its applications.
So this concludes part one of this chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
