00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:08,222
Welcome back to part two of this chapter.

2
00:00:09,274 --> 00:00:13,444
We shall continue the
discussion of Chapter One

3
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:16,502
by showing 
the historical picture

4
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:21,522
of the spectrum of ethanol
recorded in 1951.

5
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:27,088
Different isotopes
may have different spins.

6
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:29,901
First of all, there are
quite a few isotopes,

7
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,791
such as the ubiquitous carbon-13,
which is found in all organic matter.

9
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:40,718
Oxygen-16, also all over the place,
has no spin at all,

10
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:43,183
although it has
a charged nucleus, of course.

11
00:00:43,183 --> 00:00:45,363
And the nucleus
may well be spinning around.

12
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:46,595
Why should it not?

13
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:49,925
Yet it does not have a spin and so
the magnetic quantum number

14
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,235
can only be zero

15
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:53,585
and there are no transitions.

16
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,205
One cannot do any NMR at all.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,930
There are a series
of important nuclei

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,840
that have a spin one-half
and that are actually very popular

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,813
in NMR spectroscopy
and MRI imaging.

20
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:10,178
Some nuclei, some isotopes

21
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:13,188
have a spin quantum number equal to one,

22
00:01:13,477 --> 00:01:17,547
mostly deuterium, nitrogen-14,

23
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,117
and lithium-6.

24
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:23,406
Some of them have a quantum
number I of three-halves.

25
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:30,383
Typical examples are boron-11,
sodium-23, chlorine-35 and chlorine-37.

26
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,029
By the way, sodium
can be nicely observed in NMR.

27
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:38,932
And then some have the spin five-halves,
such as oxygen-17

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,202
and aluminum-27 which is actually
very interesting to observe

29
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:45,022
in aluminosilicates.

30
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:47,545
Finally, some have a spin three.

31
00:01:47,545 --> 00:01:50,225
And there are some exotic
examples that go beyond.

32
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,541
Not only do they have spin,
but they have different gammas,

33
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,851
i.e., different gyromagnetic ratios.

34
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,982
The gyromagnetic ratio

35
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:03,462
is an inherent property
of different isotopes

36
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,961
The different gammas have been given using proper units

37
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:09,357
of inverse teslas and inverse seconds.

38
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:14,257
That means that if you
multiply them with 9.4 tesla,

39
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:19,246
the proton NMR frequency
appears at 400 MHz,

40
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:24,003
and the
deuterium NMR frequency

41
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:30,323
at about 61 MHz,
and carbon-13 near 100 MHz.

42
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:34,026
You should remember that there is
a factor of about one-quarter here

43
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:37,036
and you might also wish to remember
that there is a factor

44
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:43,336
of about one-tenth between the proton
and nitrogen-15 frequencies.

45
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:47,161
These frequencies have
been given

46
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:51,536
for a field of 9.4 tesla

47
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:56,678
because that is very common
in the current world of chemistry

48
00:02:56,678 --> 00:02:57,768
and physics.

49
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:00,629
There are many, many spectrometers
that operate at 400 MHz

50
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,329
because that is reasonably cheap
and yet very effective.

51
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,750
We also see that the natural
abundance of these isotopes

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,926
varies a great deal.

53
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:14,316
For example, deuterium
is only found in 0.015%

54
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:17,656
of ordinary sea or rain water.

55
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:20,199
So that's not very much
and you may wish to enrich it

56
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,159
if you want to observe deuterium.

57
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:24,916
Carbon-13 is about 1% abundant.

58
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,307
It can be observed directly
but, of course, you can boost it

59
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:33,957
by enhancing the population differences
or by labelling the molecules

60
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:35,377
with carbon-13.

61
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,361
Nitrogen-14 has nearly 100 % abundance
but is very difficult to observe

62
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,581
because it has a very large
quadrupole splitting.

63
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:44,641
As you can see,
nitrogen-14 has a spin I = 1.

64
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:47,768
And this is one of the isotopes we have
worked on in Lausanne

65
00:03:47,768 --> 00:03:49,248
over the last few years.

66
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,869
Nitrogen-15 is very popular
in biomolecules

67
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:57,209
because you can enhance it synthetically
by cloning techniques

68
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,159
in proteins

69
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:02,616
but it is still challenging.

70
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,415
Fluorine-19 is very popular
because it has a very high abundance,

71
00:04:06,415 --> 00:04:11,695
100%, and also because one
can find fluorine-19 in many

72
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:15,697
drug molecules but not in
natural living matter.

73
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:20,177
Silicone-29 is popular
for those studying silicates

74
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,447
and aluminosilicates.

75
00:04:21,632 --> 00:04:23,342
And phosphorus is very popular

76
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:27,082
in biochemistry because there are
many important phosphates

77
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:30,052
in living organisms.

78
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:35,241
So you see, every isotope has a
characteristic spin quantum number.

79
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,799
Now, there are some rules about
these quantum numbers.

80
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:42,349
For example, if the number of protons
and the number of neutrons

81
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:46,159
are both even, then the resulting
spin quantum number is zero.

82
00:04:46,534 --> 00:04:50,934
That is the case for carbon-12
and oxygen-16.

83
00:04:51,253 --> 00:04:53,843
But you can also have cases
where both protons

84
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:55,753
and neutrons appear in odd numbers.

85
00:04:56,225 --> 00:04:59,165
Then we have integer quantum numbers,

86
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,595
such as one, two or three.

87
00:05:00,595 --> 00:05:03,395
They can be even and odd
or odd and even

88
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:07,463
and in either case, we have
so called half-integer spins.

89
00:05:07,854 --> 00:05:10,274
Actually, these rules
are not particularly useful.

90
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:13,067
It is better to look at
the full table.

91
00:05:13,697 --> 00:05:16,947
The electromagnetic spectrum
is very wide.

92
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:21,078
It ranges from very high frequencies
and very short wave lengths

93
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,799
to very low frequencies
and very long wave lengths.

94
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:28,836
In spectroscopy, gamma rays are used

95
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:31,586
in Mössbauer spectroscopy
that uses very high energies,

96
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:36,595
higher than x-rays, which in turn
are more energetic than

97
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:39,072
ultra-violet and visible light.

98
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,740
Next we have the infra-red range

99
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,600
and below that the microwave range

100
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,060
and, much lower, we have the 
radio-frequency range.

101
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,130
This has several consequences.

102
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,600
First of all, radio-frequency fields
are largely innocuous.

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
Nobody really worries that when
you listen to a radio

104
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,390
that you might
get irradiated by the transmitters

105
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,810
or by the receivers. Indeed, radio-frequency
irradiation is quite innocuous,

106
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:07,066
which has great advantages for MRI.

107
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:12,786
Radio-frequencies also can penetrate
through all sorts of tissues

108
00:06:12,796 --> 00:06:14,396
including living humans.

109
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:18,396
Again, you can check with your radio
that it works even if you lie

110
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:22,056
on top of it, and that is one reason
why MRI is so popular.

111
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:26,003
Whereas imaging opaque
humans with visible light

112
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:27,543
is, of course, very difficult.

113
00:06:27,873 --> 00:06:30,703
NMR has other advantages

114
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:32,913
because we have a great
spread of frequencies.

115
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:37,553
On a scale where 400 MHz
corresponds to NMR of protons,

116
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,836
you see that fluorine-19
appears in the vicinity.

117
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:45,701
Phosphorous-31 is somewhat below
and then the ubiquitous

118
00:06:45,701 --> 00:06:49,065
carbon-13 appears at about 100 MHz.

119
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:53,356
But if we have a
high-resolution spectrometer

120
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:55,746
that can resolve different
chemical shifts,

121
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,827
then one can distinguish
various types of protons.

122
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:03,427
So for example, at the top end
we have aldehyde protons,

123
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,320
at the bottom end, aliphatic protons.

124
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,850
Zero ppm actually corresponds by convention
to tetramethylsilane (TMS).

125
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:15,907
This range spans about 4 kHz
out of 400 MHz

126
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,699
which corresponds to 10 ppm,

127
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,019
and indeed that is the common
scale used here.

128
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:24,923
So the frequencies of NMR transitions
are typically in the range

129
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,293
between 10 and 1,000 MHz.

130
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:30,345
Incidentally, the world's
most powerful machine

131
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:37,057
has indeed 1,000 MHz for protons.
You can visit it in Lyon in France.

132
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:42,399
We shall consider a nucleus
with a magnetic moment µ,

133
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:44,538
This magnetic moment is

134
00:07:45,435 --> 00:07:48,595
immersed in a magnetic field.

135
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:54,339
We can orient this magnetic field
so that it's parallel to the z-axis

136
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:56,839
or if you prefer, we can simply
align the z-axis

137
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,009
of our coordinate system
with the field.

138
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:03,709
In that case, all we have to worry about
is the product of the z component

139
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,919
of the magnetic moment and
the amplitude of the field.

140
00:08:08,142 --> 00:08:12,512
It turns out that this z component
is determined by the product of m,

141
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,190
the magnetic quantum number,

142
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,150
h-bar, Planck’s constant
divided by 2 pi,

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,860
gamma, the gyromagnetic ratio,
and the amplitude of the field.

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,990
Remember that m
can be plus or minus one-half.

145
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:30,838
If I is equal to one-half,

146
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:35,858
m is either
plus or minus one half.

147
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,080
The splitting in energy
is simply

148
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,000
h-bar times the absolute
value of gamma times B.

149
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:48,572
And the NMR frequency
is the same as the splitting

150
00:08:48,572 --> 00:08:54,392
divided by h, and

151
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,025
divided by two pi.

152
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:00,274
Now for a spin one-half, we have either

153
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,497
m equal plus one-half
and we call this the alpha level,

154
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,579
or we have m equal minus one-half
and we call this the beta level

155
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,349
and we have a single transition.

156
00:09:10,034 --> 00:09:12,934
So this is the case for a spin one-half.

157
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:16,931
But if we have a spin one,
such as for deuterium

158
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:21,791
or for nitrogen-14,
then we have three possibilities.

159
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:26,561
We have m = either minus one,
or zero, or plus one,

160
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,273
and indeed we have three different levels.

161
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:33,374
It turns out that the obvious
nomenclature alpha, beta, gamma

162
00:09:33,374 --> 00:09:35,034
is not common in our business,

163
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,114
so we just use these quantum numbers.

164
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,880
If a nucleus with I = 1,
which could be a deuterium

165
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:48,218
or a nitrogen-14, is dissolved
in an isotropic liquid,

166
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,905
then it turns out that the

167
00:09:50,935 --> 00:09:53,635
energy splitting between the top
and middle levels

168
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,615
is exactly the same as the energy
splitting between the middle

169
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:57,715
and bottom levels.

170
00:09:57,715 --> 00:10:00,325
So these two transitions are degenerate.

171
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,994
When we see a single line like this,
actually half of it

172
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,304
comes from the top transition

173
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:06,994
and half from the bottom transition.

174
00:10:07,978 --> 00:10:10,058
Whereas in this case, for protons,
for example,

175
00:10:10,058 --> 00:10:12,088
there is really only one transition.

176
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:16,613
So let's attempt to summarize
the main points

177
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:18,563
of the introductory chapter.

178
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:23,022
First of all, every isotope
in the periodic table

179
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:26,836
has a characteristic spin
quantum number I.

180
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:30,494
Some isotopes have I = 0,

181
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:33,254
in which case it is
just impossible to do NMR.

182
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,271
This is the case for carbon-12

183
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:39,871
and the only way to rescue the situation
is by replacing carbon-12 nucleus

184
00:10:39,885 --> 00:10:41,365
by a carbon-13.

185
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:45,707
Every isotope with I
different from zero

186
00:10:46,006 --> 00:10:49,046
has a characteristic magnetic moment µ.

187
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:54,837
Nuclear spins have 2I + 1
distinct energy levels

188
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,190
labelled by magnetic

189
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,720
quantum numbers m,

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,750
which can vary from minus I
to plus I, in steps of one.

191
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:09,913
In a magnetic field,
the energy levels are split

192
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,380
by an amount that is proportional

193
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,720
to the size of the nuclear magnetic moment

194
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:18,389
and to the strength of the magnetic field.

195
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:24,246
NMR spectroscopy uses
electromagnetic radiation

196
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:27,776
to induce transitions
between energy levels.

197
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,369
The frequencies of NMR transitions
are typically in the range

198
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:35,169
between 10 and 1,000 MHz.

199
00:11:35,665 --> 00:11:40,335
The intensities of NMR signals
depend on the differences

200
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:43,095
of the populations of the energy levels.

201
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:46,523
These populations are determined
by Boltzmann’s law,

202
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:51,293
thus by the temperature, by the field
and by the gyromagnetic ratio

203
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:55,874
and all of these parameters conspire
to make NMR a rather

204
00:11:55,883 --> 00:12:00,453
insensitive technique.  This is
in fact Achilles’ heel of NMR.

205
00:12:00,503 --> 00:12:03,373
One often needs
very concentrated samples

206
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:07,734
or very long experimental times
to get decent signals and

207
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,164
sufficient information.

208
00:12:09,164 --> 00:12:14,254
And this is one of the reasons
why so many NMR spectroscopists

209
00:12:14,386 --> 00:12:16,955
are trying to improve the methods.

210
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:18,075
Thank you.
