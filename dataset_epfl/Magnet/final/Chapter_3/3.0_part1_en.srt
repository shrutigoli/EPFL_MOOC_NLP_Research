00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,051
Welcome to our
massively on-line open course

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,675
on basic steps on magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:17,997
Today, we shall be talking
about spin-spin couplings

4
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:23,317
that are the subject of chapter three
of Peter Hore's book.

5
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:27,363
The appearance of multiplets
in NMR spectra is familiar

6
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:33,105
to all practitioners of analytical NMR,
familiar to virtually all chemists,

7
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:37,147
to many biologists,
and even to physicists.

8
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:40,715
However, not all of them
are aware of the subtle aspects

9
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,843
of multiplet structures.

10
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,227
Spin-spin couplings were
originally discovered

11
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:52,106
by serendipity in the 1950’s
by Erwin Hahn.

12
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:56,622
He noticed that
spin echoes were modulated.

13
00:00:56,622 --> 00:01:00,126
This observation came shortly
after Hahn's invention or

14
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,805
his discovery of spin echoes.

15
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:06,320
More about this subject in chapter six.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,565
Such echo modulations
can be observed

17
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:12,752
even when the homogeneity
of the static field is too poor

18
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:15,295
to resolve the multiplet structures,

19
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:19,967
as indeed was usually the case
in the 1950’s.

20
00:01:19,967 --> 00:01:23,279
Scalar couplings have a few
important properties.

21
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,265
First of all, they are “isotropic”.

22
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:28,069
That means that they do not
depend on the orientation

23
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:31,687
of the molecule with respect
to the external field.

24
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,020
They are also field independent,

25
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,538
that is to say, they have the same
magnitude at, say, 400 or 800 Mz.

26
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:43,896
They are mediated by electrons
via the so-called Fermi interaction,

27
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:48,209
and are said to be through-bond
as opposed to through-space.

28
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:51,921
It is still a challenge today
to calculate scalar coupling constants

29
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,757
with reasonable accuracy.

30
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:59,298
If the coupling constants are known,
the multiplets that due to scalar couplings,

31
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,807
can be predicted
with remarkable accuracy

32
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:06,142
by simple diagonalization
of the matrix representation

33
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:09,508
of the Hamiltonian in the product base.

34
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,629
The agreement between theory
and experiment is viewed by some

35
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:17,905
as a nice confirmation that
quantum mechanics actually works

36
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,027
perfectly in this case.

37
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:22,907
This perfection is due to the fact
that Hilbert space,

38
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:27,725
i.e., the space that comprises
all spin states, is of finite dimension.

39
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,646
Multiplets due to scalar couplings
give crucial information

40
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:32,994
about molecular symmetry.

41
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:38,273
They offer a great opportunity
to practice group theory.

42
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:42,155
Multiplets that are due to scalar couplings,
give unique insight into

43
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:46,524
populations of rotamers, and into
their inter-conversion.

44
00:02:46,524 --> 00:02:50,430
Another fascinating aspect is that
averaging allows the chemist

45
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,963
to grasp the flexible,
and generally speaking,

46
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:57,257
dynamic nature of most molecules.

47
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:02,568
Chapter three of Peter Hore's
book on nuclear magnetic resonance,

48
00:03:02,568 --> 00:03:06,903
is dedicated to spin-spin couplings.

49
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:10,653
In his characteristic fashion,
Peter Hore speaks first about

50
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:15,470
the manifestations of couplings
in an empirical fashion.

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,784
Next, he proceeds to explain
where they really come from.

52
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:24,146
These aspects are treated
one after the other.

53
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:27,776
So multiplets, particularly
those in proton NMR spectra,

54
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:30,821
are quite familiar
to the practicing chemist,

55
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:34,196
particularly to organic chemists
because multiplets allow them

56
00:03:34,196 --> 00:03:39,367
to identify fragments of the
molecules they are trying to analyze,

57
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:43,263
that they have synthesized
or hope to synthesize.

58
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:48,583
We shall start with the
important example of ethanol,

59
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,300
but now observed in a magnetic field

60
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,515
of a modern magnet that has
a sufficient homogeneity

61
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:58,353
so that we can not only
resolve the three chemical shifts

62
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:03,710
of the OH, methylene and methyl protons,
but also their fine structure.

63
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,411
This fine structure is due
to scalar couplings.

64
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:12,106
As most chemists
will know, the CH2 signal

65
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:16,256
is split into a quartet
because the CH2 group

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,964
has a CH3 group as neighbour.

67
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:21,914
While the CH3 group
is split into a triplet,

68
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:24,655
because its neighbour
is a CH2 group.

69
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:27,648
This kind of logic has become
instinctive for many chemists,

70
00:04:27,648 --> 00:04:30,667
but in fact, it's not so easy to explain.

71
00:04:30,667 --> 00:04:33,860
And one of our objectives
is to go into some detail

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,394
in the course of this chapter.

73
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:41,555
Multiplets are perhaps best explained
in so-called hetero-nuclear systems

74
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:45,065
where we have for example,
one proton, which has a spin 1/2

75
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,792
with two states, alpha and beta.

76
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:51,518
And one carbon-13, also
with two states, alpha and beta.

77
00:04:51,518 --> 00:04:55,402
We can take a molecule,
which only contains two such spins.

78
00:04:55,402 --> 00:05:01,672
For example, the conjugate base
of formic acid, or formate, if you will,

79
00:05:01,672 --> 00:05:05,631
with a singe proton and a single carbon-13.

80
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:10,278
About 1% in natural abundance,
or up to 100% if we enrich

81
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:13,743
the material.

82
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,234
There are two spectra.

83
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:21,183
If we take a field of 9.4 tesla,

84
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:26,595
the proton appears 
in the vicinity of 400 MHz,

85
00:05:26,595 --> 00:05:29,968
while the carbon-13 appears

86
00:05:29,968 --> 00:05:33,505
in the vicinity of 100 MHz.

87
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:36,607
In both cases, however,
we do not see singlets,

88
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:37,858
but we see doublets.

89
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:40,312
So the proton signal
is split into a doublet

90
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,236
and so is the carbon signal.

91
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:44,236
It turns out that the two splittings

92
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,326
are exactly the same.

93
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:48,554
If we wonder where this comes from,
we have to look

94
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:50,493
at the energy-level diagram.

95
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:54,080
Remember that spectral transitions,
i.e., the lines in the spectrum

96
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,738
always correspond
to differences in energies.

97
00:05:57,738 --> 00:06:03,172
If we consider a single isolated proton,

98
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:05,671
its polarization can be parallel
with the magnetic field.

99
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,800
We call this the alpha state.

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,420
Or it can be anti-parallel, in which
case we call it the beta state.

101
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,022
Of course, between the two energy levels,
there is only one transition

102
00:06:15,022 --> 00:06:17,124
which is near 400 megahertz.

103
00:06:17,124 --> 00:06:21,662
And consequently, we observe
a singlet.

104
00:06:21,662 --> 00:06:25,553
But if we now have a carbon-13
in the vicinity, it turns out that

105
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:28,771
that carbon-13 itself can be in the alpha or beta states.

106
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:32,115
And in this case, we assume
that the carbon-13 is in the beta state,

107
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:35,107
that is to say, in
an anti-parallel configuration.

108
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:38,248
And remains in this
anti-parallel configuration

109
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:42,553
while the proton is
undergoing a transition.

110
00:06:42,553 --> 00:06:46,475
It is a manifestation of the scalar coupling,

111
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:49,587
that the splitting between
these two states is larger than

112
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:53,468
the splitting between the two states
in the absence of a carbon-13.

113
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,944
Conversely, if we consider
a carbon which is polarized

114
00:06:56,944 --> 00:07:01,601
parallel to the magnetic field,
i.e., in the alpha configuration,

115
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:05,646
then it turns out that the splitting
between the two levels, where the proton

116
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:09,940
flips from parallel
to anti-parallel, is reduced.

117
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,168
If we think of the spectrum,
the splitting is enhanced

118
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,672
from here to here.

119
00:07:15,672 --> 00:07:20,294
Consequently, the line moves from
the central frequency to higher frequencies.

120
00:07:20,294 --> 00:07:24,045
Remember that frequencies
run from right to left,

121
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,731
in NMR by convention.

122
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:30,316
On the other hand, the other line
has a reduced energy splitting

123
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,855
and therefore, a lower frequency.

124
00:07:31,855 --> 00:07:36,188
So this line turns out
to be on the right-hand side.

125
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:41,144
The effect of the scalar coupling,
more specifically the one-bond scalar coupling,

126
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:44,030
because there's only one bond
between these two nuclei

127
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,569
in formate, is to split the line
of the proton into a doublet.

128
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:55,913
And likewise, through a similar argument,
to split the carbon-13 line into a doublet

129
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:57,982
with this same spacing.

130
00:07:57,982 --> 00:08:02,362
We can generalize the argument

131
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:05,362
and include

132
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:09,894
arbitrary energies and arbitrary
numbers of spins.

133
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:13,172
For example, we consider
the energy of an arbitrary state.

134
00:08:13,172 --> 00:08:16,797
Now we have many states
and these states are

135
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:21,279
specified by magnetic quantum numbers,
lowercase <i>m</i>, which

136
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,256
which can be either

137
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:30,746
plus 1/2, or minus 1/2.

138
00:08:30,746 --> 00:08:37,100
Each energy level
is specified by two quantum numbers

139
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,060
and each of them can be
either plus or minus 1/2.

140
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,525
Having said that,
the energy level diagram

141
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:48,678
is primarily determined by
this expression.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,508
This is the Larmor frequency
of spin A.

143
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:57,775
And that is
the Larmor frequency of spin X.

144
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:02,779
This is
Planck's constant,

145
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:07,560
the energy is expressed in joules, as it should be

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,573
in the international system.

147
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:14,959
Though, in practice, NMR spectroscopists
often express their frequencies in hertz (Hz),

148
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,420
which you can achieve by dividing
the energies by Planck's constant (h).

149
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:25,285
So we often write things is hertz,
which amounts to energy divided by Planck’s constant.

150
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:30,661
In this equation, the energy is
expressed correctly in terms of joules.

151
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:34,121
You see that the main effect
comes from the offsets,

152
00:09:34,121 --> 00:09:35,962
i.e., from the chemical shifts.

153
00:09:35,962 --> 00:09:39,312
But this perturbing
term is due to

154
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,221
the scalar coupling between A and X.

155
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:46,343
It turns out that if <i>m</i>A and <i>m</i>X
have the same sign,

156
00:09:46,343 --> 00:09:51,375
we have a positive contribution.

157
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:56,414
If they have opposite sign,
we have a negative contribution.

158
00:09:56,414 --> 00:09:59,047
We see this
very nicely on this diagram.

159
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:02,286
First of all, we start with a
molecule in the absence

160
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:03,775
of a magnetic field.

161
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:06,952
Then we switch on the field
for the A nucleus, so that we see a splitting.

162
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:11,399
This is the Zeeman splitting
of spin A, which could be a proton.

163
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,905
Then we have another
Zeeman splitting for spin X,

164
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,970
typically a carbon-13


165
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,063
The ratio of this splitting to this splitting
should be equal to the ratio

166
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:22,419
of the gamma of carbon-13 divided
by the gamma of the protons.

167
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:24,353
The effect of the coupling is

168
00:10:24,353 --> 00:10:29,654
to increase this energy, because
the two magnetic quantum numbers

169
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:37,111
are minus 1/2 times minus 1/2,
which is plus 1/4.

170
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,156
So we have an increase here.

171
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:43,906
And here, because we have
a product of minus 1/2 and plus 1/2,

172
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:45,939
the product will be minus 1/4.

173
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,945
And indeed, the energy
decreases like this.

174
00:10:48,945 --> 00:10:54,518
Here, it's again minus 1/4.

175
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:59,198
And here, it's plus 1/4, 
and indeed, the energy goes up.

176
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:04,097
This is clearly a consequence
of this equation.

177
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,670
In practice, we see that for

178
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,608
the A transitions, in the absence
of a J-coupling,

179
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:17,921
there would be just one line for spin A,
i.e., for the proton.

180
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:20,072
And another line for the carbon-13.

181
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:24,562
But as soon as we introduce
this J interaction, the A signal

182
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:28,071
splits up into doublet,
and the X signal also splits up

183
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,793
in a doublet with equal spacing.

184
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:34,082
In this diagram, Peter Hore

185
00:11:34,082 --> 00:11:39,471
has aligned these arrows
with the lines in the spectrum.

186
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:44,142
And this logic has been
used throughout.

187
00:11:44,142 --> 00:11:47,505
It is interesting to notice that
Peter Hore likes to draw

188
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:50,328
energy level diagrams
in this vertical fashion.

189
00:11:50,328 --> 00:11:55,086
Many NMR spectroscopists are tempted
to draw a diagram more 

190
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:58,007
in the fashion of a lozenge,
where these would be

191
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,585
the transitions of one spin,

192
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,394
and these the transitions
of the other spin.

193
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:06,978
Some of us
think it's easier to remember this.

194
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:09,871
This is for
a homo-nuclear system.

195
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:13,406
For a hetero-nuclear system,
you would have large transitions

196
00:12:13,406 --> 00:12:19,281
for spin A, and smaller transitions,
i.e., smaller energy differences, 

197
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,860
for the X transitions.

198
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,516
Some people prefer drawing
a lozenge rather than a

199
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:29,121
vertical “ladder” representation.

200
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:34,940
In larger spin systems,
with three or more spins,

201
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,221
we have more complicated multiplets.

202
00:12:37,221 --> 00:12:42,059
The multiplet patterns
can be “built up”, as it were,

203
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:48,483
from different splittings that are
invoked one after the other

204
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:52,915
in a sort of cascade of splittings,
sometimes called a 'tree'.

205
If we have a given spin that

206
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:01,532
resonates at a chemical shift A,
it will be split into a doublet

207
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,844
if we have a neighbouring spin M
with a coupling JAM.

208
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:09,524
And this doublet will be
split into a sub-doublet

209
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:13,335
by spin X with a coupling AX.

210
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:20,288
If we assign different

211
00:13:20,288 --> 00:13:23,288
transitions to different polarizations,

212
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:26,622
it turns out that the left-most
line of a multiplet,

213
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:29,994
if all couplings are positive,
corresponds to a situation

214
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:32,626
where both M and X have negative m,

215
00:13:32,626 --> 00:13:35,957
i.e., are both in the beta configuration.

216
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:42,454
For the second line from left,
spin M is still in the beta position,

217
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,907
but X has flipped over
from beta to alpha.

218
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:48,951
The transitions can be assigned in this manner.

219
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:53,295
This is a rather elaborate
way of interpreting

220
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:58,848
the different components
of a multiplet in terms of states.

221
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:01,562
At this level,
that one cannot describe all
***
222
00:14:01,562 --> 00:14:03,730
energy level diagrams like this.

223
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,808
For example, for a two-spin system,
it would look like this.

224
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:11,034
If we have a third system,
it would be like this.

225
00:14:11,034 --> 00:14:15,794
We have two lozenges,
and we can connect them like this.

226
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:21,557
It turns out that four parallel
transitions of the cube correspond

227
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:24,886
to transitions of spin A.

228
00:14:24,886 --> 00:14:29,099
For example, these could be
the transitions of spin A

229
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:33,050
and the other transitions would be
those of spin M and spin X.

230
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,422
One of the purposes
of this picture

231
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:41,533
is to show that under certain circumstances,
the couplings J-AM and J-AX

232
00:14:41,533 --> 00:14:43,645
may become equivalent.

233
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:49,329
Spin A can be coupled to a spin X,

234
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,779
and to another spin X, and in such a way
that the two coupling constants

235
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,790
are accidentally, or by symmetry, equal.

236
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,913
In this case, we have only one J,
and it's called JAX.

237
00:15:02,913 --> 00:15:05,160
And you can see
what happens in this diagram,

238
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,563
the inner transtions of these
two doublets are

239
00:15:08,563 --> 00:15:11,756
shifted on top of each other
and become degenerate.

240
00:15:11,756 --> 00:15:14,106
This degeneracy means
that the central line is

241
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:18,774
twice as intense as the
individual lines.

242
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:21,578
We can take this
one step further.

243
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:24,602
We can consider the case
where A is coupled

244
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:31,052
to three different nuclei,
all with the same coupling constant.

245
00:15:31,052 --> 00:15:33,864
This is known as an AX3 system.

246
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:38,457
In this case, we have
a quadruplet with a so-called

247
00:15:38,457 --> 00:15:40,973
binomial intensity distribution.

248
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:46,491
And each line can be assigned to the 
polarizations of the neighbouring X nuclei.

249
00:15:46,491 --> 00:15:51,285
These multiplet patterns can be

250
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,929
generalized in terms of Pascal's triangle,

251
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:00,288
which is a simple way of rationalizing
a binomial distribution.

252
00:16:00,288 --> 00:16:03,758
You probably know how
Pascal’s triangle is built up.

253
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:06,244
For example, this number three

254
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:08,930
is just the sum of numbers
one and two on the line above.

255
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,108
You can use that rule
systematically all the way down.

256
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:15,534
What you obtain
are binomial distributions,

257
00:16:15,534 --> 00:16:21,048
the distributions
for different spin systems.

258
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:27,188
This is an A spin
in AX2, AX3, … systems.

259
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,506
You may think this is
purely formal,

260
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,091
but, in fact, it is not.

261
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,465
The rules go a long way further.

262
00:16:33,465 --> 00:16:36,985
You could, for example,
consider a situation where

263
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:40,282
we have a silicon-29 nucleus
which has a spin 1/2,

264
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:43,976
which is surrounded by
four methyl groups.

265
00:16:43,976 --> 00:16:48,456
This substance is called TMS,
or tetramethylsilane.

266
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:51,812
There are 3 x 4 = 12

267
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,910
equivalent protons.

268
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,185
So the system is actually
an AX12 system, and you

269
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:01,649
can imagine that you have
to expand Pascal’s triangle

270
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:04,785
a very long way to go that far.

271
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:08,764
By the way, these intensity rules
are not always easy

272
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:11,438
to identify on a spectrum because 

273
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,978
the outer lines are very weak compared

274
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:15,182
to the central lines.

275
00:17:15,182 --> 00:17:17,873
Sometimes you just
don't see the outer lines.

276
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:21,291
And one way of not being fooled
by the fact that the outer lines

277
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:25,215
may be drowned in the noise,
is to compare the lines

278
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,046
of the central components.

279
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:31,958
In this case, we have 15:20:15,
which is, of course, distinct from 1:2:1.

280
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:37,396
And therefore, we can identify on which
level of the Pascal’s triangle we are,

281
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:45,188
without actually identifying the full list of lines.

282
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:49,483
There are many cases
where couplings involve nuclei,

283
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:54,900
so-called quadrupolar nuclei,
which have spin quantum number I,

284
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,803
larger than 1/2.

285
00:17:56,803 --> 00:18:00,665
The simplest example being
the deuterium nucleus, which has a spin I = 1.

286
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,183
The nitrogen-14 nucleus also has a spin I = 1.

287
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,700
Lithium-6 also has a spin I = 1.


288
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,073
Not to mention all the higher spins.

289
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,227
Now let's take a simple example
where we consider a carbon-13

290
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:18,697
attached to a deuterium nucleus.

291
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,404
We call the carbon nucleus-13 spin X,

292
00:18:23,404 --> 00:18:27,611
while the deuterium nucleus
will be called spin A.

293
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:30,596
In the energy-level diagram

294
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:37,220
for the deuteron, which has I = 1,

295
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,842
the magnetic quantum
number m can be either

296
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:45,902
-1, or 0, or +1.

297
00:18:45,902 --> 00:18:48,823
We find three levels corresponding

298
00:18:48,823 --> 00:18:51,897
to m = -1, or 0, or +1,

299
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,765
the magnetic quantum numbers of the deuteron.

300
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,354
This transition is actually

301
00:18:56,354 --> 00:18:59,380
degenerate with this transition


302
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,400
of the deuteron.

303
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,943
If we are in isotropic phase,


304
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,522
there is actually no evidence
that this is a quadrupolar nucleus.

305
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,555
But if we look at the carbon-13 multiplet, 
we have

306
00:19:10,555 --> 00:19:14,968
to take into account that there is
a splitting.

307
00:19:14,968 --> 00:19:19,008
Let's call

308
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,471
this quantum number S
to avoid confusion.

309
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,119
In this case, m can be
m = -1/2, or m = +1/2.

310
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,536
These can be called
beta or alpha states.

311
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:38,363
Now we have
six energy levels, with

312
00:19:38,363 --> 00:19:40,638
a certain number of transitions.

313
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,462
We see on the carbon-13 side,
i.e., on the X side,

314
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,495
three transitions.
These are nicely aligned

315
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,282
with these peaks.

316
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:52,314
There is a direct relationship between

317
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,732
the energy level diagram
and the spectrum.

318
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,944
Some people say that
a spectrum is nothing else

319
00:19:56,944 --> 00:20:00,490
but a peculiar “projection”
of the energy-level diagram.

320
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,540
If we look at the A side,

321
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,372
it turns out that these lines
are still rigorously degenerate,

322
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,202
since they have exactly the same frequency.

323
00:20:09,202 --> 00:20:13,107
So they end up as a doubly
degenerate line.

324
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:17,436
Likewise, these two transitions
are exactly degenerate

325
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:21,920
and pile up on top of each other
to give a doubly-degenerate line.

326
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,352
The remarkable thing
is that for the X nucleus,

327
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:28,621
i.e., of the carbon-13 nucleus, we don't
have a binomial triplet,

328
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:33,342
but we have a triplet with
equal intensities 1:1:1.

329
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:37,515
There are many other quadrupolar nuclei.

330
00:20:37,515 --> 00:20:41,397
We have the example of boron-11, which has

331
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:44,162
a spin quantum number I = 3/2

332
00:20:44,162 --> 00:20:49,611
The magnetic quantum number m of boron-11
can go from m = - 3/2

333
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:55,175
to m = - 1/2, m = + 1/2,and
finally m = + 3/2.

334
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:59,450
So there are four distinct
quantum states for each boron-11.

335
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,569
Consider this peculiar molecule,
known as diborane,

336
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,635
which comes from the condensation
of two BH3 molecules.

337
00:21:07,635 --> 00:21:14,403
We have twice BH3 that give a B2H6.

338
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:17,892
The structure of this B2H6

339
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:21,538
is a rather peculiar assembly,

340
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,127
where we have 4 so-called
terminal protons.

341
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:29,124
Each of these terminal protons
only “sees” one boron-11.

342
00:21:29,124 --> 00:21:33,573
(Incidentally, we assume that
boron-10 has been removed

343
00:21:33,573 --> 00:21:38,192
by suitable synthetic preparation.)

344
00:21:38,192 --> 00:21:40,753
Now each proton sees
just one boron-11,

345
00:21:40,753 --> 00:21:44,089
and consequently the terminal
protons are split up into

346
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:46,240
a quartet of four equal lines.

347
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,499
This is a non-binomial
1:1:1 quartet.

348
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:56,629
that is characteristic of
any nucleus coupled

349
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:58,999
to a spin 3/2 nucleus.

350
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:02,160
But more peculiar is what happens
if we look at the bridging protons.

351
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,787
These protons actually
have equal bonds to two borons,

352
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:07,805
and also equal scalar couplings.

353
00:22:07,805 --> 00:22:09,900
In fact, the whole molecule

354
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,263
is completely symmetrical.

355
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:16,482
And these protons and these
borons are magnetically equivalent.

356
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,653
If we want to understand
the fine structure

357
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,733
of the multiplet of the bridge proton,

358
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:29,226
we have to divide the signal
into four equal peaks,

359
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:34,276
and each of them has to be
subdivided again into four equal peaks.

360
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:37,797
Because the two couplings
are equivalent,

361
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:43,318
like in AX2 and AX3 systems, 
 

362
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:46,591
there are two
ways of getting to this line:

363
00:22:46,591 --> 00:22:48,913
either from here, or from here.

364
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:54,255
And therefore, the intensity of this line
is twice as high as the first line.

365
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,731
So we have rather peculiar multiplets,

366
00:22:56,731 --> 00:23:04,790
with relative intensities 1:2:3:4:3:2:1,

367
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,620
which is
not a binomial multiplet.

368
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,217
This does not fit into
the logic of Pascal's triangle.

369
00:23:10,217 --> 00:23:12,280
But you see where this comes from.

370
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,781
By way of exercise,
I would like to encourage you

371
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:17,299
to think of the next level.

372
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,509
What happens if a proton
were coupled to three boron nuclei?

373
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:24,110
Then of course, we have
an even more complex multiplet.

374
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,934
The challenge is
to determine its multiplicity.

375
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:30,752
This is not an academic question,
since there are actual molecules

376
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:32,885
that have such patterns.

377
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,982
So this concludes part one
of this chapter.

378
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,580
Thank you for you attention.
