00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:08,828
Welcome to our MOOC
on magnetic resonance.

2
00:00:09,118 --> 00:00:12,158
This is the second half
of chapter three

3
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:16,526
where we shall speak
about spin-spin couplings.

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:21,654
We should address the tricky
issue of ‘equivalent nuclei’.

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:25,617
It turns out that these are very nicely
described in Peter Hore's book.

6
00:00:25,617 --> 00:00:27,967
I think it's one of the best
books on this subject.

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,405
There are two forms of equivalence.

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,915
There is ‘chemical equivalence’.
That is fairly easy to understand.

9
00:00:33,915 --> 00:00:36,935
That means that you have two nuclei
that cannot be distinguished

10
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:38,275
in chemical terms.

11
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:41,415
One cannot substitute one
without substituting the other.

12
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:42,445
One cannot replace one.

13
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,745
One cannot conceive of a reaction
that would affect one

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,055
without affecting the other.

15
00:00:47,055 --> 00:00:48,295
That's one thing.

16
00:00:48,295 --> 00:00:51,285
And then there is the concept
of ‘magnetic equivalence’

17
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,395
which is much more subtle
and more difficult to define.

18
00:00:54,856 --> 00:00:58,536
Let us start with a simple application.

19
00:00:58,793 --> 00:01:02,423
We have a
magnetically equivalent pair

20
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:06,278
the two protons
have the same coupling

21
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:07,468
to the two fluorine nuclei.

22
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:11,248
So if we consider this coupling
and this coupling,

23
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,850
it turns out that by symmetry
of the molecule,

24
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,590
these two couplings must be the same.

25
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:19,313
Likewise if we started
with the two fluorine nuclei,

26
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:22,153
they also have the same
couplings to the two protons.

27
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,123
These two couplings are the same.

28
00:01:25,936 --> 00:01:28,056
But if we look at this coupling here,

29
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:30,156
which is a ‘cis’ coupling, it has a

30
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,696
different magnitude and
perhaps even a different sign

31
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,376
from this long-range coupling here,
the ‘trans’ coupling.

32
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,736
So these are distinct

33
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:41,015
and therefore, there are
two different cases.

34
00:01:42,314 --> 00:01:45,684
Peter Hore has a wonderful way

35
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,794
of explaining how you
can check for the existence

36
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,534
of magnetically equivalent nuclei.

37
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:57,324
First of all, you define an ensemble
of nuclei {a, b, c,…}

38
00:01:57,515 --> 00:02:00,285
of which you want to decide

39
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,995
whether they are magnetically
equivalent or not,

40
00:02:02,995 --> 00:02:06,715
such as in this case
of proton ‘a’ and proton ‘b’.

41
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:10,473
And then you define external nuclei,

42
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:13,134
if they exist.

43
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:15,314
This fluorine we call ‘z’,

44
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:17,874
Peter Hore uses that nomenclature.

45
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:19,644
He says:

46
00:02:19,827 --> 00:02:23,327
If the J coupling between ‘a’ and ‘z’

47
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:26,707
is equal to the coupling
between ‘b’ and ‘z’,

48
00:02:26,707 --> 00:02:29,277
and is also equal to the coupling
between ‘c’ and ‘z’, etc.

49
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:30,804
for all similar couplings,

50
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:34,413
we have magnetic equivalence.

51
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,969
And if that is not the case
as in this molecule,

52
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:41,096
then we have only chemical equivalence.

53
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:44,773
This distinction has dramatic consequences.

54
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:49,078
The test, where we compare
the scalar couplings

55
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:52,228
between ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ and an
external nucleus ‘z’,

56
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,724
has to be repeated
for different external nuclei ‘z’.

57
00:02:55,724 --> 00:02:57,584
For example we do it for ‘z’

58
00:02:57,584 --> 00:02:59,634
and then we have to do it
all over again

59
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:01,424
for a nucleus ‘z prime’.

60
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,465
In practice it turns out that once

61
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,285
you have obtained a negative
answer for one of the nuclei ‘z’

62
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,205
you don't need to check the others.

63
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:11,342
Magnetic equivalence
needs to be 

64
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:12,732
thought about carefully.

65
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,739
There are cases
that are not obvious.

66
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,879
For example this is a dodecahedron--

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,530
the molecule has the formula C20H20.

68
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:26,679
If all carbons are carbon-12,
which is not obvious,

69
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,689
unless it is depleted in carbon-13,

70
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:32,029
then we have no other nuclei

71
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:35,632
than the 20 chemically equivalent protons.

72
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,299
so there is

73
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,299
no external nucleus ‘z’,

74
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,629
and consequently we can't carry out the test.

75
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,359
Hence all 20 protons
are magnetically equivalent

76
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,724
and not merely chemically equivalent.

77
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:51,364
The same is true for a much more
mundane molecule

78
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,644
which is benzene.

79
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,855
which has six protons.


80
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,273
They are all equivalent

81
00:03:58,273 --> 00:04:01,023
because there is no proton ‘z’
and no carbon ‘z’

82
00:04:01,294 --> 00:04:05,434
that could make the six protons
inequivalent.

83
00:04:05,636 --> 00:04:10,726
Multiplet patterns can be used
to check for molecular symmetry

84
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:14,532
or to confirm or reject a hypothesis

85
00:04:14,532 --> 00:04:16,362
about the symmetry of the molecule.

86
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:18,722
Peter Hore has collected
some wonderful examples

87
00:04:18,722 --> 00:04:21,242
of phosphorus-31 NMR spectra

88
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:25,864
of compounds which contain
only phosphorus and sulphur.

89
00:04:26,313 --> 00:04:29,053
The large spheres represent
phosphorus atoms

90
00:04:29,053 --> 00:04:33,053
and the small spheres sulphur atoms.

91
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,534
There are different arrangements.

92
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:38,245
Sulphur has no spin

93
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:42,835
at least its dominant isotope
has 99% abundance and no spin.

94
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:44,265
And therefore, we can ignore it

95
00:04:44,265 --> 00:04:46,795
and we we only have to worry
about the chemical shifts,

96
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:51,509
and about the
chemical or magnetic equivalence,

97
00:04:51,517 --> 00:04:53,547
of the phosphorus nuclei.

98
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:56,628
In a configuration like this,

99
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,986
there is 

100
00:04:58,986 --> 00:05:00,506
no nucleus ‘z’.

101
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:06,516
that could conceivably have different
couplings with the four

102
00:05:06,516 --> 00:05:08,636
phosphorus nuclei.

103
00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:11,467
Therefore all four nuclei ‘a’

104
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,757
are in the same environment.

105
00:05:12,757 --> 00:05:14,177
They are chemically indistinguishable

106
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:16,507
and are
magnetically equivalent.

107
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:18,507
Therefore we speak of an A4 system.

108
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:22,945
This system has a different symmetry.

109
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:28,455
You immediately see
that these two 

110
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:32,235
phosphorus nuclei are sitting
between three sulphur atoms,

111
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,951
whereas these phosphorus nuclei
have another phosphorus

112
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,251
as neighbour, and only

113
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,861
two sulphur atoms as neighbours.

114
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,681
So chemically, they're quite different.

115
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:43,002
In fact, they also have different
chemical shifts

116
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:47,031
but when it comes to the symmetry,
it turns out that the coupling

117
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:51,031
between one of these nuclei ’A’
and the two nuclei ’X’ is equal

118
00:05:51,074 --> 00:05:55,074
and so we have an A2X2 system.

119
00:05:55,202 --> 00:06:00,312
As a result, we have a triplet for A, 

120
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:02,542
and for X we also have a triplet.

121
00:06:03,874 --> 00:06:05,884
This is a more complicated case

122
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,964
where the phosphorus on top

123
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:09,494
has three neighbouring sulphur atoms.

124
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,434
A bit like what we had before

125
00:06:11,434 --> 00:06:12,724
but at the bottom,

126
00:06:12,724 --> 00:06:16,724
we have a phosphorus atom which is squeezed
between two other phosphorus atoms,

127
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,822
whereas the other phosphorus atoms
are squeezed between

128
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:22,062
a phosphorus and two sulphur atoms.

129
00:06:22,062 --> 00:06:25,222
So clearly we have three
different chemical environments

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,690
and we have an AMX2 system

131
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,589
because the only magnetic equivalence

132
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:35,649
is between these two X nuclei.

133
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:37,919
You can see the consequences.

134
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:42,691
Nucleus A gives a large triplet

135
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:45,875
due to the coupling JAX between A and X.

136
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,965
where X are the two neighbouring
phosphorus nuclei

137
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:54,585
and a smaller coupling JAM between A
and the distant M nucleus.

138
00:06:55,437 --> 00:06:59,437
So this is a wonderful example on how
we can look at spectra

139
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:03,093
and draw conclusions as to
the symmetry of the molecule.

140
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:06,314
There are also amusing cases

141
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:09,103
when we look at lithium-7

142
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,371
or at lithium-6.

143
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:15,971
Lithium-7 has a spin I = 3/2.

144
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:20,185
This is a little bit like boron-11
that we have discussed before.

145
00:07:20,654 --> 00:07:23,064
In this case we consider
a strange molecule

146
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:27,184
which is actually a cluster
comprising four lithium atoms

147
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:29,952
arranged according to a tetrahedron.

148
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:36,162
It turns out that if you can attach
tertiary butyl groups,

149
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:39,562
that they are not attached
to one of the lithium atoms

150
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,750
but they tend to attach themselves

151
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,591
to the middle of the triangular surfaces,

152
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:47,011
to one of these sides of the cluster.

153
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:51,532
Very mysterious chemistry
but NMR is without any doubt

154
00:07:51,532 --> 00:07:54,282
proving that this structure
is the true structure

155
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,942
and not the one that
you might draw intuitively.

156
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:59,543
It turns out that
because of this structure

157
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:03,798
if we look at the lithium-7 spectrum,

158
00:08:03,798 --> 00:08:05,838
which has a spin I = 3/2,

159
00:08:05,838 --> 00:08:09,838
we shall see an ordinary binomial quartet

160
00:08:10,344 --> 00:08:15,104
because of the splittings
to three equivalent

161
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:16,954
carbon-13, since

162
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:20,954
each lithium in effect
‘sees’ three carbon-13 nuclei.

163
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,170
For example, if you take the lithium
nucleus at the top,

164
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:27,403
it ‘sees’ this carbon-13 and this one

165
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,573
and this one as equivalent.

166
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:35,447
And therefore, we have
this wonderful quartet.

167
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:39,313
On the other hand,
we could decide to enrich

168
00:08:39,537 --> 00:08:41,737
the cluster with lithium-6.

169
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:45,807
Lithium-6 has spin I = 1,
so it will split a neighbouring

170
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,947
carbon-13 into three equivalent lines

171
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,986
with amplitudes 1:1:1

172
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:58,516
but since each carbon is coupled

173
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,184
to three lithium-6 nuclei

174
00:09:01,184 --> 00:09:05,854
this gives rise to a strange non-binomial multiplet

175
00:09:05,854 --> 00:09:10,509
which is comprised of three
interleaved triplets.

176
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,499
I vividly recommend that
you to look at this carefully.

177
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:17,499
This is similar to what
you have seen in diborane

178
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:21,199
except that now there are couplings
to three neighbouring nuclei.

179
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:25,157
In four-spin systems we have

180
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:29,253
more complicated structures

181
00:09:29,264 --> 00:09:31,604
but they are fairly easy to rationalize.

182
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,634
In fact, we can simply take
the proton NMR spectrum

183
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:37,474
of dibromonitrobenzene.

184
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:39,804
This is a very simple molecule.

185
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:44,374
And we can see that
we have a proton A

186
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:48,574
which is squeezed between a proton P
and a proton M.

187
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,149
The ortho-couplings
are not exactly equal

188
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,449
but they are similar.

189
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:56,139
The proton X is across the ring,

190
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,509
so to speak, and has
a long-range

191
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,824
para coupling to A

192
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:04,835
and medium-range couplings to the
meta positions P and M.

193
00:10:05,553 --> 00:10:09,813
And as a result, the A multiplet
will be split into what is sometimes

194
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:11,342
called the ‘pseudo-triplet’.

195
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:13,285
In fact it is a doublet of doublets

196
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:15,315
with very close couplings.

197
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,925
The doublet fine structure

198
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,315
is due to the para position X.

199
00:10:20,674 --> 00:10:24,394
The proton M is split
into a large doublet

200
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:26,279
because of JAM,

201
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,639
and each line is split into a doublet

202
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,839
and again into a doublet

203
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,307
first because of P
and then because of X.

204
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:36,315
Likewise, the same logic applies
to spin P which is very similar

205
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:39,455
to spin M as far as the structure
of the multiplet is concerned.

206
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:43,455
Finally, spin X shows a pseudo-triplet

207
00:10:43,455 --> 00:10:46,375
because the couplings to P and to M 
are almost equivalent.

208
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,675
Each component is split
into a small doublet

209
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,155
because of the para-coupling
between X and M.

210
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:55,311
This kind of spectrum
allows you to determine

211
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:59,311
the molecular structure
without any help.

212
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:05,786
There is an interesting phenomenon
in scalar-coupled multiplets

213
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,870
that is known as ‘strong coupling’,

214
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,170
sometimes known
as ‘second-order coupling’.

215
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:16,021
We begin with a case

216
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:18,989
where the J splitting

217
00:11:19,006 --> 00:11:22,596
is much smaller than the
difference in chemical shifts.

218
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,495
In this case we speak of an AX system

219
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,086
but when the chemical shifts come closer,

220
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:34,435
we notice that the multiplets
not only become closer

221
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:39,818
but also change
their amplitudes.

222
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,492
The inner lines become stronger

223
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,232
and the outer lines become weaker.

224
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:46,942
In such a case, we use
two letters in the alphabet

225
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:50,432
which are close together,
so we may speak of an AB system.

226
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:54,284
Ultimately, if the two chemical shifts
become degenerate,

227
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:58,175
we have only one line left over, 

228
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,495
and we speak of an A2 system.

229
00:12:00,543 --> 00:12:03,973
To understand strong coupling

230
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:07,496
we have to use a little bit
of quantum mechanics.

231
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:12,524
This is not treated in any detail
in the first volume of Peter Hore

232
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,004
that I recommended to you

233
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:17,934
but there is a second book
that you may wish to read

234
00:12:17,934 --> 00:12:19,044
next year

235
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,984
that is written by Steve Wimperis, Jeremy Jones

236
00:12:22,984 --> 00:12:25,684
and the same Peter Hore,

237
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:27,174
in the same Oxford Primer series.

238
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:30,535
This book speaks about
quantum-mechanical effects.

239
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:35,803
In this case we have to explain

240
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:38,342
how we start with an AX system,

241
00:12:38,342 --> 00:12:40,142
where we have just two doublets,

242
00:12:40,142 --> 00:12:43,532
and go to an AB system where
the two doublets move

243
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,552
close together so that the inner lines
become more intense,

244
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:48,552
to the limiting case of the A2 system.

245
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:54,052
It turns out that all three
can be explained in one equation

246
00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,482
by saying that the bottom state


247
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:00,979
where the two spins are parallel
with the magnetic field

248
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:03,194
is not affected by this phenomenon

249
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,664
so they're always the same.

250
00:13:04,664 --> 00:13:07,414
It is always a simple state
with alpha-alpha.

251
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:11,186
Likewise, the upper state
where the two spins

252
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,789
are anti-parallel is unaffected.

253
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,829
It doesn't matter whether the system
is strongly or weakly coupled.

254
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:23,702
But the intermediate states
called psi_2 and psi_3

255
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,748
are mixed.

256
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:29,905
In fact, they are neither alpha-beta
nor beta-alpha

257
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:33,515
but there is an admixture
between the two

258
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:36,995
with coefficients given by the
cosine of an angle chi

259
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,758
and sine of the same angle chi.

260
00:13:39,571 --> 00:13:43,901
This angle is determined by the ratio

261
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:47,521
of the J coupling and the difference
in chemical shifts.

262
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,020
In terms of simple trigonometry,

263
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,720
we can draw the chemical shift difference horizontally,

264
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,930
in units of Hz (Hertz),

265
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:05,148
and we draw the scalar coupling
vertically, also units of Hz.

266
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:09,928
We can make a little diagram

267
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:14,615
and this angle is twice chi.

268
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:20,822
You can immediately see that
when the J coupling 

269
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,890
becomes much smaller
than the difference in chemical shifts

270
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,470
then the angle chi goes to zero.

271
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:31,517
The limit of chi going to zero

272
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:37,005
means that

273
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:41,002
the cosine goes to one
and the sine goes to zero,

274
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:45,261
so this is a pure alpha-beta state.

275
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:50,555
Alpha for spin A and beta for spin B.

276
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:56,193
Likewise, if we take the limit
of chi going to zero,

277
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:00,532
only the cosine term survives

278
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:04,312
so this would be a pure state
where spin A

279
00:15:04,312 --> 00:15:06,202
has a beta polarization

280
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:08,692
and spin B has an alpha polarization.

281
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,260
You can see from this
diagram that, the larger J

282
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,900
is compared to the difference
in chemical shifts,

283
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,976
the steeper the slope,

284
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:24,162
the closer the angle 2 chi
approaches 90 degrees

285
00:15:24,162 --> 00:15:28,072
and therefore the angle chi
approaches 45 degrees.

286
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:31,225
It is interesting
to see the limit

287
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,859
where chi = 45 degrees.

288
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,680
We see that the cosine
and the sine become equal.

289
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:45,432
so the coefficients are just 

290
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:50,158
1/(square root of two), times
(alpha-beta + beta-alpha).

291
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:55,788
Likewise, in the limit for chi
= 45 degrees,

292
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,518
when the J coupling is much larger

293
00:15:58,518 --> 00:16:01,528
than the difference in chemical shifts,
the other function goes to

294
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,907
 1/(square root of two), times
(- alpha-beta + beta-alpha).


295
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,159
We have minus alpha-beta
plus beta-alpha.

296
00:16:10,774 --> 00:16:14,024
In the case of an A2 system,

297
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,303
you see there is a symmetrical
linear combination

298
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,203
that we have here.

299
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:22,655
This is symmetrical in the sense
that if you do a permutation

300
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:26,405
of spins A and B, the
wave function doesn't change.

301
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,625
It is invariant to permutation

302
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,755
and is known as totally symmetric.

303
00:16:31,015 --> 00:16:33,345
Whereas for the other wave function,

304
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:35,835
the one that I just
commented on,

305
00:16:35,849 --> 00:16:39,709
is anti-symmetric with respect to
a permutation of the spins.

306
00:16:40,949 --> 00:16:44,469
It turns out that the symmetric state,
together with the top state

307
00:16:44,469 --> 00:16:45,719
and the bottom state,

308
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:49,019
together form what is known as a triplet of states,

309
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:54,486
that is to say three states
with the same symmetry.

310
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:57,366
Whereas this state here
is known as a singlet state.

311
00:16:58,172 --> 00:17:02,302
A remarkable thing is that
the peak that we see

312
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:04,771
in the spectrum is made up of two lines,

313
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:08,501
only two lines, that are degenerate
and appear on top of each other.

314
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,535
One line corresponds to the bottom
transition 

315
00:17:11,642 --> 00:17:13,582
of the triplet, and the other line

316
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:16,372
corresponds to the top transition
of the triplet.

317
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:19,971
Whereas the transitions from
the bottom state to the singlet state

318
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,251
are forbidden. This is represented
by dotted lines.

319
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,311
I cross them out to show
that these two transitions

320
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,127
are completely forbidden.

321
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:30,060
In fact, they are only
virtual, so to speak.

322
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,620
If you look at their frequencies,
they are a plus and minus J

323
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,700
away from the central component

324
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,820
but their intensities are vanishingly weak

325
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,730
and that is why we cannot see them.

326
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:44,255
This kind of quantum mechanics
has been known for decades

327
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:49,065
but has gained some renewed
interest very recently

328
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:53,545
because it turns out that the populations
can flow quite freely

329
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:57,785
within the triplet manifold
as a result of

330
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:00,755
longitudinal or spin-lattice relaxation.

331
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:04,191
Whereas populations that
are locked in the singlet state

332
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:07,481
cannot flow from the singlet
to the triplet states.

333
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:11,709
If one can contrive some way
of populating the singlet state,

334
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,879
then the populations
would be locked up,

335
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:17,919
and one can have
so-called long-lived states.

336
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,619
This is the speciality of Malcolm Levitt
in Southampton.

337
00:18:21,619 --> 00:18:23,769
We have done a lot of work in Lausanne

338
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,649
to improve techniques
to populate singlet states.

339
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:32,127
This concludes part two of this chapter.

340
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:34,477
Thank you for your attention.
