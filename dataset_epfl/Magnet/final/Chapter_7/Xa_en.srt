00:00:00,486 --> 00:00:02,541
This is Sami Jannin from the EPFL.

2
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:06,387
Welcome to our MOOC
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,925
Today we shall be talking
about dynamic nuclear polarization.

4
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:14,663
This is going to be 
the first part of this chapter.

5
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:19,903
This picture shows you
one of the most famous DNP experiments.

6
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:23,504
On the upper side here,
you can see a spectrum

7
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:28,097
measure on a urea sample
with a single scan with DNP.

8
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:32,052
On the lower side here,
you can see the same spectrum

9
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:37,862
measured without DNP
with 200,000 scans in 65 hours.

10
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:42,573
According to the authors
of this paper published in 2003,

11
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,886
the enhancement provided by DNP
exceeded 10,000 folds.

12
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:54,264
So the first question 
that is important to ask in this MOOC

13
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,926
is "how insensitive is NMR?"

14
00:00:57,778 --> 00:01:01,649
You probably know that if you have,
let's say, milligrams of sample,

15
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,179
sensitivity is usually not a problem,

16
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:11,361
but if you decrease the amount of sample
to, say, for example, 70 micrograms,

17
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:12,939
you might run into trouble.

18
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:19,378
So in this MOOC, we're going to take
as an example sodium pyruvate,

19
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:22,246
labeled on the carbon-1 position,

20
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,093
and we're going to assume,
just for the example,

21
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:29,157
that we only have 70 micrograms of sample.

22
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:37,737
Now if you measure this sample overnight
in a 300 megaherz spectrometer,

23
00:01:38,457 --> 00:01:40,388
this is the kind of spectrum 
you're going to get

24
00:01:41,038 --> 00:01:45,843
in 128 scans at an interval
of 350 seconds,

25
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:48,269
and measured during 12 hours.

26
00:01:49,582 --> 00:01:52,681
Now what if you want to look
at the other carbons,

27
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:55,094
those who are not labeled,

28
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:59,274
so in natural abundance,
with about 1% C13?

29
00:02:01,056 --> 00:02:03,115
This is the kind of spectrum you get.

30
00:02:03,115 --> 00:02:08,095
You see absolutely no signal
because the signal-to-noise ratio

31
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,861
only grows with the square root of time.

32
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:17,177
So if you want to measure 
the same signal amplitude

33
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,533
that you had measured 
on the labeled carbon,

34
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,292
You're going to need 12 hours
multiplied by a hundred

35
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:27,153
multiplied by a hundred, 
which amounts to 5,000 days,

36
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:29,431
equal to 13.7 years.

37
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,553
So who is responsible
for such a low sensitivity?

38
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:38,734
On the picture here you can see Boltzmann,

39
00:02:39,434 --> 00:02:43,441
and we're going to explain now
why the low sensitivity of NMR

40
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:46,179
is mainly due to the Boltzmann Law.

41
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:52,295
You may have been told
in some NMR courses or books

42
00:02:52,295 --> 00:02:56,499
that the thermal equilibrium
density operator of a spin one half

43
00:02:56,499 --> 00:03:01,887
can be described by Iz plus the identity.

44
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,191
But in reality there is a prefactor

45
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:09,269
that describes the polarization
in front of Iz.

46
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,015
In the picture here you see

47
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,347
the two-energy level of a spin one half.

48
00:03:15,051 --> 00:03:21,489
The balls describe the amount
of populations of spins up and spins down.

49
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:26,464
As you can see on this picture,
there are almost as many spins up

50
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,932
as spins down, described
by these big balls.

51
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,540
Still, there is a very little amount
of spins in excess

52
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,823
on the energy level up
with respect to the energy level down.

53
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,932
This is precisely what 
the polarization factor describes.

54
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:49,051
The important thing here
is that this polarization factor

55
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:51,582
is usually much smaller than one.

56
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,889
So what happens when you do
your NMR experiment?

57
00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,534
You're going to drive transitions
between those energy levels

58
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,543
but since you have 
as many spin up as spin down,

59
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:08,021
it is just going to yield
destructive interference,

60
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,199
leading to absolutely no signal.

61
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:21,534
The only signal that you're going to get
will arise from this very small amount

62
00:04:21,534 --> 00:04:25,842
of population in excess
on one level with respect to the other,

63
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:29,059
proportional to the polarization factor.

64
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,029
Now what you would like
in your NMR experiment

65
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,069
is to have all the population
sitting on the same energy level

66
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:46,085
so as to have a very high polarization
in such a way that when you drive

67
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:50,119
your transition, you end up
with a very large signal.

68
00:04:52,112 --> 00:04:56,193
Fortunately, the distribution
of population at thermal equilibrium

69
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,775
is described by the Boltzmann law.

70
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:04,845
This Boltzmann law tells you
that the ratio between the population

71
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:08,275
and the two energy levels
is described by an exponential law,

72
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:14,443
exponential -ћω,
which is transition energy,

73
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,290
divided by kT, which is 
the thermal energy.

74
00:05:19,284 --> 00:05:23,636
From this law now, if you calculate
the difference in population

75
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:27,984
divided by the sum here, which is 
by definition the polarization,

76
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:32,506
you end up with this formula,
the tangent hyperbolic

77
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,898
of ћω over 2kT.

78
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:43,548
Now if you take your NMR sample
and put it in a field of seven tesla,

79
00:05:44,183 --> 00:05:48,861
you realize that this polarization
is very low at room temperature.

80
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,404
At around 300 kelvin, the polarization
of your carbon-13 spins

81
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:56,999
is only about 6 ppm.

82
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,541
That means if you have a million spins

83
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:06,178
in your sample, only six spins
will actually participate

84
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:10,252
in the creation of a real NMR signal.

85
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:14,693
All the other spins
will yield destructive interference

86
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,409
that will not be observable.

87
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:22,009
There are two ways,
according to Boltzmann,

88
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,359
to increase the polarization.

89
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:30,981
Either you increase the magnetic field
or you decrease the temperature.

90
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:36,184
In order to achieve
a polarization close to unity,

91
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,381
you will need something like a mega-tesla,
which is not practical,

92
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,411
or you will need something
like a milli-kelvin,

93
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,683
which is also very difficult to achieve.

94
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:55,207
So another idea 
that was introduced by Overhauser

95
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,678
is to rely on the electron gamma.

96
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,925
The gamma of the electron

97
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:05,505
is about 660 times bigger than for protons

98
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:10,452
and about 2,600 bigger than for carbon-13.

99
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:15,793
That means that 
the frequency is much higher,

100
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:21,118
and that means finally that 
the polarization is also much higher.

101
00:07:22,397 --> 00:07:26,846
So what we're going to do
is we're going to bring an electron

102
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:31,875
and a nuclear spin together
and try to transfer polarization

103
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,285
from one to the other.

104
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:41,733
If you take your electron spin molecule,
in this case a nitroxide molecule

105
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:44,596
with an unpaired electron
sitting on the [N-O] bond,

106
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,155
and on the other side you take
your pyruvate molecule

107
00:07:48,155 --> 00:07:50,235
and you look, for example,
at your protons,

108
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,909
and you put this molecule 
in your field at room temperature,

109
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,970
the polarization is still fairly low.

110
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:04,446
Of course, the energy
of the transition is quite different

111
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:08,365
and if, now, you bring
the temperature down,

112
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:12,484
you might end up in a situation
where the electron polarization

113
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:16,489
is high, for example more than 90%,

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,730
while your proton polarization 
is still very low.

115
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:24,049
Now how are we going to transfer 
polarization from the electron

116
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:25,404
to the nucelar spin?

117
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:30,523
The first thing to do is
to bring them together.

118
00:08:30,523 --> 00:08:34,303
You have to bring them into contact,
such as you have, for example,

119
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,829
a dipolar coupling, a hyperfine coupling

120
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:41,595
that will allow transition
between those energy levels.

121
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:47,537
How are we going to do that?

122
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:51,722
How are we going to, for example,
transfer the population here

123
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:56,312
to this energy level so as to create
a large nuclear polarization

124
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,777
along this transition?

125
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:02,694
This is going to be done
by applying microwaves

126
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,343
at the suitable frequency

127
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,311
and this is what DNP is about.

128
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:14,532
In summary, we have illustrated
how insensitive NMR is.

129
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:20,880
We have described the spin polarization
and explained why the sensitivity

130
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,824
was directly related to this polarization,

131
00:09:24,393 --> 00:09:27,498
and we have shown 
that this polarization was very low

132
00:09:27,498 --> 00:09:30,622
in conventional NMR conditions.

133
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:35,454
Finally, we have introduced
dynamic nuclear polarization

134
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:38,932
as a technique to enhance
the nuclear polarization

135
00:09:38,932 --> 00:09:42,829
by transferring 
the high electron polarization

136
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:47,730
to the nuclear spins
by applying microwaves,

137
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:52,130
the ultimate goal being
to increase the nuclear polarization

138
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,360
to, for example, a value close to unity

139
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,707
by having most of the nuclear spins
sitting on the same energy level.
