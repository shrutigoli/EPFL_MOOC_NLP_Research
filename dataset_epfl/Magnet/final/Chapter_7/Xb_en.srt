This is Sami Jannin of the EPFL.

00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:06,632
Welcome to our MOOC
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

3
00:00:07,638 --> 00:00:10,897
Today we shall be talking about 
dynamic nuclear polarization

4
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:14,931
and this is going to be 
the second part of this chapter.

5
00:00:17,286 --> 00:00:20,416
Today, we shall be talking about 
the electron spin system

6
00:00:20,882 --> 00:00:23,069
and the nuclear spin system

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,272
that are the two key players 
in our DNP experiment.

8
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:29,875
So what about 
the electron spin system?

9
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:33,144
Let's take our nitroxide molecule

10
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,548
that has a free radical sitting 
on the N-O bond.

11
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,697
Let's first assume that 
this nitroxide molecule

12
00:00:42,993 --> 00:00:45,076
is distributed in a matrix,

13
00:00:45,076 --> 00:00:49,684
and that all these nitroxide molecules 
have exactly the same orientation.

14
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:56,372
Well, in this case, one might observe 
a very narrow ESR line,

15
00:00:56,372 --> 00:01:00,467
because all the electron spins 
will have the same frequency.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,650
While in reality,

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,251
the frequency of the electron spins 
strongly depends

18
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:12,505
on the orientation of the molecule 
with respect to the field: B-Zero.

19
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,196
So that in a real experiment, 
where all the molecules

20
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:23,175
are distributed randomly 
in the matrix [of the gas].

21
00:01:23,733 --> 00:01:28,304
The ESR spectrum is not any more
a narrow line, but a broad line

22
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:35,119
and each of these frequencies here,
correspond to a certain orientation

23
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,211
of the molecule 
with respect to the field.

24
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,140
There is another mechanism 
that broadens the line

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,673
that is the hyper-fine coupling.

26
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:47,775
In this particle or example 
in this nitroxide molecule,

27
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,812
there is a coupling 
between the electron-- here,

28
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:54,162
and the nitrogen 
that has a spin-- Spin One,

29
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:58,036
and this coupling gave rise 
to a splitting

30
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:02,081
that you can observe here, 
on this spectrum.

31
00:02:03,313 --> 00:02:05,813
These two broadening mechanisms

32
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:09,016
are usually called 
inhomogeneous broadening.

33
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:14,346
There is another broadening mechanism 
that we call dipolar,

34
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:18,402
and that depends 
on the coupling between electrons

35
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:21,585
from one molecule and the other molecule.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,456
This broadening mechanism 
is usually called homogeneous.

37
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:35,402
So most of the broadening is due to the 
inhomogeneous broadening in our case.

38
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:40,181
So is due to the Zeeman interaction 
and the Hyperfine interaction.

39
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:45,841
And for this nitroxide molecule, 
the broadening is typically

40
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:49,242
on the order of hundreds 
of megahertz per Tesla.

41
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,897
So, say you have an
inhomogeneously broadened ESR line,

42
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:59,099
so instead of having 
very well defined energy levels,

43
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,611
this population 
sitting on one level- here,

44
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:05,457
and one level- here,
in reality you have a distribution

45
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:08,353
of the energy level 
that is quasi-continuous.

46
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:16,333
And the population distribution 
amongst this energy level is, of course,

47
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:18,829
described by the Boltzmann Law.

48
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:25,177
Now, what happens if you shine microwave 
on one of these transitions?

49
00:03:26,222 --> 00:03:29,023
Well, we are going to see 
that what might happen

50
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:32,019
is that you're going 
to dig a hole in the ESR line.

51
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:36,128
So you are going 
to saturate the electron spin,

52
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:38,541
at well-defined frequencies.

53
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:44,276
Now, looking back at our energy levels
and population distribution,

54
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:49,378
what happens is that by shining microwave
at a specific transition frequency,

55
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:53,012
for example, here--
you are going to tend to equilibrate

56
00:03:53,012 --> 00:03:57,801
the distribution of population
among those two energy levels, here.

57
00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:01,418
And that's what digging a hole, means.

58
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:05,916
Now, I told you that there was
a third broadening mechanism

59
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,015
that was also very important,

60
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,152
and that is called 
the homogeneous broadening.

61
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:15,169
The width of the homogeneous broadening 
depends on the strength

62
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,371
of the dipolar coupling
between the electron spins,

63
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:23,403
which grows with 
<i>One over R - to the power of three.</i>

64
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:27,045
<i>R</i> being the distance 
between the electron spins.

65
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:32,026
And it turns out that this broadening 
is usually much weaker

66
00:04:32,026 --> 00:04:37,278
than the homogeneous broadening 
in the case of nitroxide radical.

67
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:42,533
It is about 0.2 megahertz 
per millimolar of radical.

68
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,485
So if we increase 
the concentration of radical,

69
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:52,328
you're going to decrease 
the distance between the electron spins

70
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:58,541
and this is going to increase 
the widths of the homogeneous broadening.

71
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:01,771
What is the consequence

72
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,450
on the saturation behavior 
of the ESR line?

73
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:11,674
Well, now when you are going to shine 
microwave at a specific transition,

74
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:16,956
you're going to hit 
a specific electron spin

75
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:21,153
that has the right frequency
and the right orientation,

76
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,806
but thanks to the dipolar coupling

77
00:05:23,806 --> 00:05:31,068
this saturation may be transferred 
to other electron spins by spin diffusion.

78
00:05:32,317 --> 00:05:36,175
So what happens is 
that when you shine microwave

79
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:40,243
at a specific frequency 
this perturbation

80
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,252
actually might propagate 
across the ESR line

81
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:48,601
by what we call spectral spin diffusion.

82
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,394
There is another 
very important phenomenon

83
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,826
that happens at the same time. 
That is the T-one relaxation.

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,545
So at the same time 
you try to saturate your ESR line

85
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:03,310
with microwave and you try 
to equilibrate the population

86
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,237
amongst the energy level, 
and at the same time this perturbation

87
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:12,058
tends to travel across the EPR line 
by spectral spin diffusion.

88
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:17,033
The T-one relaxation
tends to bring back the population

89
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:20,514
towards the Boltzmann distribution.

90
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:29,743
So the saturation of the ESR line,
which is a crucial step in DNP,

91
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:37,129
is a competition between saturation, 
spectral spin diffusion-

92
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,621
that propagates the perturbation
across the line and T-one relaxation

93
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:45,712
that tends to bring back 
the distribution of population

94
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,502
towards the Boltzmann distribution.

95
00:06:50,137 --> 00:06:53,466
Now, let's talk about 
the nuclear spin system.

96
00:06:56,312 --> 00:07:01,354
So we have discussed the presence 
of free radical molecules in the sample,

97
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,387
but these free radicals, 
that are usually present

98
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:08,501
at the millimolar concentration, 
are surrounded by molecules

99
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:13,161
that contain nuclear spins. 
For example, proton spins.

100
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,608
In our example, we chose to talk about 
the pyruvate molecule

101
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:21,558
that contains methide group here, 
with three protons.

102
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:27,488
So, the first important feature 
in this nuclear spin system

103
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:32,435
is that the polarization 
will possibly redistribute

104
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:36,901
amongst those spins 
by nuclear spin diffusion.

105
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:41,326
So in a sense, all these molecules 
in the solid state

106
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,583
at low temperature,
might talk to each other,

107
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:47,733
and the polarization might be transferred 
from one molecule to the other.

108
00:07:49,506 --> 00:07:53,388
To give a pictorial idea 
of what spin diffusion does,

109
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:58,304
let's take just a line of spins--
so we have a line, here, of molecules,

110
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:01,575
and we just assume 
that at a certain time

111
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:06,346
some molecules have their spin 
polarized down,

112
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:10,485
and some molecules have their spins
polarized up.

113
00:08:11,441 --> 00:08:15,983
So that when we look at the polarization 
of the proton spins along this line,

114
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:21,414
we see a big step function, here, 
with a negative polarization, here,

115
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,427
and a positive polarization, here.

116
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:29,644
So what spin diffusion is going to do 
is, that, it is going to re-distribute

117
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:35,963
the polarization in such a way 
that the polarization is homogeneous

118
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:38,047
on a microscopic scale.

119
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:44,085
Now, if by any means,
you manage to polarize molecules

120
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:46,206
on this side of the line,

121
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:51,037
with microwaves or with DNP, 
what spin diffusion is going to do,

122
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:55,085
is it's going to propagate 
this polarization through the line,

123
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:58,117
in such a way, that you might end up with

124
00:08:58,117 --> 00:09:01,707
almost all the spins 
polarized through space.

125
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:10,025
This spin diffusion process 
is characterized by a diffusion constant.

126
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,807
And in a static solid at low temperature,

127
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:18,195
this diffusion constant 
is about 10 to the 5 angstrom/second.

128
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:23,338
So that the length 
that the polarization can travel,

129
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:28,878
is proportional to 
the <i>square root of D times the time.</i>

130
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:34,528
That means that if you wait
about a second,

131
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,478
your nuclear spin diffusion

132
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:41,261
might lead you to the transportation 
of your polarization

133
00:09:41,261 --> 00:09:44,433
over typically, 10's of nanometers.

134
00:09:44,895 --> 00:09:52,340
Now, in a typical DNP sample, 
the average electron-electron distance

135
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:55,903
is typically on the order of 
a few nanometer

136
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:59,363
when you have about 
10's of millimolar concentration.

137
00:09:59,608 --> 00:10:04,981
So it is important here to realize, 
that the nuclear spin diffusion,

138
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:10,400
is going to propagate the polarization 
on a scale which is already larger

139
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,337
than the electron-electron distance, 
within only a second.

140
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:20,965
So now, let's take our line, 
of nuclear spins in our pyruvate molecule

141
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:25,671
and let's add an electron spin,
here, a nitroxide.

142
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:32,300
So what we said before 
is that the nuclear spin diffusion

143
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,821
might transport the polarization,

144
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:37,548
especially from one molecule 
to the other.

145
00:10:38,141 --> 00:10:40,656
Now, let's see how this is working.

146
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:46,663
Let's assume here we have a spin 
with a high polarization,

147
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:49,502
and here, a spin with a low polarization,

148
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:51,955
and let's assume,
that you have a dipolar coupling

149
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:54,027
in between those two spins

150
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:56,811
that is going 
to be enabling spin diffusion.

151
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:01,490
Well, as you can see, the spin diffusion 
is going to drive transition

152
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,465
between this energy level 
and this energy level,

153
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,515
which is an 
energy conservative transition

154
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:12,196
and will tend 
to equilibrate the population

155
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:14,773
amongst those two energy levels.

156
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:18,389
But now, if we get closer
to the electron, what might happen

157
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,291
is that the coupling between the electron
and the nuclear spin

158
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,648
is going to shift the transition energy

159
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:28,911
of the nuclear spin 
via the dipolar coupling.

160
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:34,963
And in these conditions,
if we consider the coupling

161
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:38,470
between this nuclear spin 
and this nuclear spin,

162
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,531
we see that the zero-quantum transition

163
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:45,675
is no more an energy
conservative transition.

164
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:51,842
So in a sense, the polarization 
cannot flow anymore

165
00:11:51,842 --> 00:11:54,461
from one molecule to the other

166
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:57,302
because of the effect 
of the electron spin

167
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:00,869
on the energy transition 
of these nuclear spins.

168
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:06,317
So what we usually say,
is that there is a region of space

169
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:12,697
around the electron spin 
where the diffusion is stopped.

170
00:12:13,883 --> 00:12:19,843
The spins that are inside this space 
are said to be quenched

171
00:12:19,843 --> 00:12:23,760
or bleached because 
their frequencies are shifted away

172
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,643
from the usual NMR frequency 
and the limit between this area of space

173
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:35,572
and the bulk area of space 
is usually called the diffusion barrier.

174
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:41,580
And this diffusion barrier usually 
has a radius of about half a nanometer.

175
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:46,510
So in our sample, 
you have electron spins;

176
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:53,744
around these electron spins 
you have a diffusion barrier,

177
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:59,665
so that the nuclear spin inside 
won't talk to the nuclear spin outside,

178
00:12:59,665 --> 00:13:03,771
but most of the nuclear spins 
are sitting in a space

179
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:09,395
where the dipolar interaction 
with the electron is relatively weak

180
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:12,814
and we call this the bulk nuclear spins.

181
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:19,026
In a typical DNP experiment,
the ratio between the volume of bleached

182
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:22,891
or quenched nuclear spins 
with respect to the total volume

183
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:25,900
is typically only a few percent.

184
00:13:26,563 --> 00:13:30,384
It is interesting to note 
that the highest probability

185
00:13:30,384 --> 00:13:35,667
to have a DNP transition
is at the diffusion barrier

186
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,372
where the coupling between the electron 
and the nuclear spin

187
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:43,156
is the highest, 
but where still spin diffusion

188
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,585
between nuclear spin is allowed.

189
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:51,109
So, there are two very important questions
that I want to ask

190
00:13:51,109 --> 00:13:55,988
and try to give a general answer here;
is nuclear spin diffusion efficient?

191
00:13:56,443 --> 00:14:00,044
Well in principal, yes.
It can propagate polarization

192
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:03,756
over a scale that is larger 
than the electron-electron distance

193
00:14:03,756 --> 00:14:09,337
within a few seconds, unless, 
your nuclear spins are very diluted,

194
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:13,003
so if your concentration of nuclear spin 
is on the order of micromolar,

195
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:15,105
you might run into trouble.

196
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:18,578
The second thing is; 
is the bleaching important?

197
00:14:19,027 --> 00:14:22,901
In principal, no, there are only 
a few nuclear spins that are bleached,

198
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:27,070
unless your electron concentration 
would be very high,

199
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,590
in the hundreds of millimolar range.

200
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:35,057
So today we talked about 
the electron spin properties

201
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:38,109
and we saw that the saturation 
of the ESR line

202
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:44,220
was involving spectral spin diffusion, 
also T-one relaxation,

203
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,799
and at the end it was 
a kind of competition

204
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:48,416
between those two effects.

205
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:51,952
We discussed about 
the nuclear spin properties

206
00:14:51,952 --> 00:14:57,419
and we saw that nuclear spin diffusion 
was a very important feature

207
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:00,364
that would propagate the polarization

208
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,236
across the whole sample in space

209
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:10,483
and we talked about the interaction 
between the electron and the nuclear spin.

210
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,876
We introduced the concept 
of a diffusion barrier,

211
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,828
and of bleaching and quenching.

212
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:23,123
Thank you for following our MOOC 
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.
