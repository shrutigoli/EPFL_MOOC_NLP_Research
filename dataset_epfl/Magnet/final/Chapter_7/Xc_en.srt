00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,520
Welcome back to our MOOC
on basic steps in magnetic resonance.

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:08,035
Today we shall talk about
dynamic nuclear polarization

3
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:11,263
and this is going to be
the third and last part

4
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:12,783
of this chapter.

5
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,525
Many free radical molecules
can in principle be used

6
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,525
for dynamic nuclear polarization.

7
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,987
Here I give you four examples.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,760
The Trityl free radical
molecules with an electron

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,530
based on the carbon, here,

10
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,276
the BDPA molecule,

11
00:00:29,276 --> 00:00:31,299
the Galvinoxyl molecule,

12
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,025
and the Tempol molecule.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,990
It is interesting to see
that these molecules

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,510
have very different ESR spectra

15
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:45,128
because the electron
has a different coupling

16
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:47,796
with surrounding nuclear spins

17
00:00:47,796 --> 00:00:51,796
but also because it has different
J anisotropy.

18
00:00:55,536 --> 00:00:59,256
We can separate these radicals
in two classes,

19
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:01,556
those with broad ESR line,

20
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:04,006
such as Tempol and Galvinoxyl

21
00:01:04,006 --> 00:01:06,236
and those with narrow ESR lines

22
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:09,536
such as BDPA and Trityl radicals.

23
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:15,748
These lines are broad or narrow
with respect to nuclear

24
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,766
Larmor frequencies.

25
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,536
For example, the Trityl and BDPA radicals

26
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:25,956
are narrow with respect to the proton
Larmor frequency

27
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:30,237
and are on the order of the carbon
number frequency.

28
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,729
Whereas, the Tempol
and the Galvinoxyl radicals

29
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:37,553
have ESR lines that are very broad

30
00:01:37,553 --> 00:01:39,583
compared to the carbon frequency

31
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,543
and are on the order of the proton
Larmor frequency.

32
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,990
And because they have different
ESR features,

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,255
they're going to yield
different DNP mechanisms.

34
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:57,468
So, let's start with the simple
case of a narrow ESR line

35
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:02,248
of very dilute radicals
that don't have much dipolar couplings

36
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:03,851
between each other.

37
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:08,494
This is most likely to yield
what we call the solid effect.

38
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,790
So, in order to understand
what the solid effect is about,

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,580
let's consider an electron spin

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,480
with a narrow ESR line--
here, the Trityl radical--

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,540
coupled to a proton
of a Pyruvate molecule.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Here, see, the four energy levels
of this coupled two-spin system.

43
00:02:31,278 --> 00:02:34,508
And you can already see
that there is a large

44
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:37,499
electron polarization
across these transitions.

45
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:42,031
Whereas, the nuclear polarization,
across these transitions,

46
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,571
is close to zero.

47
00:02:44,725 --> 00:02:47,505
So what we're going to do now,
is going to shine

48
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:50,305
microwave frequency
at a low frequency

49
00:02:50,305 --> 00:02:54,305
and we're going to increase
this frequency until something happens.

50
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,956
The first thing that's going to happen
is that we're going to match

51
00:02:59,961 --> 00:03:03,961
what we call the Zero Quantum
Transition, here.

52
00:03:07,748 --> 00:03:10,768
By matching the Zero Quantum Transition,

53
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:13,928
we are going to drive
transition of population

54
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:18,341
so as to equilibrate the population

55
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:20,291
amongst those two energy levels.

56
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,969
And this is going to yield
a net nuclear polarization

57
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:28,779
across this transition
and across this transition here.

58
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:34,268
Looking at the ESR spectrum, here,

59
00:03:34,268 --> 00:03:36,968
and at the microwave frequency, here,

60
00:03:36,968 --> 00:03:40,268
we're going to sweep through
these different values

61
00:03:40,268 --> 00:03:44,268
until we reach the Zero Quantum
Transition, here.

62
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:48,781
And this is going to yield
a net positive proton polarization

63
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:52,741
that will look exactly like
the ESR spectrum

64
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:56,521
but will be shifted by the proton
Larmor frequency.

65
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:02,804
Now, if we keep on
increasing the frequency,

66
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:06,757
we're going to hit another transition

67
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:10,013
that is the electron frequency.

68
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:16,222
By doing so, we're going to drive
transition of population

69
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,482
amongst those energy levels

70
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:22,047
so as to equilibrate
the populations there.

71
00:04:24,754 --> 00:04:29,524
So, looking again at the ESR spectrum
and at our frequency,

72
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:32,994
we're going to sweep
right on the ESR resonance.

73
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:36,305
and we're going to saturate
the electron resonance.

74
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:40,275
This is not going to yield
nuclear polarization

75
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,805
in this particular case.

76
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:46,497
Now, we can keep on
increasing the frequency

77
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:49,987
until we hit another
transition that is called

78
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,996
the double quantum transition, here.

79
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:57,513
And by doing so, we're going to again
drive transition of population

80
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:03,323
among those energy levels
until we equilibrate the population here.

81
00:05:04,025 --> 00:05:07,545
And this is going to yield
a net negative polarization

82
00:05:07,545 --> 00:05:10,975
on the nuclear spins
along these transitions.

83
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,295
So again, looking at our spectrum,

84
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:16,025
we keep on increasing the frequency

85
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,485
and we're going to observe
a negative lobe

86
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,276
with a negative proton polarization.

87
00:05:23,264 --> 00:05:25,254
What is interesting to see here

88
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:29,516
is that the distance between
this positive and negative

89
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,236
DNP enhancements are separated

90
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:35,976
by two times the Larmor
frequency of the proton.

91
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,255
Now, say you have a broad ESR line

92
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,525
with respect to the proton frequency,

93
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,025
but you still have very dilute
electron spins,

94
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:51,255
such as nitroxide radicals.

95
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:54,027
In this particular case,

96
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:57,505
we might observe
a differential solid effect.

97
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:02,527
So, the effect is very similar
to the resolved solid effect

98
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:03,977
that we've seen before.

99
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:08,806
The difference is that
instead of yielding a very narrow lobe,

100
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,975
we're going to yield a broad lobe

101
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,555
at different microwave frequencies.

102
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:19,275
And in the same way we managed
to yield a negative lobe,

103
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:22,539
we're going to do the same
in a broad manner.

104
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:28,053
The result is that instead of having two
well-resolved lobes

105
00:06:28,053 --> 00:06:30,493
in the positive and negative side,

106
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:33,536
we're going to have a superposition
of constructive

107
00:06:33,536 --> 00:06:35,956
and destructive DNP effect

108
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:39,946
that will give rise
to a differential positive

109
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:41,764
and negative DNP lobe.

110
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:46,792
Again, the difference in frequency
between the maxima

111
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:51,508
will be at about two times
the nuclear Larmor frequency.

112
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:56,258
So, now, if we look
at another nuclear spin,

113
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:58,972
such as carbon-13, instead of a proton,

114
00:06:59,989 --> 00:07:02,289
the difference between
those two maxima

115
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:06,029
will shrink down to two times
the carbon-13

116
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,999
Larmor frequency.

117
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:14,963
So, the solid effect is a pure
electron nuclear spin process

118
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:19,755
that does not require
electron-electron interactions.

119
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,287
It is a second-order
microwave-driven transition

120
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:27,288
that has, therefore,
a fairly low probability

121
00:07:27,768 --> 00:07:31,768
and, therefore, usually requires
a high amount of power.

122
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,995
Now if one has a broad ESR line,
such as Tempol,

123
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,270
and, in addition to that,

124
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,498
has a moderate electron-electron coupling,

125
00:07:46,498 --> 00:07:49,267
due to a moderate electron concentration,

126
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:52,253
one can observe the cross effect.

127
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,295
So, starting from one single electron

128
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,545
and one single transition
with a high polarization,

129
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:03,796
and then bringing in again
another electron spin,

130
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,760
we see that our spin system
can be described by four energy levels

131
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,551
and that those two transitions

132
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:18,259
can be described by the electron
frequency of the spin one,

133
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,995
omega electron-1, here,

134
00:08:22,224 --> 00:08:25,764
and the electron frequency
of the spin two,

135
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,783
omega electron-2, here.

136
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:33,498
Now, what happens
when you drive microwave

137
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:35,998
precisely at the electron-1 frequency?

138
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:40,518
Well, you're going to
tend to saturate this transition

139
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,946
and equilibrate the distribution
of population

140
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:45,976
among these energy levels here.

141
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:51,762
At the same time,
T-1 is going to tend to drive back

142
00:08:51,762 --> 00:08:53,942
your population
to the thermal equilibrium,

143
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,243
which is here,
the highly-polarized state.

144
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,508
And now, if you consider a coupling
with a third spin,

145
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:07,766
for example the proton spin
of this Pyruvate molecule,

146
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:12,009
your energy level system
will be described now

147
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,759
not by four, but by <i>eight</i> energy levels.

148
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,761
If by chance the nuclear Larmor frequency

149
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:23,741
is about equal to the frequency
of the electron-2 minus the electron-1,

150
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:26,271
something interesting might happen.

151
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:31,264
So, again, let's shine a microwave
on the electron spin 1

152
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,264
and let's saturate those transitions.

153
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:40,016
So, again, one way to relax now

154
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:42,996
would be by T1 relaxation.

155
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:46,935
But here, since we have a coupling
with a third spin--

156
00:09:46,935 --> 00:09:50,264
with this nuclear spin--
you can see

157
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:54,004
that those energy levels
have exactly the same energy.

158
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,280
So, there is a transition here,
that we call cross effect,

159
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,800
that might be allowed.

160
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:03,752
If this happens,
population might flow freely

161
00:10:03,752 --> 00:10:06,552
from this level to this level of energy

162
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:11,522
while T1 will of course tend to bring down

163
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:15,262
the populations to the ground
polarized state.

164
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,734
So, if you think carefully,
by saturating here,

165
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:24,771
we start to populate those energy levels.

166
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,771
The cross effect tend to bring
some of the population

167
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,771
on this energy level,
and the T1 relaxation

168
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:35,301
tend to bring those spins here
down to the ground state.

169
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:39,306
And if you do that on the long time-scale,

170
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,540
longer than T1,
longer than the cross effect time,

171
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,240
you might end up with all your population

172
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,550
distributed on those two energy levels

173
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,979
which would result in a very high
nuclear polarization

174
00:10:53,979 --> 00:10:56,519
along these transitions.

175
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,799
Now, we can look at that
from another angle.

176
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:05,963
Here you see the population
distribution on all the energy levels,

177
00:11:05,963 --> 00:11:08,013
according to Bolzmann's law,

178
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,983
in a highly-polarized state.

179
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,277
When we shine a microwave
at a specific frequency,

180
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:17,737
we tend to equilibrate
the distribution of population

181
00:11:17,737 --> 00:11:20,047
along this transition here.

182
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:25,495
Now, again, we have a nuclear
Larmor frequency here

183
00:11:25,495 --> 00:11:28,775
that matches the difference in energy

184
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,225
between these electron spins here

185
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:33,776
and those electron spins there.

186
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:38,757
And cross effect will tend to
redistribute population

187
00:11:38,757 --> 00:11:40,977
amongst those energy levels here.

188
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:44,977
And this is going to create a net
proton polarization.

189
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:51,304
So, again, we can look at our ESR spectrum

190
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:53,244
and our microwave frequency,

191
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,060
and we're going to change
the microwave frequency

192
00:11:56,063 --> 00:12:00,503
until we see here a positive
proton polarization.

193
00:12:01,496 --> 00:12:03,256
And if we keep on increasing it,

194
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:06,766
we will yield a negative proton
polarization here.

195
00:12:08,742 --> 00:12:11,812
And what's interesting
in this cross effect

196
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:15,812
is that the difference in frequency
between the two maxima here,

197
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:20,262
positive and negative,
is about the proton Larmor frequency.

198
00:12:21,288 --> 00:12:25,226
So, again, if we look at C-13
instead of proton spins,

199
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:27,766
we'll see that
this is going to shrink down

200
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:30,286
to the Larmor frequency of the Carbon-13.

201
00:12:32,216 --> 00:12:36,736
So, cross effect is an electron-electron
nuclear spin process.

202
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:40,775
It requires moderate
electron-electron interaction.

203
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:45,271
and involves, simply,
allowed electron spin saturation.

204
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:52,245
So, in summary, we have
introduced the solid effect

205
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,309
that gives rise to well-resolved

206
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:57,499
positive and negative DNP lobes

207
00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:00,259
separated by two times
the Larmor frequency.

208
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,504
We've introduced
a differential solid effect

209
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,750
that gives rise to non-resolved
positive and negative lobes,

210
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,012
also at the nuclear Larmor
frequency times two.

211
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,737
And we have introduced the cross effect

212
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:20,016
that requires some electron-electron
dipolar interactions

213
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,979
and that give rise to a DNP
microwave spectra

214
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,749
with positive and negative lobes

215
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,543
separated by simply
the nuclear Larmor frequency.
