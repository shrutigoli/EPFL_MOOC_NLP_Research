1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,513
In the second part of Chapter Two,
I tried to summarize

2
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:12,727
the mathematics
that underlies the description

3
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,568
of the so-called
McConnell-Bloch equations,

4
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:19,049
which allow one to derive
such things as line broadening,

5
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:21,677
line narrowing, and coalescence

6
00:00:21,677 --> 00:00:26,355
on a rigorous basis, rather than
in terms of a purely empirical discussion.

7
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:30,899
Now, Peter Hore shows
a remarkably well-selected

8
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:34,141
set of examples
of chemical exchange.

9
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:37,777
I would like to start with
an example that is

10
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:40,957
as one of the last
of his illustrations because I think

11
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,871
it's one of the
most important ones.

12
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:46,493
It happens to have been
discovered in Switzerland

13
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:51,722
at ETH Zurich by Kurt Wuethrich
whose name I wrote out here.

14
00:00:51,722 --> 00:00:56,915
He got a
Nobel Prize for NMR of biomolecules.

15
00:00:56,915 --> 00:01:00,437
This was in 2002.

16
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,969
He once said, in an
informal lecture, that the effect

17
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,200
that I'm going to explain
to you now, was one of his

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,156
most important discoveries.

19
00:01:09,156 --> 00:01:10,960
I tend to agree
with that judgement.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
He has done many, many things,
but this is very intriguing.

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,128
We are talking about
the motion of tyrosine

22
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:20,294
which occurs in proteins.

23
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:24,384
You have the protein backbone,

24
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,274
then you have the CH2 group, next you
have a phenyl ring,

25
00:01:27,274 --> 00:01:30,501
with a para hydroxy
group. That is tyrosine.

26
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:35,679
There are four protons
in positions 2, 3, 5 and 6.

27
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,469
If the tyrosine is rotating freely,
as it would be in solution,

28
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,230
then you would expect
protons H3 and H5,

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,535
which are in meta-positions,
to have the same chemical shifts.

30
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:51,670
Likewise, you would expect H2
and H6 to have the same chemical shifts.

31
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,475
But Kurt Wuethrich did not record
these spectra in free solution,

32
00:01:55,475 --> 00:02:00,348
but he considered tyrosine,
actually amino-acid number 35

33
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:05,627
in this protein, which is called
basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,

34
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:09,591
(BPTI), which has about 70 amino acids. 

35
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,319
Number 35 happens to be a tyrosine.

36
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,972
There are other tyrosines,
but Tyr-35 is particularly interesting.

37
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,712
As you can see, you can
record spectra of BPTI

38
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:20,397
from very low temperatures,
just above freezing,

39
00:02:20,397 --> 00:02:21,808
to very high temperatures

40
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,680
without significant
denaturation of the protein.

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,239
This is not obvious, since
many proteins would be denatured.

42
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,728
But BPTI is quite happy.

43
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:33,669
At high temperatures,
you see that

44
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:38,237
protons H2 and H6 occur at

45
00:02:38,237 --> 00:02:42,808
the same chemical shift,
about 7.2 ppm.

46
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:48,470
Protons H3 and H5
also give rise to a single chemical shift.

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,831
The signal is actually split into
a doublet.

48
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:53,723
This doublet comes
from the coupling between

49
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,949
the ortho and the meta positions,

50
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,639
but that is not relevant
to today's discussion.

51
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,836
As you lower the temperature,
which is easy to do,

52
00:03:03,836 --> 00:03:07,602
you find that that spectrum
gets more complicated.

53
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:12,270
And the first thing that happens, when
going from fast flipping to slow flipping,

54
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,401
is that this signal broadens,
and then splits up into

55
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,806
two distinct resonances.

56
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:21,710
One corresponds to the ortho position H2,

57
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,723
the other corresponds
to the ortho position H6.

58
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:30,560
These two protons now have
dramatically different chemical shifts.

59
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,905
The difference comes not from
the tyrosine itself,

60
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,006
but from its environment.

61
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:38,182
It turns out that the protein
environment on one side is distinct

62
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,538
from the protein environment
on the other side.

63
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:45,214
And therefore, the two protons H2 and H6
are exposed to different local fields,

64
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,308
and have different chemical shifts.

65
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:51,476
Something similar happens
if we look at protons H3 and H5.

66
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:56,246
These are in meta positions,
which I put in a square box.

67
00:03:56,246 --> 00:03:59,624
So at high temperature,
they are simply degenerate.

68
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:02,270
The doublet structure
is irrelevant here.

69
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,160
And when you go to lower
and lower temperatures,

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,396
they broaden and split up
into two distinct resonances,

71
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:14,132
H5 and H3 here,
two distinct doublets.

72
00:04:14,132 --> 00:04:16,615
Now the remarkable thing is that,

73
00:04:16,615 --> 00:04:19,824
although the temperature scale
is the same,

74
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:23,745
the coalescence for the two
protons that are close together

75
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:27,604
at low temperatures occurs
at about 40 degrees.

76
00:04:27,604 --> 00:04:29,509
Whereas the coalescence
of the two protons

77
00:04:29,509 --> 00:04:33,249
that are far away from each other
occurs at about 60 degrees.

78
00:04:33,249 --> 00:04:36,634
That is simply
a confirmation of the laws

79
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:39,816
established by Bloch and McConnell
and can be calculated

80
00:04:39,816 --> 00:04:44,593
with the theory
that I explained in the previous part.

81
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:49,352
Actually, beyond a simple illustration,
this picture has dramatic implications

82
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:52,918
for proteins and the understanding
of protein dynamics

83
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,795
because this interconversion
really supposes that

84
00:04:56,795 --> 00:05:00,499
the ring flips,

85
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:06,534
that the aromatic ring of the
tyrosine actually flips over.

86
00:05:06,534 --> 00:05:10,198
Now that means that
it must be standing upright,

87
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:12,469
perpendicular to the plane
of the paper,

88
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:14,628
maybe for a very short interval.

89
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:16,971
But it has to be able
to flip over from

90
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,019
this flat position 
to the flat position the other way.

91
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,268
so that the positions
of H2 and H6 can interchange,

92
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:25,912
and, likewise, 
H3 and H5 can interchange.

93
00:05:25,912 --> 00:05:30,050
Now that implies that
the protein must be dynamic,

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,523
that it must be able
to “breathe”, as it were,

95
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:36,369
in order to leave sufficient room
for such an exchange process.

96
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,362
Indeed, a quite remarkable observation.

97
00:05:39,362 --> 00:05:43,274
There are more basic examples.
This one was probably already

98
00:05:43,274 --> 00:05:45,858
discovered in the '50s, 
possibly at CERN

99
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:51,161
by the early investigations
of Dharmatti and others,

100
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:53,450
who studied ethanol.

101
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:58,183
It turns out that if we consider
the multiplets of ethanol at neutral pH,

102
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:02,196
i.e., at pH 7,

103
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,833
we do not only see
the usual triplet

104
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,205
of the methyl group
that is due to the neighboring CH2:

105
00:06:09,205 --> 00:06:11,838
the CH2 is not simply
split into a quartet

106
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,337
because of the neighboring CH3,
but it is, in addition, split into a doublet

107
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:19,035
because of the neighboring OH.

108
00:06:19,035 --> 00:06:22,453
We can actually see
this OH proton.

109
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:27,599
It is split into a triplet
because it is scalar-coupled,

110
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,820
to the neighboring CH2.

111
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,126
It turns out that
you only have to add

112
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:36,848
a minute amount,
a trace amount of acid

113
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:38,820
for this effect to go away.

114
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,861
Then we observe
a singlet here.

115
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:50,555
And the multiplet of the CH2 group
collapses to a simple binomial quartet.

116
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:54,298
So the question is, why do we
observe such a collapse in the spectrum?

117
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:58,768
The answer is, if we consider
a single molecule,

118
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:02,968
the monomeric form of ethanol,
we may have a proton

119
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:06,902
called H_A,
which may well have a polarization

120
00:07:06,902 --> 00:07:11,320
that is parallel to the magnetic field,
which we call alpha.

121
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:16,193
The external proton, the one that
comes from the water or from the acid,

122
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,699
could be called proton H_B.

123
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,158
In this hypothesis it has
the opposite polarization, namely beta.

124
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:24,468
If these two exchange,
and that is exactly

125
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:28,880
what chemical exchange is all about,
then, of course, the H_B proton

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,256
will become part of the ethanol molecule.

127
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:33,985
But it will retain its beta polarization.

128
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:37,214
Whereas the H_A proton will go out
into the medium

129
00:07:37,214 --> 00:07:39,776
while retaining its alpha polarization.

130
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:44,460
From the point of view
of the CH2 protons,

131
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,082
it looks as if the neighboring

132
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:51,199
proton in the hydroxy position

133
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,654
has flipped from alpha to beta.

134
00:07:53,654 --> 00:07:56,331
This flipping can occur
at a phenomenal rate

135
00:07:56,331 --> 00:08:00,875
because acid-base reactions
are extremely fast.  

136
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:06,492
Therefore,they can lead to a collapse
of the multiplicity of the CH2 group.

137
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,237
And that is exactly what we see here.

138
00:08:09,237 --> 00:08:13,175
You will recall that this line
can also be broadened

139
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:16,935
because of exchange between
OH and the environment,

140
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:19,820
it's not easy to observe
such a sharp line.

141
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,969
But normally, we just see this part.

142
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:27,927
We should indeed see a quartet
and a triplet.

143
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:32,190
One of the best examples
that Peter Hore has cited in his book,

144
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,759
is due to David Grant
and others in Salt Lake City,

145
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,042
is cis-decalin.

146
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:42,569
This can be drawn
as a flat molecule.

147
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:47,462
It is not aromatic,
but it can still be drawn like this.

148
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,956
And if we do it that way,
we can number the positions.

149
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:51,819
We talk about
either carbons or protons,

150
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,256
in this case, the carbons.

151
00:08:58,256 --> 00:09:01,669
This is the conventional
numbering of this molecule.

152
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:05,487
And if we draw it like this, it is not
surprising that the symmetry implies

153
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:09,176
that the chemical shifts
of these two sites are identical.

154
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:11,025
You can see that

155
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:14,048
the chemical shifts of this site should
be the same as of this site.

156
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:16,645
And this site should be
the same as this site.

157
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:19,241
Of course, the other
sites are distinct,

158
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:24,534
so we find that these sites
are all distinct from the previous ones.

159
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:29,035
In effect,
at 46 degrees Celsius,

160
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,845
the molecule can be
essentially considered

161
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:36,635
as interconverting so fast
that we are allowed to draw it on a flat plane.

162
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:39,274
At that temperature,
we only have one peak

163
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:42,429
that corresponds to these two
bridging carbons.

164
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:45,849
We have one peak that
corresponds to the four carbons

165
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:48,235
that I have circled here.

166
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:53,432
And there's one peak for the four carbons
that I have put in square boxes.

167
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,013
So far, so good.

168
00:09:55,013 --> 00:09:57,615
Now it turns out that if
we go to a lower temperature,

169
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:01,595
from 46 to 16 to -12 to -29,

170
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:04,876
then the situation becomes
more complicated.

171
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:09,322
Like in the case of
Wuethrich's tyrosine, we see

172
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,170
that these lines split up.

173
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,052
The reason is that at
lower temperatures, we have

174
00:10:14,052 --> 00:10:20,375
to consider these molecules as
separate rotamers, or separate conformers,

175
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:23,023
where the symmetry is reduced.

176
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:26,400
We still have a symmetry
between these two,

177
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,659
and likewise between these two,
that has been preserved.

178
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:33,234
Indeed this line doesn't move
at all as a function of temperature.

179
00:10:33,234 --> 00:10:36,891
But we see now that this line,

180
00:10:36,891 --> 00:10:41,983
although it's the same as this one,
it is no longer the same as that one,

181
00:10:41,983 --> 00:10:43,978
and no longer the same
as that line.

182
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:48,569
So C1 and C5 still pile up together,

183
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:51,952
and C4 and C8 are still degenerate.

184
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,484
But they are no longer equal.

185
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:57,572
However, if we warm them up,
so you see that C1 and C5,

186
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,693
and C4 and C8 tend to coalesce

187
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:05,789
and end up in the positions
that I've indicated previously.

188
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:10,709
There is here a two-fold coalescence.

189
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:14,505
We notice that, in this case, the coalescence occurs

190
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:15,991
at about the same temperature.

191
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,270
Because the splittings between
these two and these two, by accident,

192
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,550
happen to be about the same.

193
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,132
This is a very good example.

194
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,915
In fact, at the beginning
of this chapter, I spoke about

195
00:11:25,915 --> 00:11:29,482
the interconversion of cyclohexane,
which as I mentioned,

196
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:32,276
is too fast. But in cis-decaline

197
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:37,084
the exchange becomes slow enough so that you
can observe it

198
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:39,376
in the vicinity of room temperature.

199
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:42,585
The next example is much
more sophisticated.

200
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,633
This is known as bullvalene.

201
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:47,050
It's one of these molecules
that was probably designed

202
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,307
in order to get into the
Guinness Book of Records

203
00:11:50,307 --> 00:11:52,191
for maximum complexity.

204
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:57,712
In fact, all we have to remember
is that we have a cyclopropane unit

205
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:02,915
with three 
carbon-13 positions.

206
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:07,180
We also have a bridging position
which is a lone position.

207
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,071
There are all sorts of 
so-called Cope rearrangements

208
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,174
where the double bonds travel

209
00:12:13,174 --> 00:12:17,232
and the cyclopropane ring opens up.

210
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:19,279
I will not give you a lecture
on organic chemistry,

211
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,027
but you see that this cycle
turns up here and so on and so forth.

212
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:29,160
And in doing so, for example,
this site here, which was the isolated D,

213
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,984
now becomes a site A, which is typical
of the environment of cyclopropane.

214
00:12:34,984 --> 00:12:39,669
And so indeed, there is an
interconversion between A and D.

215
00:12:39,669 --> 00:12:42,377
And in fact, the entire process
can be summed up

216
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,651
in this topological graph,
showing that D goes to A,

217
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:51,747
while A goes to C, C to B, and B remains,
in part, equal to itself

218
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:55,641
in the course of this Cope rearrangement.

219
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:59,318
At high temperature, there's only one position.

220
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:02,609
But as we lower the temperature
it splits up into many lines.

221
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:06,357
And we can, of course,
determine the exchange rates

222
00:13:06,357 --> 00:13:10,971
of these processes by doing
an analysis of the line shapes.

223
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:15,100
The next example in Peter Hore's book
should be more to the liking

224
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,762
of people who are interested
in organometallic chemistry.

225
00:13:18,762 --> 00:13:21,921
Peter Hore cites an example

226
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:25,795
of a ruthenium complex
where you have a ruthenium

227
00:13:25,795 --> 00:13:30,714
that is hovering
over this cyclooctatetraene ring.

228
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:34,832
In doing so, can be
attached to different positions.

229
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:39,081
We have two ordinary double bonds,
in these delocalized bonds

230
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:43,945
where the ruthenium is most strongly attached.

231
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:48,341
It turns out that the ruthenium
is not very tightly bound 

232
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:52,794
and can move a little bit like the hands
of a clock around a dial.

233
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:57,374
At high temperatures,
we have a single line in carbon-13 NMR,

234
00:13:57,374 --> 00:14:01,476
but as the temperature is decreased,
it splits up into a manifold.

235
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:05,714
Again, we can draw topological diagrams

236
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:10,958
which show the exchange rates between
these four different forms.

237
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,694
It turns out that the question here
is whether we have a 1-2 shift,

238
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:18,709
or a 1-3 shift, or a 1-4 shift,
or a 1-5 shift.

239
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:24,108
The spectra allow you
to rule out some of these mechanisms

240
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:29,898
and choose the one that is correct.

241
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:34,502
The next example in this chapter
has already been discussed

242
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:39,122
in an earlier chapter about
scalar couplings between

243
00:14:39,122 --> 00:14:42,400
a spin S = 1/2, such as a carbon-13,
and a quadrupolar spin

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,280
such as lithium-6.

245
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,405
Lithium-6 has a spin I = 1,

246
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:56,265
therefore, it has three possible states,
<i>m = +1, 0 or -1.</i>

247
00:14:56,265 --> 00:15:01,153
Consequently, the neighboring
carbon-13, if there were only

248
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:06,996
one lithium-6, would be split into
a triplet, with three equal intensities.

249
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,625
This is known
as a non-binomial triplet.

250
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:15,042
As we have discussed before,
four lithium atoms can make

251
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:17,820
a tetrahedral structure.

252
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,760
These tertiary butyl groups

253
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,888
can attach

254
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:29,587
not to the corners of the
tetrahedron, but to

255
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:32,540
the middle of each
of the triangular faces.

256
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,692
At low temperatures,
each carbon-13 will be coupled

257
00:15:37,692 --> 00:15:40,046
to three lithium-6.

258
00:15:40,046 --> 00:15:46,228
This results in a rather peculiar
non-binomial multiplet

259
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,169
at low temperature.

260
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,409
But the situation gets even
more complex if we heat it up.

261
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,189
If we go from low
to high temperature

262
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:57,259
it turns out
that these groups

263
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,830
can move.

264
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,370
They can hop from
one triangular surface to another.

265
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,420
Or, if you prefer, they stay
where they are,

266
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,211
but it's the lithium cluster
that rotates within the cloud

267
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:13,211
of carbon substituents.

268
00:16:13,211 --> 00:16:17,185
Whatever the case may be,
it turns out that at 26 degrees Celsius,

269
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:22,814
we find that each carbon-13 is coupled
not to 3 lithium-6 nuclei, but 4 lithium-6 nuclei,

270
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:26,650
because all four lithium-6 nuclei, even this
remote one, will at one point

271
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,732
be close to the carbon-13,
and have a scalar coupling.

272
00:16:30,732 --> 00:16:32,155
We see two interesting things.

273
00:16:32,155 --> 00:16:35,098
First of all, the multiplet
becomes more complex.

274
00:16:35,098 --> 00:16:39,432
In addition, the effective scalar coupling,
the splitting

275
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,312
is larger here than it was there.

276
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:46,558
It is actually reduced
because of the averaging.

277
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:49,518
So I'd like to summarize
Chapter Four

278
00:16:49,518 --> 00:16:53,837
that Peter Hore
dedicated to chemical exchange,

279
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,341
which seems to be one
of his favorite subjects.

280
00:16:56,341 --> 00:17:02,009
It is indeed one of the key aspects
of modern magnetic resonance.

281
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:05,690
Chemical exchange effects in NMR
can arise either

282
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,499
from chemical reactions or from
conformational equilibria.

283
00:17:10,499 --> 00:17:15,186
In the slow exchange regime,
NMR lines are simply broadened,

284
00:17:15,186 --> 00:17:17,342
and we can measure
that exchange rates by

285
00:17:17,342 --> 00:17:19,722
looking at the line-widths.

286
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:24,669
The difference in NMR
frequencies between exchanging spins

287
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:30,594
can be averaged by fast exchange.

288
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:35,423
It is the magnitude of delta nu,
that is to say the difference

289
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,776
in the chemical shifts between
the nuclei that are involved

290
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,632
in exchange processes,

291
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:45,305
relative to the exchange rate constants
that determines whether

292
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:50,529
the exchange process is
in the slow or in the fast regime.

293
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,656
Chemical exchange effects give
information on rates and mechanisms

294
00:17:55,656 --> 00:18:02,366
of chemical reactions, molecular
rearrangements and internal motions.

295
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:06,822
Now most comments in Peter Hore's book
refer to chemical exchange

296
00:18:06,822 --> 00:18:11,658
between sites that are distinct
because of their chemical shifts.

297
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,659
But there are other ways
of distinguishing sites.

298
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:18,917
One of them, for example,
is the quadrupole interaction in solids.

299
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:22,292
Here, at the Ecole Polytechnique
in Lausanne, we have spent years

300
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:25,635
determining the spectra
of nitrogen-14 which

301
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:28,440
is a quadrupolar nucleus
with a spin I = 1,

302
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,379
and has a quadrupole interaction
that ranges

303
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:33,529
from 1 to about 5 MHz.

304
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:38,011
We have observed
exchange-broadening effects

305
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:42,648
between different sites that
are interchanging at very high rates.

306
00:18:42,648 --> 00:18:46,490
When the exchange rate
is, say, 1 MHz,

307
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,117
that means the lifetime is
on the order of 10 to the -9.

308
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:53,378
That is to say nanoseconds.

309
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:58,577
Consequently, nitrogen-14 spectra
in solids are sensitive to processes

310
00:18:58,577 --> 00:19:02,346
that occur on a timescale
of about a nanosecond.

311
00:19:02,346 --> 00:19:04,783
It all depends which
nuclei you look at

312
00:19:04,783 --> 00:19:06,671
and in which environments.

313
00:19:06,671 --> 00:19:10,541
Chemical exchange is probably
one of the subjects that will live

314
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,184
for many years to come.

315
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:16,548
Currently, much attention is
paid to chemical exchange in proteins

316
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:21,552
and also in DNA, for it has been found
that the well-known double helix

317
00:19:21,552 --> 00:19:24,196
is not as static as it appears,
 

318
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:27,055
and there are many exchange processes
that are worth studying

319
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,945
in large biomolecules.

320
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,976
Thank you for your attention.
