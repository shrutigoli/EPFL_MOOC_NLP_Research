So far, we have simply explained in an empirical fashion how chemical exchange affects
NMR spectra.
And we have shown you some computer simulations without telling you how these effects can be calculated.
Let me try to explain the basics now.
First of all, we spoke of spectra, which in the low exchange regime, comprise at least two lines, with frequencies nu zero B and nu zero A, so these are two chemical shifts.
It turns out that such a spectrum, which typically is drawn from right to left, by convention, is obtained by an operation called a Fourier transformation, which I just write as a black box with this italic <i>F</i>.
We'll talk more about this in Chapter 6.
The time domain signal was called by Felix Bloch â€œFree Induction Decayâ€� (FID).
We shall see in Chapter 6 how you can record an FID.
This time domain signal is, in this simple case, composed of a superposition of two different cosine waves which have two different arguments.
There is a phase for site A which is equal to two pi times nu zero A times t.
And there is a phase for site B which is also proportional to two pi nu zero B and to time.
So we have two cosine waves, simply <i>cos phi A + cos phi B</i>.
So both of these phases are linearly proportional to time.
If you draw them, you have a slow beat, with dotted lines that correspond to the lowest frequency of the slow cosine wave.
On top of that, a faster cosine wave.
Now we can plot the difference in phase: <i>Delta phi</i>.
Delta phi is the difference between the fast and slow phases.
<i>Delta phi = phi A - phi B</i>.
If these equations hold, that is to say, if there is no chemical exchange, you expect the difference in phase to be simply proportional to time, since both of these factors are proportional to time, we have a simple line with a slope that is determined by the difference in chemical shifts.
The slope would actually be
<i>two pi times delta nu</i> which is the difference in chemical shifts.
This is applicable if there is no exchange, but if there is hopping of the molecules from one site to the other, so A becomes B and B becomes A, then these different signals cannot build up a phase difference, because we effectively hop from one curve to another in a stochastic fashion.
This haphazard hopping, from one site to the other means that the chemical shift differences are averaged to zero.
This means that there can be no build-up of a difference in phase.
If the exchange is reasonably fast without being infinitely fast, then we get this rather noisy line where the phase difference is close to zero degrees.
If we have a very fast exchange, an infinitely fast exchange, then there will be a sharp horizontal line, without any stochastic excursions.
So far, we have discussed the consequences of chemical exchange on the line width and line positions in NMR spectra in a sort of empirical fashion, supporting our discussion by numerical simulations, but without telling you how these numerical simulations were made.
To understand that we have to go one step beyond.
I would like to discuss what happens with the magnetization in a frame that we shall discuss in Chapter Six, which is known as the â€œrotating frameâ€�.
It turns out that the magnetization can be drawn as a vector.
This vector has an X component and a Y component.
In the course of a magnetic resonance experiment, the vector will undergo both a precession and a decay of its magnitude.
The precession angle between its initial position and its position at time <i>t</i> can be called <i>phase as a function of t</i>.
It turns out to be convenient to define a complex number, which I call <i>M_+(t)</i>, and which is defined as
<i>M_X(t) + i times M_Y(t)</i>.
This is a simple complex notation.
Incidentally, it's modelled after a so-called <i>raising operator</i> that is used in quantum mechanics.
This is defined as 
<i>I_+ = I_X + i times I_Y</i>.
This is the model for our definition of <i>M_+(t)</i>.
To describe procession we can write
<i>M_+(t) = M_+(t=0) times a complex number</i>.
This notation encompasses both the amplitude and the phase at time t = 0.
The precession is given be the product of
<i>two pi nu zero</i>, i.e., of the chemical shift of the magnetization, and <i>time t</i>.
We can embellish this notation by taking into account the decrease of the amplitude.
This can be done by multiplying with a decaying function.
This equation describes both the precession and the transverse relaxation of the magnetization.
We can obtain the time derivative, which we can write
<i> d/dt</i> of the complex number, which can be written in shorthand notation
<i>M_+(t) with a dot </i>, which is the same as this expression
We now consider two different magnetization vectors precessing with different angular velocities.
We can use different colors.
The second magnetization vector, which is drawn in green, will have a different phase angle, say a faster precession.
Its phase would be moving faster.
The phase of site B also depends on time t,
We can rewrite these equations, both for sites A and B.
For the vector A, this is the time derivative
I can do the same thing for the vector B, if I replace A by B, replace all of the Aâ€™s by Bâ€™s, and in this fashion we can â€œcook upâ€� an equation that describes the magnetization of the other site, without actually rewriting everything.
So far so good, we will see in a minute why this is convenient to describe chemical exchange.
So in the previous picture you have seen how the precession can be described in terms of a complex magnetization vector with a phase and amplitude.
Now we shall discuss how chemical kinetics can affect this precession.
To prepare the ground, letâ€™s start with a simple equation: the chemical transformation of A into B, which is accompanied by the reverse reaction.
We know that if we take the time derivative of the concentration of A that it will decrease with a factor proportional to the initial concentration of A, but it will be replenished, as it were, by the reverse reaction from B to A.
In this notation we distinguish
<i>k_forward and k_backward</i>
Likewise, the time dependence of the concentration of B, will be proportional to the concentration of A, which is, as it were, fueled by the forward reaction.
At the same time, the concentration of B is depleted by the backward reaction.
This is a set of two differential equations.
It turns out to be convenient to write them in the form of a matrix and a vector. 
We have the time derivative of a vector consisting of the concentration of A and the concentration of B, both time-dependent quantities. 
We have a matrix which is made up of the coefficients that we see here:
<i>- k_forward + k_backward 
+ k_forward - k_backward</i>.
This matrix multiplies another vector, comprising the same concentrations of A and B.
So this is a simple description of first-order chemical kinetics.
It turns out that we can express the interplay of the magnetization vectors by describing their interconversion.
To do that we have to take the time derivatives of the complex magnetization vector of site A and the complex magnetization vector of site B, and we make a vector of these two complex numbers. 
In this matrix we have 
<i>- k_forward </i> that we know stems from chemical exchange, but we also have a phase due to the chemical shift.
Here we have
<i>+ k_backward</i> and here we have
<i>+ k_forward</i> and here we have
<i>- k_backward</i> but we include a phase due to the chemical shift.
This matrix then multiplies the vector of two complex numbers M, the complex number that describes the magnetization of site A and the complex number that describes the magnetization of site B.
So this equation describes both the chemical exchange which is expressed by the symbols k and the precession due to the chemical shifts of sites A and B.
We can embellish this by inserting
<i>1/T_2 of site A</i> in the first diagonal element, and by inserting 
<i>1/T_2 of site B</i> in the last diagonal element.
The basic idea is that we have a
2 x 2 matrix.
Such a differential equation can be resolved, by diagonalizing the matrix.
It is not a completely trivial matrix to diagonalize because it is not necessarily symmetric, and also has imaginary components in the diagonal elements, but it can be done. Moreover, this can be generalized for N > 2 sites.
It is quite remarkable that you can handle an arbitrary number N of sites, say A, B, C, D â€¦, set up a matrix and diagonalize this matrix.
This kind of calculation forms the foundation of the simulations that you have seen in the first part of this chapter.
This concludes Part 2 of this Chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
