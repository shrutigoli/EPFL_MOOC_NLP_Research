In the second part of Chapter Two,
I tried to summarize the mathematics that underlies the description of the so-called
McConnell-Bloch equations, which allow one to derive such things as line broadening, line narrowing, and coalescence on a rigorous basis, rather than in terms of a purely empirical discussion.
Now, Peter Hore shows a remarkably well-selected set of examples of chemical exchange.
I would like to start with an example that is as one of the last of his illustrations because I think it's one of the most important ones.
It happens to have been discovered in Switzerland at ETH Zurich by Kurt Wuethrich whose name I wrote out here.
He got a
Nobel Prize for NMR of biomolecules.
This was in 2002.
He once said, in an informal lecture, that the effect that I'm going to explain to you now, was one of his most important discoveries.
I tend to agree with that judgement.
He has done many, many things, but this is very intriguing.
We are talking about the motion of tyrosine which occurs in proteins.
You have the protein backbone, then you have the CH2 group, next you have a phenyl ring, with a para hydroxy group. That is tyrosine.
There are four protons in positions 2, 3, 5 and 6.
If the tyrosine is rotating freely, as it would be in solution, then you would expect protons H3 and H5, which are in meta-positions, to have the same chemical shifts.
Likewise, you would expect H2 and H6 to have the same chemical shifts.
But Kurt Wuethrich did not record these spectra in free solution, but he considered tyrosine, actually amino-acid number 35 in this protein, which is called basic pancreatic trypsin inhibitor,
(BPTI), which has about 70 amino acids. 
Number 35 happens to be a tyrosine.
There are other tyrosines, but Tyr-35 is particularly interesting.
As you can see, you can record spectra of BPTI from very low temperatures, just above freezing, to very high temperatures without significant denaturation of the protein.
This is not obvious, since many proteins would be denatured.
But BPTI is quite happy.
At high temperatures, you see that protons H2 and H6 occur at the same chemical shift, about 7.2 ppm.
Protons H3 and H5 also give rise to a single chemical shift.
The signal is actually split into a doublet.
This doublet comes from the coupling between the ortho and the meta positions, but that is not relevant to today's discussion.
As you lower the temperature, which is easy to do, you find that that spectrum gets more complicated.
And the first thing that happens, when going from fast flipping to slow flipping, is that this signal broadens, and then splits up into two distinct resonances.
One corresponds to the ortho position H2, the other corresponds to the ortho position H6.
These two protons now have dramatically different chemical shifts.
The difference comes not from the tyrosine itself, but from its environment.
It turns out that the protein environment on one side is distinct from the protein environment on the other side.
And therefore, the two protons H2 and H6 are exposed to different local fields, and have different chemical shifts.
Something similar happens if we look at protons H3 and H5.
These are in meta positions, which I put in a square box.
So at high temperature, they are simply degenerate.
The doublet structure is irrelevant here.
And when you go to lower and lower temperatures, they broaden and split up into two distinct resonances,
H5 and H3 here, two distinct doublets.
Now the remarkable thing is that, although the temperature scale is the same, the coalescence for the two protons that are close together at low temperatures occurs at about 40 degrees.
Whereas the coalescence of the two protons that are far away from each other occurs at about 60 degrees.
That is simply a confirmation of the laws established by Bloch and McConnell and can be calculated with the theory that I explained in the previous part.
Actually, beyond a simple illustration, this picture has dramatic implications for proteins and the understanding of protein dynamics because this interconversion really supposes that the ring flips, that the aromatic ring of the tyrosine actually flips over.
Now that means that it must be standing upright, perpendicular to the plane of the paper, maybe for a very short interval.
But it has to be able to flip over from this flat position to the flat position the other way. so that the positions of H2 and H6 can interchange, and, likewise, 
H3 and H5 can interchange.
Now that implies that the protein must be dynamic, that it must be able to â€œbreatheâ€�, as it were, in order to leave sufficient room for such an exchange process.
Indeed, a quite remarkable observation.
There are more basic examples.
This one was probably already discovered in the '50s, possibly at CERN by the early investigations of Dharmatti and others, who studied ethanol.
It turns out that if we consider the multiplets of ethanol at neutral pH, i.e., at pH 7, we do not only see the usual triplet of the methyl group that is due to the neighboring CH2: the CH2 is not simply split into a quartet because of the neighboring CH3, but it is, in addition, split into a doublet because of the neighboring OH.
We can actually see this OH proton.
It is split into a triplet because it is scalar-coupled, to the neighboring CH2.
It turns out that you only have to add a minute amount, a trace amount of acid for this effect to go away.
Then we observe a singlet here.
And the multiplet of the CH2 group collapses to a simple binomial quartet.
So the question is, why do we observe such a collapse in the spectrum?
The answer is, if we consider a single molecule, the monomeric form of ethanol, we may have a proton called H_A, which may well have a polarization that is parallel to the magnetic field, which we call alpha.
The external proton, the one that comes from the water or from the acid, could be called proton H_B.
In this hypothesis it has the opposite polarization, namely beta.
If these two exchange, and that is exactly what chemical exchange is all about, then, of course, the H_B proton will become part of the ethanol molecule.
But it will retain its beta polarization.
Whereas the H_A proton will go out into the medium while retaining its alpha polarization.
From the point of view of the CH2 protons, it looks as if the neighboring proton in the hydroxy position has flipped from alpha to beta.
This flipping can occur at a phenomenal rate because acid-base reactions are extremely fast.  
Therefore,they can lead to a collapse of the multiplicity of the CH2 group.
And that is exactly what we see here.
You will recall that this line can also be broadened because of exchange between
OH and the environment, it's not easy to observe such a sharp line.
But normally, we just see this part.
We should indeed see a quartet and a triplet.
One of the best examples that Peter Hore has cited in his book, is due to David Grant and others in Salt Lake City, is cis-decalin.
This can be drawn as a flat molecule.
It is not aromatic, but it can still be drawn like this.
And if we do it that way, we can number the positions.
We talk about either carbons or protons, in this case, the carbons.
This is the conventional numbering of this molecule.
And if we draw it like this, it is not surprising that the symmetry implies that the chemical shifts of these two sites are identical.
You can see that the chemical shifts of this site should be the same as of this site.
And this site should be the same as this site.
Of course, the other sites are distinct, so we find that these sites are all distinct from the previous ones.
In effect, at 46 degrees Celsius, the molecule can be essentially considered as interconverting so fast that we are allowed to draw it on a flat plane.
At that temperature, we only have one peak that corresponds to these two bridging carbons.
We have one peak that corresponds to the four carbons that I have circled here.
And there's one peak for the four carbons that I have put in square boxes.
So far, so good.
Now it turns out that if we go to a lower temperature, from 46 to 16 to -12 to -29, then the situation becomes more complicated.
Like in the case of
Wuethrich's tyrosine, we see that these lines split up.
The reason is that at lower temperatures, we have to consider these molecules as separate rotamers, or separate conformers, where the symmetry is reduced.
We still have a symmetry between these two, and likewise between these two, that has been preserved.
Indeed this line doesn't move at all as a function of temperature.
But we see now that this line, although it's the same as this one, it is no longer the same as that one, and no longer the same as that line.
So C1 and C5 still pile up together, and C4 and C8 are still degenerate.
But they are no longer equal.
However, if we warm them up, so you see that C1 and C5, and C4 and C8 tend to coalesce and end up in the positions that I've indicated previously.
There is here a two-fold coalescence.
We notice that, in this case, the coalescence occurs at about the same temperature.
Because the splittings between these two and these two, by accident, happen to be about the same.
This is a very good example.
In fact, at the beginning of this chapter, I spoke about the interconversion of cyclohexane, which as I mentioned, is too fast. But in cis-decaline the exchange becomes slow enough so that you can observe it in the vicinity of room temperature.
The next example is much more sophisticated.
This is known as bullvalene.
It's one of these molecules that was probably designed in order to get into the
Guinness Book of Records for maximum complexity.
In fact, all we have to remember is that we have a cyclopropane unit with three carbon-13 positions.
We also have a bridging position which is a lone position.
There are all sorts of so-called Cope rearrangements where the double bonds travel and the cyclopropane ring opens up.
I will not give you a lecture on organic chemistry, but you see that this cycle turns up here and so on and so forth.
And in doing so, for example, this site here, which was the isolated D, now becomes a site A, which is typical of the environment of cyclopropane.
And so indeed, there is an interconversion between A and D.
And in fact, the entire process can be summed up in this topological graph, showing that D goes to A, while A goes to C, C to B, and B remains, in part, equal to itself in the course of this Cope rearrangement.
At high temperature, there's only one position.
But as we lower the temperature it splits up into many lines.
And we can, of course, determine the exchange rates of these processes by doing an analysis of the line shapes.
The next example in Peter Hore's book should be more to the liking of people who are interested in organometallic chemistry.
Peter Hore cites an example of a ruthenium complex where you have a ruthenium that is hovering over this cyclooctatetraene ring.
In doing so, can be attached to different positions.
We have two ordinary double bonds, in these delocalized bonds where the ruthenium is most strongly attached.
It turns out that the ruthenium is not very tightly bound and can move a little bit like the hands of a clock around a dial.
At high temperatures, we have a single line in carbon-13 NMR, but as the temperature is decreased, it splits up into a manifold.
Again, we can draw topological diagrams which show the exchange rates between these four different forms.
It turns out that the question here is whether we have a 1-2 shift, or a 1-3 shift, or a 1-4 shift, or a 1-5 shift.
The spectra allow you to rule out some of these mechanisms and choose the one that is correct.
The next example in this chapter has already been discussed in an earlier chapter about scalar couplings between a spin S = 1/2, such as a carbon-13, and a quadrupolar spin such as lithium-6.
Lithium-6 has a spin I = 1, therefore, it has three possible states,
<i>m = +1, 0 or -1.</i>
Consequently, the neighboring carbon-13, if there were only one lithium-6, would be split into a triplet, with three equal intensities.
This is known as a non-binomial triplet.
As we have discussed before, four lithium atoms can make a tetrahedral structure.
These tertiary butyl groups can attach not to the corners of the tetrahedron, but to the middle of each of the triangular faces.
At low temperatures, each carbon-13 will be coupled to three lithium-6.
This results in a rather peculiar non-binomial multiplet at low temperature.
But the situation gets even more complex if we heat it up.
If we go from low to high temperature it turns out that these groups can move.
They can hop from one triangular surface to another.
Or, if you prefer, they stay where they are, but it's the lithium cluster that rotates within the cloud of carbon substituents.
Whatever the case may be, it turns out that at 26 degrees Celsius, we find that each carbon-13 is coupled not to 3 lithium-6 nuclei, but 4 lithium-6 nuclei, because all four lithium-6 nuclei, even this remote one, will at one point be close to the carbon-13, and have a scalar coupling.
We see two interesting things.
First of all, the multiplet becomes more complex.
In addition, the effective scalar coupling, the splitting is larger here than it was there.
It is actually reduced because of the averaging.
So I'd like to summarize
Chapter Four that Peter Hore dedicated to chemical exchange, which seems to be one of his favorite subjects.
It is indeed one of the key aspects of modern magnetic resonance.
Chemical exchange effects in NMR can arise either from chemical reactions or from conformational equilibria.
In the slow exchange regime,
NMR lines are simply broadened, and we can measure that exchange rates by looking at the line-widths.
The difference in NMR frequencies between exchanging spins can be averaged by fast exchange.
It is the magnitude of delta nu, that is to say the difference in the chemical shifts between the nuclei that are involved in exchange processes, relative to the exchange rate constants that determines whether the exchange process is in the slow or in the fast regime.
Chemical exchange effects give information on rates and mechanisms of chemical reactions, molecular rearrangements and internal motions.
Now most comments in Peter Hore's book refer to chemical exchange between sites that are distinct because of their chemical shifts.
But there are other ways of distinguishing sites.
One of them, for example, is the quadrupole interaction in solids.
Here, at the Ecole Polytechnique in Lausanne, we have spent years determining the spectra of nitrogen-14 which is a quadrupolar nucleus with a spin I = 1, and has a quadrupole interaction that ranges from 1 to about 5 MHz.
We have observed exchange-broadening effects between different sites that are interchanging at very high rates.
When the exchange rate is, say, 1 MHz, that means the lifetime is on the order of 10 to the -9.
That is to say nanoseconds.
Consequently, nitrogen-14 spectra in solids are sensitive to processes that occur on a timescale of about a nanosecond.
It all depends which nuclei you look at and in which environments.
Chemical exchange is probably one of the subjects that will live for many years to come.
Currently, much attention is paid to chemical exchange in proteins and also in DNA, for it has been found that the well-known double helix is not as static as it appears, and there are many exchange processes that are worth studying in large biomolecules.
Thank you for your attention.
