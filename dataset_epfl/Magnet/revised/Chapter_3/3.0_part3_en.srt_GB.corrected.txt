Welcome to part three of this chapter.
It is also interesting to look at two-bond coupling constants,
Typically there is a coupling between a proton and another proton, mediated by two bonds, attached, for example, to a common carbon.
We can look at the proton-proton coupling between two protons attached to the same carbon, provided that these protons are not equivalent, we can measure the coupling between them.
These couplings are critically dependent on the question of if the substituent X is an electron-donating or -withdrawing group.
In this case, the dependence is even more pronounced.
This is a coupling between two protons attached to the same carbon.
This being X, we are talking about this coupling.
These couplings are generally negative, and they are in the vicinity of -10 to -17 Hz.
Incidentally, you may not have heard of negative couplings before; very often, in the NMR literature, nobody mentions the signs of couplings, and what people actually report is the absolute value of the coupling.
Of course, if you do it that way, you cannot see the sign.
The fact is that it is rather tricky to determine the sign, and it takes a bit of understanding of NMR, and particularly of two-dimensional spectroscopy or of multiple-resonance in order to determine the sign.
But many signs have been measured, and they can certainly be calculated.
Some people have been looking for very exotic couplings, so that they have a chance to get an entry in the Guinness Book of records.
For example, we have a very long-range coupling between two protons separated by five bonds.
Because of the delocalized nature of the electrons, this is about 2.2 Hz.
All couplings in this chapter are given in units of Hz (Hertz).
We can even go to seven bonds, then it turns out that we have a negative coupling, rather strangely.
You may wonder how one can measure this, because these two protons are magnetically equivalent.
Indeed, there is no multiplet structure, but you can replace one of the portons by deuterium, so that you have a long-range J-coupling.
The coupling JHH is proportional to JHD, provided we multiply by the ratio Î³H/Î³D.
So, we measure H-D in an asymmetric molecule, and then apply this rule in order to draw a conclusion about the H-H coupling.
More straightforward are benzene groups.
Ortho couplings between neighbouring protons lie somewhere between 7 and 10 Hz, depending on the substituents.
Meta couplings are smaller, and para couplings are typically less than 1 Hz.
So, this is smaller, and this is almost negligible, although, of course, they can be detected.
Likewise, if we have molecules that are rigid
-this doesn't work if they are floppy- we can have long-range couplings, provided the arrangement of the bonds obeys a so-called W structure, that allows one to convey the information through the electrons.
There are some interesting properties of J-coupling constants that are worth knowing.
Some people have an encyclopeadic knowledge about these things.
First of all, one can distinguish between proton-proton couplings that are â€˜cisâ€™ or â€˜transâ€™, i.e., on the same or opposite sides of a double bond. â€˜Cisâ€™ coupling are in the vicinity of 10 Hz, and â€˜transâ€™ couplings near 15 to 19 Hz.
It depends on the question whether there is a substituent here in the third position.
Many chemists know these things by heart, and just from the knowledge of the coupling constant, they can tell you what the substituent X is.
There are other examples here.
This is a proton-proton coupling between vicinal protons.
They are limited to a smaller range, and also depend on the substituent X.
This kind of observation is very important in chemistry of cyclohexanes and their derivatives, in particular of sugars, because many sugar molecules are built of six-membered rings, with oxygen and hydroxyl groups, but the basic pattern is a six-membered ring.
It turns out that we can distinguish axial couplings between a proton up here and a proton down there, which have an axial-axial coupling.
The dihedral angle, if you look at a Newman diagram, is 180 degrees, the scalar coupling is quite large, in the vicinity of 12 Hz.
If we consider a coupling between this equatorial proton and this axial proton, there is a 60 degree dihedral angle, and the coupling drops to about 4 Hz.
Likewise, between the two equatorial protons there is also coupling, and again, the dihedral angle, although it's not obvious from this diagram, is only 60 degrees, and the coupling is 3.9 Hz.
So, there are important lessons to be gained from looking at three-bond coupling constants.
Of course, this hasn't escaped the attention of some theoreticians, and there is a famous relation that was invented many years ago by Martin Karplus.
He got a Nobel prize a few years ago, but that was hardly for this equation.
His equation explains a relationship-- it's actually a partly empirical, partly theoretical relationship-- of which Karplus himself said â€œif you use it, it's at your own risk.â€�
I won't give the equation here, but the point is that the J-coupling between two protons in vicinal positions depends on the dihedral angle.
This J-coupling is largest if the angle is 180 degrees-- that is to say, if one proton is sitting here and the other is sitting there.
These J-couplings are somewhat smaller, but not dramatically smaller if the angle is 0 degrees, that is to say, if the two protons are eclipsed, if the proton in the back is hidden behind the proton in front, so to speak.
These J-couplings drop to something like
2 Hz or so if the angle is 90 degrees, which it frequently is.
Such relationships can be calculated, using DFT and quantum chemistry, but they can also been observed in many molecules, provided that you can fix the angle.
You contrive the molecule with suitable substituents and rings in order to prevent it from rotating.
Karplus postulated a famous equation which bears his name, which says that a three-bond coupling is proportional to a constant A, plus a factor B times cos(Î¸), which is the dihedral angle, plus a factor C times the square of cos(Î¸).
You see that if  Î¸ = 90 degrees, then cos(Î¸) and its square both disappear, so the coupling becomes J = A.
In the limit where Î¸ = 180 degrees, one has cos(Î¸)= -1 and its square is +1, so the J = A-B+C.
If the angle
Î¸ = 0 degrees one has J = A+B+C.
The Karplus equation offer a nice way of catching the complexity.
We see similar things if we look at amino acids.
An amino acid can be represented by a Newman projection.
In front, we have what's known as the Î± carbon, which is attached both to the carboxyl group and to the ammonium group of the amino acid.
Behind the disk of Dr Newman is the Î² carbon.
Attached to this Î² carbon we find the "residue," the rest of the chain, plus a Î²2 and a Î²1 proton.
And on the Î± carbon, of course, we have the Î± proton, and so the question is: what is the coupling between these two, and what is the coupling between these two?
It turns out that, depending on the angle Î¸, which is the dihedral angle between these two planes, these couplings vary dramatically.
For example, in this configuration, we have about 60 degrees between the Î± and Î²1 protons, while we have 180 degrees between Î± and Î²2.
In this configuration, this is about 60 degrees and this is about 180 degrees.
The couplings will vary, depending on the angle Î¸.
We shall be observing the weighted average of the three couplings, and therefore we can draw conclusions as to the average value of this angle Î¸.
In fact, this is a rather modern subject.
We find similar things in polypeptide chains, that is to say, chains of amino acids, but in a slightly different disguise.
Here, we see there are couplings between the proton attached to the Î± carbon, and the proton attached to the nitrogen that is part of the amide bond.
The J coupling between the
H attached to nitrogen and H alpha, tells you about this dihedral angle, which in the language of peptide chemistry is known as the angle Ï†, the other ones being Ïˆ and Ï‡.
The knowledge of these couplings, which can be determined even in fairly large molecules, allows you to determine these angles, and if you know these angles from one peptide bond to the next, ultimately you can define the entire three-dimensional structure of the peptide, and that is a very flashy thing to do.
In chapter three of Peter Hore's book, there is also a brief discussion of dipolar couplings.
Dipolar couplings do not occur in liquids, but they occur in solids, and are very important as such.
They can be seen in solids in the form of splittings, but they also influence spectra in liquids, because they are essential to drive relaxation.
Relaxation, as we shall see, is a process through which the magnetization returns to its thermal equilibrium, and as such it's very important, both to be able to record NMR spectra, but also to determine certain molecular properties, such as internal motion, or rotational and translational diffusion coefficients.
Dipolar couplings are quite different from scalar couplings.
You see here a few doublets of a spin A that is coupled to a spin X in a solid, as a function of the orientation.
The reason for these splittings is that we have a spin-- let's call this spin A-- and then somewhere else in space there's another spin, call it spin X, and the direction and distance, are described by a vector.
This molecule will be placed in an external magnetic field, which we call B0, as usual.
If we extend this internuclear vector, we find an angle called Î¸.
The energy level diagram is affected by the dipole-dipole coupling.
This has nothing to do with the J-coupling, it has nothing to do with electrons, it is purely mediated through space.
So there is an angular dependence.
In fact, this equation is called a Legendre polynomial of rank two, sometimes just called P2.
A property is that it depends on the orientation of the vector with respect to the magnetic field.
In then example here, the spectrum is split into a large doublet, if Î¸ = 0, that is to say, if the vector is aligned with the magnetic field.
There comes a point where the splitting goes through zero, where the doublet collapses to a singlet.
That turns out to be the case when Î¸ is equal to about 54 degrees, which is the so-called "magic angle."
If that is the case, we only have a singlet, but the splitting reappears, and as we go to 90 degrees, that is to say, if the vector is perpendicular to the external field, we have a splitting with a magnitude is one-half the splitting that we have if the vector is parallel.
The authors call this splitting R, rather unusually, since most books call it D.
The splitting is proportional to the product of the gyromagnetic ratios of spin A and of spin X, and most importantly, it is inversely proportional to the third power of the distance between them.
R is simply the modulus or length of the vector.
And that distance r, of course, is interesting to chemists, because it allows them to determine the size of a molecule and the distance between two spins.
If we consider a powder, then there is no single orientation of the vector R.
Let me draw the field again, and remember that we have an internuclear vector like this, which subtends an angle Î¸.
In a powder, we have all sorts of particles, a bit like in sugar or in salt, that have different angles, and consequently, Î¸ is distributed over a range of angles.
We then observe a â€˜powder spectrumâ€™ an expression invented by George Pake in the '50s when it was first discovered.
The splitting RAX, which was shown in the previous figure, corresponds to the case where Î¸ is exactly equal to 90 degrees.
Such crystallites are fairly common, because it is likely that the vector is perpendicular to the external field.
But the largest splitting corresponds to Î¸ equal to 180 degrees, and the signals are weaker here, in amplitude, because the likelihood that they should be precisely parallel to the magnetic field is much smaller.
In fact, you can see that this Pake pattern is made up of two halves.
It's actually a superposition of two parts.
These are the two transitions of the doublets.
Now, let's recapitulate, together with Peter Hore, what is to be said about scalar and dipolar couplings.
First of all, J-couplings require bonds.
They are mediated by electrons.
If there are no bonds, there cannot be any J-couplings.
By contrast, dipolar couplings go directly through space, and therefore can be intermolecular.
J-couplings are weak, typically on the order of 100 Hz that is only an order of magnitude.
Dipolar couplings tend to be much larger.
This size depends on the Î³â€™s of the nuclei.
100 kHz is typical for protons.
J-couplings are â€˜isotropicâ€™.
That is what a â€™scalarâ€™ coupling means. â€˜Isotropicâ€™ means that their magnitude is independent of the orientation of the molecule with respect to the magnetic field.
Dipolar couplings vary with the orientation, according to the Legendre polynomial, where Î¸ is the angle subtended between the magnetic field, on the one hand, and the internuclear vector, on the other.
J-couplings tend to be small if there are more than three bonds that separate the nuclei, whereas dipolar couplings always are proportional to the inverse of the third power of the distance.
J-couplings cause splittings in spectra in solution.
They also can be seen in solids, but that is difficult because they are so small.
Dipolar couplings lead to large splittings in solids, and also in more exotic environments such as liquid crystals, i.e., partly aligned molecules.
J-couplings do not contribute significantly to relaxation, that is, to the return of the magnetization to its equilibrium, but dipolar couplings can cause relaxation; in fact, they can drive relaxation, particularly in the presence of motion, and they offer a way to determine such motions.
There are some further comments here.
The strength of the interactions depend on the magnetogyric ratios--
I like to call them gyromagneticâ€”- and on the molecular structure.
The numbers are very approximate, so this is just to guide the eye.
They can be more complicated if some chemical exchange is going on, and one has to worry about internal motions.
In summary, spin-spin interactions-- they can be either J-couplings in liquids, or dipolar couplings in solids-- give rise to multiplets.
In liquid-state spectra, there are only J-couplings, and in solid-state spectra there are mostly dipolar couplings.
J-couplings usually occur via chemical bonds, because they're mediated by electrons, and they are generally small when the nuclei are more than three bonds apart.
J-couplings give information on bonding networks in molecules.
Within a group of magnetically equivalent spins
J-couplings do not produce any multiplet splittings.
As soon as you have identified an ensemble of spins that are magnetically equivalent, there will be no evidence of any scalar couplings between these spins.
Strongly-coupled spins have more complex spectra than weakly-coupled spins.
Particularly, when we have a two-spin system, the inner lines tend to grow at the expense of the outer lines.
This is known as a "roof effect,"
In larger spin systems the multiplets can be very complicated.
Dipolar couplings occur through space, and normally do not lead to any multiplets in liquid-state NMR spectra, unless we happen to deal with liquid crystals that are partly aligned with respect to the magnetic field, but this is clearly a very exotic subject.
Thank you for your attention.
