Welcome to the third and last part of chapter 6.
Chapter 6 ends with a brief discussion of polarization transfer.
In fact, the name â€œINEPTâ€� means â€œInsensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transferâ€�.
This is typical of so-called acronyms; that is to say, short words that are made up of the initial letters of a long expression.
Acronyms have become very popular, a fashion that was started by my PhD advisor, Ray Freeman, and has since taken over the entire world of NMR which is full of acronyms that you may wish to remember; or some of them you may better forget.
The idea of â€œINEPTâ€� is applicable to heteronuclear systems with protons and carbon-13, or perhaps nitrogen-15, or some other nuclei.
And the idea is that the inherent sensitivity of protons is better than the inherent sensitivity of carbons because protons have a higher gyromagnetic ratio.
The basic idea is to apply a pulse sequence that starts by exciting proton magnetization, then refocusing it by forming an echo.
At the top of this echo, we apply a pair of pulses, which have the net effect of transferring the transverse magnetization from the protons to the carbons.
This leads to a gain in amplitude of the carbon-13 spectrum.
To understand why one should like to apply INEPT to a heteronuclear system, we first have to look at the populations in thermal equilibrium, determined by Boltzmannâ€™s Law.
The idea is that, according to Boltzmannâ€™s Law, a difference of populations is proportional to the difference in energy.
The carbon-13 transitions have a small splitting, consequently, if we have 6 balls here, meaning that the ground state is the most populated state, and only 5 balls here, thereâ€™s a difference whereas if we look this proton transition, we have a difference
Consequently, the difference in populations is four times larger across the proton transition than across the carbon-13 transition.
Likewise, we have +1 here, and -4 there.
This distribution represents a Boltzmann distribution.
It is immediately obvious that this distribution is unfavourable for carbon-13, but favourable for the proton transitions.
INEPT can reshuffle the populations in such a way that the two protons transitions will acquire opposite phases: one transition will have an amplitude +4 and the other an amplitude -4, whereas the carbon-13 transitions will be considerably amplified.
Instead of +1, we have -5, and instead of +1, we have a difference in population of +3.
This is achieved by swapping the populations.
For example, the two balls here end up there, and the single ball here ends up down there.
This can be achieved with this pulse sequence.
If we consider the doublet of the carbon-13 spectrum, we have a positive peak +3, and a negative signal -5.
If we add a normal carbon spectrum, we have 3 + 1 = +4, and -5 +1 = -4.
So this restores the symmetry.
This is neither symmetrical nor anti-symmetrical.
But this is now perfectly anti-symmetrical,
This can be achieved in practice by alternating the phase of this pulse.
The INEPT experiment can be explained in terms of semi-classical magnetization vectors by associating a magnetization vector with each single-quantum transition.
In other words, if we have a pair of energy levels, we consider it as a â€œfictitious spinâ€� 1/2 and we assume that we can associate a magnetization vector with each transition.
A more powerful approach uses density operators, more specifically, product operators that will not be discussed in this book, but that are the subject of the next volume in Peter Horeâ€™s series.
If we consider semi-classical vectors, we have in thermal equilibrium not one but two proton vectors corresponding to the two parallel transitions, that are both aligned with the magnetic field.
We start by applying a 90 degree pulse around the x-axis so that the two proton vectors are flipped along the -y-axis, as you would expect.
Then we wait for a delay tau.
This delay must be tau = 1/4J. where J is the scalar coupling constant between the carbon-13 and the proton.
These vectors will precess through different angles in the interval tau.
One of the vectors goes all the way to this position, it seems in a great hurry, and runs quite quickly.
The other vector only has gone through a small phase difference.
At that point, we can apply a 180-degree pulse to the protons.
The net effect of that is to â€œflip the pancakeâ€�, as Erwin Hahn would have said. 
The proton vector H-alpha, ends up in a symmetrical position with respect to the z-O-x-plane.
Likewise, the vector H-beta ends up in a position that is symmetrical to where it was before the pulse.
The next thing we have to do is apply a 180-degree pulse to the carbon-13 spins.
The net effect is simply to swap the labels of H-beta and H-alpha, i.e., H-alpha becomes H-beta.
If we did not do that, then an ordinary echo would form and there would be no effect of the scalar coupling.
But because we have applied a 180-degree pulse to carbon-13, the two vectors will continue to diverge, and the H-alpha vector will end up along the +axis, whereas the H-beta vector will end up along the -axis.
At that point, we have two vectors in opposite sign.
In terms of density operators. we sahll say that we have an antiphase term at point F.
In connection with the more sophisticated density operator theory, we can call this IxSz with a factor 2 as norm
This is Ix for the proton and Sz for the carbon-13.
At this point, weâ€™re going to apply a 90-degree pulse along y.
By rotating through 90 degrees around this axis, the net effect is that the H-alpha vector goes to the south pole, whereas the H-beta vector returns to the north pole, in fact to the same position where we started off.
So the overall effect is to invert the magnetization of the H-alpha transition, while leaving the magnetization of the H-beta transition the magnetization of the H-beta transition unaffected.
We can achieve the same effect for different chemical shifts.
So INEPT works for all doublets at the same time.
Now, this state can be described in terms of density operators as a term 2HzCz, or, if you prefer, as 2IzSz with Iz for protons and Sz for carbon-13.
This distribution of populations is called â€œlongitudinal two-spin order.â€�
We can consider the proton transitions or the carbon-13 transitions that correspond to this state.
We can apply another pulse, this time along the x-axis, to flip the C-beta magnetization along the -y-axis, and at the same time, flip the C-alpha magnetization along the +y-axis.
There are many interesting experiments that are known as â€œtwo-dimensional NMRâ€�, which we simply like to call â€œ2D NMRâ€�.
Two-dimensional spectra have two distinct frequency domains, omega-1 and omega-2.
It turns out that 2D spectra can be obtained by recording a signal in time domain with two distinct variables, t-1 and t-2.
We can apply a Fourier transformation to t-1 to generate omega-1 and to t-2 to generate omega-2.
We shall not go into any details.
In general, we have to decide on some preparation technique, in the simplest case, this might be a 90-degree pulse, like in INEPT.
Then we have periods in which there is usually no perturbation at all, where we allow the spins to evolve freely.
Then we need some sort of a mixing interval, which could be a simple 90-degree pulse, before we detect the signal.
The simplest realization is â€œCOSYâ€� or â€œCorrelation Spectroscopy.â€�
You may wonder what this is good for.
It turns out that a COSY spectrum of a 2-spin system looks like this.
The ordinary (single-quantum) 1D spectrum contains simply two doublets, one centred on the chemical shift of spin A, the other centred on the chemical shift of spin X, both split by 2*pi*J,in units of radians per second.
The resulting two-dimensional spectrum has a diagonal about which it is symmetrical.
There are multiplets that are known as â€œdiagonal multipletsâ€�.
We shall not look at them in great detail.
More importantly, there are â€œoff-diagonal multipletsâ€� that tell us that the multiplet centered on the chemical shift of spin X, is actually connected with the multiplet centered on the chemical shift of spin A.
The existence of this multiplet can be considered as a proof that J(A,X) is different from zero.
Whenever we see a multiplet, we can say, â€œThere must be a coupling.â€�
And that is very important for the assignment and for many applications.
Actually, in the spectrum that you see here, all multiplets are in-phase.
This cannot be achieved by such a simple technique, but by a more sophisticated technique known as â€œTotal Correlation Spectroscopyâ€� or TOCSY.
The basic idea of TOCSY is to insert a longer mixing period between t-1 and t-2, which allows one to get in-phase signals rather than anti-phase signals.
The two simplest two-dimensional NMR experiments are COSY, which really means, if we write it out, â€œCorrelation Spectroscopy.â€�
This is actually not a very good acronym because it uses the first and the second, and then the last letter.
But itâ€™s a nice word and was popularized by Kurt Wuethrich so that it is now widely accepted.
And the other experiment is â€œNuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopyâ€�,
(NOESY).
You can also write the last Y with a capital as in SpectroscopY.
These are two basic experiments that are most routinely used.
In the COSY experiment we simply apply a 90-degree pulse to excite transverse magnetization, which will then evolve under the effect of the chemical shifts and J-couplings.
We choose not to look at the magnetization, we do not store the free induction decay in the computer, we just ignore the signal.
We apply another 90-degree pulse which converts magnetization into transverse magnetization of connected transitions.
The NOESY experiment is built on different principles.
Here we have the same idea of a precession of transverse magnetization, but in this period, we have longitudinal magnetization of spin A.
In this period, because of the Overhauser effect, part of the magnetization will travel spontaneously from spin A to spin X, and as a result, the transverse magnetization will oscillate at the characteristic frequency of the chemical shift of spin X.
We have a multiplet centered on the frequency of spin X, whereas here we have a multiplet centered on the frequency of spin A.
The COSY experiment is normally used for homonuclear systems.
We can consider the familiar energy-level diagram of a two-spin system.
The magnetization that we initially excite would be associated with these two parallel allowed (single-quantum) transitions.
The 90-degree pulse leads to a conversion into transverse magnetization.
This conversion actually goes from here to here.
You can argue whether the process actually involves populations or not.
The basic effect can be described beautifully with more advanced methods.
In the NOESY experiment, there is a slightly different situation.
We have again a homonuclear case.
We have again transverse magnetization associated with the two parallel transitions.
The net effect is to convert these transverse magnetizations into populations, and then allow the NOE effect, that is to say the flip-flop of the two spins, to interchange the populations of the central energy levels.
From these central energy levels we can generate transverse magnetization of the connected transitions.
There are many applications of COSY, or â€œHomonuclear Correlation Spectroscopyâ€�.
We can apply COSY to proton spectra of molecules such as this.
This molecule was probably chosen because it has many nearly degenerate protons.
In fact, it is a bit like a sugar, since we always have carbons with one OH and one H attached.
Indeed, sugars represent a particular challenge because the chemical shifts are very close and itâ€™s not easy to identify coupled neighbours.
Sugar chemistry has greatly benefited from the invention of COSY.
We donâ€™t actually â€œseeâ€� the molecule, but from the two-dimensional spectrum we can determine using a diagram that represents the topology of the coupling network.
Thus proton d is coupled to proton f and to proton i. f is coupled to d and i. i is coupled to b. b is coupled to a, etc.
We can immediately determine this by looking at the spectrum.
For example, between the chemical shifts of a and bâ€” of the proton a and the proton b, we see a cross-peak.
This cross-peak reveals the fact that there is scalar coupling between a and b.
We can also look at proton h, and we see another cross-peak, that corresponds to this bar.
These represent J-couplings.
With the help of the COSY spectra one can determine the topology of the coupling network.
One can often draw immediate conclusions about the structure and the connectivity of the network of the protons in the molecule.
Homonuclear Correlation Spectroscopy is often applied to protons, but it can also be used for exotic nuclei, such as boron-11, which has a spin quantum number I = 3/2, and therefore has a quadrupole coupling, so that its transverse relaxation is very efficient, the lines become broad, and the multiplets are not easy to detect in one-dimensional boron spectra.
If we consider a half-open cage, we can easily record COSY spectra, and observe off-diagonal peaks that obviously connect boron in the 4-position with boron in the 3-position.
Corresponding to a J-coupling between positions 3 and 4.
The J-couplings are a degenerate.
The interpretation of the spectrum allows us to determine what the cage looks like.
Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy has become a very popular method.
But in fact, when it was invented, it was first applied to a problem that has nothing to do with Overhauser effects, but is concerned with chemical exchange.
In fact, in its early version,
NOESY was called EXSY, which stands for Exchange Spectroscopy.
This is a beautiful example of how exchange spectroscopy can be used to investigate rearrangement mechanisms.
This example shows how exchange spectroscopy can be used to explore rearrangement mechanisms.
This is heptamethylbenzenonium ion where there is one methyl group in excess, which doesnâ€™t quite know where to go, and therefore travels around the ring.
This methyl group hops from one position to the ortho position next door.
The protons that are attached to the methyl group that stays behind will move from this crowded environment into a different environment, which is in the ortho-position with respect to the new crowded environment.
The chemical shift of the methyl protons in position 1 are different from the chemical shifts of the methyl protons in position 2.
Indeed, in the spectrum we can identify the two chemical shifts of these methyl protons.
This is the crowded position, and this is the ortho-position, and the cross-peak is indicative of the fact that this group has indeed undergone a so-called 1,2-shift from one position to the other.
The pulse sequence that was originally invented to monitor exchange phenomena can also be applied to monitor Overhauser effects in homonuclear systems.
Recall that in a large molecule, the Overhauser effect comes primarily from the flip-flop transition probabilities that we called W0 between the up-down and down-up configurations of the spins.
This W0 flip-flop probability is proportional to the inverse of the sixth power of the distance between the two spins.
Consequently, if these spins are far apart, this sixth power is a very large number, and the flip-flop rate is vanishingly small.
Conversely, only when the distance is is smaller than 3 or 4 angstrom can we actually expect to see a significant flip-flop rate.
In a NOESY spectrum of a protein, which is composed of amino acids, where each amino acid might have up to ten protons or so.
So in a protein that comprises
100 amino acids, we would have about 1000 protons.
Along the diagonal, we would expect to see about 1000 distinct chemical shifts.
Not all of them are connected but if we consider a cross-peak, we can immediately come to the conclusion that it must lie at the the intersection of two chemical shifts, for example A and X.
The amplitude of such a cross-peak is directly proportional to the flip-flop rate W0 of the pair A and X.
Therefore, the amplitude of this cross-peak is actually proportional to the inverse of the sixth power of the distance between nuclei A and X.
Any one of these cross-peaks tells you that two nuclei must be close.
If we draw the molecule as a chain like this,
A and X must somehow be close in space. as can be seen in the 2D NOESY spectrum
There are hundreds or even thousands of cross-peaks, and therefore, we have thousands of â€œrestraintsâ€� that allow us to determine the 3D structure of the protein.
This is quite remarkable because the protein is in solution.
The solution is isotropic and homogeneous.
There is no need to have any crystals; thereâ€™s no need to go to a synchrotron to look at x-ray diffraction patterns.
We can do all this in solution.
HSQC is another barbarian expression that means â€œHeteronuclear Single
Quantum Correlation Spectroscopy.â€�
This allows one to correlate spectra of protons with a high gyromagnetic ratio with other nuclei, such as nitrogen-15 or carbon-13, that have lower gyromagnetic ratios.
The first part is identical to the INEPT sequence.
If you return to INEPT, you will see what that means.
Then we have a free evolution of the nitrogen-15 magnetization until we apply another pulse.
In fact, if we insert one more pulse, we have exactly the same sequence.
This can be considered as â€œretro-INEPTâ€�.
If we summarize what happened during INEPT, we were converting transverse magnetization from the protons to the nitrogen-15.
Here we convert magnetization from the nitrogen-15 back to the protons.
This pulse which Iâ€™ve added for the sake of symmetry, could be in a symmetrical position.
So this would be a 90x pulse.
Immediately after that, we have a 90-x pulse.
The result of the two pulses vanishes.
This is simple trick in order to show the symmetry between INEPT and retro-INEPT.
The important result of HSQC is that we get a map where we can correlate the chemical shifts of the protons on the one hand, and the chemical shifts of the nitrogen-15 nuclei on the other hand.
There are many peaks in this map.
Each peak corresponds to polarization being transferred from an amide proton in a protein.
This shows the beginning of a protein, which goes on and on.
We see a correlation between the chemical shifts of the amide proton and the amide nitrogen.
Of course there are as many peaks as we have amino acids.
One way of counting the number of amino acids is simply counting the number peaks in the spectrum.
The pattern is very sensitive to the environment, and therefore we call this a â€œfingerprintâ€� of the protein.
The implication is that two different proteins will necessarily have different fingerprints, and therefore can be recognized.
HSQC spectra can be used for drug screening.
If we take a protein and we mix it with a ligands that have some affinity for the protein, then weâ€™ll have protein-ligand complexes.
The affinity can be described by a dissociation constant, which is simply the product of the concentrations of the free protein and of the free ligand, divided by the concentration of the complex.
And one of the issues in drug research is to find a ligand that has a very small dissociation constant, maybe as small as a few nanomoles/liter.
In this kind of research we can do a titration where we observe the HSQC spectrum of the protein and titrate the ligands.
If we gradually increase the concentration of the ligand, some peaks will move in 2D space, and we can map the displacement.
If there is no ligand, we have the chemical shift of the protein.
When the ligand comes in, we have a change in chemical shift.
In the absence of ligands, we have the pure protein.
When itâ€™s saturated with ligand, we have only the complex, and, in-between, we have a sigmoid curve.
You can imagine, like with a pH titration, that the infection point informs us of the stability of the complex.
In other words, very stable protein-ligand complexes would behave like this.
And very fragile ones would behave like that.
The job of pharmaceutical industry could be summed up by saying that you should move from a bad ligand to a good ligand, from a non-specific to a specific, from a weakly-binding to a strongly-binding ligand.
There are many experiments that are built on the principle of combining two distinct two-dimensional experiments in order to obtain a three-dimensional experiment.
All of them start with a two-dimensional experiment that is achieves a useful purpose, and that has a preparation, an evolution, a mixing and a detection period.
And then you take another experiment, which has its own preparation, evolution, mixing, and detection periods.
You can simply remove the detection period of the first experiment, and remove the preparation period of the second experiment, and stitch them together.
As a result, you get a sequence where you have a preparation, a first evolution, a first mixing, a second evolution, and a second mixing period, and then you detect the signal at the end.
In a typical example, you could begin with an HSQC that would correlate protons and nitrogen-15, so that we go back to protons.
Then we can carry out a NOESY sequence and that would correlate protons with other protons.
This would be a 3D HSQC/NOESY experiment.
There are many possible combinations, and they can be used for all sorts of purposes.
One important idea is to assign spectra of proteins, which is a particular challenge.
This is just one application.
There are many other applications.
In proteins, for example, if we like to assign the signals, we could go from the amide proton to the amide nitrogen.
Then we could do a transfer to the alpha-carbon, and we could go to the beta-carbon in the side chain.
And we could do a transfer, and another transfer, and come back, and come back again, to end up here.
So there are six consecutive transfers.
This would actually allow us to correlate the proton of the amide group with the beta-carbon in the side chain.
These are typical experiments that are currently being developed in order to assign and interpret spectra of carbon-13, protons, and nitrogen-15 in large molecular assemblies.
So letâ€™s try to summarize the main features of chapter 6, dedicated to experimental methods.
First of all, the vector model turns out to provide a simple picture of many elementary NMR experiments.
The vector model can be used to describe the effects of radio-frequency pulses, of periods of free precession, and above all, of spin relaxation; that is to say, of the return of the magnetization vector to its equilibrium position.
The rotating frame offers a simplified view of the vector model.
NMR spectra can be obtained by applying a Fourier transformation to the free induction decays so that they are transformed from time-domain into frequency-domain.
Spin-spin relaxation, or transverse relaxation, corresponds to a loss of phase-coherence.
T1 and T2 can be measured using inversion-recovery or spin-echo sequences.
It is possible to enhance the sensitivity of spins with low gyromagnetic ratios, such as carbon-13 or nitrogen-15, by polarization transfer techniques such as INEPT from spins with higher gyromagnetic ratios, such as protons.
Two-dimensional spectra can be obtained by measuring signals as a function of two time variables, and transforming them by a double Fourier transformation into two frequency variables.
The two-dimensional COSY and NOESY experiments reveal correlations between homonuclear pairs of spins.
COSY allows one to identify scalar or J-couplings, whereas NOESY allows one to map out dipolar couplings that cause Overhauser effects.
HSQC, which means Heteronuclear Single
Quantum Correlation Spectroscopy, can be used to reveal correlations between carbon-13 or nitrogen-15 on the one hand, and protons on the other.
Two-dimensional NMR experiments can be combined to produce three-dimensional
NMR experiments.
