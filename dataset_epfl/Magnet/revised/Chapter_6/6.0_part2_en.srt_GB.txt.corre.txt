Welcome back to part two of this chapter.
One of the challenges of NMR is that we observe a â€œfree induction decayâ€�, and that the human eye is not well equipped to perceive the frequencies that are contained in such a signal.
And, therefore, one needs a transformation from the time domain signal into a frequency domain signal. 
We immediately recognize, in this case, a quartet.
The transformation from the free induction decay to the spectrum is known as a â€œFourier transformationâ€�.
Let me try to explain how this works.
First of all, we have a signal.
S(t=0) is the initial amplitude-- in this case, we'll consider a real signal-- times cos(Î©T).
The raw signal that comes from the spectrometer looks like a cosine wave.
The first step of the Fourier transform consists in multiplying S(t) with an artificial cosine wave with an argument omega_test x t.
This is the product of the initial function times the test function.
If these two frequencies, the actual resonance frequency and the test frequency, are different, then we have a beat pattern.
In this case, the frequencies are different.
But if they are equal, then the net effect is that we have a square of a cosine function.
So when the frequencies are equal we see that we have a square of a cosine function.
In this case, if we integrate over all of values, we get zero or something that will converge to zero, whereas if we integrate over a positive function, the result will be non-zero.
We have a resonance when the frequencies are equal.
The idea is to take the raw function and vary the test frequency systematically.
The test frequency could be stepped in increments where n would be the number of steps, with n = 0, 1, 2, â€¦,  (N - 1).
At each value of n, we carry out the integration again.
When the frequencies are different, we obtain zero, and there is no effect, except maybe for some noise.
But suddenly we hit a condition where the frequencies are equal, so that we have a peak with an amplitude A.
If the test frequency goes beyond the resonance frequency the integral becomes zero again.
This, in a nutshell, is what the Fourier transform is all about.
We can define the spectrum in frequency domain as an integral of the product of the two functions integrated from zero to infinity.
This is a simple way of looking at Fourier transformations.
You can do this simultaneously for the cosine and the sine components, in which case you need a complex Fourier transform.
This is indeed what modern spectrometers use.
Once the Fourier transformation is understood, you can use it to analyze signals.
This nice beat pattern corresponds to a binomial quadruplet.
This more complicated pattern corresponds to some arbitrary distribution of chemical shifts.
It would be very hard to recognize by eyeball what frequencies are contained in the time domain signal.
That is why the Fourier transformation is essential to make the information readable for humans.
Fourier transformations make it very simple to do â€œsignal averagingâ€�, although signal averaging really has nothing to do with Fourier transforms.
Let me first explain what this is all about.
It turns out that if we record the same quadruplet four times, then the signal will be essentially the same from one scan to the next, but the noise will be different.
The noise is stochastic.
If we add up the four, the signal will be four times as intense as in the individual components, whereas the noise will increase in proportion to the square root of the number of signals that we have added together.
If we take four different noise traces, since âˆš4 = 2, the noise only increases by a factor two.
In Fourier transform NMR we use this all the time because we apply a pulse to observe a free induction decay, and then apply another pulse, to get a new free induction decay, sometimes hundreds or even thousands of times.
This allows us to benefit from this advantage.
You can do the same in the old days of continuous-wave NMR, and you can do it in virtually any form of spectroscopy, and this is well-known to people who observe signals that are very weak, such as is done routinely in astrophysics.
There are a number of important experiments.
First of all, there are experiments that have been designed for the measurement of T1, that is the longitudinal or spin-lattice relaxation time.
This experiment is known as â€œinversion recoveryâ€�.
In inversion recovery, we apply a 180 Â° pulse to the magnetization so that it turns upside-down.
And then we wait for a variable delay, which can be varied from milliseconds to seconds, whatever the case may be, before we apply another 90Â° pulse and observe the signal.
Note that after the 180Â° pulse, there are no transverse components so there is no precessing magnetization.
Depending on the duration of the interval the longitudinal magnetization may still be upside-down.
It may be almost zero.
It may already have become positive, or it may have completely recovered to its equilibrium position.
Whatever the case may be, the subsequent 90Â° pulse will rotate in this magnetization from its position along the -z-axis towards the +y-axis, or, if it has already recovered, from the +z-axis to the -y-axis.
And consequently, the signals will be negative up to the zero-point crossing, and then become positive.
As we know from the chapter on relaxation, this will converge to an asymptotic value, which is the equilibrium magnetization.
The curve is simply given by the exponential.
The deviation follows an exponential law
Mind you, this experiment also works if the initial inversion is not perfect.
It could be that the negative component is a bit smaller than the positive component, and therefore we would perhaps not start at -1, and we would have a slightly different decay.
We can still measure the deviation accurately.
We have to introduce a variable parameter in such cases, which are quite commonly encountered.
Inversion recovery is a very rewarding experiment because it's easy to do and it gives you immediate insight into the relaxation rates of different sites.
For different protons in dinitrobenzene you can immediately see that some of them recover very quickly.
The H5 proton is squeezed between the H4 and H6 protons, and therefore benefits from rather strong dipole-dipole couplings.
As a result, the H5 proton recovers rapidly.
The zero passage already occurs after a few seconds.
H4 and H6 are less lucky.
Both of them have just one dipole-coupled partner and, consequently, the zero passage is somewhat delayed and the recovery is slower.
Finally, H2 is isolated out there.
It has no immediate proton neighbour, and consequently its zero passage is even further delayed.
These pictures can be interpreted as follows: one of them goes very rapidly, another one goes slower, and the third one goes very slowly, as a function of the recovery delay.
This is the equilibrium magnetization.
You can always extract relaxation times T1 from these recovery curves.
If we are concerned with the measurement of T2, that is, of â€œtransverseâ€� relaxation times,
(also known as â€œspin-spinâ€� relaxation times), then we have to know about spin echoes.
Spin echoes were invented in the '50s by Erwin Hahn, initially by accident.
This is known as a â€œserendipitousâ€� invention.
Instead of inversion recovery which requires a 180 pulse first and then a 90 pulse, now we start with a 90 pulse in order to generate transverse magnetization, and we then apply a 180 pulse.
Remember that the signal has decayed partly because of its true homogeneous transverse relaxation time T2, but partly also because there is a distribution of resonance frequencies due to the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field.
It turns out that the inhomogeneous decay, can be reversed, and this reversal leads to an increasing signal, to the formation of an echo, followed by the decay of the signal due to the inhomogeneous distribution.
So how does this work?
We start with the magnetization in its equilibrant position.
We then rotate this through 90Â° about the x-axis so that it ends up along the -y-axis.
Then, depending on where we are in the sample, some vectors may rotate slowly, others a bit faster, and others are in a great hurry and will be far ahead because they are experiencing a larger field.
Then we apply a 180Â° pulse around the +y-axis.
As Erwin Hahn would have said, this amounts to â€œflipping the pancakeâ€�.
So the entire picture is simply reversed, by a plane of symmetry.
So the vectors end up behind, but they continue to rotate at their specific angular velocities, and continue to rotate counter-clockwise.
The path described in the refocusing period is exactly the same as the path in the defocusing period.
In the refocusing period, a factor with a longer path, also had a longer path in the defocusing period,
The longest path corresponds to the largest excursion.
When the refocusing period is precisely matched with the duration of the defocusing period, then all three vectors end up along the same axis.
That means that the interference between these vectors is constructive which that means that the signal will be intense.
We can extract T2 by comparing the signal at the time of the echo with the signal at the beginning of the experiment.
And we notice that this decays as a function of the overall time between excitation and echo divided by T2.
To understand how the echo forms, it may be convenient to draw a diagram of the phase as a function of time of the three components.
Let's start with component A.
In the defocusing period, it starts with a phase zero and builds up a phase.
Because of the refocusing pulse, the phase suddenly changes sign from +phi to -phi, which corresponds to the reversal of the sine to the opposite position.
During the refocusing period, it will converge and come back to a vanishing phase.
So this would be for A.
This slope is nothing else that the frequency of A.
We can do the same thing for a component B, which, as we have seen, precesses faster and therefore builds up a larger phase difference.
This will also be reflected into a symmetrical position and then continue its precession in the refocusing period, and precisely catch up with A at the time of the echo.
And component C is even more dramatic.
C will diverge more rapidly, refocus here, and all three components should end up with the same phase at the time of the echo.
This concludes part two of this chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
