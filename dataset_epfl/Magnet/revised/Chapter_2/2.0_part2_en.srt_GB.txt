Welcome back to part two of this chapter.
Chemical shifts are often considered as empirical quantities that escape any attempt to explain them.
But of course, that's not true.
People, and chemists in particular, physicists as well, would like to give an explanation.
And there are in fact a wide variety of explanations.
Some of them are conflicting.
Sometimes they make sense, sometimes they donâ€™t.
One has to be very careful to pick one's way among this minefield of explanations.
But let me give you some of the elements, so you can judge yourself how sound this science is.
Here we have
Pauling's electronegativity.
We all know there is a series from iodine to bromine to chlorine to fluorine, where the electronegativity increases; that is, to say, the electron withdrawing ability.
And it turns out that if we take methyl halides,
CH3X, where X is one of the above, it turns out that the chemical shift of the protons of the methyl group follows a particular trend, which is roughly linear with Paulingâ€™s definition of electronegativity.
So you might say, the stronger the withdrawal, the larger the chemical shift of the protons of the methyl group that are neighbors of the halide. So far, so good.
This makes sense. I wouldn't use it as a way of determining the electronegativity.
But you could, if you wished.
Now, it turns out that the electronegativity has an effect beyond the neighboring methyl group.
In fact, if we take a chlorine at the end of a long chain-- one of the halides at the end of a butane molecule.
You can see that the protons on the neighboring methylene group are shifted all the way to the left but the second methylene group is affected much less.
The third one is hardly affected at all, and the methyl group is so far away that it has essentially the same chemical shift as the methyl group in a simple butane molecule.
So, this tells you something about the range of this electronegative electron-withdrawing effect.
There is an important aspect of attempts to rationalize chemical shifts. Sometimes they go hand in hand with the chemistâ€™s perception of how the molecule really looks like.
And when I say "the chemistâ€™s perception"
I mean so-called
"resonance structuresâ€�.
Take this simple aromatic molecule.
We know that the NO2 group is an electron withdrawing group.
And the organic chemist rationalizes this by saying that some small fraction of this molecule is not in fact as it is drawn here but that the double bond migrates so that the single bond becomes therefore a double bond, and, concomitantly, there is a positive charge that appears here on the neighboring carbon atom.
You can consider one more step, you can cause this double bond to migrate here and then the positive charge appears in para-position with respect to the NO2-group.
Such drawings are known as â€˜resonance structuresâ€™ and they are very familiar to organic chemists because they allow one to rationalize reactivity, where do certain substituents go, and questions like that.
And in fact, these pictures have been developed hand-in-hand with the observation of the proton chemical shifts.
You see an example here.
Nitrobenzene is represented by these three â€˜resonance structuresâ€™.
Actually there are three different chemical shifts.
There's one that is strongly de-shielded with respect to benzene, in the ortho-position. You can imagine that because the electrons are being withdrawn there is a lack of density of the electron cloud and therefore the proton is less shielded. Likewise, in the para-position, there is a similar effect, although it's much less pronounced.
It's a bit paradoxical because in the resonance structures there's really no need to say that the ortho position is dominant with respect to the para position but you see that, at least empirically, it turns out that the effect is most pronounced for the ortho position and much less for the para position.
Meanwhile, according to this argument the proton in the meta position, this one here, should not be affected at all.
In actual fact, it is also shifted with respect to benzene but that must be due to a different effect than the resonance effect.
The beauty of this argument is that you see the exact opposite in aniline.
In aniline we have an electron donating group: we have a loan pair on the nitrogen.  This loan pair can move, and then this double bond will move into a new position so that we have an excess charge here.
In a second step, we can shift the charge over here so that we now have an excess charge in the para position.
Consequently, we expect the ortho position to be shielded because there are more electrons than there were before.
The electrons are de-localized and therefore the shift moves towards lower frequencies,
The para position would be somewhat less shielded, and the meta position should not be shielded at all.
Nevertheless, it is somewhat shielded.
You notice that the effect is not exactly symmetrical.
For example, the para position is very close to the ortho position
That is not the case on the left side.
Thus these arguments are essentially qualitative, and you should not give them the status of a serious theory.
These rules are more to guide the intuition.
But chemistry is often about intuition, so there's nothing wrong with that kind of thinking.
Here we have an example of carbon-13.
The chemical shifts of para-carbons in substituted benzenes.
With reference to these molecules, we're talking now about carbon-13, not about protons. This carbon is in the para position with respect to the substituent.
If we vary the substituents.
We can insert an NH2 group, which yields an amine, or, we can insert an NO2 group.
There are all sorts of groups in between, and we can use this chemical shift scale here as a measure of the ability of the substituents to donate electrons to the phenyl ring, or to withdraw them from the aromatic ring.
This is a very nice way of classifying the electronegativity of these groups, and to predict their reactivity which, of course, is essential in chemistry.
There is a more exotic example here.
In fact this was published many years ago by Ray Freeman, who was my PhD advisor, and by Rex Richards, who was Rayâ€™s PhD advisor, so, in a way,
Rex is my intellectual grandfather, if I dare say so. I vividly recommend that you look up this publication in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
It's quite a few years ago, but, nevertheless, of great current interest.
These people knew that cobalt complexes, for example with nitrile as a ligand, or with ethylene diamine, or with ammonium, and many other ligands.
These complexes have different colours, different optical transitions.
And these optical transitions are due to the crystal field splitting between the so-called t2g orbitals and the eg orbitals in the cobalt complex which always have a hexagonal environment.
The authors measured cobalt-58 chemical shifts.
This is not at all common.
Clearly a heroic attempt to discover a new correlation,
Indeed they found a wonderful correlation, between the chemical shift of cobalt-58 and the wavelength of the optical transition.
Somewhere in the range of
UV and visible light.
Then they said, "Aha, this must be a contribution to the chemical shift," which they attributed to what is now known as a paramagnetic contribution to the shift.
They noticed that it's inversely proportional to the parameter delta, which is simply the splitting, i.e., the transition frequency of the optical transition, and they also considered that it should be relevant to include an average over r3 where r is basically the radius of the electron cloud that is responsible for the chemical shift.
Now this is a really a beautiful observation, very interesting, very stimulating, but unfortunately, there are not many molecules that behave in such a clear way, not many examples of this effect.
In the meantime, people have been trying to split nuclear shielding into different contributions.
The effect that I spoke about at the very beginning of chapter two, the effect that we find in helium-3 and in xenon-129 which, by the way, is also known as the Lamb shift, is more properly known as a diamagnetic shielding.
If the shielding is diamagnetic, the magnetic field that is induced by the circulation of the electrons, is anti-parallel to the external field.
But we also have situations where the shielding is paramagnetic.
In that case the local field is actually parallel to the external field and therefore adds up to the external field.
Next, there are effects which are due to remote groups, or remote currents, or currents in remote groups, and of course, other sources.
It's nice to make a list of these, but it's very difficult in practice to split observed chemical shifts into separate contributions.
Remember that the magnitudes of induced diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents can be related to local electron densities, and to electronic excitation energies.
This idea is clearly inspired by the work of Ray Freeman and Rex Richards on cobalt-58 but is not necessarily of universal validity.
Some of the most important contributions to chemical shifts are so-called ring-current effects, which are specific to aromatic compounds.
In this scheme this ring represents a benzene ring or, in fact, any aromatic ring.
You see that the field induced by the electrons that circulate in this ring is opposite to the external field, and if we could have a proton right in the center of the benzene ring, it would be shielded because it experiences a field that is smaller than the external field.
But in fact, protons in benzene rings are on the outside of the ring, and therefore, they experience a local induced field which adds onto the external field.
And the result is that the protons appear de-shielded.
Now, one way of measuring this effect is by comparing benzene, where the chemical shift is about 7.3 ppm with respect to TMS, with a molecule where one of the three double bonds has been reduced by addition of a hydrogen molecule, and consequently there is no possibility for these electrons to run around a circle, they cannot sustain a ring current, and therefore not induce a magnetic dipole that is opposite to the external dipole.
Well, you see immediately that the chemical shift of this proton goes from 7.3 to 5.9, so it has become shielded, or less de-shielded, if you prefer.
There is a more spectacular example here.
This molecule is a rather contrived example of chemistry, it was made in the days when people were trying to find compounds featuring extremes of the most de-shielded and the most shielded nuclei.
The most important feature is that this methyl group lies just above the aromatic ring.
This methyl group is just above the ring.
And it turns out that it is actually more shielded than TMS, so it has a negative chemical shift, if you wish, â€œto the rightâ€� of TMS in a proton spectrum plotted on the usual scale.
At the same time, all aromatic protons, lie in this range, that is to say they are very far â€œto the leftâ€� of the spectrum, or strongly de-shielded.
A clean illustration of this effect comes from annulene which undergoes a slow inter-conversion of the internal and external protons, but the basic feature is that because the protons are on the inside of the ring where the current is circulating, they have a negative value on the delta scale of the chemical shifts which means that they are â€œon the right hand sideâ€� of TMS, whereas the other protons are just like in benzene, so that they are de-shielded and therefore â€œon the leftâ€� of the spectrum
You notice that the shift goes from 7.3 to 8.5 and 9.28, so the effect is more and more pronounced.
Now there are also interesting things that happen if we have triple bonds and other exotic groups though triple bonds are not exotic at all.
In this case we have to worry about something else, and that is about the orientation of the triple bond with respect to the external field.
And this allows us to introduce a property of chemical shifts which is very important in solid-state NMR: the chemical shifts depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field.
And it turns out, somewhat against my intuition, that if the triple bond is perpendicular to the external field, there are strong currents within the conjugated pi electron system, and the net effect is a paramagnetic shift due to a strong dipole which is parallel to the external field.
These arrows represent the magnetic flux, which will affect, for example, the acetylenic protons.
We have a situation which is opposite to what happens in benzene.
But the complexity is compounded by the fact that if the triple bond is parallel to the field, then it turns out that the electrons circulate less freely, and therefore the induced paramagnetic dipole is weaker.
If the dipoles were equal in both orientations and if one assumes isotropic tumbling of the molecules so that they can adopt all possible orientations in space, there would be no net effect.
But there is an imbalance.
Here the induced dipole is stronger, and therefore, there is no averaging when the molecule tumbles through all possible orientations.
This has curious effects.
For example, if we consider the series beginning with ethane CH3CH3, it is not very far from methane. on the â€œright hand sideâ€�, close to 1 ppm.
If we now introduce a double bond, we jump a long way.
If we introduce a triple bond, you might think that we should jump even further.
But that's not true in fact, we go back one step, so to speak.
This is because of the anisotropy of the electron motions within the triple bond.
These effects can be represented in terms of shielding and de-shielding.
We can distinguish cases where the paramagnetic dipole is larger for the parallel position than for the perpendicular position, in which case we have a distribution of fields like shown here.
In the opposite case, we have opposite signs.
Notice the drawings of cones.
These cones are schematic representations of tensors and they look a bit like orbitals.
The angle subtended by these cones we shall refer to as the â€œmagic angleâ€�, which is about
54 degrees, and we shall see that if we orient molecules in a solid along a suitable angle we get a simplified spectrum. This is also the basis of â€œmagic angle spinningâ€�.
There are some implications for â€œneighbouring groupsâ€�.
We have discussed acetylene, and spoken about the acetylenic protons.
More spectacular effects occur in molecules such as this.
In phenantrene this aromatic proton resonates at about 8 ppm but this other proton is squeezed close to the triple bond, which has a massive affect of nearly 2 ppm, further de-shielded because of the anisotropy of the neighbouring group.
This shows how a neighbouring group can affect a chemical shift.
This does not occur if the triple bond were absent.
This de-shielding due to magnetic anisotropy.
There are a few things which are perhaps more important for a chemist.
There is the case of de-shielding due to hydrogen bonding.
Hydrogen bonding, of course, is essential in chemistry and biology.
Remember that if we consider double-stranded DNA, the two strands are held together by very weak interactions called hydrogen bonds.
It is only because there are so many of them that the two strands hold tightly together.
The characterization of hydrogen bonds is actually quite important in chemistry.
Here we see two examples.
This proton is â€œsharing its attentionâ€� between two oxygens, though it may not be symmetrically distributed.
There is a proper bond to one oxygen and a weaker bond to the other oxygen.
The electron cloud is very weak around the hydrogen, which is therefore strongly de-shielded, and its chemical shift is about 11 ppm.
This simple example shows a hydrogen that really doesn't know where it wants to go, the whole molecule can be redrawn, and the double bonds can hop around, and the net effect is that the hydrogen is almost bare.
There are almost no electrons to shield it, and therefore it turns out very much de-shielded because there are no electrons to shield it.
And that is characteristic of hydrogen bonds.
As I said, we find similar things in DNA, deoxyribonucleic acids, and also in RNAs which are very popular today to study in biomolecular NMR.
There is another picture that is very instructive.
Peter Hore did a tremendous job in selecting good examples, and this is the case of ethanol.
Ethanol can be written like this, and next to it, we can draw another ethanol molecule, with a similar structure, but drawn head-to-tail.
This is known as an ethanol dimer.
And it turns out that the dimer holds together because of these two hydrogen bonds.
Because of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, the electron density around the hydrogens is very weak.
In effect, the chemical shift of the hydrogen atoms lies very much â€œto the leftâ€�.
Since they are strongly de-shielded.
So much for pure ethanol.
If we consider a solution of ethanol in an aprotic solvent such as CCl4 then the OH protons appear near 5 ppm.
As we dilute the ethanol to 0.1 mole per liter and beyond, we see that the OH protons move â€œto the rightâ€�.
This is because, as we dilute, we break up the dimer so that it falls apart into monomers.
And because the aprotic solvent is unable to make any hydrogen bonds with either of these monomers, the hydrogens have an environment that is less depleted of electrons and therefore the hydrogen is more shielded, and moves toward lower ppm values, lower chemical shifts.
You will notice that these spectra are not experimental.
In fact there is no reference to any source in Horeâ€™s book.
And the reason is that it's not so easy to observe this hydrogen because the hydrogen will also be involved in chemical exchange,
The very least that can happen is that its peak would be very broad,
And sometimes it appears at a chemical shift that depends on the entire structure.
But it's an interesting principle, and the demonstration is very nicely done.
Let me show you one of the last examples, concerned with unpaired electrons.
There are lots of systems in organic chemistry where we have unpaired electrons.
In organic chemistry we call them radicals in metals we don't call them radicals.
Simply, they have electrons that are not all combined in pairs in orbitals.
Iron is a good example of a metal that often has unpaired electrons.
Zinc, on the other hand, has an even number of electrons that are nicely paired up.
What you see here are proton NMR spectra of complexes where the four nitrogens hold the metal ion in the middle.
This metal can be either zinc or iron.
We observe the chemical shifts of the protons 
Hx and Hy.
As you go around the ring you will see there are only two chemical shifts so there are two Hx, two Hy, etc., but that is not important here.
The important part is that if we have zinc in the center, then the complex is not paramagnetic.
There are no free electrons, and we have a simple case where all aromatic protons resonate somewhere between 8 and 9 ppm, which is fine, there is nothing abnormal.
But, if we replace zinc by iron, we see tremendous changes.
The protons are dramatically shielded, shifted towards the right hand side of the scale.
Furthermore, the protons Hx and Hy are no longer similar.
The near-degeneracy that we have in the zinc case is now lifted.
This is due the coupling between the free electrons and the protons.
A long-range coupling which is known as â€œhyperfine couplingâ€� that leads to a shift because the distribution of the electron polarization between alpha and beta states is not 50/50 but it's displaced towards the lowest energy state, following Boltzmannâ€™s law.
The rapid transitions between electrons in the alpha and beta states give rise to an average chemical shift, to an average position of the proton lines which depend on the environment.
To conclude this second chapter of Peter Horeâ€™s book, let's look at the summary that the author has put together at the end of the chapter.
First of all, we notice that nuclei such as protons are embedded in molecules, and that they may have slightly different NMR frequencies depending on their environment, an effect that is known as the chemical shift.
Such effects occur not only for protons, but also for carbon-13, nitrogen-15 phosphorus-31, and depending on the sort of system that we're looking at silicon-29, and many other nuclei in the periodic table.
Chemical shifts arise from induced electronic currents which can either shield or de-shield the nuclei from the applied magnetic field.
The chemical shift parameter delta is used to quantify the extent of nuclear shielding or de-shielding with respect to a conventional reference, often tetramethylsilane (TMS) for protons and carbon-13
For other nuclei one has different standards.
The magnitudes of induced diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents can be related to local electron densities and to electronic excitation energies.
Chemical shifts can often be understood by considering the effects of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups, by looking at the effects of induced currents in neighbouring groups such as triple bonds and aromatic rings, by looking at charged or polar groups, at the role of hydrogen bonds, and of unpaired electrons which have hyperfine couplings to the nuclei that we are looking at.
Chemical shifts distinguish nuclei in different environments in molecules and therefore give information both on the identity and on the structure of the molecules.
