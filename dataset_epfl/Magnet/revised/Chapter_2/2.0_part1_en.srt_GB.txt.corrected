100:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,659Welcome to the second chapter of our MOOC,200:00:08,868 --> 00:00:13,248Massively Online Open Course,on basic steps in magnetic resonance.300:00:13,998 --> 00:00:17,258Today’s chapter will be concerned withchemical shifts.400:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,999Chemical shifts are indeedat the heart of magnetic resonance.500:00:23,157 --> 00:00:25,987More specifically, they are essential600:00:26,108 --> 00:00:28,548for most applicationsof magnetic resonance700:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,838to chemistry and biology.800:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,222In physics, they are perhapsless important,900:00:33,222 --> 00:00:34,762although that can be argued.1000:00:35,464 --> 00:00:38,534In fact, the origin of this effect1100:00:38,543 --> 00:00:42,673is what is known in goodEnglish as “serendipity”1200:00:42,864 --> 00:00:45,204and in bad English, sheer luck.1300:00:45,205 --> 00:00:47,425It was, in fact, discovered by mistake1400:00:47,898 --> 00:00:50,618and against the wishes of the inventors,1500:00:51,233 --> 00:00:53,333Proctor and Wu,1600:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,413who in the late 40s or early 50s,1700:00:56,123 --> 00:01:01,253wanted to measure thegyromagnetic ratio of nitrogen.1800:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,273More specifically, of nitrogen-14,1900:01:03,273 --> 00:01:05,683which is the predominant isotope of nitrogen,2000:01:06,234 --> 00:01:10,514To do so, they decided to takea material that would be full of nitrogen2100:01:11,043 --> 00:01:14,033and they turnedto ammonium nitrate2200:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,185which indeed has lots of nitrogen.2300:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,263And to their distaste, they found,2400:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,618once they'd identifiedthe nitrogen resonances,2500:01:22,684 --> 00:01:25,774that there weretwo peaks and not one.2600:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,657Now we know that one of thesenitrogen peaks2700:01:28,657 --> 00:01:30,667came from the ammonium groupand the other one2800:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,068from the nitrate group.2900:01:32,068 --> 00:01:33,758But they didn't want that.3000:01:33,758 --> 00:01:35,028They wanted just one peak3100:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,868since they wanted to measure the Gamma--3200:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,711the gyromagnetic ratio.3300:01:38,711 --> 00:01:41,651The frequency of precession,the transition frequency3400:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,371unaffected by the environment.3500:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,032To them, the environmentwas just a nuisance.3600:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,742So nitrate and ammonium,that was not their business.3700:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,302They were not chemists.3800:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,682But they wrote a paper.3900:01:52,682 --> 00:01:55,772They submitted a paperwhere they called this effect4000:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,802a “dirt effect.”4100:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,279The editor wrote, "Dirt effect is nota very scholarly expression.”4200:02:03,283 --> 00:02:05,933Would you please proposeanother expression?"4300:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,863And they said, "Well, let's call ita chemical shift."4400:02:08,863 --> 00:02:11,483And it has beena chemical shift ever since.4500:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,427By the way, when I tell youanecdotes like this,4600:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,589I'm not too sure that they are genuine,4700:02:18,589 --> 00:02:20,039that they can be trusted.4800:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,979Maybe the story was just made upby somebody else.4900:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,599But, you know, “Se non è vero, è ben trovato.”5000:02:26,618 --> 00:02:29,228"If it isn't true, at leastit's a nice story."5100:02:29,228 --> 00:02:33,068You can find many of such storiesin the books of Abragam,5200:02:33,463 --> 00:02:37,463of Casimir, and of many other scientistswho have enjoyed themselves5300:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,763writing up their autobiographies5400:02:40,025 --> 00:02:43,875and talked about thefun aspects of research.5500:02:44,129 --> 00:02:49,199We shall now discuss the secondchapter of the book by Peter Hore,5600:02:50,179 --> 00:02:52,769which is dedicated to chemical shifts.5700:02:53,313 --> 00:02:58,163Chemical shifts can be discussedin a purely empirical fashion,5800:02:58,568 --> 00:03:01,108i.e., a phenomenon that can be observed5900:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,902without necessarily trying to explain it.6000:03:04,229 --> 00:03:08,389This, in fact, is a very importantapproach in chemistry and in biology.6100:03:08,389 --> 00:03:11,919Of course, scientistslike to explain things.6200:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,759And so they have thought aboutthe origin of chemical shifts6300:03:15,164 --> 00:03:18,114and they have tried to splitthe chemical shifts6400:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,834into different contributions.6500:03:19,834 --> 00:03:22,604These are known as contributionsto nuclear shielding.6600:03:22,604 --> 00:03:26,234In fact, nuclear shieldingis another word for chemical shifts.6700:03:26,395 --> 00:03:29,865We’ll have a summaryand then some exercises.6800:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,846Perhaps the simplest explanationof nuclear shielding6900:03:33,846 --> 00:03:39,386and chemical shifts is forthe example 7000:03:39,732 --> 00:03:44,692of noble gases which aremono-atomic molecules7100:03:44,886 --> 00:03:46,356such as helium.7200:03:46,356 --> 00:03:49,126In fact, the isotope 3 of helium7300:03:49,438 --> 00:03:54,178happens to have a spin <i>I = ½</i>.7400:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,307This is lucky, of course.7500:03:56,455 --> 00:04:00,455It can be hyper-polarizedas we shall discuss later.7600:04:00,612 --> 00:04:05,262It can actually be used to makeimages of human lungs.7700:04:05,543 --> 00:04:09,543Likewise, we could also consider Xenon-1297800:04:09,615 --> 00:04:13,975which also has a spin ½ and also is used7900:04:13,975 --> 00:04:18,565for imaging of lungs of living humans.8000:04:19,244 --> 00:04:23,894Now, both have a spherical symmetryand both have a nucleus8100:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,185at the center of a cloud of electrons.8200:04:26,185 --> 00:04:29,325Of course, these electronsmove all over the place,8300:04:29,325 --> 00:04:34,005but there is a slight preferencefor them to move in a plane8400:04:34,005 --> 00:04:37,945which is perpendicular tothe external magnetic field.8500:04:38,132 --> 00:04:42,042So the field <i>B0</i>,is the external magnetic field8600:04:42,454 --> 00:04:47,734which is applied to the sampleby the experimentalist8700:04:47,734 --> 00:04:51,734usually generated by a largesuperconducting magnet8800:04:51,742 --> 00:04:54,192to achieve a sufficiently intense field.8900:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,680It turns out thatthis external magnetic field9000:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680affects the electrons in such a waythat there will be a slight preference9100:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,470for the electrons to move aroundon a trajectory9200:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,580which is perpendicular to the field. The electrons9300:05:09,594 --> 00:05:13,254move in such a way, thatthe field that they induce,9400:05:13,254 --> 00:05:15,124which is called B’,9500:05:15,207 --> 00:05:19,557the induced field,9600:05:20,065 --> 00:05:23,895the field induced bythe circulating electrons.9700:05:23,895 --> 00:05:28,085According to the law of Lenz,this induced field9800:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,135has a sign opposite to the external field.9900:05:31,454 --> 00:05:36,854The net effect is that the local field,10000:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,010at the site of the nucleus,10100:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,329is proportional to the external field,10200:05:42,553 --> 00:05:49,023but there is an attenuation factorwhich can be written as <i>1 – σ</i>.10300:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,270If sigma is zero,10400:05:55,713 --> 00:05:59,443then the local field is equal tothe external field10500:05:59,443 --> 00:06:00,893and there is no attenuation.10600:06:00,893 --> 00:06:04,434But in many molecules,the sigma has different values10700:06:04,434 --> 00:06:06,284depending on the environment,10800:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,554the chemical environment of the nucleus.10900:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,567The same thing can be expressednot in terms of fields11000:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,777but in terms of NMR frequencies.11100:06:15,777 --> 00:06:19,077The precession frequencyof the transversed magnetization11200:06:19,537 --> 00:06:22,407is equal to the energyof the transition between11300:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,457the bottom state and the excited state.11400:06:24,457 --> 00:06:28,197And this is proportionalto the gyromagnetic ratio,11500:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,330proportional to the external field,attenuated by the circulating electrons.11600:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,988This attenuation is againexpressed as <i>1 – σ</i>.11700:06:38,706 --> 00:06:43,256We can look at the same thingin terms of energy levels11800:06:43,409 --> 00:06:47,339where we see that the bare nucleushas a transition frequency11900:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,849which is determined only bythe applied magnetic field.12000:06:52,301 --> 00:06:56,301But as soon as the nucleussits in an electron cloud,12100:06:56,301 --> 00:06:58,971it is partly protectedfrom the external field.12200:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,310And therefore we havea shielding parameter,12300:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,580the nuclear shielding expressed bythe attenuation factor12400:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,690which stems fromthe circulating electrons.12500:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,236And as you can see, the splittingbetween the bottom12600:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,736and the top levels is reducedbecause of that.12700:07:16,886 --> 00:07:21,936Now, chemical shifts, as I mentionedin my introductory remarks,12800:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,804can be observed in many cases.12900:07:24,804 --> 00:07:30,034The case that I mentioned wasnitrogen-14 in an ammonium group13000:07:31,014 --> 00:07:34,714and nitrogen-14 in a nitrate group.13100:07:35,334 --> 00:07:39,334And as I said, the physicistswho used this material13200:07:39,334 --> 00:07:43,024were very disappointed to discoverthat these two nitrogens13300:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,144had different chemical shifts,as we now call them,13400:07:46,144 --> 00:07:47,624or different environments.13500:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,594But for the chemists,that was wonderful13600:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,174because that allowed themto distinguish the environments.13700:07:52,364 --> 00:07:56,944This is a typical NMR spectrumand you can imagine13800:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,352that this is site B and this is site A.13900:07:59,506 --> 00:08:02,786It could be any moleculethat has two distinct14000:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,226resonance frequencies.14100:08:04,226 --> 00:08:10,606In fact a more commoncase would be for proton NMR.14200:08:10,663 --> 00:08:15,503Proton NMR is by far the most popular form of magnetic resonance14300:08:15,503 --> 00:08:19,283today, and particularly in organic chemistry.14400:08:19,443 --> 00:08:22,183In proton NMRwe have a range of roughly14500:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,633eight to ten ppm.14600:08:23,851 --> 00:08:28,641This is the range of chemical shiftsexpressed in the parameter delta.14700:08:29,636 --> 00:08:34,296If we have some protonsin different environments,14800:08:34,392 --> 00:08:38,622in different solvents,for example this is benzene--14900:08:38,853 --> 00:08:42,143and these are different environments.15000:08:42,607 --> 00:08:47,817Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is by definitionused so that the origin15100:08:49,068 --> 00:08:54,318of the scale is adjusted to be zeroat the frequency of TMS.15200:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,529The delta scaleis defined more properly here.15300:08:58,808 --> 00:09:02,678It is simply the frequencyof the transition15400:09:02,967 --> 00:09:05,567minus a reference frequency.15500:09:05,567 --> 00:09:08,227So this for example isthe frequency of benzene15600:09:08,468 --> 00:09:13,258minus the frequency of TMS,divided by the frequency of TMS.15700:09:13,675 --> 00:09:17,675So typically this might be a bit above 400 MHz, minus 15800:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,505a bit below 400 MHz.15900:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,848The ratio, of course,16000:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,148is dimensionless.16100:09:25,148 --> 00:09:30,098It turns out that this dimensionlessnumber tends to be rather small,16200:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,599on the order of 10^-6.16300:09:32,689 --> 00:09:35,509And, therefore, it is usuallyby convention16400:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,219multiplied by 10^6in order to get reasonable numbers.16500:09:39,348 --> 00:09:42,078And this gives youthe definition of delta,16600:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,578known as the chemical shift to chemists.16700:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,568And as you can see,it is a dimensionless number.16800:09:48,708 --> 00:09:53,668It is usually expressed in ppm.16900:09:54,038 --> 00:09:56,908I should warn you thatin much of the physics literature,17000:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,962the convention is not the same.17100:09:58,962 --> 00:10:01,872They often use the parameter sigma,17200:10:01,872 --> 00:10:03,552the nuclear shielding parameter17300:10:03,552 --> 00:10:07,202and not the parameter deltadefined in this expression.17400:10:08,598 --> 00:10:11,798What is true forthe precession frequencies17500:10:11,798 --> 00:10:14,228is also true for theshielding parameters.17600:10:14,228 --> 00:10:17,098And you can reformulate this equation17700:10:17,098 --> 00:10:21,098by saying that it isthe sigma of the reference17800:10:21,133 --> 00:10:23,913minus the sigma of thesubstance of interest.17900:10:23,913 --> 00:10:27,773And you will notice that thisruns in the opposite direction.18000:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,048The delta scale runs in the opposite direction18100:10:30,394 --> 00:10:34,134as the scale of the shieldingparameters sigma. This gave rise18200:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,524to a great deal of confusionbetween the literature of the chemists18300:10:37,524 --> 00:10:39,494and the literature of the physicists.18400:10:39,988 --> 00:10:45,028Chemical shifts are very oftenconsidered as empirical parameters18500:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,565without any attempt to explain them.18600:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,335As such, they are very well known.18700:10:50,335 --> 00:10:53,755Particularly to chemists and morespecifically to organic chemists18800:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,315who have a tremendous ability,the good ones anyway,18900:10:56,315 --> 00:10:59,725to recognize a molecule whenlooking 19000:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,335at its proton NMR spectrum.19100:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,429This is not such an easy task.19200:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,139You can see that the scale heregoes from 0 to 10.19300:11:07,188 --> 00:11:10,768For example, we find that protons19400:11:10,768 --> 00:11:13,418attached to aromatic molecules19500:11:13,592 --> 00:11:15,412span a considerable range.19600:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,310Benzene is somewherenear 7.25 ppm19700:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,610but depending on the environment,19800:11:21,877 --> 00:11:24,567the shifts can cover quite a range.19900:11:24,567 --> 00:11:29,637It is even worse forhydroxyl aromatics.20000:11:29,637 --> 00:11:33,147Different moleculeshave different ranges.20100:11:33,617 --> 00:11:35,397We note amusing things.20200:11:35,909 --> 00:11:39,909For example, that an acetylene proton,20300:11:39,909 --> 00:11:45,259as we shall discuss later,appears towards lower chemical shifts20400:11:45,393 --> 00:11:48,943than an olefinic proton,which is surprising.20500:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,160This is due to a very peculiareffect sometimes called20600:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,910the neighboring group effectthat we shall try to explain later on.20700:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,729This table is important20800:11:59,729 --> 00:12:03,319because many organic chemistshave it, as it were,20900:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,399engraved in their brains, and21000:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,349remember this table all the time.21100:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,827And you’re very familiar with21200:12:10,827 --> 00:12:14,827this kind of empirical material,21300:12:14,838 --> 00:12:18,358it allows you to recognizethe fingerprint of your molecule21400:12:18,358 --> 00:12:20,198and determine exactly what it is.21500:12:20,558 --> 00:12:22,218Now there are other things.21600:12:22,218 --> 00:12:24,488For example, the amplitudesof the signals,21700:12:24,857 --> 00:12:26,817more properly called the integrals,21800:12:27,188 --> 00:12:31,328are proportional to the numbersof nuclei within the molecule.21900:12:31,429 --> 00:12:33,279Some examples are shown here.22000:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,909This is trimethylbenzene.22100:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,599These protons are directly22200:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,789attached to the aromatic ring,22300:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,720There are 3 of them,22400:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,940and there are a total of 3 x 3 = 9methyl protons.22500:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,880So the ratio of the methyl protonsto the aromatic protons22600:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,400is three to one:22700:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,8909/3 = 3/1.22800:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,976In the NMR spectrum,we see a weak peak here,22900:13:03,231 --> 00:13:06,961close to 7 ppm, and a muchmore intense peak,23000:13:06,961 --> 00:13:10,001that is 3 times more intense,just above 2 ppm.23100:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,733And the fact that they havethese amplitude ratios23200:13:12,756 --> 00:13:15,946confirms what I just told you,that there are indeed23300:13:15,946 --> 00:13:17,5463 aromatic protons.23400:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,976These 3 here are directlyattached to the ring,23500:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,593and the 9 methyl protons.23600:13:23,749 --> 00:13:29,299So rememberthat we go from 9/3 23700:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,723equals 3/123800:13:31,723 --> 00:13:33,013What you observe is 3/1,23900:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,143and what the chemistwould like to know is 9/3.24000:13:35,298 --> 00:13:40,006And it takes a bit of chemicalintuition to go24100:13:40,006 --> 00:13:42,586from  3/1 to 9/3.24200:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,506We have another example here.24300:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,866This is a tetramethylbenzene.24400:13:48,308 --> 00:13:50,868There areonly 2 aromatic protons24500:13:50,897 --> 00:13:55,907and there are a totalof 4 x 3 = 12 methyl protons.24600:13:55,907 --> 00:14:01,949So that’s a ratio of 12 divided by 224700:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,900So 12 methyl protonsand 2 aromatic protons,24800:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,830and of course, the ratio is 12/2 = 6/1.24900:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,330And you can see that indeedwe have the amplitude25000:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,560of the aromatic peak is 1/6of the aliphatic peak.25100:14:17,305 --> 00:14:21,305So this kind of reasoningcan be extended to many,25200:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,635many molecules.25300:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,455In fact, these examples area bit oversimplified.25400:14:25,455 --> 00:14:26,805They have been chosen25500:14:26,805 --> 00:14:27,985carefully without cheating.25600:14:27,985 --> 00:14:30,275They are genuine examples,but they have been chosen25700:14:30,275 --> 00:14:31,875because these particular molecules25800:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,185do not feature any scalar couplings.25900:14:34,185 --> 00:14:36,465They do not have anymultiplets and therefore,26000:14:36,465 --> 00:14:39,955we can argue purelyon the grounds of chemical shifts.26100:14:40,236 --> 00:14:43,986If we have a more general molecule,such as a protein,26200:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,180then we havemany different chemical shifts,26300:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,660many environments.26400:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,830This particular protein was popular26500:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,850in Oxford in the days of writing the book.26600:14:55,071 --> 00:14:58,831It contains 129 amino acids,26700:14:58,831 --> 00:15:02,391which is a fairly small proteinby biological standards.26800:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,081But a large protein fromthe point of view of chemists.26900:15:06,081 --> 00:15:11,071For NMR spectroscopiststhis represents a challenge.27000:15:11,257 --> 00:15:16,747129 amino acids means roughly,since there are about 10 protons27100:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,347for each amino acid,27200:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,101(some have more, some have less)27300:15:20,107 --> 00:15:22,437roughly that meansabout 1,000 protons.274Indeed we have about1,000 chemical shifts.27500:15:25,267 --> 00:15:29,267Some of them pile up so thatyou get a rather messy profile.27600:15:29,267 --> 00:15:32,567That means that many peaks are addedon top of each other.27700:15:32,606 --> 00:15:35,546Others are quite nicely isolated.27800:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,146This is the sum ofa few degenerate methyl groups.27900:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,486And this looks like a ratherisolated proton attached28000:15:42,486 --> 00:15:46,056to an amide nitrogen.28100:15:46,228 --> 00:15:48,818Typically, we can write it like this.28200:15:48,818 --> 00:15:51,148And this could probablybe written like this.28300:15:51,148 --> 00:15:53,728These are examples of assignments,28400:15:53,728 --> 00:15:59,098That is to say, relationshipsbetween peaks and atoms28500:15:59,098 --> 00:16:03,628which are one of the great challengesof protein NMR spectroscopy.28600:16:04,034 --> 00:16:06,864But a great deal of progresshas been made in this field,28700:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,460particularly by combining proton NMRwith carbon-13 NMR28800:16:11,476 --> 00:16:16,136and with nitrogen-15 NMR,by enriching the proteins28900:16:16,286 --> 00:16:21,596with these stable isotopes and thenrecording so-called two-dimensional29000:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,108correlation spectra thatallow one to assign--29100:16:25,108 --> 00:16:28,808each and every one of these peakscan be assigned and identified.29200:16:29,146 --> 00:16:33,476The next rather exotic exampleis very far from biology,29300:16:33,476 --> 00:16:35,036far from proteins.29400:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,850There is a substance.29500:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,570This is actually a metal cluster,29600:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,460which contains four cobalt atomsand a bunch of carbon monoxides.29700:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,680And the question is, what is the structureof this strange cluster?29800:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,370You could imagine something like this.29900:16:53,411 --> 00:16:56,871We have four metal atomsforming a regular tetrahedron30000:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,139each of the four metal atomsis surrounded by a local little cloud30100:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,567of three carbon monoxides.30200:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,597The whole thing would have a symmetry30300:17:05,597 --> 00:17:08,167corresponding to the point groupof a tetrahedron.30400:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,929If that were the case,then there should be30500:17:12,048 --> 00:17:14,488all sorts of symmetry elements,30600:17:14,488 --> 00:17:17,198planes of reflection, rotation,all sorts of elements.30700:17:17,344 --> 00:17:21,064A conclusion of the analysisof the symmetry of this molecule30800:17:21,102 --> 00:17:26,452is that there should be only one peakfor all oxygen atoms.30900:17:26,742 --> 00:17:29,892And also only onepeak for all carbon atoms31000:17:29,899 --> 00:17:32,199and one peak for all four metals,31100:17:32,199 --> 00:17:35,529if they happen to have a spin,like cobalt for example.31200:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,454Now it turns out that if we look atthe oxygen-17 spectrum,31300:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,801that there are not 1 but 4 peaks.31400:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,999So we can safely say this is no good.31500:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,539This can be ruled out becausethe particularly simple symmetry31600:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,169is incompatible with the factthat there are four lines31700:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,759in the oxygen-17 spectrum.31800:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,559By the way, oxygen-17 isa rather unusual nucleus.31900:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,039It has a large quadrupole couplingand the lines are rather broad32000:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,419because of rapid transverse relaxation.32100:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,419These are not your favorite molecule,nor your favorite isotope32200:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,209in the periodic table,but they offer a very nice illustration.32300:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,120Now you can speculate about other symmetries.32400:18:15,065 --> 00:18:17,415This has a symmetry of D2D.32500:18:17,887 --> 00:18:22,697It has some so-called bridgingcarbonyls.32600:18:22,956 --> 00:18:25,776And it also has so-calledterminal carbonyls,32700:18:25,776 --> 00:18:28,036which have different environments.32800:18:28,087 --> 00:18:30,937And from the structureyou conclude that32900:18:30,937 --> 00:18:33,657there should be 2different peaks.33000:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,257So this can also be ruled out.33100:18:36,496 --> 00:18:39,536Now when you look at thisstructure, it turns out33200:18:39,713 --> 00:18:42,563that we again have bridging carbonyls.33300:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,243There are 3 of those.33400:18:44,371 --> 00:18:49,061And then you have some whichare in an apical position.33500:18:49,061 --> 00:18:54,901They point away from the metaland are isolated.33600:18:54,901 --> 00:19:00,811Whereas, in this case,we have 3 carbonyls33700:19:00,888 --> 00:19:03,568attached to the same metal.33800:19:04,298 --> 00:19:07,908In this case, we have 2 carbonylsattached to the same methyl.33900:19:08,584 --> 00:19:10,834I’m not sure how to draw this.34000:19:10,834 --> 00:19:12,804I should have changed the colors actually.34100:19:13,793 --> 00:19:18,823Now, this molecule, therefore,is compatible with34200:19:18,834 --> 00:19:23,044an oxygen-17 spectrum that has 4distinct resonances.34300:19:23,054 --> 00:19:25,474It’s not easy to say which of these lines34400:19:25,474 --> 00:19:26,984belongs to which environment.34500:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,414That’s a difficult questionand it’s not the purpose34600:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,964of today’s lecture.34700:19:31,324 --> 00:19:36,704This interesting case of fullerenes,34800:19:37,810 --> 00:19:43,820sometimes calledbuckminsterfullerenes, 34900:19:43,827 --> 00:19:46,437or C60 is perhaps the most common expression.35000:19:46,694 --> 00:19:50,454We know that this isa icosahedral molecule35100:19:50,454 --> 00:19:56,554where the carbons are arrangedon the pattern of a football.35200:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,060There are some surfacesthat have a hexagonal environment35300:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,724and others a pentagonal environment.35400:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,284Now what is remarkable about this molecule35500:20:06,602 --> 00:20:10,602is that is has an extremelysimple carbon-13 spectrum.35600:20:10,744 --> 00:20:14,304In fact, you can convince yourselfthat it has a very high symmetry,35700:20:14,319 --> 00:20:17,069an icosahedral symmetry,and that therefore,35800:20:17,069 --> 00:20:19,269the chemical shifts of all 6035900:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,499carbon atoms should be the same.36000:20:21,499 --> 00:20:24,209And indeed the spectrumshows just a single line.36100:20:24,209 --> 00:20:27,919So the mere fact that there is a single lineis a confirmation36200:20:28,265 --> 00:20:33,925that the symmetry of the moleculemust indeed be very simple.36300:20:34,445 --> 00:20:36,295Now this was not obvious at all.36400:20:36,295 --> 00:20:37,985When this material was discovered36500:20:37,985 --> 00:20:41,255by Harry Kroto and his co-workers,36600:20:41,255 --> 00:20:45,945this was stillan uncertain matter36700:20:45,949 --> 00:20:50,149and it was not at all clearthat carbon atoms could be arranged36800:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,469in such a structure,such a strange molecule.36900:20:53,603 --> 00:20:56,243In fact, this molecule went unnoticed37000:20:56,243 --> 00:20:58,943for about two centuriesof modern chemistry,37100:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,999and therefore, it’s quite remarkable37200:21:00,999 --> 00:21:03,619that it was found so late in history.37300:21:03,747 --> 00:21:07,347Kroto, by the way, got a Nobel prize,probably mostly for this.37400:21:07,347 --> 00:21:10,787And if you are interestedin the origin of such things,37500:21:10,792 --> 00:21:14,962I vividly recommend thatyou read this in <i>ChemComm</i>.37600:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,774You can look it up following instructions37700:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,654that I will give later.37800:21:20,879 --> 00:21:23,209So let’s take another example,37900:21:23,209 --> 00:21:27,469which I think is very well chosenby Peter Hore from the vast literature38000:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,559that describes such effects.38100:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,139And this example uses phosphorus-31.38200:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,459That’s a very popular nucleusbecause it is very abundant.38300:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,830In fact, this isotope is 100 % abundant.38400:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,329It’s not radioactive, of course,38500:21:42,329 --> 00:21:45,999stable and it is found almosteverywhere in biology.38600:21:46,477 --> 00:21:49,007But it is also foundin inorganic chemistry.38700:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,391The example studiedby Raymond Andrew,38800:21:52,391 --> 00:21:56,611who is a very famous English NMRspectroscopist and physicist,38900:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,290in a paper that I vividly recommendyou should read,39000:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,189Andrew and his team studiedthis very simple molecule.39100:22:07,382 --> 00:22:09,952So this is phosphorus pentachloride.39200:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,462If you consider it in solution,39300:22:12,462 --> 00:22:17,192it is a bi-pyramidal affair, like this.39400:22:17,778 --> 00:22:19,708The phosphorus, of course,is in the middle39500:22:19,825 --> 00:22:23,825and the five chlorine atoms sitat the corners of this polygon.39600:22:23,902 --> 00:22:26,722It turns out that there isa high degree of symmetry,39700:22:26,743 --> 00:22:30,273and that the phosphorus sits in the middle39800:22:30,273 --> 00:22:32,283and is quite happy to be there.39900:22:32,283 --> 00:22:34,223It has only one chemical shift.40000:22:34,671 --> 00:22:38,901But if you precipitate this materialand make a solid out of it,40100:22:39,063 --> 00:22:41,883then the molecule actuallydisproportionates40200:22:42,202 --> 00:22:46,622and gives you an anionic speciesand a cationic species,40300:22:46,622 --> 00:22:50,382so PCl4- and PCl6+.40400:22:51,085 --> 00:22:53,375The phosphorus-31 nuclei have different chemical shifts.40500:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,145In fact, it turns out that this one40600:22:55,145 --> 00:22:57,245is shielded and thisone is de-shielded.40700:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,825And this is then plottedon a ppm scale 40800:23:00,825 --> 00:23:03,045for phosphorus-31.40900:23:03,738 --> 00:23:06,578Actually, to recorda phosphorus-31 spectrum41000:23:06,578 --> 00:23:09,208in a solid is not such a simple affair41100:23:09,753 --> 00:23:13,093because as we shall see later,the phosphorus41200:23:13,478 --> 00:23:16,108has an anisotropic chemical shift,41300:23:16,134 --> 00:23:19,674and therefore, in a solid, ittends to give very broad lines.41400:23:19,973 --> 00:23:22,833And in order to get rid ofthis line-broadening,41500:23:22,833 --> 00:23:26,633Andrew invented a wonderful experimentwhich is known as magic angle41600:23:26,633 --> 00:23:30,553spinning. This allows youto retrieve very narrow lines41700:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,620from spectra of solids thatotherwise would be broadened.41800:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,635This is a very clever techniqueand Andrew deserves41900:23:37,635 --> 00:23:39,195much credit for that.42000:23:39,195 --> 00:23:41,975This was one of the firstapplications of that technique.42100:23:41,975 --> 00:23:46,585Now there are also applicationsof silicon-29 NMR.42200:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,971This applications isof some industrial interest42300:23:52,391 --> 00:23:55,541because of aluminosilicates,42400:23:55,881 --> 00:24:01,971that is to say, porous solidsthat are built of aluminate units,42500:24:02,429 --> 00:24:07,669AlO4 and silicate units, SiO4.42600:24:08,441 --> 00:24:11,641This notation means thatthe aluminium atom is surrounded42700:24:11,641 --> 00:24:16,631by four oxygen atoms, roughlyin a tetrahedral environment42800:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,381and the silicon atom likewise.42900:24:18,607 --> 00:24:22,977But together these make upa vast array of substances43000:24:22,977 --> 00:24:25,050called aluminosilicates.43100:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,620Some of which are found in nature.43200:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,330Some of which are only made synthetically.43300:24:29,348 --> 00:24:31,838And many of whichhave interesting properties43400:24:31,838 --> 00:24:36,458as heterogeneous catalystsbecause they have pores43500:24:36,458 --> 00:24:40,568and molecules can enter into these poresand their chemical reactions43600:24:40,568 --> 00:24:44,051can occur on the innersurfaces of these pores.43700:24:44,230 --> 00:24:47,310The characterizationof aluminosilicates43800:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,960is not an easy matterbecause as you can see43900:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,070in the periodic table,aluminium and silicon44000:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,110are very close togetherand they have roughly44100:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,720the same electron density around them.44200:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,330So that makes it hard to distinguishthem with x-ray diffraction.44300:25:02,598 --> 00:25:05,568But of course, in NMR, aluminium-27,44400:25:05,568 --> 00:25:08,808which by the way has a quadrupolar coupling,is completely different44500:25:09,195 --> 00:25:11,005from silicon-29.44600:25:11,064 --> 00:25:14,084You see here a range of silicon-2944700:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,744spectra of different zeolites.44800:25:16,744 --> 00:25:20,894Zeolites are an important classof aluminosilicates with different44900:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,710ratios of silicon to aluminium.45000:25:24,349 --> 00:25:26,709So in the bottom case,we have mostly silicon45100:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,129and very little aluminium.45200:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,466In the top case, they are about equal.45300:25:30,609 --> 00:25:34,339We see a distribution of45400:25:34,347 --> 00:25:37,337chemical shifts of silicon-2945500:25:38,076 --> 00:25:42,076If there is no aluminiumin the neighborhood,45600:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,809then we have this line here.45700:25:44,809 --> 00:25:48,029If there is one aluminiumnext door, we have this line.45800:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,449If there are two aluminium atomsnearby, then we have this line.45900:25:51,492 --> 00:25:55,732If there are three, then we havea line further to the left.46000:25:55,858 --> 00:25:58,108There’s actually one moreover here, which is very weak.46100:25:58,451 --> 00:26:02,451The more aluminium atoms,that is to say, the lower46200:26:02,451 --> 00:26:04,621the ratio of silicon to aluminium--46300:26:04,621 --> 00:26:07,091the higher we move up in this figure.46400:26:07,091 --> 00:26:12,201The distribution showslines that correspond to silicon atoms46500:26:12,201 --> 00:26:19,191environed by n alumimium atoms.46600:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,141Now, it’s interesting to look atthese distributions.46700:26:23,141 --> 00:26:27,661The relative amplitudesgive a very refined,46800:26:27,662 --> 00:26:32,162a very subtle, very informative wayof characterizing these46900:26:32,183 --> 00:26:35,963zeolites or aluminosilicatesthat are so important47000:26:36,199 --> 00:26:40,369for heterogeneous catalysesand frequently used47100:26:40,369 --> 00:26:46,425in the petroleum industryfor cracking heavy crude oil47200:26:46,425 --> 00:26:50,695to make convenient petrolor gas as the Americans say.47300:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,830You can find more about this in this paper47400:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,320by Jacek Klinowski, Colin Fyfe and others.47500:26:58,050 --> 00:27:03,460We tried [but where not allowed] to providea key to such papers in our supplement.47600:27:04,174 --> 00:27:07,824Now, here is a morebiological application47700:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,059but it’s not just biological.47800:27:10,059 --> 00:27:12,739It’s really of universal importance.47900:27:13,669 --> 00:27:18,559It was first described by Ian Campbelland Raymond Dwek.48000:27:19,241 --> 00:27:23,241Ian Campbell, incidentally,was teaching in Oxford48100:27:23,269 --> 00:27:26,549and was the co-examiner of my PhD.48200:27:26,939 --> 00:27:30,199I wouldn’t say I’ve known himvery well, but he was a charming person48300:27:30,199 --> 00:27:32,159who unfortunately died a few years ago.48400:27:32,721 --> 00:27:36,721Raymond Dwek, as far as I’m aware,is still active in Oxford.48500:27:37,025 --> 00:27:39,775Now this discovery was very important48600:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,635as an illustration.48700:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,619They were looking at histidine.48800:27:44,743 --> 00:27:46,923Histidine comes in two forms.48900:27:47,403 --> 00:27:51,553It can be protonated,in which case it’s called HisH+.49000:27:51,553 --> 00:27:54,893meaning that there is a proton49100:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,309attached to this nitrogen.49200:27:56,309 --> 00:27:58,339In fact, the molecule looks49300:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,979nearly symmetrical when it is protonated.49400:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,769But of course, the proton can drop off,in which case it goes into the solution,49500:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,769and the nitrogen is then naked,so to speak, with a lone pair49600:28:08,874 --> 00:28:10,514of electrons sticking out.49700:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,630But this in itself is not somethingwe wish to observe.49800:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,630What we shall observe isthe chemical shift of the proton49900:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,955which is attached tothe neighboring carbon.50000:28:20,955 --> 00:28:23,375The chemical shift50100:28:23,859 --> 00:28:26,809of the proton attached tothe neighboring carbon,50200:28:26,809 --> 00:28:31,349the chemical shiftof this so-called C2 proton,50300:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,330or H2 proton, which is the oneattached to the C2 carbon,50400:28:38,743 --> 00:28:42,273is very sensitive to the questionif the molecule is protonated or not.50500:28:43,379 --> 00:28:49,419Here are spectraof histidine in its natural environment50600:28:49,497 --> 00:28:52,357which is actually in haemoglobin,50700:28:52,357 --> 00:28:56,437which is the protein that carries oxygen50800:28:56,437 --> 00:28:59,287in our blood and delivers this oxygen50900:28:59,287 --> 00:29:01,477to the organisms where it is needed.51000:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,140And of course, it’s interestingto see what happens.51100:29:04,207 --> 00:29:08,127If the haemoglobin carriesoxygen, it’s called ‘oxy’.51200:29:08,127 --> 00:29:11,347And if it has lost its oxygen,it’s called ‘deoxy’.51300:29:11,347 --> 00:29:13,127So there are two different forms.51400:29:13,127 --> 00:29:15,707But even before we start talking aboutlosing the oxygen,51500:29:15,707 --> 00:29:18,177let’s talk about the oxy form first.51600:29:18,581 --> 00:29:23,801We notice that the chemical shiftof this proton51700:29:23,818 --> 00:29:27,818depends critically on the pHof the solution.51800:29:28,298 --> 00:29:33,018The chemical shift as a function of pH51900:29:33,201 --> 00:29:36,931can be used a little bit likewe can use the potential52000:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,690of an electrode in a pH meter,52100:29:39,903 --> 00:29:43,163There is a point of inflection52200:29:43,163 --> 00:29:46,193in this curve,and this point of inflection,52300:29:46,388 --> 00:29:49,378where the derivative changes sign,52400:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,759is known as the <i>pk</i>.52500:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,109And so we can determinethe <i>pk</i> of this52600:29:56,109 --> 00:29:58,859histidine.52700:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,039This histidine is embeddedin haemoglobin.52800:30:03,593 --> 00:30:09,203Now it turns out that ifthe haemoglobin is oxygenated,52900:30:09,203 --> 00:30:11,382that is to say if it carries oxygen,53000:30:11,382 --> 00:30:14,852which is of course attachedto the iron atom of the haeme,53100:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,680it turns out that the <i>pk</i> is affected.53200:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,550We can do the same experiment again.53300:30:19,550 --> 00:30:23,670And as you can see, the <i>pk</i>is shifted from 7.9 to 6.8.53400:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,280That’s quite remarkable.53500:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,200Now it turns out thatthis is an illustration53600:30:28,200 --> 00:30:33,350of a very universal rule, which isthat the average chemical shift,53700:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,780which is what you seealong the vertical axis,53800:30:35,780 --> 00:30:40,850this average chemical shiftis made up of a weighted average53900:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,820of the chemical shiftof the protonated form54000:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,460of this molecule,54100:30:45,540 --> 00:30:48,560and the chemical shift of54200:30:49,116 --> 00:30:52,076the de-protonated molecule.54300:30:52,576 --> 00:30:54,136This is very simple.54400:30:54,136 --> 00:30:56,506The protonated chemical shift is weighted54500:30:56,506 --> 00:30:59,996by the concentrationof protonated histidine,54600:31:00,318 --> 00:31:04,318and the de-protonated shift is weightedwith the concentration if de-protonated histidine.54700:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,078And then you divide it by the sumof the two concentrations54800:31:07,317 --> 00:31:10,197the average shift becomes againa dimensionless quantity.54900:31:10,197 --> 00:31:12,687The average chemical shift55000:31:12,687 --> 00:31:14,307is what we measure here.55100:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,507So this is a weighted average.55200:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,617This equation is shown here55300:31:19,617 --> 00:31:22,327specifically for the case of histidine,55400:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,424but of course, it is quite universal.55500:31:25,424 --> 00:31:28,294It’s true for any acid-base equilibrium.55600:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,316It is also true if we havemultiple equilibria.55700:31:31,316 --> 00:31:33,916For example, if you have phosphoric acid,55800:31:33,916 --> 00:31:37,916it can occur with 3, 2 or 1 proton.56000:31:43,505 --> 00:31:45,795All of these forms havedifferent chemical shifts56100:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,975and different concentrations,and therefore,56200:31:47,975 --> 00:31:52,755the weighted average will dependon the pH and on the <i>pk</i>s56300:31:52,755 --> 00:31:57,273and we can determine the <i>pk</i>sby measuring the chemical shift56400:31:57,274 --> 00:31:59,154as a function of pH.56500:31:59,453 --> 00:32:02,333This is a very important observation,56600:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,763very universal in its applications.56700:32:06,053 --> 00:32:09,083So this concludespart one of this chapter.56800:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,090Thank you for your attention.
