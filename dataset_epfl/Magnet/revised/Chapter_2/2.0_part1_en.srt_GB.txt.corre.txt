Welcome to the second chapter of our MOOC,
Massively Online Open Course, on basic steps in magnetic resonance.
Todayâ€™s chapter will be concerned with chemical shifts.
Chemical shifts are indeed at the heart of magnetic resonance.
More specifically, they are essential for most applications of magnetic resonance to chemistry and biology.
In physics, they are perhaps less important, although that can be argued.
In fact, the origin of this effect is what is known in good
English as â€œserendipityâ€� and in bad English, sheer luck.
It was, in fact, discovered by mistake and against the wishes of the inventors,
Proctor and Wu, who in the late 40s or early 50s, wanted to measure the gyromagnetic ratio of nitrogen.
More specifically, of nitrogen-14, which is the predominant isotope of nitrogen,
To do so, they decided to take a material that would be full of nitrogen and they turned to ammonium nitrate which indeed has lots of nitrogen.
And to their distaste, they found, once they'd identified the nitrogen resonances, that there were two peaks and not one.
Now we know that one of these nitrogen peaks came from the ammonium group and the other one from the nitrate group.
But they didn't want that.
They wanted just one peak since they wanted to measure the Gamma-- the gyromagnetic ratio.
The frequency of precession, the transition frequency unaffected by the environment.
To them, the environment was just a nuisance.
So nitrate and ammonium, that was not their business.
They were not chemists.
But they wrote a paper.
They submitted a paper where they called this effect a â€œdirt effect.â€�
The editor wrote, "Dirt effect is not a very scholarly expression.â€�
Would you please propose another expression?"
And they said, "Well, let's call it a chemical shift."
And it has been a chemical shift ever since.
By the way, when I tell you anecdotes like this,
I'm not too sure that they are genuine, that they can be trusted.
Maybe the story was just made up by somebody else.
But, you know, â€œSe non Ã¨ vero, Ã¨ ben trovato.â€�
"If it isn't true, at least it's a nice story."
You can find many of such stories in the books of Abragam, of Casimir, and of many other scientists who have enjoyed themselves writing up their autobiographies and talked about the fun aspects of research.
We shall now discuss the second chapter of the book by Peter Hore, which is dedicated to chemical shifts.
Chemical shifts can be discussed in a purely empirical fashion, i.e., a phenomenon that can be observed without necessarily trying to explain it.
This, in fact, is a very important approach in chemistry and in biology.
Of course, scientists like to explain things.
And so they have thought about the origin of chemical shifts and they have tried to split the chemical shifts into different contributions.
These are known as contributions to nuclear shielding.
In fact, nuclear shielding is another word for chemical shifts.
Weâ€™ll have a summary and then some exercises.
Perhaps the simplest explanation of nuclear shielding and chemical shifts is for the example of noble gases which are mono-atomic molecules such as helium.
In fact, the isotope 3 of helium happens to have a spin <i>I = Â½</i>.
This is lucky, of course.
It can be hyper-polarized as we shall discuss later.
It can actually be used to make images of human lungs.
Likewise, we could also consider Xenon-129 which also has a spin Â½ and also is used for imaging of lungs of living humans.
Now, both have a spherical symmetry and both have a nucleus at the center of a cloud of electrons.
Of course, these electrons move all over the place, but there is a slight preference for them to move in a plane which is perpendicular to the external magnetic field.
So the field <i>B0</i>, is the external magnetic field which is applied to the sample by the experimentalist usually generated by a large superconducting magnet to achieve a sufficiently intense field.
It turns out that this external magnetic field affects the electrons in such a way that there will be a slight preference for the electrons to move around on a trajectory which is perpendicular to the field. 
The electrons move in such a way, that the field that they induce, which is called Bâ€™, the induced field, the field induced by the circulating electrons.
According to the law of Lenz, this induced field has a sign opposite to the external field.
The net effect is that the local field, at the site of the nucleus, is proportional to the external field, but there is an attenuation factor which can be written as <i>1 â€“ Ïƒ</i>.
If sigma is zero, then the local field is equal to the external field and there is no attenuation.
But in many molecules, the sigma has different values depending on the environment, the chemical environment of the nucleus.
The same thing can be expressed not in terms of fields but in terms of NMR frequencies.
The precession frequency of the transversed magnetization is equal to the energy of the transition between the bottom state and the excited state.
And this is proportional to the gyromagnetic ratio, proportional to the external field, attenuated by the circulating electrons.
This attenuation is again expressed as <i>1 â€“ Ïƒ</i>.
We can look at the same thing in terms of energy levels where we see that the bare nucleus has a transition frequency which is determined only by the applied magnetic field.
But as soon as the nucleus sits in an electron cloud, it is partly protected from the external field.
And therefore we have a shielding parameter, the nuclear shielding expressed by the attenuation factor which stems from the circulating electrons.
And as you can see, the splitting between the bottom and the top levels is reduced because of that.
Now, chemical shifts, as I mentioned in my introductory remarks, can be observed in many cases.
The case that I mentioned was nitrogen-14 in an ammonium group and nitrogen-14 in a nitrate group.
And as I said, the physicists who used this material were very disappointed to discover that these two nitrogens had different chemical shifts, as we now call them, or different environments.
But for the chemists, that was wonderful because that allowed them to distinguish the environments.
This is a typical NMR spectrum and you can imagine that this is site B and this is site A.
It could be any molecule that has two distinct resonance frequencies.
In fact a more common case would be for proton NMR.
Proton NMR is by far the most popular form of magnetic resonance today, and particularly in organic chemistry.
In proton NMR we have a range of roughly eight to ten ppm.
This is the range of chemical shifts expressed in the parameter delta.
If we have some protons in different environments, in different solvents, for example this is benzene-- and these are different environments.
Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is by definition used so that the origin of the scale is adjusted to be zero at the frequency of TMS.
The delta scale is defined more properly here.
It is simply the frequency of the transition minus a reference frequency.
So this for example is the frequency of benzene minus the frequency of TMS, divided by the frequency of TMS.
So typically this might be a bit above 400 MHz, minus a bit below 400 MHz.
The ratio, of course, is dimensionless.
It turns out that this dimensionless number tends to be rather small, on the order of 10^-6.
And, therefore, it is usually by convention multiplied by 10^6 in order to get reasonable numbers.
And this gives you the definition of delta, known as the chemical shift to chemists.
And as you can see, it is a dimensionless number.
It is usually expressed in ppm.
I should warn you that in much of the physics literature, the convention is not the same.
They often use the parameter sigma, the nuclear shielding parameter and not the parameter delta defined in this expression.
What is true for the precession frequencies is also true for the shielding parameters.
And you can reformulate this equation by saying that it is the sigma of the reference minus the sigma of the substance of interest.
And you will notice that this runs in the opposite direction.
The delta scale runs in the opposite direction as the scale of the shielding parameters sigma. This gave rise to a great deal of confusion between the literature of the chemists and the literature of the physicists.
Chemical shifts are very often considered as empirical parameters without any attempt to explain them.
As such, they are very well known.
Particularly to chemists and more specifically to organic chemists who have a tremendous ability, the good ones anyway, to recognize a molecule when looking at its proton NMR spectrum.
This is not such an easy task.
You can see that the scale here goes from 0 to 10.
For example, we find that protons attached to aromatic molecules span a considerable range.
Benzene is somewhere near 7.25 ppm but depending on the environment, the shifts can cover quite a range.
It is even worse for hydroxyl aromatics.
Different molecules have different ranges.
We note amusing things.
For example, that an acetylene proton, as we shall discuss later, appears towards lower chemical shifts than an olefinic proton, which is surprising.
This is due to a very peculiar effect sometimes called the neighboring group effect that we shall try to explain later on.
This table is important because many organic chemists have it, as it were, engraved in their brains, and remember this table all the time.
And youâ€™re very familiar with this kind of empirical material, it allows you to recognize the fingerprint of your molecule and determine exactly what it is.
Now there are other things.
For example, the amplitudes of the signals, more properly called the integrals, are proportional to the numbers of nuclei within the molecule.
Some examples are shown here.
This is trimethylbenzene.
These protons are directly attached to the aromatic ring,
There are 3 of them, and there are a total of 3 x 3 = 9 methyl protons.
So the ratio of the methyl protons to the aromatic protons is three to one:
In the NMR spectrum, we see a weak peak here, close to 7 ppm, and a much more intense peak, that is 3 times more intense, just above 2 ppm.
And the fact that they have these amplitude ratios confirms what I just told you, that there are indeed
3 aromatic protons.
These 3 here are directly attached to the ring, and the 9 methyl protons.
So remember that we go from 9/3 equals 3/1
What you observe is 3/1, and what the chemist would like to know is 9/3.
And it takes a bit of chemical intuition to go from  3/1 to 9/3.
We have another example here.
This is a tetramethylbenzene.
There are only 2 aromatic protons and there are a total of 4 x 3 = 12 methyl protons.
So thatâ€™s a ratio of 12 divided by 2
So 12 methyl protons and 2 aromatic protons, and of course, the ratio is 12/2 = 6/1.
And you can see that indeed we have the amplitude of the aromatic peak is 1/6 of the aliphatic peak.
So this kind of reasoning can be extended to many, many molecules.
In fact, these examples are a bit oversimplified.
They have been chosen carefully without cheating.
They are genuine examples, but they have been chosen because these particular molecules do not feature any scalar couplings.
They do not have any multiplets and therefore, we can argue purely on the grounds of chemical shifts.
If we have a more general molecule, such as a protein, then we have many different chemical shifts, many environments.
This particular protein was popular in Oxford in the days of writing the book.
It contains 129 amino acids, which is a fairly small protein by biological standards.
But a large protein from the point of view of chemists.
For NMR spectroscopists this represents a challenge.
129 amino acids means roughly, since there are about 10 protons for each amino acid, roughly that means about 1,000 protons.
Indeed we have about
1,000 chemical shifts.
Some of them pile up so that you get a rather messy profile.
That means that many peaks are added on top of each other.
Others are quite nicely isolated.
This is the sum of a few degenerate methyl groups.
And this looks like a rather isolated proton attached to an amide nitrogen.
Typically, we can write it like this.
And this could probably be written like this.
These are examples of assignments,
That is to say, relationships between peaks and atoms which are one of the great challenges of protein NMR spectroscopy.
But a great deal of progress has been made in this field, particularly by combining proton NMR with carbon-13 NMR and with nitrogen-15 NMR, by enriching the proteins with these stable isotopes and then recording so-called two-dimensional correlation spectra that allow one to assign-- each and every one of these peaks can be assigned and identified.
The next rather exotic example is very far from biology, far from proteins.
There is a substance.
This is actually a metal cluster, which contains four cobalt atoms and a bunch of carbon monoxides.
And the question is, what is the structure of this strange cluster?
You could imagine something like this.
We have four metal atoms forming a regular tetrahedron each of the four metal atoms is surrounded by a local little cloud of three carbon monoxides.
The whole thing would have a symmetry corresponding to the point group of a tetrahedron.
If that were the case, then there should be all sorts of symmetry elements, planes of reflection, rotation, all sorts of elements.
A conclusion of the analysis of the symmetry of this molecule is that there should be only one peak for all oxygen atoms.
And also only one peak for all carbon atoms and one peak for all four metals, if they happen to have a spin, like cobalt for example.
Now it turns out that if we look at the oxygen-17 spectrum, that there are not 1 but 4 peaks.
So we can safely say this is no good.
This can be ruled out because the particularly simple symmetry is incompatible with the fact that there are four lines in the oxygen-17 spectrum.
By the way, oxygen-17 is a rather unusual nucleus.
It has a large quadrupole coupling and the lines are rather broad because of rapid transverse relaxation.
These are not your favorite molecule, nor your favorite isotope in the periodic table, but they offer a very nice illustration.
Now you can speculate about other symmetries.
This has a symmetry of D2D.
It has some so-called bridging carbonyls.
And it also has so-called terminal carbonyls, which have different environments.
And from the structure you conclude that there should be 2 different peaks.
So this can also be ruled out.
Now when you look at this structure, it turns out that we again have bridging carbonyls.
There are 3 of those.
And then you have some which are in an apical position.
They point away from the metal and are isolated.
Whereas, in this case, we have 3 carbonyls attached to the same metal.
In this case, we have 2 carbonyls attached to the same methyl.
Iâ€™m not sure how to draw this.
I should have changed the colors actually.
Now, this molecule, therefore, is compatible with an oxygen-17 spectrum that has 4 distinct resonances.
Itâ€™s not easy to say which of these lines belongs to which environment.
Thatâ€™s a difficult question and itâ€™s not the purpose of todayâ€™s lecture.
This interesting case of fullerenes, sometimes called buckminsterfullerenes, or C60 is perhaps the most common expression.
We know that this is a icosahedral molecule where the carbons are arranged on the pattern of a football.
There are some surfaces that have a hexagonal environment and others a pentagonal environment.
Now what is remarkable about this molecule is that is has an extremely simple carbon-13 spectrum.
In fact, you can convince yourself that it has a very high symmetry, an icosahedral symmetry, and that therefore, the chemical shifts of all 60 carbon atoms should be the same.
And indeed the spectrum shows just a single line.
So the mere fact that there is a single line is a confirmation that the symmetry of the molecule must indeed be very simple.
Now this was not obvious at all.
When this material was discovered by Harry Kroto and his co-workers, this was still an uncertain matter and it was not at all clear that carbon atoms could be arranged in such a structure, such a strange molecule.
In fact, this molecule went unnoticed for about two centuries of modern chemistry, and therefore, itâ€™s quite remarkable that it was found so late in history.
Kroto, by the way, got a Nobel prize, probably mostly for this.
And if you are interested in the origin of such things,
I vividly recommend that you read this in <i>ChemComm</i>.
You can look it up following instructions that I will give later.
So letâ€™s take another example, which I think is very well chosen by Peter Hore from the vast literature that describes such effects.
And this example uses phosphorus-31.
Thatâ€™s a very popular nucleus because it is very abundant.
In fact, this isotope is 
100 % abundant.
Itâ€™s not radioactive, of course, stable and it is found almost everywhere in biology.
But it is also found in inorganic chemistry.
The example studied by Raymond Andrew, who is a very famous English NMR spectroscopist and physicist, in a paper that I vividly recommend you should read,
Andrew and his team studied this very simple molecule.
So this is phosphorus pentachloride.
If you consider it in solution, it is a bi-pyramidal affair, like this.
The phosphorus, of course, is in the middle and the five chlorine atoms sit at the corners of this polygon.
It turns out that there is a high degree of symmetry, and that the phosphorus sits in the middle and is quite happy to be there.
It has only one chemical shift.
But if you precipitate this material and make a solid out of it, then the molecule actually disproportionates and gives you an anionic species and a cationic species, so PCl4- and PCl6+.
The phosphorus-31 nuclei have different chemical shifts.
In fact, it turns out that this one is shielded and this one is de-shielded.
And this is then plotted on a ppm scale for phosphorus-31.
Actually, to record a phosphorus-31 spectrum in a solid is not such a simple affair because as we shall see later, the phosphorus has an anisotropic chemical shift, and therefore, in a solid, it tends to give very broad lines.
And in order to get rid of this line-broadening,
Andrew invented a wonderful experiment which is known as magic angle spinning. This allows you to retrieve very narrow lines from spectra of solids that otherwise would be broadened.
This is a very clever technique and Andrew deserves much credit for that.
This was one of the first applications of that technique.
Now there are also applications of silicon-29 NMR.
This applications is of some industrial interest because of aluminosilicates, that is to say, porous solids that are built of aluminate units,
AlO4 and silicate units, SiO4.
This notation means that the aluminium atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms, roughly in a tetrahedral environment and the silicon atom likewise.
But together these make up a vast array of substances called aluminosilicates.
Some of which are found in nature.
Some of which are only made synthetically.
And many of which have interesting properties as heterogeneous catalysts because they have pores and molecules can enter into these pores and their chemical reactions can occur on the inner surfaces of these pores.
The characterization of aluminosilicates is not an easy matter because as you can see in the periodic table, aluminium and silicon are very close together and they have roughly the same electron density around them.
So that makes it hard to distinguish them with x-ray diffraction.
But of course, in NMR, aluminium-27, which by the way has a quadrupolar coupling, is completely different from silicon-29.
You see here a range of silicon-29 spectra of different zeolites.
Zeolites are an important class of aluminosilicates with different ratios of silicon to aluminium.
So in the bottom case, we have mostly silicon and very little aluminium.
In the top case, they are about equal.
We see a distribution of chemical shifts of silicon-29
If there is no aluminium in the neighborhood, then we have this line here.
If there is one aluminium next door, we have this line.
If there are two aluminium atoms nearby, then we have this line.
If there are three, then we have a line further to the left.
Thereâ€™s actually one more over here, which is very weak.
The more aluminium atoms, that is to say, the lower the ratio of silicon to aluminium-- the higher we move up in this figure.
The distribution shows lines that correspond to silicon atoms environed by n alumimium atoms.
Now, itâ€™s interesting to look at these distributions.
The relative amplitudes give a very refined, a very subtle, very informative way of characterizing these zeolites or aluminosilicates that are so important for heterogeneous catalyses and frequently used in the petroleum industry for cracking heavy crude oil to make convenient petrol or gas as the Americans say.
You can find more about this in this paper by Jacek Klinowski, Colin Fyfe and others.
We tried [but where not allowed] to provide a key to such papers in our supplement.
Now, here is a more biological application but itâ€™s not just biological.
Itâ€™s really of universal importance.
It was first described by Ian Campbell and Raymond Dwek.
Ian Campbell, incidentally, was teaching in Oxford and was the co-examiner of my PhD.
I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve known him very well, but he was a charming person who unfortunately died a few years ago.
Raymond Dwek, as far as Iâ€™m aware, is still active in Oxford.
Now this discovery was very important as an illustration.
They were looking at histidine.
Histidine comes in two forms.
It can be protonated, in which case itâ€™s called HisH+. meaning that there is a proton attached to this nitrogen.
In fact, the molecule looks nearly symmetrical when it is protonated.
But of course, the proton can drop off, in which case it goes into the solution, and the nitrogen is then naked, so to speak, with a lone pair of electrons sticking out.
But this in itself is not something we wish to observe.
What we shall observe is the chemical shift of the proton which is attached to the neighboring carbon.
The chemical shift of the proton attached to the neighboring carbon, the chemical shift of this so-called C2 proton, or H2 proton, which is the one attached to the C2 carbon, is very sensitive to the question if the molecule is protonated or not.
Here are spectra of histidine in its natural environment which is actually in haemoglobin, which is the protein that carries oxygen in our blood and delivers this oxygen to the organisms where it is needed.
And of course, itâ€™s interesting to see what happens.
If the haemoglobin carries oxygen, itâ€™s called â€˜oxyâ€™.
And if it has lost its oxygen, itâ€™s called â€˜deoxyâ€™.
So there are two different forms.
But even before we start talking about losing the oxygen, letâ€™s talk about the oxy form first.
We notice that the chemical shift of this proton depends critically on the pH of the solution.
The chemical shift as a function of pH can be used a little bit like we can use the potential of an electrode in a pH meter,
There is a point of inflection in this curve, and this point of inflection, where the derivative changes sign, is known as the <i>pk</i>.
And so we can determine the <i>pk</i> of this histidine.
This histidine is embedded in haemoglobin.
Now it turns out that if the haemoglobin is oxygenated, that is to say if it carries oxygen, which is of course attached to the iron atom of the haeme, it turns out that the <i>pk</i> is affected.
We can do the same experiment again.
And as you can see, the <i>pk</i> is shifted from 7.9 to 6.8.
Thatâ€™s quite remarkable.
Now it turns out that this is an illustration of a very universal rule, which is that the average chemical shift, which is what you see along the vertical axis, this average chemical shift is made up of a weighted average of the chemical shift of the protonated form of this molecule, and the chemical shift of the de-protonated molecule.
This is very simple.
The protonated chemical shift is weighted by the concentration of protonated histidine, and the de-protonated shift is weighted with the concentration if de-protonated histidine.
And then you divide it by the sum of the two concentrations the average shift becomes again a dimensionless quantity.
The average chemical shift is what we measure here.
So this is a weighted average.
This equation is shown here specifically for the case of histidine, but of course, it is quite universal.
Itâ€™s true for any acid-base equilibrium.
It is also true if we have multiple equilibria.
For example, if you have phosphoric acid, it can occur with 3, 2 or 1 proton.
All of these forms have different chemical shifts and different concentrations, and therefore, the weighted average will depend on the pH and on the <i>pk</i>s and we can determine the <i>pk</i>s by measuring the chemical shift as a function of pH.
This is a very important observation, very universal in its applications.
So this concludes part one of this chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
