Hello, my name is Simone Deparis,
I'm master of teaching and mathematics research at EPFL.
In teaching and research, I often use
MATLAB and Octave.
But what is Octave, what is MATLAB?
These are mathematical softwares that help to do simple calculations, but also to solve complex problems.
In this course, you learn how to get started with the software.
Why introduce two softwares at the same time?
For most common tasks, Octave and
MATLAB are very similar, they use the same language.
MATLAB is a commercial software developed and sold by MathWorks, whereas Octave is developed by passionate people who distribute it freely  under GPL licence.
These two characteristics make one company or school choose one or the other.
Both are able to handle very complex problems and are equipped with many toolboxes, that is, complementary tools for solving specific problems.
In this course, we will not study them, but we will rather we will focus on the basics of the software so, thereafter, you can continue to learn by yourself with the Internet.
At the end of this course, I expect that you know how to handle the software, use scripts and functions, work with vectors and matrices, treat data files, generate graphs and save them in PDF or JPEG format and write small interactive programs.
The first thing to do is choose between
MATLAB and Octave.
I can not make that choice for you, and besides, you can always change your mind or use both, depending on the circumstances.
To help, discuss with your colleagues or browse a bit on the Internet.
If the software is not yet installed, visit one of these sites.
Chapter 1.2 is devoted to Octave installation on Mac.
