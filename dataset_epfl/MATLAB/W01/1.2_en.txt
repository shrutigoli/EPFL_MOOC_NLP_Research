The first thing you need to do, is to choose between Octave and Mat Lab.
I can not make that choice for you, and besides, you can always change your mind or use the 2 depending on the circumstances.
To help, discuss with your colleagues or search on the internet.
If you chose MATLAB, go to MathWorks site they develop the software.
You can buy it or if you are a student or employee of PFL, get a version with the campus license.
Octave, is a free software distributed under GPL.
The developers make it available to the community but free does not mean it costs nothing.
That's why developers are asking users to donate.
I type "Octave" to search my pages.
So here's the Octave page.
For installation, I need to go to
"Download".
As you see, there is Linux, BSD, OS X and Windows.
We are interested in installation on OS X.
There are various possibilities, the new and fairly easy, is the binary installation.
Then you must download the binary, you can start the download.
You have to take "Octave 3806" it's a package.
First, it will download.
And within this binary, will have either an application in command line that we will not use particularly, or (gui) version with a graphic interface, this is the one you will often use.
The download is finished, you can go to the download file and explicitly open it.
There is the installation file.
So we will click twice on the package, and now we are ready to install.
You need a user password.
Now, Octave is in your applications.
You can click twice to open it and have it available.
You've installed MATLAB and Octave, and you are ready to start using them.
