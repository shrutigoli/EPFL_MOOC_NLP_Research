Here we are in the last lesson
It is dedicated to the construction of a small program.
We'll first define the required features, which allows us to describe the functions that must be implemented.
Although structure allows us to organize the development from the beginning into several clear and easy tasks to write.
Here is the description of the program we would like to write.
This program must give the user a choice among seven possibilities.
The last, the seventh, exits the program.
The first explains the program itself,
So we would like the user to read all the choices he has available.
The second is to define the limits of the figure: we would like to have a figure and this figure draw one or more ellipses.
Therefore, step 2 is to define the limits of the figure: the maximum x, maximum y, the minimum x, minimum y.
The 3rd option is to draw an ellipse defined by the user.
An ellipse is defined by its center and its main axes.
This is what the user should plot before drawing the ellipse.
The fourth step is to load the  ellipses file and then draw.
So,what is this? we provide a file with multiple ellipses inside, you should load this file into a matrix and then draw all ellipses.
The fifth step is to request the accuracy of the drawing.
We have seen that to draw a curve, you must give some points, and then we can draw.
So we ask the user to set the precision.
By default,we use 200 points.
And the sixth step is to clean the figure.
So in summary, this program should offer the possibility to the ser to define multiple ellipses, to draw all in the figure defined and clean from time to time this figure if he wants to start.
As for the guidelines,you should organize your program you need to save the main program in a script,
This allows us to call several functions, use functions in a file and document the functions and the main program.
