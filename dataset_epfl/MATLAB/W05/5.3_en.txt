These are the functions that we need.
The first is explainProgram.
ExplainProgram should only explain what this program does so it will be some output lines in the command line.
So you'll have to use, for example, the disp function to print character chains explaining the program on the screen.
The second is askAxes, it has no entry
Inside, you will ask the user a question with the input function, and then make the output myAxes which must be a 4x1 matrix.
The modifyAxes function, should take in myAxes which is a 4x1 matrix and edit the figure with these new axes given by the user.
AskEllipse should simply ask a 4x1 matrix where the first two numbers are the center coordinates and the second two are the main axis along X and the main axis along Y.
PlotEllipse takes input the ellipse, four numbers in a matrix, and the number of points that we wants to use to draw the ellipse.
On the output, there will be nothing.
There will be something on the screen, but nothing is rendered to the main program. loadFileAndPlot, will load the file we just saw earlier where there are many ellipses one after the other.
And you should give it as input the number of points to use to draw these ellipses.
Therefore the input is Npoints, and it is an integer, and on output, there is nothing, there will only be something on the screen in the figure
And when we want to change the accuracy, you use the askPrecision function and then there will be a new precision the is requested.
So I don't ask that, when changing accuracy, all ellipses that already exist be redrawn, that's a little more complicated, it would require at that time to keep all ellipses in a database in order to reload them and reprint them, it is possible, but that is not what is required.
So this new precision is used to ellipses drawn thereafter.
