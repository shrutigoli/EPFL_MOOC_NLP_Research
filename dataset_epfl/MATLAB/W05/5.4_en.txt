The first function to write, is explainProgram.
I have already written it, as
I said, it is very simple.
This is a function, and this function has no output, so there is no need to write brackets, but if you want, you can write.
This is a function that makes nothing and needs no input.
This feature explains the program.
And then I wrote my explanation, it can be very different, more accurate, less precise, it's up to you.
I see that there is a small typo.
We don't have the ability to use accents.
Here is a quote,
I have to put two to ensure that the program interpretes this string correctly.
Besides, I can use this function and control that I did not make any mistakes.
Indeed, it wrote everything I explained my explainProgram function.
The second function to write is askAxes.
First, axes, what is it?
Here we see the function that I have prepared.
Look at what happens when we do a little drawing.
So I just draw a point, there is a figure that opens.
Now I can watch the axes:
It is 3 ; 4 ; 3,6 ; 4,4 ; 4,4 ; 5,6.
Let the figure.
The X axis is 3,6 to 4,4, and the Y axis is 4,4 to 5,6.
Now if I want to change these axes, actually,
I need four numbers.
I ask them four times,
I ask the X axis minimum, maximum X, minimum Y, maximum Y.
And it'll make my axes.
Try to see the operation.
So myAxes equal to askAxes.
There is an error because I wrote the function in French then you need to write in English.
So myAxes equal to askAxes.
For example now I want to draw between
1 and 5 and between -3 and 10.
How to use these new axes?
You must call the function axis with myAxes.
Now, the axes are changed.
So in modifyAxes function it will take the axes that are defined by the user and using them to stud.
I'll do the modifyAxes function.
I have not yet written the function.
Then the input, the inputs for this function are one: it's myAxis, we simply need to call the axis function with these new axes.
I can save.
The fourth function to write is the askEllipse function.
This function is like function that asks the axes of the graph.
We'll get the ellipse as a 1x4 matrix which contains the center of the ellipse in X and Y coordinates and along the axes X and Y.
These, ask the user and must instruct the user to say what we do.
Here is how you can ask
-it is a possibility- the user the ellipse he wants to draw.
And then you have to draw the ellipse.
This is the plotEllipsis function.
There, I called ellipsis, plotEllipsis.
If I do that here backup function will not really change, you must also change the file name.
You can go to file browser and change the name.
I changed my name. What does this function do?
She draws an ellipse with Npoints, so as input,
I have Npoints defined with the ellipse so
(X-c1). ^ 2 /a1Â² + (y-c2). ^ 2 /a2Â² <= 1 or = 1 if we just want the perimeter.
Now I have to recover the data c1, c2, a1 and a2 inside the ellipse, I make an extraction of these data.
I prepare my parameter which is equal to linspace, so it is Npoints distributed between
0 and 2 * pi.
Now how do we draw an ellipse?
This is c1, so the first coordinate is the center
+ A1 * sin (t), the sine of the parameter.
The second coordinate is c2+a2 *cos(t), the cosine of the parameter.
Now we can use plotEllipse to draw an ellipse in a parametered way.
We can try the program.
See our main program.
If I make a choice that is between
1 and 3, it should work
We can try.
You must, for example, choose the explanation which will rewrite the whole program again and give me a new choice.
Now I can, for example, change the axes.
Want axes 1 to 4 and from 2 to 7.
There is a mistake. So myAxes is not defined.
I see that there is a mistake here,
I correct, and I have to start over.
So callPlot. . .
So I said, I want to give the axes.
And we will see the figure that appears, only the axes.
Now we can choose to draw an ellipse.
You have to give the center of the ellipse,
I'll put it at the center of my figure, so it is 2-3 and the axes along X and Y, for example, here, I'll do 1 and 1.5.
Now there is another mistake.
It's Npoints which is not defined.
Indeed, Npoints has not been defined before,
So it must be well defined at the beginning.
So by default, I was told -
I look at my definition
You must have 200 points.
You see, in a script, errors occur only at the time of execution of the line in question.
Npoints was not defined here and
I got the error.
So callPlot.
Now maybe I can already continue drawing my ellipse.
So I said I'll put this ellipse centered the axes of just now.
So it was 2-3, with axes was 1 and 1,5, and my ellipse appears.
In fact, I forgot that my program will first close the figure,
So there it is a figure that is new,
I must surrender the right axes.
So the axes, I wanted them, for example, 0-4 for X and 1 to 5 for Y, and now my axes are changed and my figure is present.
If I draw a new ellipse,
I would like it to be drawn on top of the existing one.
If I take option 3, my ellipse will be crushed.
So I'll stop the program with 7 and I will slightly change my program
I load a figure 1 and in this figure, I will do what is called a hold on.
Like this, from now on, when I run this program, the figure will be continuously reused.
Now, define the loadFileAndPlot function.
So loadFileAndPlot.
What is loadFileAndPlot?
It loads the specified file and draws all ellipses of the file.
You should take the ellipses from a file and this file it is called cheeseEllipse.
To load it, we call by bringing a matrix with many lines and on each line, an ellipse is defined.
What I can do is a loop, it is a possibility with ellipse which must be equal to all these ellipses.
What there is, is that you can make a loop on both columns of a matrix.
If I want to transpose AllEllipses,
I'll have a loop on the lines of all these ellipses.
For all these lines, I can make a call plotEllipse the function we have already seen.
PlotEllipse this function needs an ellipse and the number of points.
The number of points is given as input, to the function that is being written, so there is no need to do much more.
Try our new function.
We must callPlot.
Now, it directly opened my figure.
I can draw ellipses in the file
So I give the input number 4, it directly loaded and drew all ellipses.
Now I can change the axes if I want or I can add an ellipse.
I think one is missing, for example,
I want to put in place 300 to 300 of a size 20 and 50.
Now the new ellipse appeared.
What remains to be done?
If I look callPlot, I loadFileAndPlot, what remains is the askPrecision function.
AskPrecision then, it is very similar to askAxes, it will just prompt for input.
We will edit this function askPrecision here it's already written.
This is a feature that makes the number of points and has nothing on input.
It asks what accuracy to draw with, and we can say Npoints equal input, a small message, and after, it may return the number of necessary points.
You should also control the data.
Now our program has ended, we have implemented all the functions, maybe some functions are improved.
On one hand, in askPrecision, you need to do controls; same for the axes, you need to add some controls on the axes; also improve small bugs that we put; when you change the axes, maybe we can add comments in the function modification of the axes, and save.
Our program is finished.
We created a program consisting of several functions.
Before implementing each of them,
We have defined the framework and identified the functions.
For each function, we defined inputs and outputs.
This allowed us to divide the work well and possibly also allow sharing between multiple people.
I suggest you use the same approach each time you must write a new program.
I hope you enjoyed this course.
Naturally, this was a first introduction to MATLAB and Octave software.
It is using the best that you can learn.
Feel free to search the Internet, there is often the answers to your questions.
