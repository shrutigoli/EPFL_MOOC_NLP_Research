00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,179
Hello, in this lecture, we will see how a man, standing on

2
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:10,355
Earth is in equilibrium. We will use

3
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:13,171
a new construction, called a free-body diagram,

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:18,310
which will enable us to identify all the forces which act on this person,

5
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,810
and we will determine how to define equilibrium

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,330
on the basis of precise criteria.

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:31,685
When a man is in equilibrium on the ground, it is obvious that, due to universal 

8
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:38,510
gravity, his mass induces a weight which is activated by Earth.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,895
Earth itself acts on this person, so that he is in equilibrium,

10
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:49,280
and, under the person's feet, acts a contact force.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,150
We are going to use this construction

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,730
of a free-body diagram to evidence these effects.

13
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,914
Let's look at a man on the ground.

14
00:00:57,914 --> 00:01:03,578
The first force which acts at his center of gravity, which is approximately at

15
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:09,426
this height, is his weight G, which acts vertically downwards, and this

16
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:15,450
weight has a value of approximately 800 Newtons in this case.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,610
We can see lots of other things

18
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,610
around this person, which do complicate our thinking.

19
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,286
Are there some effects induced by the red

20
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:26,913
construction behind, or by the benches, or by the flower display cases ?

21
00:01:26,913 --> 00:01:27,907
It is not clear.

22
00:01:27,907 --> 00:01:31,398
So, what we want to introduce is the principle 

23
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:35,635
of a free-body, which will enable us to isolate what interests us,

24
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:38,710
it will often be a structure, here it is a person, from

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,620
the environment, to only focus on what is

26
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,440
significant. I then draw a free-body which

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,862
surrounds the person, which includes everything which is significant, and then

28
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:58,220
which cuts, however, just under the person's feet,

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,600
since we want to reveal what happens under the feet.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,975
What happens around him, however, is not very significant, and thus

31
00:02:07,975 --> 00:02:08,758
disappears.

32
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,414
Thus if we look at this sky blue free-body edge,

33
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:15,166
inside this free-body acts a force of 800

34
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:17,278
Newtons downwards, and if it was the only

35
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:21,040
force which would act, well, the man would go down, would fall down.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,395
There is necessarily another force, it is neither 

37
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,882
on the left, neither on the right, the man is not borne

38
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,126
by air, it is not either on the top, the man is not

39
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:32,050
borne by his hair, but it is under his feet.

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,214
I draw here

41
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:39,240
a force which corresponds to the effects of both feet together, and which is the effect

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:44,658
of Earth on the man.

43
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,630
Just where our free-body passes under the feet,

44
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,796
it passes at the boundary between the man and the ground, and this

45
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:04,713
kind of force is a contact force which

46
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:09,717
always acts perpendicularly between

47
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:14,437
two bodies which touch one another. We now want 

48
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,447
to know how this body can be in

49
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:19,962
equilibrium, how this free-body can be in equilibrium.

50
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:23,430
Well, for it to be in equilibrium, it is necessary that

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,950
the ground has enough capacity to bear the person. 

52
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,674
We can easily understand that this force must be equal to and

53
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:35,890
in the opposite direction that the person's weight, that is to say to be equal to 800 Newtons.

54
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,586
What happens if this person, instead of standing

55
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,730
on a firm ground, stands on quicksand ?

56
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,460
Well, the quicksand can exert a

57
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,860
force upwards of, let's say, only 300 Newtons.

58
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,227
So, the result of this is that there is a force

59
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:55,240
of 500 Newtons which pushes the person downwards, until,

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,812
once the friction acting along his legs increases,

61
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:04,653
the force which can be transmitted by the quicksand is significant enough to

62
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:07,930
equilibrate the 800 Newtons of the person,

63
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,274
it is thus necessary for the equilibrium that the

64
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:16,940
contact force of the ground on the person should be able to be equal to the person's weight.

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,085
We can also express it saying that it

66
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,852
is necessary that the sum of the forces acting

67
00:04:22,852 --> 00:04:26,219
on the free-body should be zero. We can represent

68
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,884
this graphically, we have here the weight of

69
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:35,320
800 Newtons, weight G, and then

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,140
we have here the contact force

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,910
which is also equal to 800 Newtons.

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,862
Then, we can see that it is... so, I drew

73
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:49,058
these two vectors a little bit staggered from each other so  that

74
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,888
we can see them, actually they are

75
00:04:50,888 --> 00:04:54,465
really layered over each other. We can also say,

76
00:04:54,465 --> 00:04:59,520
since they are two vectors, that the vectorial

77
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,310
sum of the forces must 

78
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:08,970
be zero for a body to be in equilibrium.

79
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,704
Let's consider another case, the one of a person

80
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:19,977
who leans forward. I draw a free-body which surrounds

81
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:27,286
this person, we pass just under his feet,

82
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,710
the forces which act on this free-body are on the one hand

83
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,928
inside the free-body, the weight G of the person and then, on the other hand,

84
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:51,315
under the free-body, there, the bearing force, the

85
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:57,890
contact force of the ground on the person.

86
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:03,614
What we notice is that these two forces

87
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:10,380
share the same line of action, that is to say that they are aligned.

88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,540
If we look at the person's feet on the right, we

89
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,371
can draw here the path of the free-body, well, I am only interested 

90
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:20,446
in one of both feet, but the reasoning I am doing

91
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,902
is also valid for the sum of both feet, well, we can 

92
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:28,420
see that in this configuration, the sum of, the contact force, it acts

93
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:36,050
somewhere just at the front of the feet, but it is still possible.

94
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,855
If the contact force, however, had to

95
00:06:38,855 --> 00:06:42,019
act even more on the left, it would cause

96
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,905
a problem, we could arrive at the end of the big

97
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,507
toe, and then after, there would be a problem

98
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:53,772
about the strength of the foot, and then, if we go further, this is the case

99
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:59,180
of someone who leans forward too much, this person here have a center of gravity which is

100
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,410
situated on the

101
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,562
left of the line of action of

102
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,680
the contact force,

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,640
In the first picture on the left, it is located slightly to the left, whereas in

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,840
the picture on the right, much more,

105
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,380
in this case here, we deal with a loss of equilibrium

106
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,116
since the ground is still ready to provide 800 Newtons to resist to the weight of the

107
00:07:44,116 --> 00:07:48,500
person, but however, it is impossible that the line of action of the 

108
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,380
weight of the person coincide with the line of action of the contact force.

109
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,714
The person who loses his balance is a case that does not interest us anymore

110
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,166
in this course, since we want to

111
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,050
focus on the structures in equilibrium, but

112
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,314
it is obvious that it also means that, if it happens to a man,

113
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,122
it can also happens to a structure, and then we need to be very

114
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:11,570
careful not to get structures which are not able to be in equilibrium.

115
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,754
In this video, we have seen how to use a subsystem, to 

116
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:21,812
evidence, not only the weight of the person, but also a contact

117
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:26,690
force between the ground and the person, we have seen that the equilibrium of

118
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,808
two forces is conditioned by two conditions ; the first one is 

119
00:08:31,808 --> 00:08:36,938
that the vectorial sum of all the forces which act on the 

120
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:42,094
free-body must be zero, and the second one,

121
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:47,190
is that the forces have 

122
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,950
an identical line of action. And

123
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,690
finally we have seen that a loss of equilibrium

124
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,968
results from a violation of one these two conditions.
