00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
Hello. In this

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,910
video, we are going to see which kinds of loads can act on structures.

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,140
Gravitation is the first of the loads,

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,270
which is the result from the presence of the structure

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,042
on Earth. Downfalls, seen in the

6
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:29,097
clouds, come in the form of snow, but also of water,

7
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:34,130
are also a source of loads for our structures.

8
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,558
We can see here, on the bottom, circulations of currents, and 

9
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:45,040
winds are also a source of loads for our structures, and 

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,393
finally, well, the Earth is subjected to tectonic movements

11
00:00:50,393 --> 00:00:53,895
which manifest themselves by earthquakes, and

12
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:59,387
earthquakes are also a big source of loads.

13
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:04,502
Finally, on Earth, we are there, the humans, either

14
00:01:04,502 --> 00:01:09,980
individually or in groups, or with means 

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:15,000
of transportation, and therefore people are sources of loads.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,240
Let's have a look on three examples of structures. On the building on the left, we

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,830
are very certainly going to have snow loads in the winter time.

18
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:34,196
If rainwater falls onto the building, it will be drained away, and generally this will not induce

19
00:01:34,196 --> 00:01:40,560
any other loads. Of course, we will have gravity

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,465
loads induced by the self-weight of the structure.

21
00:01:45,465 --> 00:01:49,744
The weight of the structure is thus going to be an important load; another 

22
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:54,831
important gravitational load is going to be induced by

23
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:58,398
the structure's users, people.

24
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,690
Wind causes important loads on a structure

25
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,670
like this skyscraper. Generally, wind loads increase as a function of

26
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,000
the distance to the ground, increasing with increasing

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,265
height. Wind loads generally act approximately horizontally.

28
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,933
Obviously, we do not know in which direction because wind can

29
00:02:26,933 --> 00:02:28,129
blow in all 

30
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,624
directions, but it mostly acts horizontally

31
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:35,740
on the facades. We are going to deal with

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,242
soil's movements linked to the earthquakes, they are

33
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,203
alternating movements, that is why I drew a

34
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,326
double-headed arrow. Earthquakes induce on the

35
00:02:45,326 --> 00:02:48,206
structures effects which are similar to the ones

36
00:02:48,206 --> 00:02:50,832
of the wind. Unlike what we often think, it is 

37
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:53,496
the ground which moves but the higher

38
00:02:53,496 --> 00:02:57,490
parts of the building will be subjected to very, very substantial loads.

39
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,877
And then obviously, for all these forces

40
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:03,992
to be in equilibrium, we obviously have the action of

41
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:08,070
the ground on the structure. It is necessary for

42
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,120
equilibrium and it is also something which is going to vary.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,010
If now we look at a dam.

44
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,310
Well, behind this dam, there is water

45
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,310
which pushes, according to the hydrostatic pressure which linearly increases,

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:28,444
then we have the water pressure. This

47
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:30,990
dam has also obviously a big weight, it is

48
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:37,946
a big mass of concrete, then it has also a self-weight. In addition, in the presence

49
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:40,610
of people, it is possible to have

50
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,276
people moving on and inside

51
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,718
the dam, or the influence of snow are

52
00:03:45,718 --> 00:03:48,680
much less significant for this kind of structure

53
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,400
which, however, will be sensitive to the effect

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,436
of earthquakes and then, on which the action of the ground

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,950
is obviously necessary.

56
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:14,060
Finally, we have a pedestrian footbridge, and we have as loads the

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:19,110
self-weight of the structure, probably

58
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,956
a little bit of wind load, this is a footbridge which is relatively

59
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:28,940
close to the seashore, and then

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:38,142
obviously, we can observee it, the weight of people.

61
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,713
Of course, we will also have to take into account 

62
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:52,895
earthquakes and we will have

63
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:57,160
the action of the ground which will act on the structure.

64
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,798
A pressure which is often mentioned

65
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:08,500
when I ask students what kinds of forces act on structures,

66
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,670
namely the atmospheric pressure.

67
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,655
It is important to understand how it is different from

68
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:19,075
the water pressure that I have shown before. The water pressure

69
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:21,385
acts because on one side of our dam there is water

70
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:24,486
whereas there is none on the other side.

71
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:28,776
Thus water pushes on one side, and on the other side, there is nothing to push.

72
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:31,276
If we had water on both sides, well,

73
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,607
the water pressure would not have any effects 

74
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:36,620
because the water pressure would act on both sides.

75
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:42,430
It is like if I put my hand in the water, I sketch my hand in this

76
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,374
way, well, I will have a water pressure

77
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:53,910
which acts in the same way everywhere.

78
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,731
On the  contrary, if there is water on only one side of my hand, then I

79
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:02,335
will feel the water pressure. It is similar with the atmospheric

80
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:06,721
pressure. A body is subjected to the atmospheric 

81
00:06:06,721 --> 00:06:12,875
pressure above, below, on the left,

82
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:18,294
and on the right, and this pressure offsets itself

83
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:23,781
in such a way that we do not feel the atmospheric pressure, and

84
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:28,775
structures, generally, do not feel the atmospheric pressure either.

85
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,139
The case where it could be felt it is

86
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,811
if we had a structure in which we

87
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,833
would wish to create a vacuum, because when we have 

88
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,580
a vacuum, we precisely do not have the atmospheric pressure anymore. 

89
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,316
It is rare enough. It should be noted that the atmospheric pressure is

90
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,610
a very significant pressure, since it corresponds to the pressure

91
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,642
of 760 milimeters of mercury, or if we refer to

92
00:06:46,642 --> 00:06:49,610
water, of more than 10 meters of water pressure.

93
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,233
And 10 meters of water pressure corresponds to a

94
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:55,851
pressure of 100 kiloNewtons per square meter, which is huge.

95
00:06:55,851 --> 00:07:00,260
But fortunately, we do not have to take account of it for our structures.

96
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,557
We have two big families of loads, on the one hand

97
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,302
the loads which are permanent, which are always there.

98
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:17,310
So, what is always there ? Well, obviously, the self-weight,

99
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,500
and then what we call permanent

100
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,680
loads,

101
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,333
for example, in a building, it would be all the things

102
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:36,990
which are always there, like the partition walls, the floor

103
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,030
coatings, the equipments, but which do not have a structural function.

104
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,530
For example, if we put a layer of marble on the floor, it is not a component

105
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,080
which contributes to the strength of

106
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,630
the structure, but it has a weight.

107
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,165
The action of the ground is also

108
00:08:03,165 --> 00:08:08,450
a load which is of an essentially permanent nature.

109
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,342
Among the variable actions, that is to say which are sometimes there, but which

110
00:08:13,342 --> 00:08:18,080
are not always there, we have the effect

111
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,314
of people, and this also applies to the effect of automobile

112
00:08:23,314 --> 00:08:26,585
traffic, or of rail traffic, either there

113
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:29,301
is a locomotive on the bridge, either

114
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:36,832
there is nothing, the wind effect, the water pressure effect, for my dam,

115
00:08:36,832 --> 00:08:40,120
maybe the water is there, the dam

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,270
is full, but maybe the water is not

117
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,894
there, and the dam is not full, it is

118
00:08:45,894 --> 00:08:48,904
then a load which is of a variable nature,

119
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,030
and obviously, the seismic load is a load

120
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,080
which is only very occasionally there , during

121
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,300
an earthquake, otherwise there is no seismic load.

122
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,930
We will see thereafter that it is important to make the distinction between these two kinds of loads

123
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,616
because we do not deal with them in the 

124
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,266
same way regarding safety.

125
00:09:07,266 --> 00:09:10,326
In this lecture, we have seen various types of loads

126
00:09:10,326 --> 00:09:14,690
which act on structures, some loads are of a gravitational nature,

127
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,955
some loads are of a climatic nature, like wind, snow, which becomes gravitational

128
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:24,750
loads. We have seen the effect of a pressure,

129
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,610
knowing that the atmospheric pressure is not a load which acts on our

130
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,649
structures, but the water pressure behind a wall is one of them.

131
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:35,199
We have seen seismic loads and the actions of the ground on

132
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,752
a structure, and in the end we have seen that it is important to distinguish 

133
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:43,148
between permanent loads and variable loads.
