00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,912
Hello and welcome to the structures course.

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,096
Together, over the next weeks,

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,990
we will discover a series of properties of structures.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,912
In this video, we will see what a structure is and what are the reasons

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:20,432
why we now have the professional profiles

6
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:23,380
of the engineer and the architect in our professions.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,906
We will see what the "Path of Structures" is,

8
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:30,002
what are the contents of the course, we will see

9
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:33,628
what course supports are available, what are the prerequisites and

10
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:39,016
the required equipment. Finally, we will see how the course will be graded.

11
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:41,090
What is a structure ?

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,394
Nowadays, if one opens a dictionary,

13
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:46,350
we find that the part related to structures is not small.

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:55,084
But the part that is of interest to us it quite short, though:

15
00:00:55,084 --> 00:01:01,525
"Conceptual design or study of structures, layout and calculation

16
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:04,660
of the structure of constructions". This still does not tell us

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,300
quite what a structure is, but it is in accordance

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,640
with what we will try to do in this course.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,184
Where is the structure ?

20
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:16,177
Everything has a shape,

21
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:20,990
and quite often the shape hides the structure.

22
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,803
Indeed, the Statue of Liberty, which was

23
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:27,837
a gift of France to the United States for their

24
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:32,786
centennial is a structure, which withstands since more

25
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,570
than 100 years to wind, and it is quite exposed

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,554
on the Atlantic shore, so there must be

27
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:40,018
a structure, and in fact, as can be seen

28
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:43,538
in the schematic, it is a serious structure which

29
00:01:43,538 --> 00:01:47,088
was prepared in Paris, France by the design office of Gustave Eiffel,

30
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:50,644
yes, the same who also built the Eiffel Tower.

31
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:52,921
We see here elements of the Statue

32
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:55,460
of Liberty which were pre-assembled in Paris,

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,628
to make sure that they would fit when they

34
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:02,070
would eventually be assembled in New York City after they crossed the Atlantic.

35
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,257
What we call a structure is the sum of all elements

36
00:02:06,257 --> 00:02:09,000
constitutive of the assembly, the framework of a construction,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,048
the skeleton if you prefer.

38
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,990
To be even more accurate, we will talk about a load-carrying structure.

39
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,040
Engineer and architect, you have no doubt already heard

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,090
from these two functions in the field of construction.

41
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,584
As a matter of fact, the two roles have not always been separate,

42
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:30,663
if we consider these two constructions from the Roman times, which

43
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:33,900
are about 2000 years old each, the "Pont du Gard" and the

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,550
Pantheon, well they did not have an architect or an engineer

45
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,642
to speak of properly, there were builders or master builders at that

46
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:45,586
time. It is later, approximately in the nineteenth

47
00:02:45,586 --> 00:02:51,475
century that the separation

48
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:57,579
has occurred, which was logical insofar that the number of disciplines

49
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:02,820
to master was exploding, because there were new construction materials,

50
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,040
it was the beginning of steel, concrete

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,330
was soon going to appear, there were calculation

52
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,620
methods for constructions which were becoming

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,460
increasingly more accurate, but also more complex.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,385
On the other side, and for buildings in particular,

55
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:18,944
a lot of new tasks were added, as

56
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,238
for example, a little later, the arrival of 

57
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:24,370
lifts, of running water, and so on

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,970
which require that the architects have enough

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,636
time to devote to particular tasks.

60
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:34,138
Then both professional figures of the engineer and the architect, are

61
00:03:34,138 --> 00:03:39,638
now separated and are separated for good reasons, but however they 

62
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:44,498
cooperate in the field of structures, since the structures are a point

63
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:48,545
to be developed jointly by the architects and the engineers.

64
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:49,965
The aim of this course is

65
00:03:49,965 --> 00:03:53,740
to enable you to understand the structures' behavior,

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,224
in order to know how to analyze them and to understand what happens

67
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:59,935
inside, but above all, to be able to 

68
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:04,030
design them, to imagine new structures.

69
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,007
The organization of the course follows the one of the book "The art of structures",

70
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:11,190
I will come back to this book later,

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,190
which is called "The path of the structures". 

72
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,222
This path begins on the left and finishes

73
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:23,914
on the right, with a progression following this arrow. 

74
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:27,317
In the course "The art of structures I", which you are going 

75
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:32,266
to take, we will stop over here, which means 

76
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,448
that the schedule we are going to follow is

77
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:39,494
shorter, but he still have this arrow which is important.

78
00:04:39,494 --> 00:04:43,750
This course must be followed from the left to the right consecutively.

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,272
It is not

80
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,476
possible to take it from the middle. Even if you have

81
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:50,030
prior knowledge, it will be difficult.

82
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,179
It is very important to walk through the early stages of learning

83
00:04:53,179 --> 00:04:56,750
in order to be able to understand, consecutively, what will  happen. 

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,963
Indeed, it is very important to walk through all these stages.

85
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:05,187
If we look at this little boy who is putting a piece on the top of this

86
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:09,297
tower, we can say "well done, be careful", but actually, where

87
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:13,767
it was necessary to be careful, it is here, these pieces over here,

88
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:17,075
on the lower part, which carry all the rest of the tower.

89
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:19,721
If they had been incorrectly placed, there wouldn't have been 

90
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,790
any chances to put a piece on the top of the tower.

91
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,107
Likewise, it is important to pay close attention

92
00:05:26,107 --> 00:05:29,685
to the first lectures of this structures course. 

93
00:05:29,685 --> 00:05:32,105
They will maybe seem to you too simple, or maybe

94
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:34,324
even simplistic, but it is important 

95
00:05:34,324 --> 00:05:38,540
to understand them well to get strong bases which will enable you to progress thereafter.

96
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,092
And everything you will learn,

97
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:44,299
you will see, will be reused further, then if

98
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:47,970
you don't learn it well, you will have trouble following the course.

99
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,742
The course supports : they are very varied.

100
00:05:50,742 --> 00:05:53,668
Of course the first support you will refer to

101
00:05:53,668 --> 00:05:59,402
is Coursera itself, on which you will find

102
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:04,055
the videos like the one you are now watching, together with 

103
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:08,525
quiz games and exercises. You will be able to refer to the website 

104
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:13,460
i-structures : i dash structures, dot

105
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,958
epfl dot ch, which contains similar

106
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:24,775
information than in the videos, but in the form of lessons,

107
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:31,102
in a more classic form, that is to say composed of texts and figures.

108
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:37,243
You will have at your disposal on Coursera, course handouts (supports de cours),

109
00:06:37,243 --> 00:06:42,940
in pdf format, which I ask you to print

110
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,910
every week and to have in front of you when you will watch the videos.

111
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,785
The principle of these course handouts,

112
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,185
and that is the way I taught this 

113
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:55,285
course for many years, is to give you

114
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:58,795
incomplete course supports which you will complete

115
00:06:58,795 --> 00:07:01,495
as the videos will progress.

116
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:06,000
Then, when you will see me writing something, generally, 

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,340
you will have to write it on your lecture's notes.

118
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,635
This method will enable you 

119
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:15,120
to acquire well the definitions I will introduce,

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,584
and also and above to make by yourself the graphic constructions

121
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:21,000
I will make and it is important

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,665
to make them by yourself in order to understand them well

123
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:26,280
and to master them, before starting the exercises.

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,340
Finally, you have the book "The art of structures" written by

125
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:36,450
professor Aurelio Muttoni, which is available in French, 

126
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,438
English and in Italian, from the publisher EPFL Press, also known as

127
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:44,472
PPUR ; you will find

128
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:46,590
a link in the course handouts.

129
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,734
What are the prerequisites for this course ? 

130
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,079
They are not that many because actually

131
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:53,625
it is a first year college course,

132
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,780
but it is a course which does not have a high level of requirements

133
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,371
in mathematics or in any other subjects.

134
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:02,770
Then what is important is that you are comfortable with

135
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,520
mathematics, you will be asked

136
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,820
to add, to subtract, to multiply,

137
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,824
and to divide, barely more; that you are also

138
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,512
comfortable with the idea of drawing with a ruler and

139
00:08:13,512 --> 00:08:15,584
a pencil on a sheet of paper, because

140
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,970
these are operations that you will perform very often.

141
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,247
But this level is not very high, neither

142
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:24,306
in mathematics, neither in basic training.

143
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:27,344
Thus, I think that this course is open to almost

144
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:31,030
anyone who is ready to make the effort to follow it.

145
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,300
On the other hand,

146
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,234
you will need a computer. Well, I imagine that

147
00:08:36,234 --> 00:08:37,906
if you are watching this video, you have access to 

148
00:08:37,906 --> 00:08:39,666
a computer, but it is important to say that

149
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:42,123
it will be necessary that it is a real computer, in quotes.

150
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,403
You will be able to watch the videos and to make a part of the

151
00:08:44,403 --> 00:08:48,755
exercises, on a simple computer, like a tablet,

152
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:52,860
or even a cellphone, but, for 

153
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,069
some parts of the exercises, particularly to use the JAVA applets,

154
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:01,444
you will need to have access to a computer, like a Mac,

155
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:05,790
a PC, or a Linux workstation, which can use all the

156
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,513
capacities of computers. In regard to the equipment, you see that the

157
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:16,920
equipment I propose you to use is very simple. Namely: paper,

158
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,127
rather than a pad, I suggest you to buy,

159
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,545
or to use a notebook.

160
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,719
The interest of a notebook is that it keeps a consecutive order,

161
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:30,893
so each week, you write Week 1, lecture 1, then

162
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,514
you take notes according to what you

163
00:09:33,514 --> 00:09:36,692
see, maybe in the videos, but in particular in the exercises.

164
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:39,811
And then, a couple of weeks later, you will say to yourself "but,

165
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:41,869
I have seen that before" and you will be able to go back.

166
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,205
This is the advantage of a notebook, unless you

167
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:47,155
snatch pages, it will keep a memory of, not only what 

168
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:50,240
you wrote, but also of the order in which you progressed. 

169
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,183
Then, you will need a set square.

170
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:54,729
I propose you to try to find one with a 

171
00:09:54,729 --> 00:09:59,346
similar design than this one with additional lines, not only parallel to the long

172
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:02,600
side, but also perpendicular to it, because it enables to

173
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,570
make graphic constructions in a quicker and more comfortable way.

174
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,358
This set square should be at least

175
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,416
fifteen centimeters long, so you can

176
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,627
work comfortably. 

177
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:17,240
You will also need a ruler, about 30 centimeters long.

178
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,390
A calculator will also be useful, but a very simple one with only four operations is enough.

179
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,090
You will soon discover that red and blue colors are very

180
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,028
important in this course, soI suggest you to buy either a

181
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:30,857
red pencil and a blue pencil, or one of these accountants' pencils,

182
00:10:30,857 --> 00:10:34,415
like the one I have here, which combines the blue and the red.

183
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:37,670
And then, a pencil and an eraser will obviously be useful.

184
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,958
You will have eight exercises to perform. The exercises will be located on the website

185
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:44,493
i-structures, which will enable an automatic correction,

186
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:47,116
but you will access them from Coursera.

187
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:50,661
I have to say that these exercises, compared to other exercises that

188
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:54,594
you have maybe seen within the framework of Coursera or of another online course,

189
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:58,600
do not give you a feedback, or just a very little feedback

190
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,738
on your work. They will only 

191
00:11:00,738 --> 00:11:03,114
save your answers, and then, when the exercise

192
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:05,432
will be corrected, you will be able to see the correction,

193
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,940
but there is no intermediate indications,

194
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,118
save for a little colored indicator

195
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:13,609
which fades from black to deep green,

196
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:16,694
passing through red and yellow,

197
00:11:16,694 --> 00:11:20,138
green being positive and red less positive.

198
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,707
This small indicator, even if it is not very accurate,

199
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:24,600
will inform you a little bit about where you are.  

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,172
These exercises have to be submitted respecting the due dates which

201
00:11:28,172 --> 00:11:31,896
will be indicated. A very accurate correction will 

202
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:35,165
be made, and you will get, I don't know, forty-eight marks

203
00:11:35,165 --> 00:11:40,207
from sixty-five for the exercise, and then, this score will be transformed into a

204
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:45,705
grade between zero, the worst grade, and three, the best one.

205
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,988
Then, at the end of the semester, the arithmetic mean of all

206
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:53,652
exercises will be done and everyone who reaches a grade of two on average,

207
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:57,274
will obtain a certificate for this course, and everyone who will reaches

208
00:11:57,274 --> 00:12:01,070
a two point five grade will obtain a certificate with distinction.

209
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,268
This concludes this first video of the course

210
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:08,079
L'Art des Structures. Welcome and good luck !

211
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,686
I advise you to start watching 

212
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:14,241
the next videos to start on the course material.
