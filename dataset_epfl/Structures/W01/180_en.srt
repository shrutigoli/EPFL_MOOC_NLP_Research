00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,614
Hello. In this video, I am going to show you

2
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:12,160
how to activate and to use the applet i-Cremona which is a program that

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,310
we are going to use throughout this course to

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:19,660
have interactions dealing with graphical statics.

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,460
i-Cremona is a Java applet, that is to say

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,835
a small program which executes inside

7
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,830
an Internet browser.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:33,410
Most the usual browsers like Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,695
Explorer, Opera and so forth, support the use of the Java applets.

10
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:41,260
Although we are going to see later that it is necessary to activate them.

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,336
However, and it is a bad news, most of the mobile platforms, whether

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,846
it be cellphones or tablets working under IOS as well as

13
00:00:50,846 --> 00:00:55,370
under Androïd, do not support the use of Java applets.

14
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,731
To use these applets, and it is a significant

15
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:05,015
part of the course's exercises, you will have to have access

16
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:10,245
to a classic computer like a PC, a Mac, or a Linux workstation to

17
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:15,230
be able to use a complete version of these browsers

18
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,202
which can host

19
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:20,670
a compatible Java virtual machine.

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,652
I am going to show you soon how to proceed.

21
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:26,421
Once we will have activated the applet, I will

22
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:31,500
show you how we can use the main commands to

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,688
save the documents, to add forces and divers

24
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:39,570
other elements inside, in relation to a structure. 

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,410
Generally, in the Art of Structures

26
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,659
course, you will access an applet through a link

27
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,359
which will be given to you for example in an exercise or in a lecture. 

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,106
When you follow this link, you arrive on a page where normally the applet

29
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,908
should appear. If you arrive on a such page with this

30
00:01:59,908 --> 00:02:05,120
typical pink rectangle, it means that on the computer that you use,

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,790
either Java is not installed, either it is not activated.

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:17,720
In this case, you can follow the link which is proposed to you. Normally, here, on the right, in the

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,418
window, you should have a yellow window.

34
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:22,802
If it is pink again, it means that

35
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:25,508
there is no installed Java virtual machine at all. 

36
00:02:25,508 --> 00:02:28,048
You then have to go on the website of Oracle to 

37
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:31,850
install a virtual machine which corresponds to

38
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,050
your platform whether it be Windows, Mac OS or the diverse versions of Linux.

39
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,130
Once again, it will not be possible

40
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,860
for a tablet or a cellphone, or at the least

41
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,974
for the models which are common in 2013 when I record this video.

42
00:02:48,974 --> 00:02:52,503
When I have activated Java in my browser, I can 

43
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:56,796
now, directly clicking on the link, start the applet.

44
00:02:56,796 --> 00:03:00,348
Note that I receive here a security

45
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:03,300
warning telling me that I am going to execute an applet.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,080
Why this ?

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,010
Because there have been quite important security problems linked to Java

48
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,946
the last few years and since then, the browsers give

49
00:03:11,946 --> 00:03:16,973
different kinds of warnings, here we can see the one of Internet

50
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:21,115
Explorer on a PC, but there are different kinds

51
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:24,993
of warnings which encourage us not to use the Java applets.

52
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,273
In the present case, we want to do it, we can trust

53
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:32,284
the Java applet i-Cremona, but it's a question of accepting the risk.

54
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:33,406
We can also,

55
00:03:33,406 --> 00:03:37,445
without any troubles, accept not to see anymore this warning 

56
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:40,780
thereafter, since we will quite often start this applet.

57
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,492
Once we have done this, the Java applet appears

58
00:03:43,492 --> 00:03:46,222
with its work zone which is here framed

59
00:03:46,222 --> 00:03:51,430
in gray with a series of buttons, here on the top, which we are going to look at later.

60
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,068
A work zone on the middle and

61
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:55,940
an input zone which we are going to use very soon.

62
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,592
On the top-left corner, you can find a button to open

63
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,204
a file. 

64
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:02,706
Actually, we are not going to use this very often since generally we

65
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:06,640
will open a file following a link from an exercise.

66
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,236
The save button is however very important because it

67
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:13,974
will enable us to keep the work we have done.

68
00:04:13,974 --> 00:04:16,319
I am going to give you a very quick example.

69
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,830
Here, using the button "force", we can introduce

70
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,613
two forces here and we are going to push the "save" button.

71
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:28,279
Let's say that we have thereafter to stop our work on the exercise. 

72
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,887
No problem, we can close the applet and when we will 

73
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,450
open it again, we will find again in the environment

74
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,530
both arrows that we had introduced. 

75
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,310
Well, I want to quickly delete them so I click on the arrow and I click on the

76
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,520
x to take it off and I am going to explain you

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,165
a little bit more how to introduce a force.

78
00:04:47,165 --> 00:04:49,644
OK, I click on this button which stays down

79
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:54,812
and black, and then, on the bottom, a text area appears with

80
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:59,398
on the left, one hundred, on the middle, less than and on the right, minus ninety.

81
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:03,900
What does it mean ? Well, the "one hundred" is the amplitude of the force which

82
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,384
we are going to introduce, the "less than", symbolizes an angle and 

83
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:14,833
the "minus ninety", indicates that we are going to get a force

84
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:17,424
which will point in the orientation minus

85
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:19,666
ninety degrees when counterclockwise.

86
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,045
Then, when we use the counterclockwise orientation, horizontally 

87
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:23,865
to the right it is zero, vertically

88
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,860
upwards it is ninety degrees, vertically downwards it is minus ninety.

89
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,005
If I want now to introduce a force of only 10 Newtons then

90
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:37,985
I edit this field and I can directly introduce this force.

91
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,037
If I put the cursor on the force,

92
00:05:40,037 --> 00:05:43,001
it shows indeed with its amplitude

93
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:45,063
of ten and its orientation ninety.

94
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:47,690
Note that it has exactly the same size than

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,670
the force of one hundred I had introduced before.

96
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:51,230
Why ?

97
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,320
Because the applet will automatically scale the first

98
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,110
force that you introduce to have this size on the screen.

99
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,894
If I introduce a second force which has

100
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,074
an amplitude of twenty Newtons, it

101
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:11,753
is clearly going to be longer and if I introduce a third force with only

102
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:18,800
five Newtons, it will be smaller.

103
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,750
If I want to move one of these forces, I can grasp it anywhere or

104
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,150
particularly by the little ball which is at the lower end

105
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,830
of the arrow and I can move it.

106
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,090
Let's say that I am going to place

107
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,865
these three arrows on top of each other.

108
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:35,420
The three forces.

109
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,585
Notice that when I move it, I can see the line of action

110
00:06:40,585 --> 00:06:44,070
of the force, which enable me to work with quite great precision.

111
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,014
If I want to change the amplitude of a force, I can go at

112
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:55,940
the other end of the force and choose, to change its amplitude, there we go.

113
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,118
That is what I have done here.

114
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,660
If I click again on this force, I can see that

115
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:05,420
now it has an amplitude of 35.5 and that it points at minus 119 degrees. 

116
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,150
If I want to delete a force as you have seen before, I simply click,

117
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,495
once it is selected, and we see it

118
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:14,590
in pink, I click on the "delete" button.

119
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,374
If I want to select several forces, I can do it.

120
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:20,970
For that, I click on the button "control", do it rather with the keyboard but

121
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,614
here I do it with this button on the mouse, and afterwards I can move them

122
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:32,535
simultaneously or for example modify them making them turn like here.

123
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,986
If I stop pressing "control", I

124
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:40,644
can also make change the amplitude of the forces,

125
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:46,090
delete them at the same time. Here we have a button "support"

126
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,769
which we will use to represent the supports

127
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,263
when we will arrive there in the structures course.

128
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,318
We can introduce at most two supports and like for

129
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:59,230
forces, if we select them, we can delete them.

130
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,004
There is also a tool which enable us to draw a free-body.

131
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:09,440
Then, I draw my free-body here in a quite simple way.

132
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,210
Once the free-body is created,

133
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,772
we can move it for it to

134
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,257
correspond exactly to what we want. 

135
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:19,613
And then if we are patient, we can move and activate when we are 

136
00:08:19,613 --> 00:08:22,563
individual points of the free-body, which we make appear

137
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:24,687
as intermediary points. They are

138
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,628
used for the drawing of the free-body and you

139
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,360
can see that with this, we can improve the shape,

140
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,150
that we have given to our free-body, if

141
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,730
we want to get something more accurate. 

142
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:45,050
Please do not hesitate to delete your free-body and draw it again

143
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,780
more accurately because it is maybe easier

144
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,560
to draw it again in the good way the second time.

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,320
A button which is also very important withing the framework of the applet is

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,616
the button which is always above the applet, with the label "reset".

147
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:01,780
When we click on "reset", we

148
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,305
exactly get back where we started from at the beginning of the exercise.

149
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:08,605
It is something which is very recommended, why ?

150
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,530
Because the activities that you will do

151
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,930
within the applet are generally very short.

152
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,629
A couple of minutes at most and once you have understood what

153
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,167
you have to do, maybe there will be something that does not work

154
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:21,566
well but you have understood thus it is often easier to reset

155
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,820
the applet and to do over everything we asked you to do.

156
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,884
So, here you have on the right a

157
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:30,760
button to replace the control key, to replace the

158
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,396
shift key and to replace the alt key of the keyboard.

159
00:09:34,396 --> 00:09:38,920
When you hold them down, do not forget to inactivate them afterwards because

160
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,105
otherwise, there will be secondary effects a little bit everywhere. 

161
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:45,305
These two buttons here allow you to introduce

162
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:48,210
either red lines, or blue lines.

163
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,206
These lines are really, completely

164
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:52,880
free.

165
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,390
They look like a free-body, and work a little bit in the same

166
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,455
manner, that is to say that if you want to edit it

167
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,919
you go to the end of this line,

168
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,824
there will be a little ball which is going to form and then we will be able to edit

169
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:13,136
and create drawings which combine blue elements and red elements.

170
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:17,560
For some operations, we will ask you 

171
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,817
to create this kind of drawing to indicate where there is

172
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:25,993
tension and where there is compression in a given structure.

173
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:29,326
Finally, here this button of help activates the online help.

174
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:33,930
It is essential to allow the website i-structure

175
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,985
to display pop-ups for this to work.

176
00:10:38,985 --> 00:10:41,875
The first time, it is not going to work. 

177
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,660
We are going to make

178
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,780
reappear the applet and then, it is necessary to have

179
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,098
saved your work,

180
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:51,477
otherwise we would have problems, but the second

181
00:10:51,477 --> 00:10:53,442
time, the online help is going to appear and for

182
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,298
example, here we can go to the online

183
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:58,900
help which explains how to create a free-body,

184
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,238
how to modify it, how to delete it, and the all of the functions

185
00:11:02,238 --> 00:11:04,730
of the applet are described in the online help.

186
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,620
The last button that I want to show you

187
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,864
here is the background image.

188
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:13,119
The background image is what you see in the applet.

189
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:17,540
You will sometimes have a photo, you will have a little drawing, a sketch, etc.

190
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,870
We can make it disappear by clicking on this button.

191
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,643
If you have been worried, "But, I do not see anything

192
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:26,793
anymore !", click on this button and generally, the background image will reappear.

193
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:29,336
Another reason for which the drawing

194
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:32,960
can disappear is because you will have zoomed too much.

195
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:39,310
Here, I click on "zoom" and I zoom around the point where I am.

196
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,715
If I want to unzoom, I have to click in the same time

197
00:11:43,715 --> 00:11:47,757
on "shift" and then now, I am dezooming.

198
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:53,420
If I click on "control", I can pan the zoom. 

199
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,380
Most of you, at the least

200
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,460
if you have a computer will prefer to use

201
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:02,711
the scroll function of the middle wheel and to point, by clicking on the middle button. This enables to

202
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:06,800
do that much more easily than what I do with the applet.

203
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,230
However, sometimes there are secondary effects regarding

204
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,270
the environment which can be a little bit complicated.

205
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:20,110
Do not forget to click again on the zoom button to deactivate this mode at the end.

206
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,490
To conclude,

207
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,458
I want to summarize the buttons that we have see in the applet and their main

208
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:32,791
functions. This first button here, it is open a

209
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:41,195
file, it is relatively classic. But actually, it is rarely used.

210
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:45,470
As I said it, generally you will open a file through a link.

211
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,046
This button, however, it is used to save

212
00:12:54,215 --> 00:12:59,508
and it is very important. This button enables

213
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:03,780
to activate or to deactivate

214
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:08,840
the background image. It is

215
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,014
also an important function, especially if

216
00:13:14,014 --> 00:13:19,320
you lose the background image. This button enables you to zoom

217
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,052
or unzoom using the shift key or to

218
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:30,680
move using the control key. This button enables to introduce a support.

219
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,956
We will see later what a support is.

220
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:35,820
This button enables you to introduce a force.

221
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,270
We have seen that we can specify the amplitude and the orientation of the force

222
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,790
or that we can change it interactively at a later time.

223
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,986
This button enables

224
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:50,660
you to draw a free-body.

225
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,360
These two buttons, here, enable you to introduce red

226
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,100
lines, respectively

227
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,196
blue lines which represent lines in tension and in

228
00:14:06,196 --> 00:14:10,497
compression. This button, here, enables to delete a force

229
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:14,742
or a support or a free-body. And then finally,

230
00:14:14,742 --> 00:14:19,086
here, these buttons here are buttons equivalent to keyboards button which

231
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:23,445
reproduce the functions of the control,

232
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:27,912
shift an alt keys. Finally, here, very important,

233
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:35,944
this button enables you to have access to the online help, which I recommend you

234
00:14:35,944 --> 00:14:40,780
to use to get more information about the applet.

235
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,270
During this lecture, we have seen the principle of activation

236
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,872
of the Java applet i-Cremona which is used within the framework of this course of structure.

237
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:55,822
We have seen how to open and save

238
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:59,120
an applet's file with data inside.

239
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,042
We have seen how to introduce

240
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,100
forces and supports

241
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,110
We have also seen how to introduce a

242
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,636
free-body and how to use the online help.
