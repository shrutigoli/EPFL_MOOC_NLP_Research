00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,652
Hello, in this video, we will see the

2
00:00:07,652 --> 00:00:09,964
concepts of internal force and of stress which

3
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:12,276
will enable us to understand what

4
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:15,490
happens inside the components of a structure.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,691
On the basis of the example of a person,

6
00:00:17,691 --> 00:00:20,318
standing on a stool, we will see how

7
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:22,235
the weight of this person is in

8
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,271
equilibrium with the gravitational force that this

9
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,290
person exerts on Earth, through the stool.

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,620
In this video, I stand up on a stool.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,440
My weight of 800 Newtons is not directly borne by the ground anymore. 

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,470
It is obvious that I still exert a gravitational

13
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,964
force on Earth of 800 Newtons too.

14
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:43,330
Then, these two forces must be in equilibrium.

15
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,118
But now, between us, there is the stool.

16
00:00:46,118 --> 00:00:50,293
In order to sketch rather than to look at myself on the stool, we can

17
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,742
simply, sketch. 

18
00:00:51,742 --> 00:00:56,533
I am standing, on the stool which is directly standing, on Earth.

19
00:00:56,533 --> 00:01:02,890
Acts on me, my weight, a gravitational force of 800 Newtons.

20
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,616
Acts on Earth, the gravitational force that I exert on

21
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:11,430
Earth, which is equal and opposite, of 800 Newtons.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,406
And now, what interests us in this lecture, is what 

23
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:18,424
happens, is what happens inside the stool ?

24
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:21,360
To answer this, we are going to isolate three free-bodies.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:31,110
One for the man, one for Earth.

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,615
Well, it is not complete, but we include all Earth below. 

27
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:38,718
And then, finally, one for the stool.

28
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,510
The forces that we

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:46,630
already know, are the weight of the person, 800 Newtons, and the gravitational

30
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:52,490
force that the man exerts on Earth, of 800 Newtons as well.

31
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,934
For that free-body "man" to be in equilibrium,

32
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:59,223
it is necessary that the stool exerts on him,

33
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:01,517
a force equal and opposite to his weight

34
00:02:01,517 --> 00:02:04,180
of 800 Newtons, and on the same line of action.

35
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,920
Thus,

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,285
we have, here, 800 Newtons which are

37
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:14,946
the stool's effect on

38
00:02:14,946 --> 00:02:19,788
the man. Likewise, below the stool,

39
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:24,691
we must have a force of 800 Newtons

40
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:30,030
which is the effect of the stool on the Earth.

41
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,190
Our two free-bodies of the man and of the Earth are now in equilibrium,

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,330
and now we have to deal with the free-body of the stool.

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,969
The stool is subjected to a

44
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:52,130
force of 800 Newtons which is the effect of the man on the stool.

45
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,002
And then, below,

46
00:02:54,002 --> 00:02:59,388
also to a force of 800 Newtons which is the effect 

47
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:04,675
of the Earth on the stool. If we disregard, what

48
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:09,670
is a reasonable hypothesis, the weight of the stool,

49
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:14,644
we can see that the stool, which has no weight, is nevertheless

50
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:19,750
subjected to forces which pass through it. These forces, inside

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,320
a structure, we call them internal forces. 

52
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,849
This is the way I give you the following definition : an internal force is

53
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:34,100
a force inside

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:40,220
a structure. And, to be able to see

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,240
this force, it is necessary to use a free-body.

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,456
Then, we say that it is... this force is

57
00:03:50,456 --> 00:03:54,331
revealed by the cut of a

58
00:03:54,331 --> 00:04:02,300
free-body. Looking at an example,

59
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,031
hum, of a man who is now on the top of a column. 

60
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:11,770
His weight is still 800 Newtons. And if we draw

61
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:17,430
a free-body which passes just under his feet,

62
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,910
it is obvious that, there must be an internal force in the column, of 800

63
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,390
Newtons, upwards, for the the man to be in equilibrium. 

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,556
Thereafter, once again, we are going to... it is a little bit

65
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:33,064
less easy to admit, but we are going to do it anyway.

66
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:39,320
We are going to disregard the weight of the column.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,931
If I take a free-body, in the middle of the column,

68
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,168
and there is no force inside the free-body since we disregard the weight

69
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:01,337
of the column. However, acts on the top of the column, an

70
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:08,134
internal force of 800 Newtons which is the effect of the man on the column.

71
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:12,082
And then, below our piece of column, we also

72
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:17,571
have an internal force of 800 Newtons which

73
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:22,360
is the effect of the ground on the column further to the person's weight.

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,202
The internal force, inside this component, which we

75
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:30,870
draw in blue, is a compressive internal force.

76
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:36,282
And conventionally, now, and for the rest of this course, the compression

77
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:41,690
will always be drawn in blue, and will always be negative.

78
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,203
It is a convention,

79
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:46,230
but it is important, and we will stick to it.

80
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,396
How to know, if an internal force which acts in a free-body is compressive ? 

81
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:58,090
Well, we observe that, a compressive internal force

82
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,290
pushes

83
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,053
on the free-body. Let's look at

84
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:12,226
the element of column once again, on which

85
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:17,970
acts a compressive internal force of 800 Newtons,

86
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:32,050
which we denote by the letter N. We have here, N equal to minus 800 Newtons.

87
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,770
When I draw the force which acts on the subsystem, I do not need

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:44,257
to indicate a minus sign, since if the force pushes, it is compressive.

89
00:06:44,257 --> 00:06:46,420
It is then, a minus sign, automatically.

90
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,006
This internal force acts

91
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:52,920
on the surface of the column, which we call its section.

92
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,078
The section, it is the surface of the

93
00:06:55,078 --> 00:06:58,715
column, when we cut it perpendicularly to its axis.

94
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:03,310
Here, we denote this section by the letter A.

95
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,153
And it is expressed in units of area, typically, in square millimeters. 

96
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:10,177
Of course, it could be square meters, or something else.

97
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:12,410
But, it is very often square millimeters.

98
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,290
We want,

99
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,790
now, to introduce the definition of the stress, as being

100
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,578
the internal force per unit of area. If we take a little element of 

101
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:28,500
column, we recognize it, and if we say that it has an area

102
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,540
equal to 1, a unit surface. Then, we can define the

103
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:39,230
stress, as the internal force,

104
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,570
per unit of area.

105
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,565
We denote the stress by the greek letter sigma, and we write,

106
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:57,260
then, sigma equal to N, the internal force, divided by the area.

107
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,511
On this small element, we have a stress which pushes on the element. 

108
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:06,295
This is a compressive stress.

109
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:16,929
And it is also negative per convention.

110
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,206
You probably wonder if it happens 

111
00:08:24,206 --> 00:08:26,800
to get positive internal forces and stresses.

112
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,194
And the answer is yes.

113
00:08:28,194 --> 00:08:30,940
It happens when an element is in tension.

114
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,440
Here, I have a free-body of a window cleaner hung up to a cable.

115
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,040
We disregard the weight

116
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,358
of the cable which extends below the

117
00:08:42,358 --> 00:08:45,940
window cleaner, which is, probably, very low.

118
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:53,530
And, we notice that for this man... let's say that his weight is still 800 Newtons.

119
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,953
For him to be in equilibrium, it is necessary that acts on the free-body,

120
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:05,862
an internal force N, equal and opposite, thus of 800 Newtons

121
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:10,434
upwards. If I take, now, a

122
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:15,725
free-body of the cable in the part, above the

123
00:09:15,725 --> 00:09:20,830
window cleaner. We have, acting on this element,

124
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,765
we have, acting on this element of cable, an internal force N of

125
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:31,064
800 Newtons, upwards, and downwards

126
00:09:31,064 --> 00:09:37,189
on his lower end. We draw, in

127
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:43,574
this section, the tension in

128
00:09:43,574 --> 00:09:50,435
red. And, the tension is positive. 

129
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:55,890
How do we know if an internal force is tensile ?

130
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,286
Well,

131
00:09:56,286 --> 00:10:00,772
in a very similar way than what we have seen about the compression, an

132
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:05,538
internal force of

133
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:12,310
tension pulls

134
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,510
on the free-body.

135
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,915
And thus 

136
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:28,305
the tensile stress

137
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,710
is also positive.

138
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,340
If we consider a little element of cable : sigma

139
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,448
equal to N over A. Since N is positive, sigma will be positive. 

140
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,150
In this lecture, we have seen how to pass

141
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:56,720
from the loads to the internal forces, and from the internal forces to the stresses.

142
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,700
Internal forces are

143
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,717
forces which act inside elements of structure.

144
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:08,120
And stresses are internal forces per unit of area.

145
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,418
Compressive internal forces occur

146
00:11:11,418 --> 00:11:14,556
when a force pushes on the free-body.

147
00:11:14,556 --> 00:11:19,638
Tensile internal forces occur when a force pulls on the free-body.
