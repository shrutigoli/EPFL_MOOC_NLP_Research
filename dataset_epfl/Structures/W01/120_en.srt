00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,015
Hello.

2
00:00:05,015 --> 00:00:08,700
In this video, we will review rapidly the principles of universal

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,124
gravitation and we will see how it applies to gravitation on earth.

4
00:00:14,124 --> 00:00:16,972
We will see the effect of masses

5
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:20,905
of the bodies, their distance, we will look

6
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,439
at what is gravitation

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,802
on the Earth and finally we will make some considerations

8
00:00:25,802 --> 00:00:29,470
on the units of force that will be used throughout this course.

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,255
Let's first consider the case of universal gravitation as it

10
00:00:34,255 --> 00:00:40,421
applies, for example, between a Sun of mass m2 and a planet,

11
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:46,062
the Earth for instance, with a mass m1. The forces

12
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:51,118
always act along the

13
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:56,347
axis which links the centers of gravity of the two celestial

14
00:00:56,347 --> 00:01:01,374
bodies. On the body with mass m2

15
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:06,333
acts a force F 1 2 due to body number 2,

16
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:11,277
likewise, on the body with

17
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:16,308
mass m1 acts a force F 2 1 which is due to

18
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:18,310
body number 2.

19
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,513
Universal gravitation tells us that this force F 1 2 is

20
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:29,426
equal to force F 2 1 and that it is opposed to it,

21
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:35,004
with a value of G times the product of

22
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:40,818
the two masses m1 and m2, divided by the distance between the two bodies to the square.

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,915
Constant G is called the universal gravitation constant.

24
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,440
Its value is 6.67 times ten

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,696
to the minus eleventh power with units cubic meter

26
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:28,400
divided by kilogram and seconds to the square.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,912
So, this allows us

28
00:02:29,912 --> 00:02:32,369
to determine, for example, the force

29
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:35,183
that the Earth exerts on the Sun or vice-versa,

30
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:37,410
the force that the Sun exerts on the Earth.

31
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,948
In this course, we are more interested in what happens

32
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:43,453
on the Earth, so we will now look at

33
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:46,243
this case, which is closer to us.

34
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:52,631
We still have a large mass m2, which is the mass of the Earth,

35
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:58,854
and a smaller mass m2, which is the mass of a person standing on the Earth.

36
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:02,300
The forces in presence act like before

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,606
along the axis that connects the center of gravity of the person to the center

38
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:12,915
of gravity of the Earth. We have force F 1 2 which the

39
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:18,081
body #1 exerts on mass 2 and the force

40
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:22,808
F 2 1 which the Earth exerts on the person. It must be noted

41
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:27,602
that we generally do not notice that the force, the gravitational

42
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:31,740
force which acts on a body is in direction of the center of the Earth. We

43
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,690
rather think, and this

44
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,470
is also true, that it acts vertically, downwards.

45
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,655
But when we say downwards, actually, we need to look not just to

46
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:43,530
the ground, we have to see that this force acts up to the center of the Earth. 

47
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,260
Then, what is the value of this force if we consider a person of mass m1 ? 

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,640
Let's regroup the constant terms together. F2 1 is equal to G, the universal 

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,488
gravitation constant, which is obviously constant, multiplied by

50
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:00,160
the mass of Earth, which is also constant,

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,200
divided by the distance between both centers of gravity.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:12,083
This distance is equal to the Earth's radius plus roughly

53
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:17,663
one half the height of the man. When we consider that the radius of 

54
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:22,336
Earth is more than six millions of meters, we can see that adding one

55
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:26,169
meter, maximum one point two meters, is not going to change very much.

56
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,962
Thus we can consider that the distance between both bodies is simply r, where

57
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:38,242
r is the Earth's radius, multiplied by the mass m1 which is variable.

58
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:42,925
If we regroup all these elements together and if we take their numerical value,

59
00:04:42,925 --> 00:04:47,245
we will then get the universal gravitation constant, 6.67 times ten

60
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:52,259
power minus eleven times the mass of Earth 5.985 times ten

61
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,408
power twenty four kilograms divided

62
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:03,250
by 6378000

63
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,420
meters, to square. If we calculate

64
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,799
this, we get the value of 9.81 with units

65
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:18,679
meter per second squared

66
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:23,674
and this is a constant which we call g, which is

67
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:28,670
the terrestrial gravitation constant.

68
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:41,188
You can then express again the force F2 1 which

69
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:46,090
acts on the man by g times m1.

70
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,955
We also notice that g is approximately equal to 10, 9.81, there is a 

71
00:05:51,955 --> 00:06:00,870
little error, but for this course we will consider that g is equal to 10 and thus the effect,

72
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:06,000
the force F2 1 is equal to 10 times m1. If we consider a person with a mass

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,830
of 80 kilograms and if we multiply this mass by 10, we obtain the force

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,855
F2 1 which isbe equal to 800 kilograms times

75
00:06:15,855 --> 00:06:20,986
meters per second squared. This entity, kilograms times 

76
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:26,308
meters per second squared, is a new unit of measure which

77
00:06:26,308 --> 00:06:30,822
we will call the Newton, with N as symbol.

78
00:06:30,822 --> 00:06:34,580
This is the unit of measure of force that we will use

79
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,630
mostly in this course. One Newton is the gravitational force

80
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:44,226
corresponding to a mass of one hundred grams. It is a rather small value.

81
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:51,500
We will often work with the kiloNewton, which is equal

82
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,592
to one thousand Newtons, that is to say the gravitational force

83
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:02,448
of one hundred kilograms, or even with the megaNewton, which is

84
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:07,738
equal to one million of Newtons, that is to say the gravitational force

85
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:12,850
of one hundred tons, this is the weight of a big locomotive.

86
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,958
In this lecture, using the principles of universal gravitation, 

87
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:21,985
we expressed the bases of gravitation on Earth. 

88
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:25,087
We have seen that the terrestrial acceleration constant

89
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:29,590
g is approximately equal to ten meters per second squared.

90
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,019
We have seen that the forces which are exerted will be expressed

91
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:40,401
in Newton, respectively in kiloNewton and megaNewton.
