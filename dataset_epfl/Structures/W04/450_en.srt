00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,164
Hello, in this video, we are going

2
00:00:06,164 --> 00:00:11,742
to see how to use the applet i-Cremona to obtain, in the same way that we 

3
00:00:11,742 --> 00:00:16,288
obtained them with the graphical statics, the internal forces in a

4
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:21,345
cable subjected to a load, as well as the forces at the supports.

5
00:00:21,345 --> 00:00:23,403
So, we will successively see how to introduce a 

6
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:25,419
load, this, you have already done it, how to introduce

7
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,020
a support, you have also already done it.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,970
Then, we will see how to activate the funicular polygon

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,465
and how to control it, that is to say to give it the proper geometry.

10
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:38,690
Then, we will see how to read with the applet,

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,610
the internal forces which act on the structure.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,690
In this applet, we have, as background, the 

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,210
configuration of the cable with a centered load in the middle.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,300
We introduce

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,440
both supports, one on the left, the other one on the right.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,810
Let's try to accurately place them where the real supports are

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,240
and we introduce, as a force, in the middle, a load of 10 Newtons.

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,064
We can place it a little bit above the chain, we can

19
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:12,460
place it below the chain, we can place it in a symmetric way.

20
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,540
Anyway, when we move a load on its line

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,310
of action, it does not have any influence on the solving.

22
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,980
We now activate the button "funicular polygon" of the applet

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,540
to activate the automatic solving, by the Cremona method.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,280
By default, the resolution starts from the first

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
support which we have introduced, it is the support here, on the left,

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,235
the one which, in our case, has a small

27
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:40,735
vertical line, the other support does not have any small vertical line

28
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:45,118
inside. That is from this support that the

29
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,196
slope is defined at 45 degrees by default in the applet.

30
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:54,146
Obviously, this is not that slope which interests us here.

31
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:57,060
So, we are going to use this button, the red ball,

32
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,420
which has the function to define the initial tangent.

33
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,730
We click once on this button, it stays pushed down, you can see, it has a gray tint.

34
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,900
Then, we come

35
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,754
here on the polygon, we click on it, we keep the

36
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:14,210
button of the mouse pushed down, and we can now move the polygon, and

37
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,674
you can see that we can move it until it is

38
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:24,058
exactly superimposed on the chain that we had on the blackboard.

39
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:27,730
You can see on the right, the Cremona diagram

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,030
which has been materialized, we recognize 

41
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,886
the force of 10 Newtons, both internal forces of roughly 7 Newtons.

42
00:02:34,886 --> 00:02:39,990
If we place the cursor on the intersection of both segments, we can see, in yellow,

43
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,970
the solving which enlightens on the right part,

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,620
that is to say, the three internal forces or forces which correspond to this configuration.

45
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:56,066
If, on the contrary, we place the cursor approximately in the middle of the segment between the support and

46
00:02:56,066 --> 00:03:01,034
the first load, we can see that, on the right, this force enlightens in yellow,

47
00:03:01,034 --> 00:03:06,054
and, its magnitude, which is not exactly 7, as we had it in

48
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:11,312
the accurate solving, but 6.81 and 6.96 on the right.

49
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:15,190
This is a small uncertainty but

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,500
which is not a particular problem.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,226
We can, for example, make a parametric study,

52
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:23,775
that is to say that we are going to add a second load of 10 Newtons.

53
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,070
So, you can see that now, in the construction,

54
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,870
there are two loads on top of each other.

55
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,130
And, the internal force is now equal to 13, roughly 14

56
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,270
Newtons, which corresponds to what we have already seen.

57
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,820
In this configuration, we have as background, 

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,370
the configuration of cable with an inclined and eccentric load.

59
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,289
We introduce

60
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,777
both supports, as usually. A load of 10

61
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:56,160
Newtons, which we position somewhere on the line of action of the force.

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,830
We now have to make it rotate.

63
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,470
If we activate the button "control" and if we grasp

64
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,516
the tail of the force, we can

65
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,380
rotate it without changing its magnitude and then, we

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,486
line it up quite well on the line of action which

67
00:04:10,486 --> 00:04:12,044
we wanted to get.

68
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:15,460
We now activate the funicular polygon.

69
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,307
We must deactivate the button "control", otherwise we

70
00:04:18,307 --> 00:04:21,470
will have some troubles. We click on the button "funicular

71
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,544
polygon" and on the button "initial tangent" to give

72
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:30,189
to our cable, the exact shape which we were looking for.

73
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:35,713
And we obtain the internal forces, on the left of 4.4, it was 4.5 before

74
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,270
if I remember well and of 8.47 instead of 8.5.

75
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,430
So, it also works very well, like the various other functionalities. 

76
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,214
In this video, we have seen how

77
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:51,390
to use the applet i-Cremona to obtain the internal forces

78
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,679
in a cable with a load, whether it

79
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:56,514
be vertical or inclined, or whether it be centered of eccentric. 

80
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,467
We have seen how to introduce the

81
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:01,047
fixed supports, how to introduce the load,

82
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:05,073
how to rotate the load for it to corresponds to what we want to do and

83
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:07,610
we have also seen how to activate the

84
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,660
funicular polygon and how to control its geometry.
