1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,617
In this lecture dedicated to cables, we are going to

2
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:10,500
start to study real structures, entire real structures.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,200
As in the case of the Golden Gate

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,500
bridge in San Francisco, that you see, here.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,549
We have for example, the load-bearing cable.

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:20,080
It has more or less a parabolic shape, with vertical cables.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,115
That is what we call hangers,

8
00:00:22,115 --> 00:00:24,160
which have the function to hang up the deck.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,344
We have here,

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,240
of course, similar structures, as buildings.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,360
What you can see here, it is a roof, in Lisbon.

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,180
At first sight, it is very different.

13
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,312
In reality, regarding the functioning,

14
00:00:37,312 --> 00:00:39,444
it is very similar to the bridge of San Francisco.

15
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:43,768
That is to say, we have a reinforced concrete surface, which has approximately the same

16
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:47,168
shape than the load-bearing cable of San Francisco,

17
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:50,518
and which we can also study it exactly 

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,750
the same way.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,766
We can also arrange cables in

20
00:00:53,766 --> 00:00:56,470
space, as in this example, in Munich.

21
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,930
We have, here, two categories of cables, in reality.

22
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:03,010
We have load-bearing cables, which have the same

23
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,255
shape than in the case of the Golden Gate, again.

24
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:09,665
But, we also have cables which have a downwards curvature.

25
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:12,745
They have the function to stabilize the structure.

26
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:15,823
So, to stabilize the cable, it is

27
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:18,816
an interesting problem which

28
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:21,800
we are also going to study in this lecture.

29
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,930
We can also arrange cables with other elements.

30
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,632
In the case that you can see here, we have

31
00:01:27,632 --> 00:01:30,758
for example, elements in compression in addition to the cables.

32
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,828
That is a roof, which has, on the

33
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,057
drawing, if we look at its lower part,

34
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:38,225
we can see immediately that we

35
00:01:38,225 --> 00:01:41,095
have, one more time, a shape and an element

36
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:46,110
which works in a similar way than the one of the load-bearing cable of the Golden Gate.

37
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,986
We start by the cables, also because they are relatively simple to

38
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:55,040
study using models, for example, as you can see here.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,360
We can easily understand the functioning, and we

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,769
can even study interesting particularities of the cables.

41
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:05,693
We are also going, of course,

42
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:08,410
to study the functioning, by way

43
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,050
of graphical statics, which will also enable us

44
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,537
to determine the internal forces that we can

45
00:02:13,537 --> 00:02:17,240
within these types of structures.
