00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,095
Hello, this

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:10,190
video is dedicated to the method of the auxiliary cable which will enable us,

3
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,310
on the one hand, to directly and freely calculate the shape of a cable,

4
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:20,407
and on the other hand, to obtain, without needing

5
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:25,165
a model, the position and the magnitude of the resultant of a

6
00:00:25,165 --> 00:00:28,035
system of arbitrary forces, and particularly of

7
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,926
forces which are parallel one to each other.

8
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,204
We will see that the method of the auxiliary

9
00:00:33,204 --> 00:00:36,901
cable enables us to determine the shape of a cable.

10
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,773
We will see how to construct the auxiliary cable,

11
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:44,831
what are the arbitrary choices that we have to make to

12
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:47,798
be able to make this construction, and finally,

13
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,754
we will see how to use this construction

14
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:54,580
to obtain the position of the resultant of a system of forces.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,394
In this video, you recognize the system with two loads.

16
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:04,016
We now add a red chain on

17
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:07,790
which we hang up two weights in its middle.

18
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,206
We can note that the red chain and the white chain are perfectly

19
00:01:11,206 --> 00:01:13,402
superimposed, on the left and right

20
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:15,765
parts, between the support and the first force,

21
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:18,295
respectively between the last force and the support.

22
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:20,770
However, in the middle, the shape is different.

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,178
We can see how to solve these systems.

24
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:27,150
I am not going to take lots of time to

25
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,100
do that, because we already did it several times before.

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,450
For the system on the top, we have

27
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,100
two loads, a load of 10 Newtons

28
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,288
which is in equilibrium with a horizontal

29
00:01:47,288 --> 00:01:54,142
internal force and an internal force which goes up towards the

30
00:01:54,142 --> 00:02:00,915
left. So, we have these internal forces.

31
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,967
We could read their value, but we have

32
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:06,150
already determined them another time before, thus, it will not be necessary.

33
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,710
Thereafter, on the right part, we also have 10

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,732
Newtons, and

35
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:21,450
we have

36
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,198
obtained the internal forces in the segments, on the left and on

37
00:02:26,198 --> 00:02:28,799
the right, as well as in the intermediate segment of cable.

38
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:31,578
If we now look at the red chain,

39
00:02:31,578 --> 00:02:36,950
on the bottom. It is subjected to a load of

40
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:43,560
20 Newtons

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,774
with, in its right part, an inclination which

42
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:52,298
goes up towards the right, and on its left

43
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:57,560
part, and inclination which goes up towards the left.

44
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,690
We can note big similarities between these two 

45
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,028
constructions. Actually, 10 plus 10 equals 20.

46
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:19,008
So, the effect of this force is equal to the effect of these two forces.

47
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:23,744
We can note that this segment has the same length than this other

48
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:28,738
segment, as well as this segment, here, has the same length than this

49
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,690
other segment.

50
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,085
In other words, the internal forces, in the inclined parts of the white

51
00:03:35,085 --> 00:03:40,480
cable, are identical to the internal forces in the inclined parts of the red cable.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,680
The only difference is that the red cable

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,850
does not have any horizontal segment in its middle.

54
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,800
What does it mean ?

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
It means that for the red chain and the white

56
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,180
chain, in the part between the support and the first load, for example,

57
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,100
the internal force is identical.

58
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,684
The link, both links, if we

59
00:03:58,684 --> 00:04:03,090
consider them individually, they have exactly the same internal force.

60
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,352
What does it mean ?

61
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:09,110
Well, it means that the force of 20 Newtons

62
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,570
has exactly the same effect than both forces of 10 Newtons.

63
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,998
What does it mean ?

64
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:16,885
Remember the definition I gave

65
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:19,315
you for the resultant, when I introduced

66
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,184
this concept?

67
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:24,292
The resultant it is a force whose the effect on the system

68
00:04:24,292 --> 00:04:27,985
is the same than the one of all the considered forces.

69
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:37,890
Well, clearly here, we are dealing with a resultant.

70
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,968
What is also interesting is to see

71
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,905
where is located the line of action of the resultant.

72
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:44,505
I think that

73
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:46,755
we already agreed to say that the resultant

74
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:49,560
was going to have a magnitude of 20 Newtons.

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,600
But now, what we can also see,

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,890
it is that this resultant has its line of action

77
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,415
which is on the intersection

78
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:12,386
of the extension of the first and of the last segment of the

79
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:18,362
cable, the ones which were indicated by three and by two before.

80
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:22,688
The line of action of the resultant passes where they cross each other.

81
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,870
Let's look at this second case, it is the same cable,

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:31,280
but now, with a load of 10 Newtons on the left, and two loads of

83
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,910
10 Newtons on the right. I make quickly the construction.

84
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,223
So, the load of 10 Newtons, and I know that I will have the load

85
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:48,860
of 20 Newtons afterwards.

86
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:27,184
Here, this is the internal force in the left part of the cable, in the intermediate

87
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:33,700
part. Then, we can directly

88
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,040
close the polygon of forces, for the equilibrium of the force on the right.

89
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,400
Now, if I make the drawing for the second system,

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:55,210
I directly have a force of 30 Newtons,

91
00:07:06,705 --> 00:07:12,625
with a component which goes up towards the right

92
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:19,350
first, then which goes up towards the left,

93
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:30,540
and we can note once again that these two elements,

94
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,120
here, and here, respectively here,

95
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,250
and here, are identical. So, once again,

96
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,272
the force, here, of 30 Newtons and the resultant

97
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:51,570
of two forces of 10 and of 20 Newtons.

98
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:58,880
Its line of action

99
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,472
is located, one more time, on the intersection of the extension

100
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:07,910
of the first segment, and of the last segment of the

101
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,512
cable. We are going to use this property 

102
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:16,736
which is general to define a general method,

103
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:22,300
to determine the position of the line of action of the resultant.

104
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,036
Let's start with a simple example.

105
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,780
Now, we deal with the resultant of two forces.

106
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,588
We do not have any cables.

107
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:31,811
We can, in the Cremona diagram,

108
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:33,692
because we know that we will

109
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,140
need it, we can already draw these two forces,

110
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,903
the force of 10 Newtons, and the force

111
00:08:41,903 --> 00:08:43,820
of 20 Newtons.

112
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,845
We are going to work with what we call an auxiliary cable.

113
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:59,301
We can also call it a fictional cable, because it is going to be useful,

114
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:02,060
and afterwards, once it will have

115
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,134
used it, we will be able to forget it,

116
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,740
respectively, to erase it if we wish to.

117
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:14,386
This cable will start from a support, here, and will have a certain initial inclination.

118
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:15,134
I choose,

119
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:17,594
because it is easier for me, to

120
00:09:17,594 --> 00:09:21,970
give it an initial inclination of 45 degrees.

121
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,460
But this, that is totally arbitrary, we shall return to this point later.

122
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:34,147
It corresponds, in the Cremona diagram, to this part, and that is also

123
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:40,538
very easy with an angle of 45 degrees. We know that the internal force in this cable

124
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,580
is somewhere, here.

125
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,100
Afterwards, we have a second choice

126
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,030
to make, either we choose a second angle.

127
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,435
For example, we could say that the cable is horizontal

128
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:56,185
after having touched the force of 10 Newtons.

129
00:09:56,185 --> 00:09:59,312
Alternatively, we can choose a point in the Cremona

130
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:03,900
diagram to represent the internal force in the intermediate part of the cable.

131
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,050
So, now, I prefer

132
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,900
to choose that the cable is horizontal between both forces.

133
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,498
You remember that it was not the

134
00:10:12,498 --> 00:10:14,284
case in the cable which we have constructed previously.

135
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:16,540
It was horizontal when there was only one force.

136
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,755
But actually, we can find a cable whose the part, here, is horizontal.

137
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,445
What does it mean ?

138
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:24,946
Well, it means that in the Cremona

139
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:29,370
diagram, this part, here, must be horizontal, and then,

140
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,572
the internal force in the first

141
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:39,100
segment is now determined. Then, we

142
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,505
also have automatically determined, in the Cremona

143
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:49,535
diagram, the inclination of the last segment of cable, which is

144
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:54,410
like this. And, we can finish the diagram

145
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,400
of forces.

146
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:02,850
I copy this inclination in the structural sketch,

147
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,410
and I obtain the end of my auxiliary cable.

148
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,950
So, I stop the auxiliary cable here, by a support.

149
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,016
What did we observe before ?

150
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:25,980
That is if we extend the first and the last segment of the cable,

151
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,390
we are going to extend them, in this way,

152
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,750
and the last segment too,

153
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,488
well, we

154
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:55,818
obtain, on the intersection, a point

155
00:11:55,818 --> 00:12:01,129
which is on the line

156
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:08,452
of action of the resultant.

157
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:13,500
We come back to the Cremona diagram.

158
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,676
What is the value of the resultant ?

159
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:16,804
Well, it is equal to the sum of both forces.

160
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:21,231
I draw it, a little bit staggered for the drawing to stay clear.

161
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:26,170
But it is clear that the resultant, here, is equal to 30 Newtons.

162
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,875
But where does it pass in the real system ?

163
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:33,976
Well, this resultant will be vertical.

164
00:12:33,976 --> 00:12:39,002
It will pass by the point which we have determined before.

165
00:12:39,002 --> 00:12:46,880
So, here, I draw the line of action of the resultant,

166
00:12:53,945 --> 00:13:00,477
and then, the resultant itself, I can represent it where I want, for example,

167
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:07,240
here. I indicate R is equal to 30 Newtons.

168
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,932
For this construction, we are going to construct the resultant of the

169
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:15,030
forces, starting by the force which will touch the cable first.

170
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,993
For the moment, it is a little bit obscure, but you will see it, you will understand it a

171
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:19,864
little bit later.

172
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:22,812
The first thing consists in choosing a support for the

173
00:13:22,812 --> 00:13:26,880
auxiliary cable, then in choosing an initial inclination for the

174
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,530
auxiliary cable, which is going to give us the first segment, like

175
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,010
the last time, but this, it is simply because it suits me well.

176
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,855
Sometimes, it could not be a good solution.

177
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,380
I choose 45 degrees, and I indicate this segment by 1.

178
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,570
We now have to work in the Cremona diagram.

179
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,284
So, I am going to copy the

180
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:52,205
force of

181
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:56,715
20 Newtons in the Cremona diagram, and I

182
00:13:56,715 --> 00:14:01,229
also copy the first

183
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:06,926
segment of cable, which I call 1.

184
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:09,320
I do not know exactly where it is going

185
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,270
to stop yet.

186
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,238
I now choose, either on the right, the point of intersection

187
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:16,740
in the Cremona diagram, either the inclination of the second segment.

188
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,420
To change, I am going to choose the

189
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,220
point of intersection in the Cremona diagram.

190
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,372
I am going to choose this point, here. On the basis of this point, here, it

191
00:14:26,372 --> 00:14:31,610
gives me a second segment, which is not horizontal anymore as before.

192
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,912
Then, I copy this segment

193
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:40,854
into the real system. I indicate it

194
00:14:40,854 --> 00:14:45,488
by 2. I can now add the second

195
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:49,950
force which is equal to 10 Newtons, and determine the

196
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,828
the rest of the Cremona diagram, with this

197
00:14:54,828 --> 00:15:00,112
inclination here, which I indicate by 3. And I

198
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:04,602
copy this inclination into the

199
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:09,870
real system, and I can put

200
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:15,180
a support. I directly extend

201
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,580
this first line of action.

202
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,538
Here, I put the support about which I talked.

203
00:15:23,538 --> 00:15:25,510
Likewise, I extend the first line

204
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:25,980
of action.

205
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,480
I have obtained a point on the line of action of the resultant.

206
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,374
The resultant, I get its magnitude, and its orientation, R

207
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:44,631
equals 30 Newtons, in the Cremona diagram, and afterwards,

208
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:50,280
I copy this orientation, and I obtain, here,

209
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,528
the line of action of the resultant. And the

210
00:15:55,528 --> 00:16:00,680
resultant itself, I can place it here, on

211
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,360
this line of action, R equals 30 Newtons.

212
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,660
One more time, this method is very general.

213
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,915
It will also apply to several forces, we are going to see it

214
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:15,390
later, and also to forces which would not be

215
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,260
parallel.

216
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,010
Let's precisely look at the case of the resultant of three parallel forces.

217
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,185
I first draw these three forces in the Cremona diagram.

218
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:35,820
The first one, of 10 Newtons, the second one, of 20 Newtons,

219
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,220
and the third one, of 30 Newtons.

220
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,232
I choose to place a support.

221
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:57,405
Note that in this system, the lines of

222
00:16:57,405 --> 00:17:00,205
action of the forces have already been placed, which is

223
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,790
very useful because usually, we are not going to directly intersect

224
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,560
the force, but we will always intersect its line of action.

225
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,808
To change a little bit, we are going to assume that the first segment of the cable is

226
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:17,050
horizontal. We also draw it

227
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,332
in the Cremona diagram. Actually, I can directly

228
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:28,610
draw it like this, and I choose this point.

229
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:34,188
So, it directly gives me the inclination of the second

230
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:41,880
segment of the cable, which I am going to copy in the real system.

231
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,510
So, this is the segment 1. And this is the segment 2.

232
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,746
The third segment has this

233
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:59,960
inclination

234
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,720
And the fourth segment is very vertical.

235
00:18:32,505 --> 00:18:37,419
I draw directly its extension, since we have to

236
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,630
find the intersection of the first and of the last segment.

237
00:18:48,565 --> 00:18:53,759
So, this is the segment number 4. Also here, I also

238
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,802
indicate the support which ends the cable. The resultant itself,

239
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:03,740
in the Cremona diagram, it is vertical, and it has a

240
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,315
magnitude of 60 Newtons. And we can copy this

241
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:14,462
vertical line of action in the real

242
00:19:14,462 --> 00:19:19,084
system representing the

243
00:19:19,084 --> 00:19:25,630
resultant, here, which is equal to 60 Newtons.

244
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,185
So, we have seen that this system of construction, which

245
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:33,155
I had shown for two forces, can be applied generally for three

246
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:36,525
forces, and actually, for any number of forces, 

247
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,310
I mean at least as many as you will have the patience for.

248
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:44,681
In this lecture on the auxiliary cable, we have seen

249
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:48,466
that this method enables us to determine the shape of a

250
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:52,970
cable in an arbitrary way, deciding, for example, on the orientation

251
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:56,510
of the first segment of a cable, even of the first two segments.

252
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,064
We have seen

253
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:02,150
how to systematically proceed for this construction.

254
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,414
We have seen that this construction, by the intersection

255
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:07,790
of the first and of the last segment of cable,

256
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,417
gives us a point on the line of action of

257
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,896
the resultant, and it thus enables us to determine

258
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:19,164
the resultant for any number of forces.

259
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:23,676
We have seen that this method is very general, and that it can be applied

260
00:20:23,676 --> 00:20:27,800
for parallel forces, or for non-parallel forces.
