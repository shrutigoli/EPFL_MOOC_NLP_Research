00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,495
Hello, this video

2
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:10,990
deals with the case of a cable subjected to two symmetric loads which act on it.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,374
We are going to solve this case identifying

4
00:00:14,374 --> 00:00:18,070
and solving the equilibrium of each load

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,078
in an individual way using an appropriate

6
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:24,150
free-body, then we will combine these results together.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,150
We will get

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:30,398
the internal forces in each segment of cable and we will also obtain

9
00:00:30,398 --> 00:00:35,270
the forces at the supports at the ends of the cable.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,115
Here, you have a cable without any loads on which

11
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:43,770
we simultaneously hang up two loads at predetermined positions.

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,660
As you can see, the cable take a trapezoidal

13
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,522
shape with the supports on the upper

14
00:00:50,522 --> 00:00:54,890
part of the trapezium and both loads on the lower part.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,590
We have, on the left, a structural sketch representing

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,840
our structure and on the right, we are going to construct

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,043
a Cremona diagram combining

18
00:01:05,043 --> 00:01:08,500
the various internal forces in a single graphical construction.

19
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:15,780
We firstly identify a free-body around the force on the left.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,946
We can draw again this free-body just

21
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:25,905
below, with an horizontal segment,

22
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:30,376
an inclined segment, the load of 10

23
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:35,084
Newtons and, acting on the

24
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:40,860
ends, on the edge of the free-body, the internal forces in the

25
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,370
cables which we wish to determine.

26
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,690
In the Cremona diagram, we can draw this force of 10 Newtons.

27
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,900
Then, on this line of action,

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,667
we know that the horizontal load

29
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:11,860
will act, and finally, in parallel

30
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,180
with the segment of cable on the left, we can copy

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,706
the force which goes up towards the

32
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:30,898
left. well, we can

33
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:36,310
now finish the equilibrium

34
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,806
of the blue free-body on the left, directly

35
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:46,753
reading the value of the internal forces, here 7.4 Newtons in

36
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:51,237
the horizontal segment of cable. We have

37
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,826
tension here. 7.4

38
00:02:55,826 --> 00:03:02,520
Newtons. Then, 12.4

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,948
Newtons in

40
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:13,070
the inclined segment on the left.

41
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,160
I identify the free-body

42
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,116
which has given us this construction, with

43
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:29,100
sky blue. We now want to study

44
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,630
the force,

45
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,478
the load on the right with this pink free-body which I also draw

46
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:40,160
again below,

47
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,196
with a horizontal segment, an inclined segment and the

48
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:57,683
load of 10 Newtons. Here, we have seen in

49
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:03,173
the blue free-body that this internal force had a magnitude of 7.4 Newtons.

50
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:07,780
Here, it will be the same in the other direction.

51
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,980
We already know it, here, we have 12.4 Newtons.

52
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,510
And here, we will have a tensile internal force whose we do not know the magnitude yet.

53
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,374
But we already know its inclination. Let's now consider the Cremona diagram, we

54
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:31,090
draw the second force of 10 Newtons.

55
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:42,024
In this Cremona diagram, we are going to actually start with

56
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:47,868
the internal force of 7.4 Newtons acting horizontally.

57
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:53,960
Then, we will have a load of 10 Newtons and we are going to close the polygon of forces

58
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,870
corresponding to the pink free-body, here, by this internal force.

59
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,870
Then, if we measure it, we are going to see that it has the same magnitude,

60
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,711
it also has a value of 12.4 Newtons. That is quite logical since our

61
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:14,950
structure is symmetric. I identify the contribution to the

62
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:22,021
Cremona diagram of the pink free-body. We now want to

63
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:28,867
take an interest in the free-body concerning the supports.

64
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:35,580
Well, I draw again this free-body

65
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,794
independently. We have a piece of cable, the end

66
00:05:40,794 --> 00:05:45,446
of the cable acting on this free-body, there is of course

67
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:49,940
the internal force of 12.4

68
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,030
Newtons which pulls this support

69
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,320
downwards. In the Cremona diagram, we now reuse

70
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,080
the internal force of 12.4 Newtons pulling downwards then,

71
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,045
we finish

72
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:18,010
the construction with the vertical component on the left

73
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,807
and the horizontal component on

74
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:32,400
the left. We can see that this horizontal

75
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,315
component is also equal to 7.4 Newtons and the vertical

76
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:42,503
component is equal to 10 Newtons. We identify

77
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:47,900
the contribution of the free-body

78
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,248
to the global construction, and we now consider

79
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:55,850
the support on the right with a yellow free-body

80
00:07:00,315 --> 00:07:05,054
with a piece of cable and

81
00:07:05,054 --> 00:07:10,260
the end. The internal force is equal

82
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,252
to 12.4 Newtons. I did not copy it

83
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:20,786
here, also 12.4 Newtons and I did not copy it

84
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:25,910
in the free-body either. We have a tensile internal force

85
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:31,400
of 12.4 Newtons. On the yellow

86
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,770
free-body acts the internal force of 12.4

87
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:42,084
Newtons, going down towards the left. Then,

88
00:07:42,084 --> 00:07:48,480
the horizontal internal force on the right

89
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:54,270
which is equal to 7.4 Newtons.

90
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:00,610
Then, the vertical internal force on the right

91
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,902
which is equal to 10 Newtons. I also

92
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,550
identify the contribution to

93
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,138
the Cremona diagram, of the yellow

94
00:08:15,138 --> 00:08:19,378
free-body. If we apply a second

95
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:25,618
load on our system, actually it does not change its shape, but now, as

96
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:30,710
it was the case for a system with only one load, the internal forces are doubled.

97
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:35,978
Thus, we would just have to take again the Cremona diagram which we have previously

98
00:08:35,978 --> 00:08:37,776
made and to read it with a

99
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:40,690
doubled scale to directly get the internal forces.

100
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,340
Or, of course, we could integrally reconstruct it.

101
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,480
Let's now deal with a practical exercise of dimensioning of the cable.

102
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,450
It is now a cable on which acts not

103
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:57,635
anymore 10 Newtons, but a permanent load of 12 kiloNewtons,

104
00:08:57,635 --> 00:09:00,585
12000 Newtons so it is a quite significant

105
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:04,910
load on which is added a variable load of 8 kiloNewtons.

106
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,663
Let's see how to proceed to obtain the diameter of the cable

107
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:17,790
knowing that the strength of the cable fsd is 320 Newtons per square millimeter.

108
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,826
We first have to get the design load, Qd, which acts on this

109
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:35,040
cable. Qd is equal to 1.35

110
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,625
times G plus 1.5

111
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,210
times Q or for us, 1.35

112
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,855
times 12 plus 1.5 times 8,

113
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:55,138
that is to say 28.2 kiloNewtons.

114
00:09:55,138 --> 00:10:01,830
We are now going to have a design load,

115
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,580
I draw it here in pink, a little bit staggered, Qd.

116
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,450
By the way, I should not have moved it, we are going

117
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:16,290
to draw it over, here, Qd equal to 28.2 kiloNewtons.

118
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,452
Naturally, we could made a new Cremona diagram

119
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:26,716
for the load of 28.2 kiloNewtons but it is not necessary since we

120
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:31,988
have already the solution for 10 Newtons, and therefore we now want

121
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:37,020
to multiply everything by the ratio between 28200 Newtons

122
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,620
and 10 Newtons to directly obtain our internal forces.

123
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:48,290
The larges internal force, we have obtained it before in both inclined

124
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:54,728
parts of the cable, it was 12.4 Newtons

125
00:10:54,728 --> 00:11:00,160
for an applied load of twice 10 Newtons.

126
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,348
Now, we want to see what is the

127
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:10,720
result for 28.2

128
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,288
kiloNewtons and actually, because we do not want to have thousands of Newtons, we

129
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:20,730
would be interested to have this answer in kiloNewtons, at least for the moment.

130
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:27,295
This answer is simply going to be 12.4

131
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:33,050
divided by 10, this is a proportion, times 28.2.

132
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,889
And this, it gives us

133
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:40,990
35 kiloNewtons. Thus the internal force in these

134
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,410
two segments of cable, for the dimensioning,

135
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:50,600
we have Nd is equal to 35

136
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,301
kiloNewtons. We now want

137
00:11:56,301 --> 00:12:01,005
to do the dimensioning of the cable. The dimensioning is

138
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:06,509
the choice of the dimensions, actually we

139
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:11,442
want to know the diameter of the cable. We

140
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:16,650
have then Nd is equal to 

141
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,740
35 kiloNewtons. That is to say

142
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,006
35000 Newtons and we have a material which

143
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:32,015
resists to 320 Newtons per square millimeter thus the minimal required

144
00:12:32,015 --> 00:12:37,415
area is 35000 divided

145
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:42,190
by 320, that is to say

146
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,852
109 square millimeter, so

147
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:51,146
the diameter is still the square root of 4 times

148
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:56,122
A divided by pi : it is equal

149
00:12:56,122 --> 00:13:00,895
to square root of 4 times 109 divided by

150
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:05,940
pi, that is to say 11.8 millimeters,

151
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:10,958
thus we choose a cable of 12

152
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:17,276
millimeters diameter which will be adequate

153
00:13:17,276 --> 00:13:21,650
to resist to the design internal forces.

154
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,422
We also could obviously do the verification

155
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:26,690
of the transitional part of the cable, you

156
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,190
know, the one which had 7.4 Newtons for an applied load of twice 10 Newtons,

157
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,428
but actually, this cable would have a smaller diameter, that is why

158
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:40,520
we only did the dimensioning for the part with the largest internal force.

159
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,664
In this video, we have seen how

160
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,880
to solve the equilibrium of a cable subjected to two symmetric

161
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,976
loads, we have proceeded expressing in the Cremona

162
00:13:49,976 --> 00:13:53,778
diagram, the equilibrium of each free-body around

163
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:56,390
the load on the left and around the load on the right.

164
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:01,970
We have seen how to obtain the internal forces in each segment of cable,

165
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,851
then we have proceeded to the dimensioning performing a

166
00:14:07,851 --> 00:14:12,060
load combination to get the design load.

167
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,085
Thereafter, a cross-multiplication, a

168
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,510
proportion to obtain the design internal force

169
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,160
in the cable and finally we have been able to determine the diameter of the cable.

170
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,074
During the construction, we have also determined 

171
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:26,120
the forces at the supports in a very

172
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,538
similar way to what we did before

173
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:31,080
for the case of the cable with only one force.

174
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,186
A question which maybe

175
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:38,486
came to your mind is, but, what happens

176
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:40,208
if I do not know the geometry of the cable ?

177
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:43,106
Because that is true that until now, we have had photos of the geometry

178
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:45,940
of the cable, well, we are going to take an interest

179
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,920
in this question in the following lectures.
