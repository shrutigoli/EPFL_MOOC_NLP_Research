1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,593
Hello.

2
00:00:01,593 --> 00:00:08,732
In this video, we will see what are the

3
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:10,806
internal forces in a cable which is subjected to a

4
00:00:10,806 --> 00:00:13,795
load, which acts transversally, but not in

5
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:16,472
the middle, but which acts in an eccentric way.

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,136
In a very similar way that what we

7
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,528
have done in the previous video, we will study

8
00:00:20,528 --> 00:00:22,701
the free-body of the load, we will obtain the

9
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,030
internal forces in the segments of cable, then we will study

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,070
the free-bodies of the supports, to obtain the

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,900
forces at the supports, and we will

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,818
finish by a case a little bit particular

13
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,820
of a force which is not only eccentric, but also inclined.

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,740
In this video, you can see what happens, when on

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,030
a cable which did not have any loads, we apply an eccentric load.

16
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,590
Once again, as before, the cable takes a rectilinear shape,

17
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,434
between the supports and the applied load. As before, we

18
00:00:56,434 --> 00:01:02,032
construct the structural sketch tracing parallels

19
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:07,410
to the different segments of cable in

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,120
an independent sketch.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,200
So, we have a load of 10 Newtons which acts.

22
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,438
And then, for the record, this segment is parallel to this one.

23
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:43,590
This segment is parallel to this one. We start

24
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,732
by identifying the free-body including the load and

25
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:53,710
by drawing it again in an independent way.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:03,902
We have a piece of cable on the left, another

27
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:11,460
piece of cable on the right, the load of 10 Newtons,

28
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:21,146
and the internal force in the left part

29
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:25,690
of the cable, N1, and in its right part,

30
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:31,276
N2. We want, in

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:36,290
the Cremona diagram, to draw

32
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:41,770
with a length of 10 centimeters,

33
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:49,280
the load of 10 Newtons, equal to 100 millimeters, there.

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:02,180
Then, we trace the parallels to both segments of cable, N2 first,

35
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,960
and N1 afterwards.

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,557
So, here, we have an internal force

37
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:22,950
N2 which is equal to 8.5

38
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,030
Newtons. Then, here, we have the internal force

39
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,600
N1 which is equal to 4.5 Newtons.

40
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,680
Then, we

41
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,620
can take an interest in

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,808
the free-body of the support

43
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:53,619
on the left which

44
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:59,863
includes a segment of

45
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:04,330
cable with an internal force of 4.5

46
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,340
Newtons. That is

47
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,280
this internal force N1 along which we travel in the other

48
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,760
direction, and for which we are going

49
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,716
to obtain a vertical force at the

50
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:32,405
support V1 and an horizontal one

51
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,350
H1. V1 is equal to

52
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,020
2.4 Newtons,

53
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,032
while H1 is equal to

54
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:50,970
3.7 Newtons.

55
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:56,904
We can do like before, that is to say

56
00:04:56,904 --> 00:05:01,375
to identify the part of the Cremona diagram which corresponds

57
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:05,995
to the orange free-body. Likewise, we are going to take a

58
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:11,350
pink free-body for the support on the right.

59
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,540
We have a segment of cable

60
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,658
on which acts an internal force of 8.5

61
00:05:29,658 --> 00:05:35,047
Newtons. So, we will have the forces 

62
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:40,670
at the support V2 and H2. I should have drawn,

63
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,966
before, V1 and H1 for

64
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:50,306
the support on the left. In the Cremona diagram,

65
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:55,708
using the internal force N2 in the other direction, it becomes an arrow with two

66
00:05:55,708 --> 00:06:01,065
heads, we obtain the force H2, whose we

67
00:06:01,065 --> 00:06:06,453
can see that it is equal to H1, thus 3.7 Newtons,

68
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,107
and then, the vertical force on

69
00:06:11,107 --> 00:06:17,055
the right which is equal to 7.6 Newtons,

70
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:22,302
the sum being equal once again to 10 Newtons,

71
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:27,058
which is the applied load. We are going

72
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:32,595
to copy again, I first indicate the free-bodies

73
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:36,030
used in the Cremona diagram.

74
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,576
So, the sky blue free-body, is the

75
00:06:38,576 --> 00:06:41,550
free-body of the load to obtain N1 and N2.

76
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,560
Then, both free-bodies which have been

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,070
used to get the internal forces at the supports.

78
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,300
We copy the results to the structural sketch,

79
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,362
so both segments of cable are in tension.

80
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,450
Thus, we can draw them in red.

81
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,618
The internal force

82
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:10,150
N2 is equal to 8.5 Newtons in tension.

83
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,380
And the internal force N1 is equal to 4.5 Newtons in tension.

84
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,864
We can see that the method which we used to solve this case

85
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,770
is very similar to the one we have seen in the previous video.

86
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,402
Indeed, we do not have anymore

87
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,418
values of the internal forces in the segments of

88
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,098
cable which are equal, as well as

89
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:41,793
certain components of the forces at the supports are different.

90
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,221
Let's now look at,

91
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,920
the case a little bit more complicated of a

92
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,592
cable with a load which is neither centered, neither vertical.

93
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:53,674
So, we have an eccentric load which is a little bit inclined.

94
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:58,940
We introduce it in our relaxed cable, by means of a dynamometer.

95
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,686
The force which acts is exactly of 10 Newtons.

96
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:07,174
So, we exactly have the same applied load than before.

97
00:08:07,174 --> 00:08:08,318
However, it does not act

98
00:08:08,318 --> 00:08:12,180
vertically. Here, we have copied the structural

99
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,660
sketch of our configuration. So, we have, here, acting

100
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,630
on an inclined axis, a load of 10 Newtons.

101
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,870
And as before, we take an interest in the

102
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,960
free-body which includes the load.

103
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,864
This free-body cuts the cable on

104
00:08:43,864 --> 00:08:49,464
the right and the cable on the left, and includes

105
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:53,482
the load of 10

106
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:59,040
Newtons. We are looking for the

107
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,060
internal forces N1 and N2 which act in

108
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,510
the cable.

109
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:26,680
We copy the load

110
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,690
of 10 Newtons to scale, that is to say 100

111
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:39,440
millimeters.

112
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,550
Then,

113
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:52,180
the parallels to the segment

114
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,670
N2,

115
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,130
then N1.

116
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,062
Which thus gives us, the internal forces N2 and

117
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:33,902
N1. N2

118
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:38,850
is equal to 8.3

119
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,290
Newtons and N1 is equal to

120
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,990
4.8 Newtons.

121
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:01,280
We copy these values in the structural sketch,

122
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,836
also indicating the type of internal force in the structure.

123
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:18,900
In this case, both elements are in tension.

124
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:27,560
We now take an interest in the support on the left.

125
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,000
I draw again the corresponding free-body,

126
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,576
with the internal force

127
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:50,020
of 4.8 Newtons.

128
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,203
And this free-body will be in equilibrium thanks to the

129
00:11:55,203 --> 00:12:00,275
forces at the support V1 and

130
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:05,058
H1. In the Cremona diagram,

131
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:10,111
we had used N1 in this direction. We now use it

132
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:15,396
in the opposite direction, and we close the polygon of

133
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:20,348
forces thanks to its component 

134
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:24,962
V1 and to the

135
00:12:24,962 --> 00:12:30,524
force at the support H1. H1 is equal to

136
00:12:30,524 --> 00:12:36,599
2.2 Newtons. V1

137
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:43,810
is equal to 4.2 Newtons.

138
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:49,778
Likewise, we are going to solve the free-body

139
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:54,180
corresponding to the support on the right;

140
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,374
with the internal force of 8.3

141
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:09,650
Newtons in the

142
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:15,415
cable and the forces at the support V2 and

143
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:21,450
H2. We reuse

144
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,158
the vector

145
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:30,400
N2. Then, we introduce

146
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,858
H2, and we finish by the force

147
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:40,540
at the support V2. H2 is equal to

148
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,361
7 Newtons

149
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:51,340
and V2 is equal to 4.5

150
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,390
Newtons.

151
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,056
We can note that in this configuration, well,

152
00:13:58,056 --> 00:14:01,202
the sum of the horizontal forces at the support

153
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:04,317
is not zero, since precisely, there is

154
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:08,480
a horizontal component in the load which is applied.

155
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,772
You maybe wondered, whether it be in this video, or in the

156
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:16,441
previous video, why, after having drawn the

157
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:21,141
load of 10 Newtons, I have systematically always

158
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:26,120
taken the internal force N2 which was on the right of this load, and afterwards the internal force N1.

159
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,662
And you maybe wondered, why

160
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:31,440
did not I do the reverse ? 

161
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,050
Actually, I already applied, without officially saying it to you,

162
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,340
a convention which we are going to use for the rest of

163
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,730
this course, which is that, when we deal with the forces

164
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,208
which act on a free-body, we take them in a

165
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,101
systematic order which is the counterclockwise order.

166
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:54,940
So, we turn around the free-body, in the counterclockwise

167
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,500
order, starting by where the forces are known.

168
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,169
So, here, we know the load of 10 Newtons.

169
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,889
Afterwards, we will have the element two which is N2.

170
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:09,588
And finally, the element three which is N1.

171
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,560
And then, in the Cremona diagram,

172
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,970
this is the first element that we have traced.

173
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,200
Here, the second element.

174
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,936
Here, the third element.

175
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,512
We can, obviously, proceed with the opposite convention.

176
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:24,110
That is to say, to turn in the clockwise order.

177
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,034
Will the equilibrium be modified ?

178
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:27,438
No, since regarding the

179
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:30,675
treatment of each free-body, we insure the equilibrium,

180
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:35,892
and we can of course ensure the equilibrium by adding first N1, and afterwards N2.

181
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:41,184
Actually, that is what has been done in this figure, from the book The art of

182
00:15:41,184 --> 00:15:46,241
structures, in which we have dealt with this free-body. And if we closely

183
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:51,144
look at this, indeed we have firstly dealt with the

184
00:15:51,144 --> 00:15:56,174
force, then the internal force N1 and finally

185
00:15:56,174 --> 00:16:01,193
the internal force N2. So, we have used the force which

186
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:07,673
is indicated by Q, then N1 and finally N2.

187
00:16:07,673 --> 00:16:10,373
You can see that the diagram is similar

188
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:12,720
to the one we did before.

189
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,860
The results are obviously right, and are the same.

190
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,000
You can try to do this job by yourself.

191
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,924
To simplify the correction and the communication

192
00:16:23,924 --> 00:16:26,236
within this course, we ask you,

193
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:28,808
for this course, for the exercises, for your

194
00:16:28,808 --> 00:16:33,004
reasoning, also with the assistants or with your questions, to systematically

195
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:37,100
use the counterclockwise order, as I have

196
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,480
shown you in this lecture.

197
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,197
Within the framework of this video, we have generalized the approach

198
00:16:45,197 --> 00:16:50,294
method to solve the equilibrium of a cable subjected to a transversal load.

199
00:16:50,294 --> 00:16:51,246
We have first

200
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:56,470
dealt with the case of an eccentric load, then of an eccentric and inclined load.

201
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,670
We have seen that the order in which

202
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:05,825
we consider the internal forces and the loads which act

203
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,105
on a free-body, has an influence on the

204
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,700
shape and on the construction of the Cremona diagram.

205
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,196
For the rest of this course, we

206
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:16,705
will always use the counterclockwise

207
00:17:16,705 --> 00:17:19,860
order for the construction of the Cremona diagrams.

208
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,290
We have seen how to

209
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,530
systematically obtain the internal forces in the segments

210
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,345
of cable, and how to copy them in

211
00:17:27,345 --> 00:17:30,421
the structural sketch to communicate these internal forces.

212
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:33,779
Finally, we have seen how to obtain the forces

213
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,770
at the supports and their horizontal and vertical components.
