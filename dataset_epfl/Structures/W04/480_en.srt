00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,422
Hello.

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:07,684
In this video, we are going to solve the case

3
00:00:07,684 --> 00:00:10,700
of a cable, which is subjected to two unequal loads.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,388
We will see that the application of the method which

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,377
we have seen for a cable subjected to

6
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:18,341
two equal loads, is absolutely possible.

7
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:21,613
So, we will study a free-body for each load.

8
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:24,743
We will obtain the internal forces in each segment of cable,

9
00:00:24,743 --> 00:00:28,640
and finally, we will obtain the corresponding forces at the supports.

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,098
So, when I place

11
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:35,282
a second load on the right of the cable, we can note that the shape of the cable

12
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:40,610
changes, then reaches the equilibrium and stabilizes.

13
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:45,657
We have here represented a structural sketch of this cable

14
00:00:45,657 --> 00:00:50,435
with a load of 10 Newtons on the left and of

15
00:00:50,435 --> 00:00:55,489
20 Newtons on the right. We first isolate

16
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,310
a free-body corresponding to the force on the left, which we immediately

17
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,590
draw again. This free-body

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,258
includes the segment of cable on the right, the

19
00:01:11,258 --> 00:01:16,758
segment of cable on the left, and a load of 10 Newtons.

20
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:23,570
In the Cremona diagram, we introduce

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,730
this load of 10 Newtons,

22
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,370
a parallel

23
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,010
component to the transitional part of the cable,

24
00:01:56,875 --> 00:02:01,030
and a parallel component to the left part of the cable.

25
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:17,200
We can directly read the value of

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,904
these internal forces, approximately 10 Newtons here, and

27
00:02:21,904 --> 00:02:26,634
15 Newtons. 

28
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:32,270
Copying these internal forces

29
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:37,370
on the free-body, we can see that this internal force of 15 Newtons here,

30
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,668
pulls on the free-body, it is thus a tensile internal force, thus this part of the

31
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:50,025
cable is in tension and for the right part,

32
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,328
this internal forces of 10 Newtons here, also pulls on the free-body, and

33
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:58,772
thus we also have a tensile internal force in the cable.

34
00:02:58,772 --> 00:03:02,520
Well, it is not surprising to have a cable in tension,

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:09,940
we have here 10 Newtons, and here 15 Newtons.

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:16,900
We now take an interest

37
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,799
in the free-body on the right, including the load on the right, a part of the intermediate

38
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:24,809
segment of cable, and

39
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:27,656
a part of the segment of cable which goes up towards

40
00:03:27,656 --> 00:03:34,100
the support on the right. So, a horizontal part of cable,

41
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,330
or almost horizontal, a part of cable which goes up, and

42
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,830
a load of 20 Newtons.

43
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,870
We copy this load in the Cremona diagram.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,120
We are going to use the internal force of

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,910
10 Newtons, which we already

46
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:07,418
know, in the transitional part of the cable, the

47
00:04:07,418 --> 00:04:12,630
load of 20 Newtons, and finally, to 

48
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,850
go up towards the start of our polygon of forces,

49
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,780
we will have an internal force whose the value is roughly 22 Newtons.

50
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,023
We can copy this internal force in the free-body,

51
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:34,062
here 22 Newtons, we can note that it pulls on the free-body, thus this

52
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:39,332
element is in tension, and the last segment of cable is

53
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:44,760
thus subjected to an internal force of 22 Newtons.

54
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,885
I am going to do very quickly,

55
00:04:49,885 --> 00:04:55,010
obtaining of the forces at the supports, because there is nothing

56
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,110
different from what we have seen previously.

57
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:05,800
We obtain

58
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,288
a vertical component on the left and a horizontal

59
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:14,780
component on the left traveling again along

60
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,030
the internal force of 15 Newtons, in the other direction.

61
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,084
The horizontal internal force on the left is equal to

62
00:05:41,084 --> 00:05:46,418
10 Newtons. The vertical internal

63
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:50,975
force on the left is equal to 11 Newtons.

64
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,175
And on the right, we travel again along

65
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:56,810
the internal force of 22 Newtons, in the other direction,

66
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:03,166
then, the internal force on the right, we

67
00:06:03,166 --> 00:06:08,650
can see that it is equal to the horizontal internal force on the left and has thus a value of 10 Newtons.

68
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,474
And finally, the vertical internal force on the right, which necessarily must,

69
00:06:21,474 --> 00:06:26,375
but we can see it, have a value of 19 Newtons for the sum

70
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:31,660
to correspond to the applied load of 30 Newtons.

71
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,427
We are going to copy these elements.

72
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:41,140
So, we have 11 Newtons here, 10 Newtons horizontal,

73
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:48,648
19 Newtons vertical, and once again 10 Newtons horizontal.

74
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:53,000
We have seen in this solution that, on the

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,828
basis of a photograph or respectively of the structural system which

76
00:06:56,828 --> 00:07:00,986
has been given, we can easily obtain the internal forces in

77
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:04,410
the segments of cable, as well as the forces at the supports.

78
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,214
In the next lecture,

79
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:10,433
we will see how to determine, without necessarily knowing in

80
00:07:10,433 --> 00:07:13,859
advance the shape of the cable, the shape

81
00:07:13,859 --> 00:07:17,838
or a possible shape for the cable without having

82
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:21,520
necessarily a photo or a model available before.
