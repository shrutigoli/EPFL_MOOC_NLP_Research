1
00:00:05,515 --> 00:00:08,353
Hello, in this lecture, we will see how

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:11,030
a cable can carry a transverse load.

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,850
Until now, the loads that we have applied

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,320
on the cables acted in the axis of the cable. 

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,816
Now, we have, as you can see

6
00:00:18,816 --> 00:00:20,993
on the slide of the title, a rope

7
00:00:20,993 --> 00:00:25,670
which is held by two men, on which acts a load in the middle.

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,778
In this lecture, we are going to study

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,478
the free-body of the load to obtain the internal forces in

10
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:37,510
both segments of cable on the left and on the right.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,175
We will take an interest in the forces at the supports.

12
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:43,959
Then, we will make some variation studies about the influence of

13
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,870
the load which is applied and of the geometry of the cable.

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,558
In the case which interests us here, we

15
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:55,890
have a load, which acts in the middle of the cable.

16
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:02,489
And we are going to identify a free-body

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,501
which cuts the cable in two places and which includes the applied load.

18
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:13,640
I draw again this free-body nearby.

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,091
So, we have both segments of cable, the acting load Q

20
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:28,543
and the free-body cuts the segments of cable in two places.

21
00:01:28,543 --> 00:01:33,364
This implies that, at this place here, I have to replace the cut segment of

22
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:35,156
cable by the effect which is inside

23
00:01:35,156 --> 00:01:38,100
this segment of cable, or more exactly, the internal force.

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,313
Then, not knowing yet this internal force, I can already tell you, that

25
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,980
is not a secret for a cable, that it is a tensile internal force

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,290
which acts as until now, along the axis of the cable.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,055
We have here two

28
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:59,724
internal forces, which I am going to call N1 on the left and N2 on the right.

29
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:05,766
Let's now look at this little video of a cable first without load on

30
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:10,327
which we add a load of 10 Newtons. To be able

31
00:02:10,327 --> 00:02:17,316
to work on this structure, it is convenient to model it

32
00:02:17,316 --> 00:02:22,630
replacing the real structure by what is called a structural sketch.

33
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,855
The structural sketch represents, to scale,

34
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,820
the structure with its good proportions,

35
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,362
the loads which are applies and the supports.

36
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:35,602
So, I copy both segments of cable in

37
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:45,190
the part on the right, with the correct inclination.

38
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:55,720
And at their intersection, acts

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,010
the load of 10 Newtons.

40
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:06,410
On the left and on the right, we have elements which are

41
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,026
fixed supports. They are supports which does not

42
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:17,390
enable any movements.

43
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:23,158
Here, likewise, in the

44
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:29,050
structural sketch, we have on the left and on the right a fixed support.

45
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:36,191
Sometimes the fixed support is also symbolized

46
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:42,270
in this way, like a small triangle, the support being located at the top of the triangle.

47
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,768
We draw again the structural sketch

48
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:51,722
here. That is quite easy because within

49
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:56,670
the framework of this construction, the distance

50
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,962
between the supports, which we

51
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:08,024
call the span, which is designated by the letter 

52
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:12,598
l, is equal to 1.2 meters. And the

53
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,100
vertical distance between the supports

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:23,206
and the lower point of the cable, which we

55
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:28,600
call the rise,

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,730
f, is equal to 0.6 meters.

57
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,470
Thus, the angle is 45 degrees, which facilitated the drawing.

58
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,452
We have here, acting, a load of 10

59
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:48,113
Newtons. We first take an interest in the

60
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:54,010
free-body of the load and we draw it again

61
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,190
below. So, we have a segment

62
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:04,116
of cable parallel to the piece of cable on

63
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:09,250
the left, a segment parallel to the one of the cable on the right,

64
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,887
a load of 10 Newtons, and then both

65
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:19,500
internal forces on the left and on the right which are in

66
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,466
the extension of the cut segments of cable

67
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:31,680
and as I indicated before, we are going to have N1 and N2.

68
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,430
Let's now continue with the Cremona diagram in which we want to draw

69
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,520
the force of 10 Newtons which acts downwards.

70
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,340
I draw it with a length of 10 centimeters to make a drawing to scale.

71
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,960
So, I have 10 Newtons, equal to, we are going to say 100 millimeters.

72
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,410
For the free-body of the load to be in

73
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,650
equilibrium, it is necessary that the three forces which act

74
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,764
on this free-body then, the load of 10 Newtons, the internal force

75
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:12,184
N1 and the internal force N2, should be converging on only one point.

76
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:14,839
Well, that is good, we can see well that indeed,

77
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:18,213
they are converging on the point of hanging of the load.

78
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:20,420
Then, on the other hand, that their vectorial

79
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,580
sum should be zero, so we are going to construct the

80
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,900
vectorial sum of the load of 10 Newtons and of both internal forces N1 and N2.

81
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:40,444
So, I trace straight lines at 45 degrees

82
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:46,880
in my graph which correspond to the inclination

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,680
of the internal forces N1 and N2, thus

84
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,514
this segment here is parallel to this and also to this.

85
00:06:56,514 --> 00:07:00,398
This segment here is parallel to the segment on

86
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:05,110
the left in the free-body or in the overall system.

87
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,898
I notice,

88
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:11,738
indeed, that the internal force N2 acts

89
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:16,697
in the direction I had supposed, that is to say that it pulls

90
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:21,464
on the free-body. An internal force which pulls on the free-body is

91
00:07:21,464 --> 00:07:26,822
a tensile internal force. And the tension, for us, is red,

92
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:32,207
then I am going to draw this arrow again,

93
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:38,610
here, in red. And, since I have drawn to scale,

94
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,350
I can see that the internal force, here, is equal to 7.1 Newtons.

95
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,534
So, as I have drawn to scale, I directly obtain the numerical

96
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:55,282
value of the internal forces. Likewise,

97
00:07:55,282 --> 00:08:00,906
for the internal force

98
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:05,580
N1 that I also measure at

99
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,870
7.1 Newtons. Seventy-one

100
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,212
millimeters give 7.1 Newtons. We can

101
00:08:16,212 --> 00:08:21,408
now copy these internal forces in the real system.

102
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:26,570
That is to say that in the real system, we are going to replace

103
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,740
the basic color of each bar by

104
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,957
the conventional color for the tension, red.

105
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:42,118
And we will write, we will sketch the internal force drawing

106
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:47,110
a kind of small piece of cable with an element of tension and then,

107
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,320
here, we will write 7.1 Newtons.

108
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Likewise,

109
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,480
for the segment on the left, also

110
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,416
7.1 Newtons. We now want to take an interest in

111
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:12,190
what happens near the supports. We are going to

112
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,579
study a free-body which cuts the cable and which

113
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,526
stops just before the support on the left. I draw again this

114
00:09:22,526 --> 00:09:28,112
free-body. Once again, there will be a segment

115
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:33,380
of cable which is parallel to the segment on the right.

116
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,256
We are going to draw the beginning of the support. What is the internal force in

117
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:37,940
this cable ?

118
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:44,790
Well, we know it, it is the internal force N1 which is equal to 7.1 Newtons.

119
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,518
Of course, we could say that the internal force just near

120
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,485
the support is 7.1 Newtons which goes in the other direction.

121
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:56,335
Actually, in the field of

122
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,720
construction, it is often useful to know the

123
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,634
vertical and horizontal components of the forces at the

124
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,750
supports and that is what we are going to do here.

125
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,494
So, what would interest us, it would be to know the

126
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:15,040
vertical component here

127
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,173
and the horizontal one of these internal forces.

128
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:21,860
And this, we are going to be able to do it directly in the Cremona diagram.

129
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,275
In the Cremona diagram, we were taking an interest in the internal force N1.

130
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:30,509
Now, in the orange free-body, we use the internal force N1

131
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:33,316
in the other direction, thus we place a head of

132
00:10:33,316 --> 00:10:36,653
arrow at the other end and we take an interest in both

133
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:40,496
internal forces V and H which are

134
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:45,388
in equilibrium with this internal force. And it thus corresponds

135
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:49,830
to a vertical component V and an horizontal component H

136
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:55,250
of force at the support. We

137
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,580
can directly read their value in millimeters

138
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,575
and see that V is equal to 5 Newtons

139
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:10,060
and H is also equal to 5 Newtons.

140
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,251
We are going to do the same with the free-body of

141
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:23,708
the support on the right. I am going to be

142
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:28,575
very quick here. The internal force

143
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:33,380
is, of course, equal to 7.1

144
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,210
Newtons. And we have a vertical component

145
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:44,050
and a horizontal component. We

146
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,682
reuse the vector N2 but in the other

147
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:54,790
direction which corresponds to our pink free-body.

148
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,626
Then, we will have a

149
00:11:59,626 --> 00:12:04,980
horizontal internal force

150
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:11,030
and a vertical internal force. We read once again

151
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,373
their value. 5 Newtons for

152
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:22,950
the vertical internal force and 5 Newtons

153
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,800
for the horizontal internal force. To understand well,

154
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,062
particularly if we want to come back to our solving later, I am going to indicate

155
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:37,030
in the Cremona diagram, at which

156
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:40,985
free-body corresponds which part of the construction.

157
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:46,075
So for the first part of the construction with the force of 10 Newtons and both

158
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:52,770
internal forces N1 and N2, it was the free-body of the load.

159
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,780
Then, we have had the orange

160
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,835
free-body with the internal force N1 and the

161
00:13:00,835 --> 00:13:06,325
forces at the supports on the left and finally

162
00:13:06,325 --> 00:13:10,820
the pink free-body with the internal force N2 and

163
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,859
the forces at the supports, H and V on the right.

164
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:19,480
You can note that I used the same symbol for H and V.

165
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,971
I knew beforehand that

166
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:23,619
these two quantities had the same value, otherwise

167
00:13:23,619 --> 00:13:25,389
I would have used, and we are going to do it

168
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:29,252
later in other lectures, I would have taken H

169
00:13:29,252 --> 00:13:32,920
left and H right, V left and V right.

170
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:41,126
We can note that the sum of both vertical forces, 2 times

171
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:45,525
5 is equal to 10 Newtons, thus equal to the applied load.

172
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,540
That is logical, this applied load must be transmitted to the supports.

173
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,162
What is interesting is to note that the sum

174
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:54,183
of both horizontal forces, we have an horizontal force on the top of the

175
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,790
Cremona diagram, which points towards the left, and an horizontal force, of

176
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,845
the same value 5 Newtons, which points

177
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:04,410
towards the right on the bottom. The sum of the horizontal forces is thus

178
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:10,832
zero, in this case. Last point

179
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:17,328
of glossary, the shape of the cable which we have thus obtained

180
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:23,310
is called the funicular polygon.

181
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,889
This is an important expression which will often come

182
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,630
back in the rest of this course.

183
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,690
Well, we have made this construction for a load of 10 Newtons.

184
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,146
Now, what happens, if as in the video

185
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:43,455
on the left, we add a second force of 10 Newtons ?

186
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,810
So, I propose you to think about it and why not to calculate the results.

187
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,661
What are the internal forces in the cable

188
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:57,800
under the effect of a load, not anymore of 10 Newtons, but of 20 Newtons ?

189
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,610
I meet you later to discuss about this solution.

190
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,980
Indeed, we have noted, when I added a second load,

191
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,820
on the system, that the shape of the system did not change.

192
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,375
Thus, the construction that we have made before

193
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:15,110
with 10 Newtons, we are going to be able to make it again.

194
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,360
I am going to make it again quickly.

195
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,490
Now, with a force

196
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:36,159
of 20 Newtons. Then,

197
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,630
we trace a straight line parallel to the first segment of cable.

198
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:51,980
A straight line parallel to the second segment

199
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,355
of cable. And, we can directly read the

200
00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:05,410
internal forces, which not surprisingly, are simply doubled.

201
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,000
Of course we could have spared ourselves this

202
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,976
extra work, simply saying, well, the drawing

203
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:19,455
which I made before for

204
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,930
10 Newtons, I am going to use it for 20 Newtons.

205
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:27,911
If now I say that here, it is equal to

206
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:33,772
20 Newtons, it just changes the scale of the drawing and I can read 

207
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:39,890
seventy-one millimeters which would correspond to 14.2 Newtons.

208
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,890
It would be, of course, much more reasonable.

209
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,440
If some of you said to themselves

210
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,320
that we could proceed in this way, well, congratulations, you have well understood how this works.

211
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,395
We now want to look at another

212
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:53,310
parameter which has a large influence.

213
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,914
So, I introduced to you already the concept of rise

214
00:16:56,914 --> 00:17:00,617
which is the height between the supports and the lower point of the cable.

215
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:03,370
What happens if the rise changes ?

216
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,903
We have already solved the

217
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:09,770
basic configuration with a cable at 45 degrees which I draw in

218
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,840
red, and whose the Cremona construction is

219
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,210
already available on the right. Now, we want to look at

220
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:26,040
a variant with half the rise.

221
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,322
How am I going to proceed for the solving ?

222
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:37,990
Well, exactly in the same way than before.

223
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,048
So, I am going to make a free-body around the load of 10 Newtons.

224
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:46,870
I am going to cut a segment of cable on the left, a segment of cable on the right and

225
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:52,461
in the Cremona diagram on the right, I am going to copy parallels

226
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:57,560
to both segments of cable to close the polygon 

227
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:03,480
of forces, which expresses the equilibrium. So, here I make the polygon of forces

228
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,670
which corresponds

229
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:15,022
to the pink configuration. And we can

230
00:18:15,022 --> 00:18:21,740
note that the internal forces increase.

231
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:28,980
Here, it is equal to 11.2 Newtons.

232
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,620
For the record, in the red configuration, we had 7.1 Newtons.

233
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,220
We did not change the load, we just decreased the rise by half.

234
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,492
What happens if we are even more drastic and

235
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:51,785
that we divide the initial rise by four ?

236
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:55,330
Well, we obtain this red configuration where

237
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,845
the cable

238
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,650
is very horizontal.

239
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,218
Once again, we are going to make the same

240
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:08,820
construction, we trace the parallel to the orange segment.

241
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:30,181
And, likewise, the

242
00:19:30,181 --> 00:19:35,810
left part.

243
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,610
And this time, the internal force reaches

244
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,950
20.6

245
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,905
Newtons. I am going to introduce now

246
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:56,194
the concept of slenderness, which is

247
00:19:56,194 --> 00:20:02,990
equal to the ratio between the span and the rise,

248
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:07,740
it is something which is important, which we will see again later.

249
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,405
And what we can see is that if the ratio between

250
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:15,081
the span and the rise increases, that is to say either if the span

251
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:20,622
increases and the rise does not change, or, like in our case, if the span

252
00:20:20,622 --> 00:20:27,430
does not change but the rise decreases, so, the internal forces increase.

253
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:33,880
Conversely, if the slenderness decreases, the internal forces decrease.

254
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,760
We will see that it is not a linear increase but

255
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,450
that it is an increase which can sometimes be very sensitive depending on

256
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,728
the type of structure we consider.

257
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:46,311
In this lecture, we have looked at the structural system which

258
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,300
applies for a cable subjected to a single load.

259
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,988
We have studied the free-body of the load,

260
00:20:52,988 --> 00:20:55,980
we have obtained the internal forces in the various segments of cable.

261
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,678
We have seen that they were tensile internal forces.

262
00:20:58,678 --> 00:21:01,589
We have also studied the internal forces which act

263
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,660
at the supports and the influence of the slenderness and we have

264
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:10,630
seen the relationships which exist between the load, if the load increases,

265
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,381
the internal forces increase, and the slenderness, if

266
00:21:13,381 --> 00:21:16,560
slenderness increases, the internal forces also increase.
