1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,685
Hello.

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:08,618
In this video, we will see how to explain the equilibrium of two persons

3
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:11,814
who are practicing tug-of-war.

4
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:16,405
We will see how the weight of the persons intervenes, how

5
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:20,244
we can determine the internal force in the cable, and what

6
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:23,070
are the effects of the ground on the persons who

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,270
are practicing tug-of-war.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,341
A very simple exercise, it is an exercise of tug-of-war in which both persons

9
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:34,314
are exactly identical. For this case, we have a

10
00:00:34,314 --> 00:00:39,860
person on the left, with a weight of 800

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,093
Newtons, a person on the right, with a weight of

12
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:50,654
800 Newtons. Then we are going to have an internal force in

13
00:00:50,654 --> 00:00:55,978
the rope, and an internal force under the feet of the person,

14
00:00:55,978 --> 00:01:00,298
which we will be able to reveal by means of a

15
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:05,444
free-body. Actually, we want to take an interest in three

16
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:11,161
free-bodies, the free-body of the man on the left, cutting

17
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:16,200
just under his feet, and cutting the rope.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,150
The free-body of the man on the right, which is exactly the same.

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,132
And finally, a little free-body with

20
00:01:32,132 --> 00:01:36,170
a segment of cable on the middle, whose you will see that it is useful for us anyway.

21
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,976
So, first, we have the weight, the 800 Newtons

22
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:45,308
of each of these two persons. We

23
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:50,860
have the effect

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,660
of the rope on the man on the left, on

25
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,920
the intermediary segment and on the man on the right.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,220
So, a priori, we are going to say that there is a tension T one, and a tension T two.

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,704
But if we have a look on the equilibrium of the free-body in

28
00:02:12,704 --> 00:02:16,560
the middle, we will see that there are, acting on this free-body,

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,912
only two forces, the force T one which pulls towards

30
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:21,820
the left, the force T two which pulls towards the right.

31
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,364
Thus, necessarily, T one must be equal to T two, and then, is equal to

32
00:02:27,364 --> 00:02:31,036
T, which we will use in the following. So, we needed this

33
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:36,930
free-body anyway. If we extend the line of action of the

34
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,342
force T on the left and on the right, it

35
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:48,520
will cut the line of action

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,140
of the force of the weight.

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,500
And, to have the equilibrium, it will be necessary

38
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,840
that the force under the feet should be converging with these two other forces.

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,870
Then, that these three forces are converging.

40
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,847
And we thus get, that the force, under the feet

41
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:18,406
of the person on the left, S one, passes by this point.

42
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,586
And likewise,

43
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:26,090
the force under the feet of the person on the right,

44
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,700
S two.

45
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,696
Let's draw the acting forces, for the

46
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:40,830
free-body on the left in the Cremona

47
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,764
diagram. So, here, we have

48
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:52,280
the weight of 800 Newtons.

49
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,645
We are going to have the force T

50
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:01,010
which acts on the horizontal axis. We are not totally sure

51
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,202
until where. Then, we know, on the other hand,

52
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:10,740
the direction of the force S. I make the transition,

53
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,480
a little bit quickly. Excuse-me.

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,284
So, we get the force S one, and the force

55
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:25,075
T which express the equilibrium of the free-body on the right. 

56
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:29,990
Thus, this person is in equilibrium, and we can read

57
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,710
graphically the value of the internal force in the cable, which is equal to T.

58
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,635
Let's now take a look at the equilibrium of the person on the right.

59
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:45,035
To do that, we are going to reuse the segment T that we have already drawn.

60
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,640
In this way, we are not going to introduce any mistakes.

61
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:55,640
So, we are going to introduce the new force of 800 Newtons.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,075
We are going to reuse the segment T, in the other direction,

63
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:06,666
and we are going to close the polygon of forces expressing the equilibrium of the

64
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:13,000
person on the right, by the force under the feet, S two.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,770
This construction, in which we combine two polygons of forces,

66
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,850
together, with one or several shared forces, is called a Cremona diagram.

67
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,818
This Cremona

68
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:31,665
diagram will be a construction that we will use very often, thereafter.

69
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:37,491
So, it is very important to understand well how we construct it,

70
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:42,430
and to see well the meaning of the various components of this diagram.

71
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,912
Let's now look at a tug-of-war

72
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:48,145
a little bit more realistic, between two persons.

73
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,833
The person of 800 Newtons, that we know

74
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,860
well, and another person evidently lighter.

75
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,444
It is quite clear that the lighter person was not able to stay

76
00:05:57,444 --> 00:06:00,140
in equilibrium, when the heavier person,

77
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,026
on the left, began to lean back.

78
00:06:03,026 --> 00:06:07,466
But let's try to see why, in the Cremona diagram.

79
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,218
We have, here, on the left, a person of

80
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:16,692
800 Newtons, and on the right, a person of indeterminate 

81
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:23,276
weight, but clearly

82
00:06:23,276 --> 00:06:29,465
lighter. We draw the line of action of these two

83
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:34,642
forces, since we will need them after. And we

84
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:40,790
draw the line of action of the internal force in the cable.

85
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,779
This construction enabling us to obtain the

86
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,649
direction of the internal force under the feet.

87
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,280
We can see that this person, in this case, did not really

88
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,980
lean on the heels, on tip-toe.

89
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,190
So, here, we have S one.

90
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:12,610
Then, we can notice that the second person is more leaned back

91
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,960
with an internal force S two, under her feet. Let's now have a look at the Cremona diagram,

92
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:34,084
with the force of 800 Newtons, the

93
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:40,286
direction of the internal force T, the tension in the cable.

94
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:45,320
And, we copy the inclination of the person.

95
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,848
It gives us the complete solving of the equilibrium of the person on the left.

96
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:07,060
Then, with the internal force T in the cable, and the internal force S one under the feet.

97
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,372
Let's look at what is about the person on the right.

98
00:08:10,372 --> 00:08:13,592
Using the construction of the Cremona diagram,

99
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:17,960
we already know the internal force T, and we directly

100
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,950
obtain the internal force S two,

101
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,720
under the feet of the person, and, we deduce from that what must

102
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,594
be the weight of this person. We do not need to

103
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:41,615
know it, but we could determine it graphically.

104
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,211
What we can notice

105
00:08:43,211 --> 00:08:46,676
that the inclination of the person

106
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:50,838
on the left, alpha one, is lower than the inclination alpha two.

107
00:08:50,838 --> 00:08:53,805
We can see it even more clearly here.

108
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:55,767
We have alpha one, here, alpha two.

109
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:58,648
Just a this moment, we still have the equilibrium,

110
00:08:58,648 --> 00:09:00,942
but you have seen in the video that just

111
00:09:00,942 --> 00:09:04,461
after, the person on the right loses her equilibrium, while

112
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,486
the person on the left leans down a little bit more. 

113
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,416
Why is it

114
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,594
possible ?

115
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:11,458
Well, precisely because, if we

116
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,826
supposed that both persons had the same

117
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,450
friction capacity, then, the person on

118
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,550
the left could increase more his inclination without sliding.

119
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,068
Actually, if we take a closer look on the feet, we

120
00:09:24,068 --> 00:09:28,990
notice that the person on the left had very favorable shoes.

121
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,137
So, in all likelihood,

122
00:09:33,137 --> 00:09:38,182
the alpha max of one, is greater than the alpha

123
00:09:38,182 --> 00:09:43,390
max of two. Thus, the person

124
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:48,549
on the left would have been able to lean back more than the person on the right and would have won.

125
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:50,714
But on the other hand, if we come back to

126
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:53,009
the previous diagram, what we can see is that

127
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,845
the person on the right, because she is

128
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,978
lighter, must, anyway, in all cases,

129
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:04,265
lean back more than the person on the left to offset the tensile internal force T.

130
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:07,610
I should have put the second arrow on T

131
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,650
for the Cremona diagram to be complete.

132
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:16,070
So, in these conditions, the person on the right has simply no chance to win.

133
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,030
Even if, actually, both friction

134
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,737
coefficients would have been equal, she would not have any chances.

135
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:23,108
The only

136
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:26,418
configuration, in which the person on the right could have a chance, that is if

137
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:29,320
the heaviest person wore, for example, roller skates. 

138
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,990
In this way, the person on the right had a chance to win this game.

139
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,622
We can ask ourselves the question, when we see that, to know if tug-of-war

140
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,660
is really a sport, since actually,

141
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,640
what counts is a friction coefficient.

142
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,584
We can imagine that all the participants will have good shoes and

143
00:10:43,584 --> 00:10:45,248
a good friction coefficient, and

144
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,380
on the other hand, it is the weight of the persons.

145
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,300
So, obviously,

146
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,315
the heavier team is going to win.

147
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:54,369
In conclusion, we have seen in this video on tug-of-war,

148
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,480
how to isolate the free-bodies which

149
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,324
enable us to determine the individual equilibrium of each person.

150
00:11:01,324 --> 00:11:03,360
We have been able to construct the polygon

151
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,900
of forces which expresses the equilibrium of each person,

152
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,061
and combining these two polygons

153
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:13,870
together, we have created a new construction

154
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,020
which is called the Cremona diagram, which will be

155
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,646
very useful for the rest of this course.

156
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:24,716
