00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,485
Hello. In this video, we will see how

2
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:12,970
to solve the equilibrium of a body, of a free-body subjected to three forces.

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,120
Until now, you remember that we have

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,410
solved the equilibrium of a body submitted to two forces.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,934
For example, its weight and the ground reaction.

6
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:25,198
But we have not, it is the first time that we see

7
00:00:25,198 --> 00:00:28,260
a body, if you look at the picture on the screen,

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,640
a body which is subjected to three forces :

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
its weight, the ground reaction, and then the effect

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,070
of a rope of which the person takes hold.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,020
We are going to proceed in the following way, in this lecture.

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,632
Since we know how to obtain the resultant

13
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:45,410
of two forces, we are going to solve the equilibrium

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,572
of a system of three forces, obtaining first, the resultant of two of the forces.

15
00:00:49,572 --> 00:00:50,580
Then, we will apply

16
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:54,570
the principles of the equilibrium of two forces, that we have seen previously.

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,612
Here, we have a video which shows a man which keeps

18
00:00:58,612 --> 00:01:02,657
himself in equilibrium on the ground, taking hold of a rope.

19
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:06,761
It is clear that if we removed the rope, the person would fall down because he

20
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:10,649
leaned back too much, compared to what is possible.

21
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:13,640
This, we have already seen it in a previous video.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,707
Let's look,

23
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:19,690
now, at the free-body which includes this person.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:24,706
This free-body cuts the rope, passes under

25
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:29,734
the feet of the person, entirely surrounds the

26
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:34,758
person, thus, its weight. And the forces we have,

27
00:01:34,758 --> 00:01:40,020
which acts on this free-body,

28
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,370
are the weight of the person G which is equal to 800 Newtons.

29
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,676
An internal force, inside the rope, I think that we can immediately

30
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:56,270
admit that it is a tensile internal force, which we denote by T.

31
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:02,470
And then, the effect of the ground that I am going to denote by S.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,263
But, we do not really know

33
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:11,490
in which direction the effect of the ground acts.

34
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,856
Well, it is precisely what we want to see today.

35
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:17,868
We are going to start on the right, in the polygon

36
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:20,670
of forces with the weight of the person.

37
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,470
The person has a known weight of 800 Newtons.

38
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:35,735
And then, we also know that acts on this free-body, the internal force

39
00:02:35,735 --> 00:02:41,180
T in the cable.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:46,900
We can, thus, very easily obtain,

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,630
in the polygon of forces, the resultant of these two forces,

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,994
which we are going to name

43
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:57,688
R GT.

44
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:03,040
It is the resultant of the weight of the person, and of the tension.

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,548
And, we get, not only the, the

46
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:09,220
magnitude of the resultant, but also its orientation.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,550
What we know from the previous video, it is that these, this resultant must

48
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:22,050
necessarily pass by the intersection of the line of action of the weight, and of the

49
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,950
line of action of the force in the rope, thus, by this

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,915
place, here. I copy, now,

51
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:36,818
the resultant, with its direction in the

52
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:41,780
real system. This,

53
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,180
it is the line

54
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,598
of action of the resultant. And then the resultant itself, well,

55
00:03:53,598 --> 00:04:01,540
acts, here. We have named it, then, RGT.

56
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,610
Now, in our free-body, we still only have two forces, now.

57
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,930
The resultant RGT, and the effect of the ground S.

58
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,570
Are these two forces in equilibrium ?

59
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,824
Well, let's have a look.

60
00:04:13,824 --> 00:04:17,848
What do we know, for two forces to be in equilibrium ?

61
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:20,802
Well, they have to be equal and opposite.

62
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,700
So, we can calculate the magnitude of the RGT which is

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
a little bit greater than 800 Newtons, let's say roughly 900 Newtons.

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,340
But now, we have to know by where it passes.

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,499
Well, what we can see, it is that for two

66
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:37,620
forces to be in equilibrium, it is then necessary, that these two

67
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,220
magnitudes should be equal. But also that, the line of action should be the

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,530
same one. So, that will only be possible if the force

69
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:56,530
F has the same line of action. I am going to erase the old forces.

70
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:14,235
It is now necessary that this force S should have the same line of action than the resultant,

71
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:19,030
what we can obtain in this this way.

72
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,590
And, at that time, we can see in the polygon of forces, that

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,213
this force has the same magnitude than the resultant

74
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:44,850
RGT. And for the equilibrium to be reached,

75
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:50,080
it is necessary that the polygon of forces

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,600
should be closed.

77
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,900
And at that time, well, 

78
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,550
the resultant, the vectorial sum is also zero.

79
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,593
What we can notice, moreover, looking again at the drawing, on the right,

80
00:06:08,593 --> 00:06:13,619
it is that these three forces, at that time, the force G, the force T, and the

81
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:20,560
force S are converging on one point.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,113
We have, thus, two conditions for the equilibrium,

83
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:37,566
that the vectorial sum is zero, that the

84
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,474
polygon of forces is closed, and that these

85
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:41,910
three forces are converging on only one point.

86
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,462
Before going further, we want to look at what

87
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,550
happens, if the man, keeping his

88
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,638
feet at the same place, and without lowering his

89
00:06:48,638 --> 00:06:51,822
hands, lowers its body bending the knees.

90
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:55,440
Thus, he makes his center of gravity go down.

91
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,808
What does it change to the equilibrium ?

92
00:06:57,808 --> 00:07:00,112
Well, you have seen that in the video, I have

93
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,910
nevertheless moved a little bit my arms. 

94
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,800
Well, that is not a big deal.

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,390
We can imagine that I did not move them.

96
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:11,176
And then, to simplify the reasoning, we are also

97
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:15,030
going to admit that the rope was perfectly horizontal.

98
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,780
That was not totally the case, but that was not that far from it either.

99
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,735
In addition to the internal force

100
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:24,733
in the rope, we have, as applied force

101
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,834
to this free-body, the weight of the person.

102
00:07:27,834 --> 00:07:33,040
So, the person, here, went down.

103
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,810
And then, of course, we have the effect of the ground on the person.

104
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,394
How do we solve this problem ? Well, we just did it.

105
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:43,555
We have to find, first, the intersection of the line of action of

106
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,852
the internal force in the rope, and of the line of action of the

107
00:07:45,852 --> 00:07:47,201
weight of the person.

108
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:54,790
So, I trace the line of action of the weight of the person in both free-bodies.

109
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:05,540
And then, I trace the line of action of the internal force in the string, then, horizontal.

110
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,680
And we obtain two intersections.

111
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,540
Well, since the person has carefully gone down, 

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,300
keeping his center of gravity on the same line of action,

113
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,751
the lines of action, on the left and on the right,

114
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,603
are identical, and there is no problem.

115
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,730
This is the same point of intersection that we have there.

116
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,630
What's about the feet ? Well, likewise.

117
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,030
The feet having not

118
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:47,980
moved, the internal force under the feet S, passes by the same place than before.

119
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,636
Let's now look, in the Cremona diagram what, what happens.

120
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:04,581
So, we have, here, the weight of the person

121
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:09,478
of 800 Newtons. We have

122
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:14,605
the line of action of the internal force in

123
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:19,700
the rope, and then, a parallel, of course, and then

124
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,110
the line of action,

125
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,970
of the action of the ground on the person. Well, we have solved 

126
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,776
our problem. Thus, we can, now, trace the

127
00:09:34,776 --> 00:09:40,566
force of the ground S, and the tensile internal force

128
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:44,989
T that we get. We can see that the person

129
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,366
was less leaned in this

130
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,661
configuration, than he was before.

131
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:52,386
Thus, the tensile internal force T is smaller than before.

132
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:58,250
What we can also see, it is that each of these forces, in the polygon of forces,

133
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:06,160
is parallel to both other forces in the real system.

134
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,850
What does it mean ?

135
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,230
It means that only one polygon of forces

136
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,708
represents the equilibrium of these two configurations.

137
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,252
Thus, the person has lowered his centre of

138
00:10:16,252 --> 00:10:19,734
gravity, but all the rest having remained similar,

139
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,966
well, the internal forces under the feet, in the

140
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:24,670
rope, and so forth, remained the same.

141
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,570
We can generalize this observation, saying that if we move

142
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,275
a force, not only a

143
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:42,410
load, on its line of action,

144
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,910
the equilibrium

145
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,520
does not change. Thus, the equilibrium,

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,988
and the internal forces in the elements of the structure does not change.

147
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:01,493
So, that is very convenient, because

148
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,342
that is true that maybe before, you

149
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,933
have asked yourself the question, particularly, I know

150
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:08,106
that it often happens, when we use the applet.

151
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:12,740
Is is correct to place the force

152
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,406
with the tip of the vector which is on the center of gravity ?

153
00:11:16,406 --> 00:11:19,199
Should I put the tail of the vector on the center of gravity ?

154
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,110
Should I place the force anywhere else ?

155
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,810
Actually, as we now see, we can freely place this force, higher,

156
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,447
lower, even really lower, or really higher, as long as

157
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,342
the line of action passes by the center of

158
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,351
gravity, as the line of action does not change.

159
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:35,250
We can make the vector slide as we want to.

160
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,313
We have, here, a very similar configuration, where the man, instead

161
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:45,250
of pulling on a rope, leans on a column, in front of him.

162
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,245
It is clear that, one more time, without the column, the man would fall down,

163
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,700
since the resultant of his weight is considerably in front

164
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,220
of the position of the action of the ground on the person,

165
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,740
Here, in the corresponding free-body, then, we pass just under the hands,

166
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,990
then under the feet.

167
00:12:14,155 --> 00:12:19,320
We have, acting on this free-body,

168
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,905
the weight G of 800 Newtons.

169
00:12:24,905 --> 00:12:28,650
So, we have seen that we have not really used the solving, but

170
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,716
we can use it to graphic scale, to obtain the various internal forces.

171
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,500
Maybe we are going to do it later.

172
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,350
We are going, consequently, to have a compressive internal force

173
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,813
which acts from the column on the hands, which

174
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:49,184
I call C. And then, always, the effect of the

175
00:12:49,184 --> 00:12:54,406
ground. So, we do not exactly know where it is.

176
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:59,934
Actually, we know it, since what we saw before is that it is necessary that the

177
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:05,322
line of action of the weight, which is,

178
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:11,732
here, the line of action of the compression in the arms, and the

179
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:17,904
line of action of the internal force under the feet

180
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:23,868
converge in only one point. And then, we can see, I had

181
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:29,044
quite well drawn my force, thus, the, the internal force S.

182
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,500
I can take off

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,770
the question mark.

184
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,500
Let's construct the entire polygon

185
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,370
of forces for this person, to scale.

186
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,190
So, we put 800 Newtons.

187
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:50,880
And we have a compressive internal force. Well, we do not know until where it

188
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,081
goes, but we can trace the line of action. Then,

189
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:01,095
we will have the internal force under the feet. We know the line of action, and then

190
00:14:01,095 --> 00:14:06,092
now, that we, for the polygon to be closed, we can 

191
00:14:06,092 --> 00:14:11,819
accurately trace it. So, this is the internal force S.

192
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:17,970
And now, we can know the magnitude of the internal force C.

193
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:22,002
So, we are going to read them. To scale, there is no problem.

194
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:30,560
Here, we have roughly 38 millimeters, that is to say 380 Newtons.

195
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,170
And then, here, we have 900

196
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,640
Newtons for the internal force in the legs of the persons.

197
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,782
In this video, we have seen how

198
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,327
to solve the equilibrium of a free-body on which act

199
00:14:47,327 --> 00:14:48,185
three forces.

200
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:51,617
For the free-body to be in equilibrium, we have seen

201
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:55,950
that it is necessary that the vectorial sum of the three forces should be zero.

202
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,363
In addition, we have seen, and that is another

203
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:07,280
way to express the fact that it is equal to zero, that the polygon of forces must be closed.

204
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,875
And then, we have seen that for the equilibrium to be possible, it is necessary that

205
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,645
the three forces which act on this

206
00:15:26,645 --> 00:15:29,380
free-body converge in only one point.
