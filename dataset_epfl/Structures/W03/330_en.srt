00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,296
Hello.

2
00:00:01,296 --> 00:00:09,028
In this video, we are going to study the effect of friction, and to consider

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:14,915
how a body can stay in equilibrium while it is on an inclined plane.

4
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:17,615
We are going to look at what is the effect

5
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:22,100
of the operating surfaces, what is the influence of the inclination.

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,064
We are going to look at, in which case there will be a sliding,

7
00:00:25,064 --> 00:00:27,015
and in which case there will be equilibrium.

8
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:29,661
Obviously, it is the case which interests us

9
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:33,018
more, since our structures must be in equilibrium.

10
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:35,710
Let's start by considering our test bench.

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:41,094
This test bench will be characterized at each measure by

12
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:48,115
the maximal inclination, which will be tolerable for a surface condition.

13
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,140
That is to say for which angle

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,680
the block that we can see, will not slide on the surface.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,776
We can note that there are two tracks on our

16
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:01,055
test bench, one Teflon track, on the left, white.

17
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,710
It is a synthetic material whose the

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,070
property is to offer very little sliding.

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,941
And, on the right, we simply have a

20
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:13,790
wood track that we will use to compare to.

21
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,230
And, you can see that

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,390
the block has several surfaces which

23
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,626
will enable us to study several surface conditions.

24
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:24,432
We start with the block, whose the lower face

25
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,994
is in Teflon, which slides on the Teflon track.

26
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:30,940
This is the condition where there will be the least friction.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,700
Indeed, we only get 9 degrees of possible inclination.

28
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,678
When we make sliding the slab, the lower face

29
00:01:40,678 --> 00:01:42,706
of the wood block, on the Teflon

30
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:47,570
track, we get an inclination of 11 degrees.

31
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,235
When we make sliding the block with the lower

32
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:54,230
face in rubber on Teflon, we reach 13 degrees.

33
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,370
Finally, if we put 

34
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,386
the block whose the lower face is in sandpaper

35
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,904
on the Teflon track, we

36
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:04,698
reach a much larger angle of 34 degrees.

37
00:02:04,698 --> 00:02:06,210
Let's look now,

38
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,370
quickly, at what happens when we make sliding on the wood track.

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,495
The Teflon block, with the lower part in Teflon on the

40
00:02:15,495 --> 00:02:20,700
wood track, is able to stay in equilibrium with an angle of 15 degrees.

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:26,290
Wood on wood, we get 18 degrees.

42
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,470
Sandpaper on wood, we get 41 degrees.

43
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,300
Then, the best result is rubber on wood with 45 degrees. 

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,810
Well, maybe you now understand why, when we make

45
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,538
hike in the mountains, we use

46
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,928
shoes with rubber soles.

47
00:02:44,928 --> 00:02:47,724
It does not work very well on Teflon, but it

48
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:51,372
works very well when the surface is a little bit rougher.

49
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,060
We are going to summarize all the results in this table.

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,976
So, for the Teflon track,

51
00:02:56,976 --> 00:03:03,136
we got an angle of 9 degrees with Teflon, of 11 degrees with

52
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:09,980
wood, of 13 degrees with rubber, and of 34 degrees with  sandpaper.

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,690
For the wood track, we got 15 degrees with Teflon.

54
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,495
We can see that it is not the same value than with wood on Teflon.

55
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,005
Why ?

56
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:20,197
Because it is not exactly the same wood.

57
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:21,541
If you remember,

58
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:25,620
to have seen the wood block which was in a quite hard wood, while the track

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,250
was made by a wood a little bit softer. Wood on wood, we get 18 degrees,

60
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:38,662
sandpaper 41 degrees, and rubber 45 degrees.

61
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:42,340
We will come back, later, to this table to complete it.

62
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,960
We want, now, to look at the equilibrium of the block,

63
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,472
on an inclined plane.

64
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:53,055
So, it is subjected to gravity, to its weight G.

65
00:03:53,055 --> 00:03:58,725
Then, there is a contact force which acts under the

66
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:04,220
structure and a friction force which prevents it or not to slide.

67
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:10,999
To solve this question of equilibrium, we simply

68
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:14,848
pass, a free-body under our block.

69
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:17,228
Thus, we include, all the weight, and

70
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:20,370
we are going, thanks to the free-body, to reveal

71
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,370
the contact force and the friction

72
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,570
force which act just under the block.

73
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,900
So, here, I draw again the free-body, on the right.

74
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,360
The gravity force which I had already drawn, it obviously acts in this way

75
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,347
we have G,

76
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:42,246
the weight of the block. The contact force just acts at

77
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:49,930
the interface, here, between the block and the inclined plane.

78
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,606
It is perpendicular to this inclined plane, and its magnitude

79
00:04:55,606 --> 00:05:01,290
is equal to the projection of G on this perpendicular,

80
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:06,270
to the surface. Well, I am going to draw, here, G.

81
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,302
I represent it by a noncontinuous line, because G does not really act here.

82
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:14,930
When I am going to make its projection, on the perpendicular to the surface.

83
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,490
Well, we project it in this way, perpendicularly.

84
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:26,280
And I can read that this contact force C,

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,708
it has this magnitude.

86
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,800
So, we have here, again, a perpendicular.

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,740
And the third force which acts on this body, it acts, here.

88
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:42,800
It is the friction force.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,585
Well, we can notice one thing, it is

90
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:51,809
that these two forces, the friction force

91
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,911
and the contact force, they intersect, here.

92
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:58,199
And there is no intersection with the weight.

93
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,883
Thus, we do not have what we had to get.

94
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:03,720
What we must get, to have the equilibrium,

95
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,504
is an intersection of the three forces on only one point.

96
00:06:07,504 --> 00:06:08,973
This is a little mistake.

97
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:11,323
Note that the complete solving would not be extremely

98
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:14,062
complicated, it is simply not useful, at this stage.

99
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:17,086
What we are going to do, for the rest of this course, is that we are going to consider

100
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:18,435
a slab much thinner.

101
00:06:18,435 --> 00:06:21,845
Thus, we are going to make a much smaller mistake.

102
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:24,848
In theory, we would need a slab with an infinitesimal

103
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:28,252
thickness, then we would not make any mistake anymore.

104
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:34,530
So, we have G which acts on the slab. We have the contact force.

105
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:42,464
Then, I am going to draw it on the center of gravity, as if it acted 

106
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:43,376
on the center of gravity.

107
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,054
It is not totally right, but

108
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:48,820
the mistake is quite small, the friction force.

109
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,190
Now, let's look in the polygon of forces what it means.

110
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,210
We copy the force corresponding to G.

111
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,386
Then,

112
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:07,680
we add the force

113
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,016
corresponding to C, to the contact

114
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:18,286
force. So, the contact force, it

115
00:07:18,286 --> 00:07:23,514
has a length which goes until the projection

116
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:28,210
of G on the vertical. You can see, that is approximately right.

117
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:33,405
If now, we trace the resultant

118
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:38,064
of these two forces. what we can notice is that this

119
00:07:38,064 --> 00:07:43,440
resultant is here. It is parallel to the slope.

120
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,560
It is Rcg.

121
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,666
And it is a force which pushes our body downwards.

122
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,193
Well, that is this force which is going to make our body sliding.

123
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:55,839
If there was not any friction, our

124
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,554
body would slide, for example, like a skier on

125
00:07:58,554 --> 00:07:59,134
a slope.

126
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:01,540
There is a very little friction, when we ski.

127
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:09,535
Thus we have, as result, a driving force.

128
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:10,800
What happens ?

129
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,950
This is the case which interests us, when the body does not slide.

130
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,342
Well, when the body does not slide, it means that there is

131
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:21,715
a friction force which acts in the upwards direction.

132
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:23,965
I draw it a little bit staggered,

133
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:26,970
simply for us to be able to see it.

134
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:33,363
Here, a friction force, which

135
00:08:33,363 --> 00:08:37,755
opposes to the sliding, and which closes the polygon of forces.

136
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,730
Thus, our body is in equilibrium.

137
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,652
Let's now look at what are the reasons for

138
00:08:43,652 --> 00:08:47,735
a body to slide, or for a body to be in equilibrium.

139
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,126
So, we will have

140
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:54,660
a body in equilibrium, if

141
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,980
the magnitude of the

142
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,840
resultant of C and G is less than or

143
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,020
equal to the magnitude of the maximal friction

144
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,929
force. Why the maximal friction force ?

145
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,828
Well, imagine precisely that we have the case of

146
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:20,900
the rubber block which can hold until 45 degrees.

147
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,831
If we put it on a slope of only

148
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:29,496
20 degrees, it does not mobilize all the force.

149
00:09:29,496 --> 00:09:33,084
And it is not the friction force of 45 degrees which acts.

150
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,868
Because if this friction force would act,

151
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:39,288
then, our body would go up the slope thanks to the friction.

152
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,216
That is not right.

153
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:44,666
What is right, is that the friction force adapts to correspond

154
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:48,672
exactly to the force which is necessary not to have sliding.

155
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,015
This, until the maximum value that it can reach.

156
00:09:52,015 --> 00:09:55,370
We have seen that for Teflon on Teflon, the force would not be large.

157
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,502
However, when we have rubber on wood,

158
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,330
well, the force is quite large.

159
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,948
We often write this value of the

160
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:05,601
maximal friction force, as (Greek) nu times

161
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:11,330
the magnitude of the contact force. We have, here,

162
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:17,354
a perpendicular. And, we can recognize,

163
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:21,906
here, the inclination angle alpha, that we find again,

164
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:26,485
here, in this construction. And we can notice that the

165
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:31,540
maximum friction

166
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,802
force will be

167
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,306
equal to the contact force

168
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:45,910
times the tangent of alpha max, which

169
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,960
is the maximum angle that we have been able to measure.

170
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:56,930
So, in other words, nu equal to the tangent

171
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:04,705
of alpha max. Let's come back to this table, to complete it.

172
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:09,240
We are going to add here, each time, alpha max.

173
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,400
Then, here, we are going to say nu equal to the tangent of alpha max.

174
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,710
And we have the values, here, zero point 158,

175
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,510
zero point 194, zero point 674,

176
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,988
zero point 231, zero point 268,

177
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:39,231
zero point 325, zero point 869,

178
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:44,120
and one point zero in this case, of 45 degrees.

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,080
In this video, we have seen the reasons for

180
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,562
which a body slides or not on an inclined plane.

181
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:54,175
That is that the friction. There is

182
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:58,375
no sliding if the maximum friction which can be mobilized

183
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,655
is larger than the driving force resulting

184
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,094
from the weight and from the contact force.

185
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:08,066
We have seen that the friction coefficient nu can

186
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:13,142
be deducted from a simple experiment taking the tangent of

187
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:16,630
the maximal possible angle of inclination.

188
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,280
We will not really come back on friction thereafter,

189
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,656
but it is important to understand well that

190
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:27,275
these friction forces do not have a nature

191
00:12:27,275 --> 00:12:30,075
fundamentally different from the other 

192
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:33,800
forces, with which we will be confronted.
