Hello.

2
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:08,021
In this video, we will introduce the concept of resultant,

3
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:12,730
and we will see how to get the resultant of two converging forces.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:19,771
The resultant of two or several forces, is a force whose effect

5
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,898
on the structure is the same than the one of the group of force which we consider. 

6
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:27,764
That is to say that this force, it will have as

7
00:00:27,764 --> 00:00:30,631
magnitude, the vectorial sum, the magnitude of the

8
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:33,337
vectorial sum of the forces, and we will see

9
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:37,100
how to determine the position of its line of action.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,214
We have here an example of a real system with

11
00:00:41,214 --> 00:00:46,980
two forces, force one, and force two.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,780
We also want to draw

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:59,000
to better see it, the line of action of each of these two forces.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:12,442
I drew, on the left, these two forces with their accurate position, and their

15
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:15,108
magnitude, although the magnitude does not need

16
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,022
to be necessarily accurate in the real system. 

17
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:21,345
And then, on the right, in the polygon of forces, I am going to copy

18
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:23,145
these two forces with their accurate

19
00:01:23,145 --> 00:01:25,940
magnitude, to construct their vectorial sum.

20
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,827
So, force number one,

21
00:01:29,827 --> 00:01:35,800
first, then force number two.

22
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,063
The resultant of these two forces,

23
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,750
is simply constructed like the vectorial sum.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,505
And, we denote, usually, the resultant by R.

25
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:09,806
For the rest of this course, I will use

26
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:13,658
very generally, the color orange to identify the resultant.

27
00:02:13,658 --> 00:02:17,277
Now, we have got the magnitude of this resultant.

28
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:19,768
We can measure it in centimeters, since we actually have a

29
00:02:19,768 --> 00:02:22,426
scale drawing in the polygon of forces on the right.

30
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:25,490
But now, the question is, where does this resultant act ?

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,295
Well, we want it to act

32
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,618
so that it produces the same effect than the two other forces.

33
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:34,012
Thus, we cannot make it act anywhere,

34
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,790
we have to determine where its line of action is located.

35
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,442
So, I am going to draw the direction of

36
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:42,670
the line of action in the polygon of forces.

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:47,959
And now, we want to copy this line

38
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,416
of action in the real system. And for these two forces

39
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:56,688
to have the same effect on the system, it

40
00:02:56,688 --> 00:03:00,462
is necessary that this line of action should pass by the intersection of

41
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:03,778
of the lines of action of

42
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:07,040
forces one and two, in the real system.

43
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:17,274
Thus, we have, here, this intersection, between the

44
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:23,663
lines of action of force one, and force two.

45
00:03:23,663 --> 00:03:30,680
And we get, in this way, the line of action of the resultant.

46
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,000
And we can, of course, copy this resultant with

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,200
its magnitude, which we will have measured in the polygon of forces.

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,210
So, but as we do not need to draw it

49
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,796
to scale, here, it is enough to copy it in this way.

50
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:55,100
Of course, you can see that there is a limitation to this construction.

51
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,130
It is that both forces should be converging.

52
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,631
That is what we had in the title of the lecture.

53
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,607
We will revisit

54
00:04:01,607 --> 00:04:05,260
several times the theme of the resultant, particularly for the case of

55
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,858
several forces, and for the case of forces which are not converging.

56
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:11,406
For example, forces which are parallel, or else which

57
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:14,420
would cross, let's say outside of our sheet of paper.

58
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,808
We have seen in this video, that the resultant

59
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:21,710
is obtained by making the vectorial sum of the forces.

60
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,300
But, for the 

61
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,815
resultant to have the same effect, we also have to

62
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:29,069
take into account the intersection of the lines of action of the

63
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,310
forces, which will enable us

64
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,830
to determine, one point on the line of action of

65
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,900
the resultant, with which we will be able to trace in the real system.

66
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,000
I repeat, in the real system, we draw the position of the forces to

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,728
scale, but the forces

68
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:46,140
do not need to be necessarily to scale.

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,156
In the polygon of forces, the

70
00:04:48,156 --> 00:04:51,756
forces must be drawn accurately to scale,

71
00:04:51,756 --> 00:04:54,500
and obviously, with the good orientation.
