00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,378
In this video, we are going to see how to use the applet i-Cremona,

3
00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,167
to solve of a system of three forces.

4
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:17,326
We will see how to introduce a force. I think that you remember this.

5
00:00:17,326 --> 00:00:19,840
We will see how to introduce supports.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,790
We will see how to activate and control the funicular polygon.

7
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,439
And finally, we will see how we can

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,490
obtain the internal forces which act within our structures.

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,712
So, we have, here, in our applet, the person,

10
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:40,154
whose known weight of 800 Newtons acts at the center of gravity.

11
00:00:40,154 --> 00:00:44,500
Let's say here. Then, we are going to look at a

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,536
free-body, for example, here, which includes the person, which

13
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:54,336
passes just under his feet, which cuts the rope, and

14
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:58,720
which obviously includes the load which acts on the person.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,217
We do not have, naturally, supports, but where the structure

16
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:07,036
has an intersection with the outside, where we are going to

17
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:11,151
have an internal force, we can also introduce a support, either

18
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:15,604
under the rope, either under the feet, I introduce first a support

19
00:01:15,604 --> 00:01:16,640
under the feet.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,266
I draw your attention on the fact that the first support

21
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,790
that I introduce has a little one inside the triangle,

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,166
this enables to know that it is the first support.

23
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,240
You will see that it is important later.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,020
I introduce a second support, where the free-body cuts the rope.

25
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,179
Now, I can start the solving,

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,630
clicking on the button "funicular polygon".

27
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,814
This button "funicular

28
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:45,402
polygon", generates a funicular polygon, we are going to say, arbitrary.

29
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:47,641
But, we are going to be able to control it by

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:51,457
means of the following button, which is called initial tangent.

31
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:55,700
And thanks to this initial tangent, if we come closer to the support

32
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,900
one, there is a little line, a little black line which appears.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,614
We click on this black line, and we keep the button of the mouse pushed down.

34
00:02:03,614 --> 00:02:05,987
And it enables us to 

35
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:09,330
give the correct shape to the funicular polygon.

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:14,280
That is to say that it follows the rope, here, and it passes, obviously, by the feet.

37
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,392
And if we look at the part on the right, we can

38
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:20,760
see that the construction of the funicular polygon has been done correctly.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,235
If we place the cursor on the middle

40
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:27,801
of the segment, we can directly read the internal force.

41
00:02:27,801 --> 00:02:30,810
Thus, the internal force in the legs is equal to 827 Newtons.

42
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,346
Then,

43
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:34,985
in the part on the right, this force has enlightened in yellow,

44
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:39,160
to indicate where it is located in the Cremona diagram.

45
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,305
Likewise, here, the internal force in the horizontal part,

46
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:45,699
in the rope, is equal to 225 red.

47
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,450
That is to say in tension.

48
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,264
And, they are going to appear.

49
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:54,345
That is almost horizontal, 178 degrees instead of 180.

50
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:56,985
If we place the cursor on the intersection

51
00:02:56,985 --> 00:03:01,456
of both forces, well, or of the three forces, then we can see that

52
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:05,920
the equilibrium of these three forces is made by this polygon of forces.

53
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,350
That is useful for certain occasions, especially when we

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,600
will have more complicated structures.

55
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,336
I am now going to quickly redo the same

56
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:16,250
example, with the man who leans against a column.

57
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,830
So, again, a load of 800 Newtons. 

58
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,310
Here, I do not draw the free-body, it is not necessary.

59
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,170
I place a support under the feet, a support against the column.

60
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,050
I activate the funicular polygon.

61
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:35,084
I solve it. Sometimes, it is a little bit difficult.

62
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:39,730
We can draw away as much as we want from the support.

63
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,986
Well, we can imagine the internal force in the arms, it is something like that.

64
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,408
So, we have, in the legs of the 

65
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:52,016
person, a compressive internal force of 860 Newtons.

66
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:57,500
And in the arms, an internal force of roughly 250 Newtons.

67
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,038
In this lecture, we have seen that to solve a system of three

68
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:03,235
forces in the applet, it is possible

69
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:06,315
to introduce only one of the forces, and two supports.

70
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:09,010
These supports, when we use the resolution of the

71
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,466
funicular polygon, will enable us, once we will have

72
00:04:12,466 --> 00:04:18,890
defined the proper geometry, to obtain the internal forces between each support and the force.

73
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,470
We will be able to read their value and their inclination in the applet

74
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,110
which will be used, for example, to later for a dimension the structural element.
