00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,217
This lecture deals with the material properties

3
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:09,760
and with the principles of dimensioning of structures.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,120
The content of the session

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,999
will be as follows: we will first talk about springs, which

6
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:20,807
will enable us to study elasticity, linearity,

7
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:25,346
reversibility and the concept of stiffness, then we will talk

8
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:30,348
about the principle of stress and deformation applied to common construction

9
00:00:30,348 --> 00:00:36,460
materials and we will introduce the concept of modulus of elasticity.

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,567
Then, we will talk about the usual construction materials which are

11
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,490
steel, concrete, timber and glass. 

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,947
We will see their main properties,

13
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:50,538
particularly their strengths, their moduli of elasticity and

14
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:52,120
their modes of failure. 

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,550
In this context, we will talk about ductility and fragility.

16
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,685
Then, we will deal with the dimensioning of the structures, for which 

17
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,638
we will explain the principles of dimensioning to guarantee as

18
00:01:03,638 --> 00:01:06,950
well the safety of people as a satisfactory

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,010
usage of the structure, in particular with regard to its deflections.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,005
Then, we will deal with the example of an elevator, as it is a simple

21
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:19,488
example, which is accessible with the tools we have already seen within

22
00:01:19,488 --> 00:01:23,723
the framework of this course and for which we will see how to choose the

23
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:27,531
diameter of the main cable, to guarantee the safety of

24
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,361
people and also a good comfort,

25
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:32,100
that is to say that the elevator should stop at the required level.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,380
Finally, we will have a few examples and exercises which will conclude this lecture.

27
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,541
I now invite you to begin with

28
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:48,081
the first video of this lecture which deals with springs and elasticity.
