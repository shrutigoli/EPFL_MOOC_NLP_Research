00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,032
Hello, in this video, we will deal with dimensioning which is

2
00:00:09,032 --> 00:00:12,776
the operation of choosing the dimensions to give to an element

3
00:00:12,776 --> 00:00:16,545
of structure, in such a way that it can resist the internal forces

4
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:19,470
to which it is subjected, and not to deform too much.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,025
The principles of, dimensioning are,

6
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:25,018
then, one the one hand to ensure the structural safety,

7
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,171
that is to say that the element of structure should not break under a normal use.

8
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:32,799
On the other hand, that its use, also,

9
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,126
can be made in a comfortable way.

10
00:00:35,126 --> 00:00:39,070
For example, without exaggerated deformations or vibrations.

11
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,037
And then, finally, we wish to build

12
00:00:42,037 --> 00:00:44,716
structures which are economical, which

13
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,408
do not uselessly waste materials, and

14
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,250
which can also behave in a sustainable way.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,951
We have two fundamental components

16
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:55,630
in the operations of dimensioning.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,940
On the one hand, the service limit state.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:05,004
You can see in the illustration, a roof which, which is not flat,

19
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,620
and for which there is no water drainage system which is  foreseen.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,029
Well, the result, it is a puddle of water

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,372
which stagnates, which is not aesthetically pleasing, in which, maybe,

22
00:01:14,372 --> 00:01:16,595
mosquitoes will be able to develop, and which has 

23
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:20,654
clearly negative effects on the quality of the behavior.

24
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:24,850
So, we want to limit the deformations.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,790
And on the other hand, as I already said, it is not

26
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,790
something we will deal with within the framework of this course.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,690
But, the service limit state is also linked to the limitation of vibrations.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,926
For example, if we build a footbridge, and if people are scared

29
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:43,732
to step onto this footbridge because it vibrates

30
00:01:43,732 --> 00:01:45,859
too much, well, we will have not built a

31
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:51,455
structure which is satisfactory. The ultimate limit 

32
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:58,550
state ULS (in French ELU), while the service limit state is abbreviated SLS (in French ELS). 

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,750
The ultimate limit state deals with the structural safety.

34
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:08,610
So, we absolutely have to avoid a failure of the structure.

35
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,095
In the picture you can see, below, there

36
00:02:18,095 --> 00:02:21,180
were two children in the back of the car.

37
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,162
This is something that we cannot tolerate. 

38
00:02:24,162 --> 00:02:26,759
We do dangerous jobs, when

39
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,583
we deal with constructions.

40
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,635
And it is unacceptable that a structure which

41
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,268
we have designed behave in such a way.

42
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:38,089
So, we absolutely have to avoid failure, and it means

43
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:47,320
that we will have to think about failure scenarios.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,500
It can be, for example, the impact of a truck on the column of a building.

45
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,624
To ensure that even in a such case, there will not be a failure and that

46
00:02:56,624 --> 00:03:03,362
people who have not been involved are injured or worse,

47
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:09,370
in an accident. So, we want a very, very low

48
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:18,120
probability that a failure occur. 

49
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,072
It is quite radically distinguishable, by the way, from the service limit

50
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:25,568
state, because, we talk about deformations.

51
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,514
Well, does it deform too much, or just a little

52
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:28,913
bit too much ?

53
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,627
This is something which is probably debatable.

54
00:03:31,627 --> 00:03:34,201
However, failure is not debatable.

55
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,868
We want, in what follows, to take

56
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:40,246
the example of an elevator, because it is a simple

57
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:42,798
example, which corresponds to the knowledge, on

58
00:03:42,798 --> 00:03:45,270
structures and on internal forces that we have learned up to now.

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,231
So, on an elevator, we have a cable

60
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:53,072
which links the elevator to the upper part of the building.

61
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:53,999
And this cable,

62
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:57,612
is used both to make the elevator go up and go down, but

63
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:01,080
also to support it, and thus, to insure the safety of its occupants.

64
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,849
Well, let's think for a while, what does it

65
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,930
mthe service limit state mean for an elevator ?

66
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:13,160
Well, it clearly means to be able to easily enter in

67
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,050
and exit from the elevator.

68
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:25,930
Let's say that if when the elevator is full and that it

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,060
arrives at a given floor, it is two or three centimeters too low, there is

70
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,480
a significant risk that the people are going to trip over

71
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,020
the ground at the exit, and this, it is

72
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,170
something which is not good for the usage.

73
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,930
So we want that the elevator arrive quite accurately at the level of the floor.

74
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:51,570
Conversely, we absolutely want to avoid, for the ultimate limit state,

75
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:57,250
we absolutely want to avoid failure.

76
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,733
That is to say, the fracture of the cable, and obviously,

77
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:04,348
with as consequence, the risk of fall of the elevator.

78
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:05,410
So, it is clear enough.

79
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,065
Now, we are going to see, how we can,

80
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,060
with the tools that we know, solve this problem. 

81
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,470
Let's start by the service limit state. I remind you that it is abbreviated ELS.

82
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,630
We have, here, put some data about this elevator.

83
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,182
First, we have two elements in the elevator, the self-weight

84
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:29,410
G which corresponds to the self-weight of the cabin.

85
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,469
Its value is given as 10 kiloNewtons.

86
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,880
That is to say that the maker told us,

87
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,155
well, the elevator that we are going to deliver,

88
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:39,938
will weigh 10 kiloNewtons. And then, there is the number of persons

89
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:44,958
that we can put in the elevator, who are 10 persons of 80 kilograms, it

90
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:51,420
corresponds to 800 kilograms. That is to say 8 kiloNewtons of force.

91
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,612
Let's now think about the case of the cabin.

92
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:57,717
It is very easy to adjust the cabin when it

93
00:05:57,717 --> 00:06:00,981
is empty, for it to stop, exactly at the level of the floors,

94
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:01,710
isn't it ?

95
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,294
What we wish, is now that, if this, if in

96
00:06:06,294 --> 00:06:10,270
this empty cabin, we add 10 persons, then, 8 kiloNewtons.

97
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:17,606
Well, this cubicle, goes down to not more, to not more than delta l equal to 10 millimeters.

98
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,845
We consider than 10 millimeters, it is acceptable.

99
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:23,476
People are going to raise a little bit their foot.

100
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:26,426
And if the cabin is too high, or too low of 10 millimeters, 

101
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:30,568
then there will not be any problems for the use of the elevator.

102
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,753
Now, we need another data.

103
00:06:33,753 --> 00:06:36,674
It is the length of the cable, and for this

104
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:41,860
exercise, we are going to take a length of 50 meters.

105
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,930
Then, when the cabin is in the

106
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,000
stationary position and it is empty, it is at position 0.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,310
And then, it is going to go down of delta l,

108
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,951
when we are going to place the loads Q inside.

109
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,994
I put only one man.

110
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,257
Obviously, there would be ten persons. 

111
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:09,780
And delta l, we know, has to be less than or equal to 10 millimeters.

112
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,237
How can we solve this ?

113
00:07:12,237 --> 00:07:15,790
Well, using the formulae which we have seen previously.

114
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,400
We know

115
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,682
that epsilon is equal to delta l over l.

116
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:25,504
Then, delta l, we know it, not more than 10 millimeters.

117
00:07:25,504 --> 00:07:26,386
l, 50 meters.

118
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,910
Thus, we can calculate epsilon.

119
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:37,416
What we know, on the other hand, it is that E the modulus of elasticity, our cabin,

120
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,046
I forgot to mention it, is made by steel.

121
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:42,564
Then the modulus of elasticity

122
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:46,200
is equal to 205 000 Newtons per square millimeter.

123
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,200
As we know, it is equal to sigma over epsilon.

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,332
Then epsilon, we know it, we just have seen it before.

125
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:57,640
But, we do not know sigma. Then, we can get sigma

126
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,355
equals to E times epsilon equals

127
00:08:03,355 --> 00:08:08,610
to E times delta l over l.

128
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,660
Sigma being the stress in the cable.

129
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,251
How can we get it ? The stress in the cable is, is equal

130
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:21,450
to the internal force in the cable, divided by the section of the cable.

131
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,450
And it is thus equal

132
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,294
to E times delta l over l. What is the value of N ?

133
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:40,338
In our case, N is equal to the load of the occupants.

134
00:08:40,338 --> 00:08:43,931
That is to say the 8 kiloNewtons that we

135
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:47,560
are going to add from the stationary position.

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,115
The weight of the cubicle does not play a role in this, in this case.

137
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,283
Since we know N, what, what are we looking for ?

138
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:59,850
We are looking for A, we get

139
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,380
that A is equal to N over E

140
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,218
times L over delta l. Here, I believe that we know everything.

141
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:14,972
Thus, we can substitute. N is equal to 8,000 Newtons.

142
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,986
We have to be careful, with the units. I am going to do

143
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:25,205
everything, in Newtons and in millimeters. The length is thus equal to 50,000 millimeters

144
00:09:25,205 --> 00:09:30,455
divided by the modulus of elasticity of steel which is equal to

145
00:09:30,455 --> 00:09:35,808
205,000 times the limit of 10 millimeters.

146
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:40,784
And all this, if I calculate it,

147
00:09:40,784 --> 00:09:46,243
it is equal to 195 square millimeters

148
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:51,170
Then, how to get

149
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,210
the diameter of a cable whose we know the area ?

150
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,550
So, everyone knows the area of a cable, as pi r squared.

151
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,510
For us, it is much easier, for the

152
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,785
rest of this course, to use a very

153
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:11,085
similar formula which says that the area of a circle

154
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,870
is pi times the diameter squared, divided by 4.

155
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,235
If you try it mathematically, you will see that

156
00:10:16,235 --> 00:10:19,800
it is equal to pi r squared, we do not use the radius, because we cannot

157
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,582
really measure the radius easily. So, what does it mean ?

158
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:33,205
It means that D is equal to the square root of 4 times A over pi.

159
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:37,950
And this number is roughly equal to 16 millimeters.

160
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,605
Thus, for the service limit state, it is necessary

161
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:46,190
that the diameter of the cable of the elevator should be 16 millimeters. 

162
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,165
We can now deal with the ultimate limit state.

163
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:55,252
You remember of the idealized stress-strain

164
00:10:55,252 --> 00:11:00,410
diagram, with, here, the value fs for steel.

165
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,850
But it is clear that when we buy steel,

166
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:06,730
we do not know if it is going to be exactly as

167
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,510
good as it should, as it should be.

168
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,463
On the other hand, it is very true within the framework of the case of the elevator.

169
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,608
Maybe it is going to wear out, with time.

170
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,376
Then, what we are going to do, it is that the

171
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,300
dimensioning is going to take place at a lower level.

172
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,731
We are going to consider a material which has the same modulus,

173
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:36,434
but whose the strength fsd. The design

174
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:42,044
strength fsd, is thus equal to the strength of the material,

175
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:48,180
divided by a certain gamma m, which is a partial safety

176
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,280
factor,

177
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,210
which is given by the standards, with

178
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,824
values which vary according to the material. For the case of the example we

179
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:10,066
are now dealing with, we are going to use

180
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:14,968
the value fsd of 80 Newtons

181
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:19,762
per square millimeter. This value is quite low, compared

182
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:21,400
to the steel strength.

183
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,779
We will see the steel strength a little bit later.

184
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,507
But it is totally justified, because it

185
00:12:25,507 --> 00:12:27,344
is going to be used for an elevator, where 

186
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:32,240
the wear and tear, the repeated loads, the impacts, etc, need to be taken into account.

187
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,693
Thus, we have to beware of the materials, but who has never tried to

188
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:41,095
sidle as the ninth person in

189
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,591
an elevator, which can only contain eight persons?

190
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:44,950
Or even after the ninth,

191
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,293
to try to be the tenth one, or the eleventh one?

192
00:12:47,293 --> 00:12:50,985
We know that human beings, but also loads in general

193
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:56,142
do not tend to respect what is written in the standards.

194
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:58,316
So, we are going to beware of the

195
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:01,354
loads, such as they are prescribed or indicated to us.

196
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:05,222
For example, in the case of the elevator, well, the maker told

197
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:09,660
us than the cabin was going to weigh 10 kiloNewtons. 

198
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,297
It is maybe

199
00:13:10,297 --> 00:13:11,767
right, but maybe he has made a

200
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,678
little mistake, that he is going to have to use a sheet metal

201
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:16,710
a little bit thicker, and that suddenly, it will weigh a little bit more.

202
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,446
Or else, during the life of the elevator, we are going to

203
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:23,760
have to add, aboard, a fire extinguisher which will also weigh a certain weight.

204
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,635
Or else, we will want to change the

205
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:28,930
decoration, to replace aluminum panels, maybe

206
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,535
by wood slabs, which can be thick, and then very heavy.

207
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:35,720
In short, we cannot trust, neither the loads

208
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,000
which are given to us, nor the users.

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,808
And the way in which we do this, it is

210
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:47,190
that we are going to work with a design load

211
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,560
which is obtained by punishing the loads

212
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,420
which are given to us. Then, the design load Qd

213
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,495
logically should be the sum of

214
00:14:06,495 --> 00:14:11,844
the self-weight G and of the live load Q. But in

215
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:16,921
fact, we are going to punish G, by a factor

216
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:21,560
gamma G, and the load Q by a factor gamma Q, to take into account

217
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,860
of the fact that we are not totally sure of what is going to happen.

218
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,952
Gamma G is given by the standards,

219
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:30,072
and in a general way, in the European standards, it

220
00:14:30,072 --> 00:14:35,830
is kept everywhere at 1 point 35 and likewise 1 point 5 for gamma Q.

221
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,710
Now, I would like nevertheless to point out that it is not,

222
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,930
because you know that, that you have the right 

223
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:46,280
to be the fifteenth one to enter in an elevator for 10 persons.

224
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,831
Thus, at the ultimate limit state, we have the design

225
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:56,178
load Qd which is equal to 1.35 times the 10 kiloNewtons

226
00:14:56,178 --> 00:15:01,698
of the weight of the cabin, plus 1.5 times

227
00:15:01,698 --> 00:15:07,310
the 8 kiloNewtons of the weights, of the weight of the occupants

228
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,280
which is equal to 25.5 kiloNewtons. Thus, we have here, 1.5 Q,

229
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,440
1.35 G. And if we put everything together, 

230
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,010
we get

231
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,267
a big load Qd. For our 

232
00:15:27,267 --> 00:15:32,530
free-body to be in equilibrium, it is necessary to have, here, a tensile internal

233
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,582
force Nd in the cable. And we

234
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:42,644
need that Nd be

235
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:48,450
necessarily equal to Qd, for the free-body to be in equilibrium. 

236
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,350
Let's look, now, to the side of the strength.

237
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,698
The required strength, it is R which has to be

238
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:01,780
greater that the internal force Nd.

239
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,156
How do we get the strength ?

240
00:16:04,156 --> 00:16:08,080
Well, the strength is equal to the area of the section of our cable

241
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,945
times fsd which is the design

242
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:16,320
strength, as I told you before.

243
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,580
For our case, we are going to take 80 Newtons per suqare millimeter.

244
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,846
Thus, we must have R which has to

245
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:25,380
be greater than or equal to Qd.

246
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,705
We are going to work with the equal part,

247
00:16:27,705 --> 00:16:31,233
but obviously it will be necessary that the section, respectively,

248
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:33,612
the diameter of the cable which we will obtain,

249
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,750
should be at least the value that we are going to obtain.

250
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,870
We know fsd. Thus, we can write that A

251
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,463
required is equal to or greater than Qd over

252
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:54,030
fsd, where Qd is equal to 25,500

253
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,120
Newtons. And fsd is equal

254
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,280
to 80 Newtons per square millimeter

255
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,030
That is to say

256
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,658
319 square millimeters. Thus, the diameter

257
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:20,998
which interests us, it is 4 times 319 divided

258
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:27,564
by pi, square root of this number. It is roughly equal to 20 millimeters. 

259
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:31,121
Then, now, we have two diameters

260
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:32,993
which we have to respect for our cable.

261
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:35,639
On the one hand, for the service limit state, 16 millimeters.

262
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:38,413
On the other hand, for the ultimate limit state, 20 millimeters.

263
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,589
So, it is always the biggest one of

264
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:43,358
the two diameters that we are going to take, of course.

265
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:46,820
Thus, in our case, we will need a cable with a diameter

266
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,569
equal to or greater than 20 millimeters, to be able to support our elevator.

267
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,759
I should clarify that it is more or less by

268
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,590
chance, that in our case, it is the ultimate limit

269
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,634
state with 20 millimeters which controls instead of

270
00:17:59,634 --> 00:18:01,935
the service limit state with 16 millimeters.

271
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,770
These two calculations are independent.

272
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,484
They must be done each time, and it is only

273
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:09,790
once we have the result that we will be able to know or to decide

274
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:15,007
which one of the two, which one of both conditions controls the

275
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:21,600
dimensioning, in our case, once again, the ultimate limit state.

276
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,576
In this lecture on dimensioning, we

277
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,864
have begun by the criteria of dimensioning.

278
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:29,222
We have seen that there were criteria for the service limit state

279
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:33,777
ELS (SLS in English), and then other criteria for the ultimate limit state ELU (ULS in English).

280
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:38,100
We have seen that for this last limit state,

281
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,180
it is necessary to introduce partial safety factors.

282
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:50,260
Gamma m for the materials, or gamma G and gamma Q for the loads.

283
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:55,016
We are now going to proceed to exercises,

284
00:18:55,016 --> 00:18:57,684
within the framework of this lecture.
