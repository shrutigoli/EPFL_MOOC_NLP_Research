00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,624
Hello, in this

2
00:00:04,624 --> 00:00:09,722
lecture, we are going to see how springs behave,

3
00:00:09,722 --> 00:00:15,300
we will introduce the concept of stiffness and the modulus of elasticity.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,030
When we have a body of initial length l,

5
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,205
which is subjected to a tensile internal force N,

6
00:00:26,205 --> 00:00:31,380
that is to say that we pull on the bar,

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,330
we intuitively know that the bar is going to lengthen.

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,774
This bar is in tension, let's characterize the tension by

9
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:47,460
the color red, and the internal force inside the bar, also, by a continuous red line.

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,750
The effect of this tension on our structure causes it to lengthen.

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,040
We have shown it on only one side, here. It extends by a quantity delta l.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,080
Delta l is positive according to our convention.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,870
Let's also remember that the internal force is also positive.

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:09,829
If, however, we introduce a compressive internal force in our

15
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:17,270
structure, a negative internal force, which pushes towards

16
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,210
our structure.

17
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,392
Within the structure, we represent this

18
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:26,560
internal force by a blue line which is often discontinuous.

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,544
Why is it discontinuous ?

20
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:31,936
Well, simply because we could build the element, which

21
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:35,850
is in compression, with, let's say, bricks, piled on top of one another.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,825
They can resist to compression, while obviously, this

23
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:42,324
same material, if it is not continuous, cannot

24
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,445
resist to tension. 

25
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,451
One more time, a blue line means

26
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,830
compression, or a discontinuous line.

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,255
The effect of compression on the body, is to

28
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,424
shorten it, and thus to get a delta l, smaller than 0.

29
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:02,369
It is quite intuitive, since the final length of our body will be l

30
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,492
minus delta l, and thus will be smaller. So, it is logical to

31
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:12,588
say that delta l is negative. In this video, we are going to see

32
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:17,590
how a spring behaves, on which we are going to hang up a weight. 

33
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,918
First, the spring, is initially 200 millimeters

34
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:25,520
long, but the lower end of the spring,

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,110
on which we are going to hang up the others weights,

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,420
we are going to consider that it is at the position 0.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,257
If we introduce a weight

38
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:43,424
of 10 Newtons, we get a measured lengthening

39
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:48,638
of 40 millimeters. If we introduce

40
00:02:48,638 --> 00:02:53,671
a second weight of 10 Newtons,

41
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:58,441
then for a total of 20 Newtons, the lengthening becomes

42
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:02,502
80 millimeters. If we

43
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:07,240
add a third weight,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,790
for a total of 30 Newtons, the lengthening is 120 millimeters.

45
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,480
If we introduced a weight of 15 Newtons,

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,745
that is to say between 10 and 20, well, it is quite clear that we would get

47
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,140
a lengthening which would be between the two, 60 millimeters.

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,486
What does it mean ?

49
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:36,816
It means that we could also put all kinds, a series of

50
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:39,660
loads with intermediate values and which

51
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,060
would always be aligned on one single line.

52
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,100
So, we can trace a line which connects

53
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,330
all these points, which enables us to predict

54
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,203
what would be the behavior under any weight, at

55
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:59,520
the least, between 0 and 30 Newtons. The slope of

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,244
this straight line is 1 to R. The slope of this straight line

57
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:10,630
is called the stiffness. And the stiffness

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,554
R, it is equal to the difference

59
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:21,185
of force, over the difference of length. Then, we have a

60
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:26,800
difference of force of, for example, 10 Newtons over 40

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,478
millimeters, that is to say

62
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,450
0.25 Newtons per millimeter. 

63
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:48,121
If we unload the spring, we had

64
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:54,765
then, this straight line, that we had established.

65
00:04:54,765 --> 00:05:00,345
But, if we run alongside this curve, and if we come back to zero, that is what is shown

66
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:05,389
in the video, on the left, then, we come back to the position

67
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:05,478
zero.

68
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:10,410
That is maybe obvious, but it deserves to be mentioned anyway. 

69
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,209
In this video, we can see what happens, when we add a

70
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,513
second spring to the first one, and when we

71
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:21,050
follow, as we did before, with the lengthening. 

72
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:26,516
So, at the beginning, we are a position 0. When we add 10 Newtons, the lengthening

73
00:05:26,516 --> 00:05:31,428
is 80 millimeters, 20 Newtons 160. So, 30 Newtons, 240.

74
00:05:31,428 --> 00:05:35,733
With again, a linear behavior.

75
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,334
If we have a look on the slope, hum, this

76
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:53,660
straight line, the stiffness has a value of 10 Newtons

77
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,350
over 80 millimeters,

78
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,030
that is to say of 0.125

79
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:10,100
Newtons per millimeter.

80
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,644
For the record, we had, here, a slope of

81
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:21,390
0.25 Newtons per millimeter.

82
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,691
So, we can see that if we increase the length of the

83
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:29,720
system, doubling the length of the spring, we increase this length,

84
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,050
the stiffness of the system is divided by 2.

85
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,750
In this video, we can also see a configuration

86
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,910
with two springs, but instead of having

87
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,450
put them one below the other, we have put them one

88
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,690
next to the other, with a little device which enables to

89
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:48,470
hang up the load directly to both springs in the same time.

90
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,335
So, this time, we have a displacement, of only 20 millimeters

91
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:59,448
for 10 Newtons, of 40 millimeters for 20 Newtons, and of 60 for 30 Newtons. 

92
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:00,888
Then, we have a

93
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:07,750
behavior with a much steeper slope, than before.

94
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,910
And, the stiffness, here,

95
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:19,141
is equal, we are going to see, 10

96
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:25,320
Newtons for 20 millimeters,

97
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,754
that is to say 0.5 Newtons per millimeter. So, what

98
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:36,275
we can see here, it is that if we increase the section of our spring,

99
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:41,380
or, if we double the number of springs, we also double the stiffness.

100
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,972
If we write the stiffness, we have thus seen that it

101
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:50,393
was inversely proportional to the length of the system, and then

102
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:53,795
that it is proportional to the number of springs, to be more

103
00:07:53,795 --> 00:07:58,150
general, to the area of spring available, that is to say A.

104
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,670
And then, we are going to introduce, here, a constant

105
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,710
E, of which we are going to see the meaning very

106
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,605
soon, but for the moment, we are simply going to say

107
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:12,080
that R is equal to E times A over l.

108
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,490
That is to say proportional

109
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,700
to the section and inversely proportional to the length.

110
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,597
What we have seen, now, regarding the stiffness of a structure,

111
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:32,314
it is a behavior which on the one hand, followed straight lines.

112
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:35,610
Thus, a behavior which was

113
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,070
linear, where the lengthening increased proportionally

114
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,860
to the loads.

115
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,072
On the other hand, what we have seen

116
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:48,378
is that we could increase the load, or

117
00:08:48,378 --> 00:08:51,402
decrease it, and that we are going to find again the

118
00:08:51,402 --> 00:08:53,955
initial position of our springs, at the end.

119
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:58,380
This behavior, we call it an elastic behavior.

120
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,275
An elastic behavior, is when a structure 

121
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:06,420
gets its shape back, its initial shape, when it is unloaded.

122
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,164
And actually,

123
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:12,930
here, we have got a behavior which was both linear and elastic.

124
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,974
Then, we call it a linear-elastic behavior.

125
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:29,008
On the left, we can see exactly the same graph,

126
00:09:29,008 --> 00:09:34,029
with this slope, which is equal to E times A

127
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,160
over l, the stiffness of the structure.

128
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,476
And, on the right part, we have a graph which does not show

129
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:48,706
anymore the internal force, but the stress, and not anymore the lengthening, but the strain.

130
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:52,374
What is the stress ? Sigma, it is the internal force N

131
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:56,281
divided by the section A. As the section A, of a

132
00:09:56,281 --> 00:09:59,961
body is constant, we are dividing by a constant.

133
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:05,578
We get a curve of the same shape. In the same way, epsilon, the

134
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:13,765
strain or specific deformation, epsilon is equal to

135
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:18,714
delta l, divided by l, where l is the initial length.

136
00:10:18,714 --> 00:10:22,445
So, actually, in relation to the graph on the left, we

137
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:26,310
have divided the abscissa and the ordinate, each time, by a constant.

138
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,657
Thus, we get, another straight line, with a constant.

139
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:33,939
What is interesting, is that, after having done these

140
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:39,110
operations, the slope with which we are left, here, since we have divided it

141
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,810
by A and by l, we are left 

142
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,880
with E, this constant which is thus the stiffness of the material.

143
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,600
On the left, we had graphs for the structure.

144
00:10:56,715 --> 00:11:01,350
And here, we have a graph for the material, and the

145
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,420
feature of the stiffness of the material, we

146
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,882
call it the modulus of elasticity. And

147
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:16,946
it is measured, generally, in

148
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:22,010
Newtons per square millimeter.

149
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,153
In this video, we have seen that the lengthening of a structure is

150
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:33,040
proportional to its length, and inversely proportional to its section.

151
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,805
The stiffness R of the structure is equal to the ratio between the

152
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:44,740
applied load N, and the lengthening that this N induces, that is to say, delta l.

153
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,090
We can write this

154
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,236
value, by the formula E times A over l, where

155
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:54,630
A is the section of the element and l its length.

156
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,290
About the materials, we have also

157
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:01,120
seen that the stresses are proportional to the deformations.

158
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,280
The modulus of elasticity is the stiffness of the material.

159
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,314
And then, we have seen an additional formula.

160
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:12,608
I summarize here the three simple

161
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:18,856
formulas that we have seen so far. Sigma equals N over

162
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:24,700
A. Epsilon equals to delta l over l

163
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:30,850
And then, E, modulus of elasticity, equals to sigma over epsilon.

164
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,832
These three formulas are independent, but combining

165
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:37,707
them together, we will solve quite a few problems. 

166
00:12:37,707 --> 00:12:42,059
That is what we will see in the exercises and the examples which are going to follow.
