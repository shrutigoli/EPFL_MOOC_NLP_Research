1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,847
Hello.

2
00:00:00,847 --> 00:00:04,961
In this video, we are going to look

3
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:08,513
in more detail at the properties of materials.

4
00:00:08,513 --> 00:00:11,177
In the previous video, we have seen that, at

5
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:14,564
least for a moderate level of load, materials

6
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:18,480
behave in a linear and elastic way, that is to say that the

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,516
lengthenings or deformations are proportional

8
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,350
to the loads or to the stresses.

9
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,660
If now I look at

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,613
what happens with a steel rod, I take it in my

11
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:34,532
hands and I bend it, it deforms, it is very clearly visible, if I

12
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:36,917
relax my effort, the rod gets its straight shape back,

13
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,985
it behaved then in an elastic way,

14
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:40,613
and if we did a more 

15
00:00:40,613 --> 00:00:43,650
detailed test, we would see that it is also linear.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,948
I do the same thing with a timber

17
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,520
rod which deforms and with a glass slab.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,690
Of course, the deformations of the

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,790
glass slab are relatively small but we can see that it curves.

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,638
If now I take the steel rod from before again

21
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:04,292
and that I bend it in a more pronounced manner, obviously my effort increases

22
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:08,572
but at a certain moment, I feel that the deformations increase in a much

23
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:13,990
quicker way and if I relax my effort, the rod remains deformed.

24
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,795
Schematically in

25
00:01:15,795 --> 00:01:20,810
the stress-strain diagram, we have an initial part

26
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,294
with a slope equal to the modulus of elasticity of

27
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:30,400
steel, Es, and then at a certain moment, we have a significant increase

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,010
of the strains, epsilon, without the stress increasing.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,129
This level of stress is characterized

30
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:50,530
by the value fs which is the yield limit of

31
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,242
steel. The stage during which the

32
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:58,361
strain increases without the stress increasing

33
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:02,440
anymore, is characteristic of what we call a plastic behavior

34
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,208
thus here we have plasticity

35
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,400
of the material, while in the initial stage we had

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,480
elasticity. Here we look at a tensile

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,790
test of a steel piece in a testing machine of our laboratories. 

38
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,318
What we can see in this diagram on the right

39
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:31,842
is that the internal force increases quickly, the stresses

40
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:37,200
increase quickly until reaching the limit fs, after

41
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,090
which we have an horizontal stage characteristic of plasticity then

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,670
the stress increases again to reach a maximum value

43
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:53,075
here which is characterized by the tensile strength,

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:05,950
then the deformation keeps increasing, we can notice

45
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,384
on the right, on the left, in the video, that on the middle of the test piece, there is

46
00:03:12,384 --> 00:03:18,881
a zone in which the strain concentrate and finally, we see

47
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:25,224
the failure of our element for a stress which is, by the way, lower

48
00:03:25,224 --> 00:03:30,847
than the initial yield stress but importantly with very large

49
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:34,045
strains, four hundred for one thousand, that is to say

50
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:38,190
forty percent of lengthening of the element.

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,780
That is very good, it is a very good behavior,

52
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,840
however, indeed, for the dimensioning of the structures, we

53
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,105
are not going to use these properties because

54
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:50,100
the structure would deform too much to be usable.

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,936
We can here sketch the properties of steel which are

56
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:59,538
characterized by an initial stage, with a

57
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:04,892
modulus of elasticity Es, a yield

58
00:04:04,892 --> 00:04:11,100
stage with the yield

59
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,300
strength fs and a big

60
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:22,532
stage of increase of deformations with the tensile

61
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:28,708
strength ft and then finally

62
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:34,158
the failure, characterized by very significant

63
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:40,274
strains. For the dimensioning of the structures,

64
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:43,250
we are generally going to stay in the extreme

65
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,058
left part of the diagram, that is to say where

66
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:49,978
the strains are essentially of an elastic nature

67
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,898
with sometimes, a little bit of plasticity.

68
00:04:52,898 --> 00:04:55,968
The behavior of a material which

69
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,590
behaves in this way, that is to say with an

70
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,498
elastic stage and then a long

71
00:05:01,498 --> 00:05:05,634
plastic stage, is called a ductile behavior.

72
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:18,335
Let's now look at the behavior of another building material less

73
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:21,510
common, but that we know well, which is the glass.

74
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,890
I take again the glass slab that I had before and I bend it, I increase

75
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,020
my effort and, well, what has to happen happens and suddenly the glass breaks.

76
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:38,580
The behavior can be sketched in a diagram in this way, with a linear

77
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,582
elastic stage with a modulus of elasticity of glass and

78
00:05:43,582 --> 00:05:48,750
then immediately after, we have the failure,

79
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,200
with a certain tensile

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,725
strength. There is no yield

81
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:03,859
stage of the material, we thus have a

82
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:12,671
fragile behavior.

83
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:17,260
This fragile behavior is not extremely desirable but

84
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,290
that is not either impossible to accept it

85
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,204
and we can build glass structures

86
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:23,848
but we have to prevent these problems to occur.

87
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,038
We are here interested in another

88
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:29,200
common building material which is concrete.

89
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,680
On the left, in the testing machine, we have a cylinder of concrete which is subjected

90
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,685
to compression. The compression increases without enabling us to see

91
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:43,932
anything of the behavior. If we look on

92
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:49,165
the right of the diagram which comes from this test, we can see that there is an initial

93
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:54,670
stage with a modulus of elasticity Ec of concrete,

94
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:01,680
and then, this initial stage quickly makes way for a stage

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,200
in which the strains increase in a quicker way

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,560
than simply elastically but the material continues

97
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,598
to show a satisfactory strength until we reach here

98
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,794
the compressive strength of concrete, fc, and then a little bit after,

99
00:07:19,794 --> 00:07:24,610
if you look at the compressive test, we see the appearance of

100
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,821
vertical cracks, parallel to the axis of the internal force which indicates the onset of

101
00:07:29,821 --> 00:07:35,804
concrete failure which happens a little bit later.

102
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:40,232
The behavior of concrete is thus somewhat of

103
00:07:40,232 --> 00:07:44,838
a mix between the very ductile behavior of steel and

104
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:47,690
the very fragile behavior of glass.

105
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,680
Let's sketch in this diagram the behavior of concrete.

106
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,027
In compression, we have seen it, it has

107
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:05,500
a modulus of elasticity, Ec, a compressive strength, fc.

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,959
In tension, concrete really behaves like glass,

109
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,766
that is to say that with the same modulus, it will reach a very low

110
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:21,930
tensile stress and then it will cease to resist.

111
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:26,410
For practical reasons, we can always consider that concrete

112
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,622
is completely fragile when it is subjected to tensile internal forces.

113
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:34,070
The graph on the right sketches the behavior of timber.

114
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,136
In compression,

115
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:38,270
timber has a relatively low strength.

116
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,348
Once it has reached its maximum strength,

117
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:44,016
it crushes then, after

118
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:47,420
a quite significant deformation, it reaches its failure,

119
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,950
then we have a compressive strength. 

120
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,027
However, in tension, the strength is larger, however the

121
00:08:55,027 --> 00:09:00,508
behavior is more fragile, we have a tensile strength larger

122
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:05,800
that the compressive strength and then, in the intermediate part,

123
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,340
we have a modulus of elasticity of wood which

124
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,740
is well identifiable. We have seen in the previous

125
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,964
slides, various behaviors of the materials which can be sketched

126
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:26,620
in this way, with a modulus of elasticity,

127
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,794
a maximal strength and then something

128
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:32,740
which decreases either directly or a little bit later.

129
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,426
We want to idealize this behavior

130
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:45,323
as an ideal elastic-plastic behavior,

131
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,770
with a module of elasticity

132
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,160
and a tensile strength.

133
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,664
Obviously, this does not apply to glass but you will see that

134
00:10:10,664 --> 00:10:12,732
the principles of dimensioning will also enable

135
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:14,570
us to dimension glass structures.

136
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,236
In closing, I am going to give you some characteristic

137
00:10:17,236 --> 00:10:21,204
values of the quantities whose we have talked about for the classic

138
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:26,620
building materials, which are steel, timber, concrete and glass.

139
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,841
Steel has a very high modulus of elasticity which is equal to 205,000 Newtons per square millimeter,

140
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:36,310
its tensile strength is very good, 

141
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,373
its compressive strength is

142
00:10:42,373 --> 00:10:46,030
good but unfortunately, because of the phenomenon of instability,

143
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:48,620
it is a little bit worse than in tension.

144
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:56,040
The specific weight of steel is 78.5 kiloNewtons per cubic meter.

145
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,996
Concrete is a material which varies, but has typically a

146
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:04,020
modulus of elasticity of 30,000 Newtons per

147
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,925
square millimeter, its behavior in tension

148
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:12,527
is very bad, however its behavior in compression is very

149
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:17,300
good and its specific weight is 25 kiloNewtons per cubic metre.

150
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,885
Timber has typically a modulus of elasticity which

151
00:11:22,885 --> 00:11:26,260
is also quite variable but let's say of around

152
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,570
12,000 Newtons per square millimeter, its behavior in

153
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:33,610
tension is good, its behavior in compression

154
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,558
is also good but with some limitations since it has

155
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:41,360
some troubles regarding stability and its

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,879
specific weight varies, but a good timber has a

157
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,480
specific weight of around 8 kiloNewtons per cubic metre.

158
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,234
Glass has typically a modulus

159
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:55,660
of elasticity of 70,000 Newtons per square millimeter,

160
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,630
a good behavior in tension but I do not give it three pluses

161
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,699
precisely because it is a fragile behavior and it has also

162
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:05,460
a quite good behavior in compression but it is also subjected

163
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,068
to the effects of stability and finally it has also a

164
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:13,450
volumetric weight of 25 kiloNewtons per cubic metre, like the concrete. 

165
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,115
We will see in the following videos more accurate values

166
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:23,827
of the strength of these different materials but for the moment, you have

167
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,660
already the modulus and the specific weight.

168
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,756
We have seen in this lecture that in addition to the

169
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:32,515
modulus of elasticity, the properties of the

170
00:12:32,515 --> 00:12:35,810
materials are characterized by the strength.

171
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,402
We have seen that at the time when the failure occurs, there are two

172
00:12:41,402 --> 00:12:44,867
types of behavior which are quite fundamentally 

173
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:48,960
different, ductile behaviors that is to say when the strains

174
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:54,055
increase without the stresses decreasing and fragile behaviors like the one

175
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,830
of glass when all the strength disappears as soon as failure occurs.

176
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,755
We have also seen that the common building

177
00:13:00,755 --> 00:13:05,112
materials are characterized in this way, that some of them are very

178
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:10,356
close to a perfectly ductile behavior like steel, others like

179
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:15,548
concrete or obviously glass are close to a fragile behavior.
