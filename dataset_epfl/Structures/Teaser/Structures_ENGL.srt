Hello, my name is Aurelio Muttoni and I teach structural engineering at EPFL
0:12
Hello, my name is Olivier Burdet and I also teach structures
0:15
at EPFL
0:16
We will be your instructors for this online course.
0:19
Through short videos,
0:21
with demonstrations on maquettes, we want to help you
0:24
discover and understand the behavior of cable and arch structures.
0:29
This course is based on graphical statics, an ancient technique which remains
0:33
very actual and effective today.
0:35
You will learn how to fraw graphical statics constructions
0:38
to obtain the internal forces in structures
0:40
on a sheet of paper, but also using our
0:44
Interent-based applet. Once the internal forces
0:48
in the structures are known,
0:50
we will show you how to choose the dimensions and materials
0:53
to be used to ensure the safety of the structure
0:58
and also to have a satisfactory beheviour in use.
1:03
At the end of this course, you will be able to identify and understand the behaviour of
1:07
existing cable and arch structures and you will have acquired the principles
1:13
that will allow you to conceive and dimension new structurs.
1:17
This course is mainly oriented toward students of architecture
1:21
and civil engineering who will become professionals in the field of
1:25
construction. It is however open to all andcan be interesting to those
1:29
interested in understanding the behaviour and the reasons behind
1:33
the structures that surround us.
1:35
For each of the weeks of the course, you will have to watch
1:36
a series of videos.
1:38
Once you will have watched then and you will have well understood their contents,
1:41
you will be able to start with the exercise, which is an important part and
1:45
will condition your grade for the course. In each exercise, we will ask not only
1:49
questions about the current subject, but also about the previous exercises.
1:53
For our standpoint, it is important to be able to answer well or even very well 
1:58
the question of one week's exercicise
2:02
before starting with the videos of the following week.
2:05
We estimate that the work load induced by this course is between four and six
2:10
hours per week.
2:11
We hope to have awakened your interest for the field of structures
2:14
and look forward to welcoming you soon in the online course L'Art des Structures (The Art of Structures)
