1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,882
Hello.

2
00:00:00,882 --> 00:00:05,292
This is a further lecture about the Burgo paper

3
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,260
mill whose we have studied the roof in one of the exercises.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,843
You can see in this picture a photo of the building

5
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,859
when it was close to be achieved and put in operation.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,010
It gives you an idea about the scale.

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:25,038
Here, I have created a model of this roof in which we can recognize 

8
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:28,410
the cable which we have calculated in the exercise.

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,219
Loads are hung up to this cables, these loads are 

10
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,345
hung up by means of hangers which pass through the roof, because in my

11
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:54,182
case the roof, the horizontal timber element, is not heavy enough to

12
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:57,585
introduce a sufficient load, that is 

13
00:00:57,585 --> 00:01:01,313
why I have introduced this additional element.

14
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:02,123
We can also

15
00:01:02,123 --> 00:01:08,070
immediately notice, studying a free-body for

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,884
a load which is just below the support, that this

17
00:01:12,884 --> 00:01:16,236
hanger is not going to load the

18
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:21,133
cable but to directly introduce its internal force at the level of the support.

19
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:24,070
Thus, for the modelling of the shape of the cable,

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,198
I could have avoided to put these two loads on the left

21
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:27,990
and on the right.

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,762
In the exercise, we did not take into account

23
00:01:30,762 --> 00:01:33,143
what was really happening in the

24
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:37,060
roof and we have introduced a fixed support

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,170
on the left and on the right of the structure.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,300
Well, let's immediately notice that there is no support in the sense

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,321
that the space under these two supports on the left and on the right is,

28
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,000
in reality, empty.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,565
That is even one of the arguments, or one of the advantages of this structure.

30
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:00,574
Well, if there is no support, what happens ?

31
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:06,860
Well, the effect of this support is replaced

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:13,392
by the roof itself, which

33
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:19,400
supports a compressive internal force.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,776
My model here is not accurate enough but

35
00:02:21,776 --> 00:02:25,542
what we had in the exercise, we had indeed

36
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:28,026
a little piece of roof, I draw it

37
00:02:28,026 --> 00:02:32,250
like this, a piece of cable, which had this shape,

38
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,460
and obviously here, we had a certain load,

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,312
Qb, the internal force in a edge hanger, if

40
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:53,536
now I distinguish both free-bodies, first

41
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:58,880
the free-body of the cable which includes the load Qb, to be in

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,425
equilibrium, it must have a tensile force at the support

43
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:11,310
at the end of this cable, and then another free-body with

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:18,016
the end of the roof on which acts this internal force T, well

45
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:21,952
which is not anymore a tensile internal force, which is now a compressive

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:27,285
internal force in such way that the roof is really in compression.

47
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:29,628
The structure which we have here is

48
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:32,830
actually a kind of arch-cable.

49
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,536
Of course, what we have done in the exercise, 

50
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:38,310
only dealing with the cable is absolutely correct.

51
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,790
The cable is a cable, but the whole structure is an arch-cable.

52
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,068
We can also obviously notice that the whole structure looks like

53
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:51,460
a suspension bridge like the Golden Gate Bridge for example.

54
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,820
With a particular difference, it is that,

55
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,487
at the end of the suspension bridge, we have anchor blocks which aim at

56
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:08,060
anchoring the force at the end of the cable, this internal force T which we have at the end.

57
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,148
Here, on the contrary, we do not have anchor blocks, why ?

58
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:15,065
Because the internal force, as I have shown it,

59
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:19,537
is introduced in the roof, in the cross beam.

60
00:04:19,537 --> 00:04:19,849
We thus

61
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:24,558
deal with an auto-anchored suspension

62
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:29,831
system. These systems

63
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:35,159
are quite rare because they require, we are going to see it

64
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:40,240
immediately, they require to be able to build

65
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,981
the whole roof, or the whole element which is gonna support

66
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:48,383
the compression before building the cable, which is generally

67
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:50,760
impossible when we build, for example

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,310
a very long suspension bridge.

69
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,234
Before coming to the construction process of this

70
00:04:56,234 --> 00:04:58,862
structure, we want to look at how

71
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:02,021
it behaves under asymmetrical loads.

72
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:10,155
I draw in blue on the right and on the left the level 1 which is the level of the

73
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:14,990
top of the roof before we introduce an additional

74
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,472
load. I now introduce this load on the

75
00:05:19,472 --> 00:05:24,242
right and we can see that the cross beam immediately goes down and moves.

76
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:30,082
I now indicate in orange the level of the roof after

77
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:35,600
the movement, I characterize it by a 2, we can see

78
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,850
that, on the right, where the load has been added, the roof has gone down

79
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,225
in a significant way while on the left

80
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:49,700
it has gone up, also in a significant way.

81
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,340
What is the real behavior of the structure ?

82
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,045
That is a question which you have been asked, or more exactly

83
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:00,869
we have asked you how could we stiffen the structure

84
00:06:00,869 --> 00:06:03,244
under the effect of asymmetric loads.

85
00:06:03,244 --> 00:06:07,636
You first had to understand how the structure works, essentially

86
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:09,935
what we can see here is that the structure

87
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:13,337
works a little bit like a big swing, when we put

88
00:06:13,337 --> 00:06:15,983
a load on one side, well, all the structure

89
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:18,848
moves, and then to increase the diameter of the cable is

90
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:21,008
not going to change anything to what

91
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:23,456
happens, we are not going to change anything. Likewise,

92
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,931
to change the stiffness of the roof is not going

93
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,833
to have an influence.

94
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:29,334
We can see that the roof here is largely stiff enough, it

95
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:36,140
does not deform, or just a little bit, and then it would not have a significant influence.

96
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,913
Certain persons asked themselves the question, well, what

97
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,037
happens ? Because in this lecture about

98
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:43,497
the stiffening of the cables, we had said that,

99
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,009
the use of a stiffening

100
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,830
beam enabled to improve the behavior.

101
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,962
It is absolutely right, if I study for

102
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:56,088
example this part of the cable, on which

103
00:06:56,088 --> 00:06:59,928
I put a stiffening beam, then

104
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:03,496
if I add an additional load,

105
00:07:03,496 --> 00:07:05,342
what is going to happen is that

106
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,395
the yellow part and probably beyond, is going to induce

107
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:10,869
that the additional load will not only go to

108
00:07:10,869 --> 00:07:12,821
one place, but is going to be distributed on

109
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:16,070
several hangers which will induce that the cable

110
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,194
will deform, but will deform less than under a concentrated load.

111
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:23,824
However, when we have an asymmetrical

112
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,926
load, well, we do not prevent this movement

113
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:29,005
since we have seen in the

114
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:32,050
video that the movement is an overall movement.

115
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,009
What we could have done to stiffen the

116
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:41,067
structure, it would have been to fix the roof to the pylons,

117
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,460
at the places which I have marked with a cross,

118
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,521
because in this way, we would have prevented the

119
00:07:47,521 --> 00:07:50,608
horizontal displacement and it would have as consequence that

120
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:53,660
the vertical displacement would also have been low.

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,876
But we will see later, according to the construction

122
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:01,320
process of the structure, that it was not really feasible.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,222
Let's precisely look at how this roof

124
00:08:06,222 --> 00:08:07,438
has been built.

125
00:08:07,438 --> 00:08:10,630
That is a very particular system which is not

126
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,345
often used but that precisely an interesting example.

127
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:17,140
We can see that the pylons have been built first.

128
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,750
So, we have both pylons,

129
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,830
and then the cable of the central span has been put in place

130
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,550
with hangers, and we have set up the central part of the roof.

131
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,705
In this configuration, we exactly have the same configuration than for a suspension

132
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:49,255
bridge, that is to say that there is no longitudinal internal

133
00:08:49,255 --> 00:08:54,355
forces in the roof. Afterwards, we have added the

134
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:59,266
side cables on both sides, and

135
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:05,508
we have simultaneously add the corresponding element of roof.

136
00:09:05,508 --> 00:09:08,794
This element is in compression and it leans against the

137
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:13,246
transitional part of the roof which is also in compression,

138
00:09:13,246 --> 00:09:17,180
which induces that the compression of the left part is offset

139
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,910
by the compression of the right part, and the structure is in equilibrium.

140
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,774
If we had chosen the solution that I mentioned before,

141
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:30,774
to fix the roof to the pylons, then this compression

142
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:34,392
would not have passed in the central part and we should have supported this

143
00:09:34,392 --> 00:09:37,069
compression in the pylons, which would have led

144
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:40,080
to larger dimensions for these ones.

145
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,545
Well, that is a very particular construction process

146
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:46,569
which, as far as I know, is not very often used

147
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:49,604
but, it can be used, we can be inspired by it

148
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,880
if we want to build such an auto-anchored suspension structure.

149
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:55,916
In this

150
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,838
lecture, we have seen that the structure of the Burgo paper mill is

151
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:05,018
actually an arch-cable, with a load-bearing cable and the roof in compression, it

152
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:10,828
is also an self-anchored suspension system in which we do not have anchor

153
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:14,510
blocks at the ends, we have also seen

154
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,560
how this structure has been built.
