1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,242
Hello.

2
00:00:01,242 --> 00:00:07,480
In this video, we will see a few variations

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,460
around the theme of the arches-cables.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:12,940
We have seen in the previous video that an arch-cable is a

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,006
combination of an arch and a cable, we will see in this video that it

6
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:20,824
can also be a combination of a cable and a strut, and

7
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:24,800
that it can take the shape of a structure which we call lenticular.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,107
We have here an example of a bridge made by an arch-cable, and first,

9
00:00:29,107 --> 00:00:33,775
it is important to notice why this bridge must be an arch-cable.

10
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,645
Well, that is a bridge which has the particularity,

11
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:38,930
you can see it going up, to

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,164
be able to go up and to go down above the river, in

13
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:45,596
such a way that it can let pass boats below.

14
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:49,814
So, it would be impossible to have an arch which strongly pushes at

15
00:00:49,814 --> 00:00:54,082
a height of a few tens of meters. Thus, it is necessary that it should be an

16
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:59,860
arch-cable, we have an arch in the upper

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:04,695
part, and a cable in the

18
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:09,820
lower part. And then,

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,079
obviously, supports on

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,200
these towers, which enable a rising and descending movement.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,287
However, I would like to draw your attention to the fact

22
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:26,122
that there are other elements in this structure.

23
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:30,960
There are vertical cables, about which we did not talk until now.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,528
What we are going to see is that the cables are part of the structure, that they

25
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:41,149
work but that they do not change the functioning of the arch-cable.

26
00:01:41,149 --> 00:01:45,082
We want to look at a certain place where a load Q acts.

27
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:47,442
This load acts at the level of the deck,

28
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:49,399
where the vehicles pass on this bridge.

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,017
Obviously, there is no vehicle now, since the bridge is 

30
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:57,300
going up. Let's isolate a free-body around this

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,580
load, what we have horizontally is the deck, which is cut,

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,030
vertically, we have the load Q, on the bottom, and a piece of cable upwards.

33
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:18,370
We have a tension, T, in the deck,

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,950
which is due to the effect of the arch-cable, and this tension does not change

35
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,712
when it meets a couple of forces which are perpendicular, we are going

36
00:02:26,712 --> 00:02:30,750
to see it again later, and obviously, we have

37
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,822
an internal force N in the cable. Let's make the corresponding polygon

38
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:38,796
of forces. So, we have here the load Q, then the

39
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:43,784
force T which pulls on the left, then

40
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:50,140
the internal force N upwards, and

41
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,515
the internal force T, which pulls on the right, thus my free-body is in equilibrium

42
00:02:56,515 --> 00:02:59,031
and both forces T must necessarily

43
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:01,275
be equal : since both forces N and

44
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:06,110
Q are equal and opposite, both forces T must also be equal and opposite.

45
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,256
So, we can see the fact that there is a

46
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:15,290
hanger does not have any effect on the cable of the arch-cable.

47
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,980
Now, let's look at a free-body on the arch part.

48
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,583
We have

49
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:26,780
the arch, and I exaggerate a little bit, but it changes its direction at this place here, we can

50
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,017
see that it is curved, and the force N which is equal to Q

51
00:03:32,017 --> 00:03:36,962
obviously act on the hanger, and

52
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:41,681
we have a compression in the arch on the 

53
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:47,200
left, and another compression in the arch

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,774
on the right. If we draw the polygon of

55
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:56,938
forces, I start by the compression in

56
00:03:56,938 --> 00:04:02,637
the arch on the right, afterwards I

57
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:08,160
draw the compression in the arch on the left,

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,152
and finally I have the internal force

59
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:18,355
N equal to Q, and my polygon is closed, we can

60
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:23,806
clearly see that it is the orientation change and a little

61
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:29,010
bit the magnitude of the compression in the arch, which support the internal force.

62
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:32,747
So, it was really allowed to say that there is

63
00:04:32,747 --> 00:04:38,460
an arch which carries the loads, and simply a

64
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,400
cable which only holds both ends of the arch together.

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,698
We have here the structures of the general

66
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:51,615
stores of Chiasso, which represents the symbol of the

67
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:54,410
i-structures course, and we are going to see together

68
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,503
why this structure is symbolic and important.

69
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,790
To solve it, we are going to use the applet i-Cremona,

70
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,534
specifically, we are going to use two applets i-Cremona,

71
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,695
because we cannot solve this system in one go.

72
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:09,490
We first want to start, in the applet on the

73
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:12,980
bottom, to solve the problem of the cable.

74
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,470
We have these vertical elements which introduce loads on the cable.

75
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,006
I introduce each time a load of 100 which is the value by default,

76
00:05:26,006 --> 00:05:30,425
and I position the supports, for the cable on the left and on the right.

77
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:33,890
We are going to stop the analyse now, the rest of the

78
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,750
structure is a type of structure which we will see

79
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,286
later, that is a frame, but for the central

80
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:42,090
part, the analysis which we are doing is absolutely correct.

81
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,190
I trigger the funicular polygon and I give it the proper shape.

82
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:46,820
We can see that

83
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,060
on the left part and on the right part, I

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,260
am going to correct a little bit the position of my supports,

85
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,328
we can see that, on the left part and on the

86
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,824
right part, the shape of the cable is approximately right but

87
00:05:58,824 --> 00:06:01,692
that obviously in the middle, it is as though there was

88
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,340
something which pulled the cable upwards.

89
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,030
So, we are going to introduce a force to pull the cable upwards.

90
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:14,727
I first introduce a force of 100, but it is not enough, pressing

91
00:06:14,727 --> 00:06:20,320
shift, I am going to change its magnitude, so we move it a little bit on the left,

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,684
and there you go. When I introduce a force which is equal to

93
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:31,310
roughly 200, 220, 230 here, then I get the proper shape of the cable.

94
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,235
What is the element which can carry this load ?

95
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:38,336
Well, it is precisely the arch, since for the moment, all

96
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:41,736
the loads that we talked about are supported by the cable,

97
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:46,156
since we have these loads on the roof, which go down

98
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:49,740
and which create deformations, and thus

99
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,536
internal forces in the cable, but for the moment there is no force

100
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:57,144
which acts on the arch. Now, for the system to be in equilibrium, we

101
00:06:57,144 --> 00:07:04,250
are going to put a load of 228 downwards, which

102
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:11,178
acts on this arch, and now, we

103
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:13,446
have the internal force in the arch, and we

104
00:07:13,446 --> 00:07:16,005
have the internal force in the cable and 

105
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,630
both sets of forces give

106
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,790
us all the internal forces in the whole structure.

107
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,197
Note that these elements here are in

108
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:26,835
compression, however, this element here, with a force of

109
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:28,915
100 which goes down and a force of more

110
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,040
than 200 which goes up, this element here is in tension.

111
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,198
Thus, we can now draw in this structure the

112
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:40,556
internal forces which act, so there is compression in the upper

113
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:45,342
chord, in the arch, there is compression in these

114
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:50,232
posts, and then there is

115
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:56,410
tension in the lower cable

116
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,890
and in the central post.

117
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:09,080
Why did the engineer Maillart decide to make this structure in this way ?

118
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,350
Well, it is common to have inclined roofs and it is for evacuating rainwater.

119
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,660
But it is not the only reason.

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,357
The reason is that he was probably asked to provide a certain

121
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:27,640
height, for his structure, and that if he had kept the cable as

122
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,060
it was at the beginning, then he should have

123
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,900
built all his structure higher to respect this.

124
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,941
Introducing this small subtlety of change of the cable shape, he managed to

125
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,820
decrease the total height necessary for the

126
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,120
structure, and thus made it more competitive.

127
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,210
Among the variations of arches-cables which

128
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,010
we can make, we can also transform them in cable-and-strut.

129
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,030
In this configuration, we still have a

130
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,320
cable, but it is not rectilinear anymore,

131
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,290
and we still have an arch, but now the arch has become rectilinear,

132
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,544
so we still can call it arch, or we can call it a strut.

133
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:19,110
A strut is an element which is used for the buttress, which is

134
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,910
an element which only takes compression along its own axis.

135
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,794
So, it is also an arch, we can clearly say it.

136
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:26,829
In this applet,

137
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:32,415
we can see one of the spans of the bridge of Shiosai on which act loads

138
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:38,236
induced by the self-weight and by the traffic, I introduce

139
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:43,882
a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right and I activate

140
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:48,989
the solving and we can see that the shape which has been given to this

141
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:54,320
bridge corresponds to the shape of an arch-cable.

142
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:00,848
These elements, which carry the internal forces of the deck until the cable are

143
00:10:00,848 --> 00:10:06,420
all in compression. A more recent example has been designed by the professor Muttoni.

144
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,638
It is also essentially an arch-cable with

145
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:15,894
compression in the deck.

146
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:20,064
We can notice that instead of having vertical elements,

147
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:22,830
we have now inclined diagonals.

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,908
These diagonals complicate a little bit for

149
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,370
us the understanding of the phenomenon, but have

150
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,370
the advantage to be able to slightly change the internal force in

151
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,378
the cable along its length.

152
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:37,090
Fundamentally, this bridge is still an arch-cable.

153
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:45,136
There are lots of possible variations for the arch-cables, from the

154
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:51,250
pure arch-cable which we have seen at the beginning

155
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:59,950
to the pure cable with strut.

156
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:09,004
Here we have diverse shapes, here a shape with the

157
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:14,420
three quarters of the internal force which pass

158
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,042
in the arch and 25%

159
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:23,834
remaining in the cable. Here

160
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:29,150
an interesting structure with

161
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:38,350
half of the internal forces in the cable and the other half in the arch.

162
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:47,360
And then here,

163
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,625
only a quarter of the internal forces in the arch and the

164
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:57,920
three other quarters in the cable.

165
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:05,550
The purpose of this pictures is to

166
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,130
convince you that all the variations are possible.

167
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,538
You have to decide according to the structures

168
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,495
you want to design, if you prefer a structure which

169
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:17,195
has more the shape of an arch-cable or of a cable with strut

170
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,560
or if you want something between both.

171
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,592
Actually, the family between both with 50% on each side

172
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:28,723
is very interesting, we can see here a bridge of the 19th century with a lenticular

173
00:12:28,723 --> 00:12:32,920
shape, we can see here that there are locomotives; we

174
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,180
have a desk with very heavy loads which is hung up

175
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,530
first to the cable, well, we can see

176
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:49,640
that actually there are two cables which are linked by diagonals

177
00:12:52,850 --> 00:13:00,590
but this set constitutes a big cable

178
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:07,040
and these cables continue to arrive until the level of the upper arch.

179
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,797
So, since we really have a lenticular system, half of the

180
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:18,260
loads is taken by the lower cable and the other half

181
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:23,734
is supported by the upper arch. And, it is an

182
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:30,070
arch-cable thus it only transmits vertical forces to the supports.

183
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,870
In this lecture, we have seen that

184
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,930
the arch-cable can take varied shapes from

185
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,360
an arch-cable to a cable with strut with 

186
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,580
transitional possibilities, including one, the lenticular structure,

187
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,170
which is particularly interesting.

188
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,081
Hello.

189
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,750
In this video, I am going to talk to you about the cable-stayed systems,

190
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,033
the principle of their functioning, the way in which we can

191
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:59,686
solve them by means of the graphical statics and about the

192
00:13:59,686 --> 00:14:03,596
diverse types of configuration which exist for the positioning of the cables.

193
00:14:03,596 --> 00:14:05,940
In this video, you can see a timber bar

194
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,020
which is hung up to two inclined elements of chain.

195
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,556
When I add two symmetric loads, this system is in equilibrium

196
00:14:14,556 --> 00:14:19,086
and we do not have any problem. Let's see how to solve this system.

197
00:14:19,086 --> 00:14:22,085
So, we have on the left and on the right a

198
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:26,045
load of 10 Newtons which acts on our structure.

199
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:33,195
First, look at the right part that I isolate with a free-body.

200
00:14:33,195 --> 00:14:36,575
In our free-body, we have an horizontal element

201
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,665
of deck, an inclined element of cable and a

202
00:14:39,665 --> 00:14:45,857
load of 10 Newtons. We are going to solve the equilibrium of this

203
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:51,836
configuration, so we are going to have here a load of 10 Newtons.

204
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:54,843
Turning around the free-body, we

205
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,344
first meet the chain, as it is a

206
00:14:57,344 --> 00:14:59,630
chain, I know that it is in tension

207
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,480
thus I directly draw it in tension.

208
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,604
And we have an element,

209
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,695
a tensile internal force and we meet

210
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:13,870
the horizontal element, which is in compression.

211
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,916
We have here a compression, here a

212
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:23,534
tension and we can color our cable-stayed system,

213
00:15:23,534 --> 00:15:27,055
well, I think we had already intuitively recognized it

214
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:31,060
but now, we have demonstrated it, it is a system

215
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,260
in which the chains are in tension, and the element which is used as deck

216
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,013
is in compression. If we deal with the left part of

217
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:46,468
our structure, we have the same force here of 10

218
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:51,821
Newtons, the compressive internal force in the other

219
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:57,384
direction and the tension which is equal to the tension

220
00:15:57,384 --> 00:16:03,858
in the other cable. Here we have a structure

221
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:09,538
which is more complex with 4 times 10 Newtons hung up.

222
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:16,530
We can wonder if we can solve it. At least, if we identify this

223
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,986
free-body here, we can see that it is perfectly identical

224
00:16:19,986 --> 00:16:22,650
to the one we had in the previous system.

225
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:31,460
So, we can quietly solve it. 10 Newtons.

226
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:36,647
I am going to number these tensions, I will call it T1, this one

227
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:42,010
T2, this one T3 and this one T4 and I am going to take  advantage of the opportunity

228
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:47,190
to number the compression 1, 2 and 3 and I come back to the tension.

229
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,991
So I first

230
00:16:47,991 --> 00:16:51,470
have this element here which is in tension.

231
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,595
And I obtain here the internal force

232
00:16:56,595 --> 00:17:01,720
T1, then the next element is in compression.

233
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,590
I obtain the compression C1. Now,

234
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:13,335
I am going to take an interest in this free-body here which I draw nearby because

235
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:14,985
it is interesting.

236
00:17:14,985 --> 00:17:18,126
So, we have the deck, we have an

237
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:22,945
inclined cable and we have 10 Newtons.

238
00:17:22,945 --> 00:17:28,012
What we also know, is the compression C1 which comes from the right.

239
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:31,548
Then, turning in the counterclockwise direction around this

240
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:35,856
free-body, we are going to meet our force of

241
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,742
10 Newtons, our load of 10 Newtons,

242
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:44,800
then the compression C1 in the other direction, then the cable T2

243
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,870
and finally the compression C2.

244
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,022
Obviously, we could continue towards the

245
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:13,827
left doing exactly the same construction.

246
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,841
I spare you this construction, but I 

247
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:21,074
do it by myself to have the complete drawing.

248
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:26,700
So, here, it will be C3 with

249
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,078
both loads, the two last

250
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:37,322
loads of 10 Newtons and then the

251
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:43,760
tensions T3 and

252
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:51,290
T4.

253
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,184
Obviously, the compressions are used in both direction for each

254
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:57,482
of these constructions. We can make a few

255
00:18:57,482 --> 00:19:00,590
interesting observations on the basis of this solving.

256
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,770
What we can see is that the compression is not constant in the deck.

257
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,950
It is lower at the end and becomes greater in the middle.

258
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,434
Likewise, the internal force in the cables T1 is

259
00:19:11,434 --> 00:19:14,125
greater than the internal force in the cables T2.

260
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,540
So, the cables which are more inclined support

261
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,140
more loads than the cables which are less inclined.

262
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,766
On the other hand, we can obviously see that the cables T2 are

263
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:25,495
distinctly shorter than the cables T1.

264
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:28,870
In this picture of the transporter bridge in Nantes, designed by

265
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,002
the french engineer Arnodin, we can see that the stay cables have the

266
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:34,858
same configuration than in our

267
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,724
model, that is to say a configuration with

268
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:41,150
a fan shape where all the stay cables are hung up on the top of the mast.

269
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,554
This configuration has the advantage, we have seen it, that the

270
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:48,130
internal forces are lower in the stay cables which are less inclined

271
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,461
however, the stay cables are quite long and

272
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:52,608
it is especially quite difficult to all hang

273
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,532
them on the top of the mast, thus it is a

274
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,750
configuration which has a few problems.

275
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,924
Independently of this configuration, because the

276
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:03,753
central span is much longer than the

277
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:07,510
adjacent spans, it has been necessary to use

278
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,150
vertical cables to anchor the structure in the ground.

279
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,166
On the bridge of this illustration,

280
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:16,550
we have another configuration of the stay cables which we call the

281
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,300
harp shape, that is to say that the stay cables are parallel to each other.

282
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,646
What is striking in this configuration is

283
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:24,815
that the length of the stay cables varies very quickly.

284
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:29,330
The external stay cables are very long, while the internal stay cables are very short.

285
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,438
Let's look at what is about the internal forces.

286
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:38,218
I just draw the right part of a cable-stayed bridge such as we have

287
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:43,368
calculated it before, except that this time, the stay cables have a harp 

288
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:49,806
configuration and to get something, I also load each stay cable with 10 Newtons.

289
00:20:49,806 --> 00:20:53,640
Then, I can draw here this load

290
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,640
of 10 Newtons for the free-body on the right.

291
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,810
I trace a parallel to the stay cable, it is

292
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,717
the tension in the external stay cable and this, it is

293
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:13,750
the compression, so, we are going to call this T1 C1, T2 and

294
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:18,650
C2. Here I have T1 and C1.

295
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,182
If I look at the second stay cable, there is also

296
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:29,370
10 Newtons and its orientation

297
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,730
is still the same.

298
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,385
What is interesting is that

299
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:47,340
T2 is equal to T1, so the internal force in the stay cables is the same.

300
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,460
However, the compression C2 is quite a bit greater, in

301
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,880
this case double, but it is really greater than C1.

302
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,600
So, we can

303
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,676
imagine that when we reach the end, when we have

304
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,100
the shortest stay cables, we have a huge compression.

305
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,557
However, we have the advantage to have

306
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:05,468
internal forces in the stay cables which are constant.

307
00:22:05,468 --> 00:22:07,575
Note that before the internal forces in the stay cables

308
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,950
rather tended to decrease, which was favorable.

309
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,350
An advantage of the harp configuration is

310
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,210
that we have more space to place the

311
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:17,440
anchors of the stay cables which were not easy to

312
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,860
hang up on the top of the mast in the fan configuration.

313
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,160
As you have probably guessed it, it is possible

314
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,985
to make transitional configurations, as we can see it here.

315
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:27,857
Here, a half-harp configuration.

316
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:29,313
The stay cables are not absolutely

317
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,710
parallel but they are anyway well distributed

318
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,960
on the height of the mast, which enables

319
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,640
to have a little bit the advantages of both solutions.

320
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,290
It is also possible to make cable-stayed bridges with multiple spans.

321
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,875
However, if we remember of the necessity to anchor

322
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,295
in the ground, as we had seen it for the bridge of Arnodin,

323
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:50,550
it is actually necessary that the pillars should be stiff enough to be able

324
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,230
to help support the vertical

325
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,800
loads which are very significant in the exceptional cases.

326
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:00,326
But the bridge in Millau which is in service since 2004 have shown that it was really

327
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:05,880
possible to make this kind of structure in an efficient and elegant way.

328
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,076
In this video about the cable-stayed systems, we have

329
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:11,728
seen how to solve them by means of graphical

330
00:23:11,728 --> 00:23:15,151
statics, we have seen that there are several possible

331
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:18,489
configurations for the stay cables, particularly the fan shape or

332
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,785
the harp shape and we have seen that there is

333
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:25,080
a large compression in the deck of this type of structure.
