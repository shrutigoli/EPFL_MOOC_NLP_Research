00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,847
Hello, in this video, I am going to talk to you

2
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:11,195
about the cable-stayed systems, the principle of their functioning, the way in which we

3
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:14,027
can solve them by means of the graphical statics and about the

4
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:17,960
diverse types of configuration which exist for the positioning of the cables.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,530
In this video, you can see a timber bar

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,470
which is hung up to two inclined elements of chain.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,606
When I add

8
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:30,510
two symmetric loads, this system is in equilibrium does not have any problem.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,326
Let's see how to solve this system.

10
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:36,487
So we have, on the left and on the right, a

11
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:39,763
load of 10 Newtons which acts on our structure.

12
00:00:39,763 --> 00:00:47,640
First, we look at the right part that I isolate with a free-body.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,072
In our free-body, we have an horizontal element

14
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:57,280
of deck, an inclined element of cable and a load of 10 Newtons.

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,492
We are going to solve the equilibrium of this configuration.

16
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:05,427
So, we are going to have here a load of 10 Newtons.

17
00:01:05,427 --> 00:01:10,824
Turning around the free-body, we first meet the chain.

18
00:01:10,824 --> 00:01:13,320
As it is a chain, I know that it is

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,920
in tension, thus I directly draw it in tension.

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,240
And we have an element, a tensile internal force,

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,310
and we meet the horizontal which is in compression.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:36,425
We have here a compression, here a tension and we can color our

23
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:42,731
cable-stayed system, well, I think we had already intuitively recognized it but now,

24
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:47,798
we have demonstrated it, it is a system in which the chains are in tension

25
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:52,456
and the element which is used as deck is in compression.

26
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:57,910
If we deal with the left part of our structure, we have

27
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:03,650
the same force here of 10 Newtons, the compressive internal

28
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:09,206
force in the other direction and the tension

29
00:02:09,206 --> 00:02:13,910
which is equal to the tension in the other

30
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,910
cable. Here we have a more complex

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,298
structure with four times 10 Newtons hung up.

32
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:29,990
We can wonder if we can solve it. 

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,498
At the least, if we identify this

34
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,630
free-body here, we can see that it is perfectly identical

35
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,090
to the one we had in the previous system, thus we can quietly

36
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:46,030
solve it. 10 Newtons.

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,770
I am going to number these tensions, I will call it

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,750
T1, this one T2, this one T3 and this one T4.

39
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,662
And I am going to take the advantage of the opportunity to number the compression 1, 2 and 3.

40
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:05,002
I come back to the tension. So I first have this element here which is in

41
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:11,070
tension. And I obtain here the internal force

42
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,140
T1. Then, the next element is in compression,

43
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,990
I obtain the compression C1.

44
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,831
Now, I am going to take an interest in this free-body

45
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,440
here which I draw nearby because it is interesting.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,165
So we have the deck, we have an inclined cable and we have 10 Newtons.

47
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:42,680
What we also know is the compression C1 which comes from the right.

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,480
Then, turning in the counterclockwise direction

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,968
around our free-body, we are going to meet out force of 10 Newtons,

50
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:59,240
our load of 10 Newtons, then the compression C1 in the other direction, then the cable T2,

51
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,320
and finally the compression C2.

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,736
Obviously, we could continue towards the

53
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:28,000
left doing exactly the same construction.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
I spare you this construction but I

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,540
do it myself to have the complete drawing.

56
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,920
So, here, it will be C3 with

57
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,736
both loads, the two last

58
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:51,752
loads of 10 Newtons and then the

59
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:57,190
tensions T3 and

60
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:04,005
T4.

61
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,974
Obviously, the compressions are used in both

62
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,922
directions for each of these construction. We can make a few

63
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:15,040
interesting observations on the basis of this solving.

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,636
What we can see is that the compression is not constant in the

65
00:05:18,636 --> 00:05:20,408
deck, it is lower at 

66
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:23,400
the end and becomes greater in the middle.

67
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,080
Likewise, the internal force in the cables T1 is greater than the internal force in the cables T2.

68
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,214
So, the cables which are more inclined support

69
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,580
more loads than the cables which are less inclined.

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,206
On the other hand, we can obviously see that the cables T2 are

71
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,935
distinctly shorter than the cables T1.

72
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:43,310
In this picture of the transporter bridge in Nantes, designed by

73
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,424
the french engineer Arnodin, we can see that the stay cables have the

74
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:49,314
same configuration than in our

75
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:52,164
model, that is to say a configuration with

76
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:55,590
a fan shape where all the stay cables are hung on the top of the mast.

77
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,046
This configuration has the advantage, we have seen it, that the

78
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,580
internal forces are lower in the stay cables which are less inclined,

79
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,478
however, the stay cables are quit long and

80
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:08,598
it is especially quite difficult to all hang them on the top of the mast.

81
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:12,342
Thus, it is a configuration which has a few problems.

82
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:15,655
Independently of this configuration, because the

83
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:18,238
central span is much longer than the

84
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:21,950
adjacent spans, it has been necessary to use

85
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,590
vertical cables to anchor the structure in the ground.

86
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,542
On the bridge of this illustration,

87
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,990
we have another configuration of the stay cables which we call the

88
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,740
harp shape, that is to say that the stay cables are parallel to each other.

89
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,730
Which is striking in this configuration, it is 

90
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,258
that the length of the stay cables varies very, very quickly.

91
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:43,760
The external stay cables are very long, while the internal stay cables are very sort.

92
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,868
Let's look at what is about the internal forces.

93
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:49,675
I just draw the right part of a cable-stayed

94
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,776
bridge, such as we have calculated it before,

95
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:58,035
except that this time, the stay cables have a harp

96
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:03,200
configuration and to get something, I also load each stay cable

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,216
with 10 Newtons. Then I can draw here this load of

98
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:13,080
10 Newtons for the free-body on the right.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,630
I trace a parallel to the stay cable.

100
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,645
This is the tension in the external stay cable and this, it is the

101
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:27,967
compression, so we are going to call them, T1, C1,

102
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:33,090
T2 and C2. Here I have T1 and C1.

103
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,914
If I look at the second stay cable, there is

104
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:43,810
also 10 Newtons and its orientation

105
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:51,135
is still the same. Well,

106
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:58,015
what is interesting is that T2 is equal to T1,

107
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:01,330
So the internal force in the stay cables is

108
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,252
the same. However, the compression C2 is

109
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,190
quite a bit greater, in this case

110
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,755
double, but it is really greater than C1.

111
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,954
So, we can imagine that when we reach

112
00:08:10,954 --> 00:08:13,921
the end, when we have the shortest stay cables,

113
00:08:13,921 --> 00:08:16,474
we have a huge compression. However, we have

114
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:20,170
the advantage to have internal forces in the stay cables which are constant.

115
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,920
Note that before, the internal forces in the stay cables

116
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,366
rather tended to decrease, which was favorable.

117
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,298
An advantage of the harp configuration is

118
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,724
that we have more space to place the

119
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,925
anchors of the stay cables which are not easy to

120
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,625
hang up on the top of the mast in the harp

121
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:35,300
configuration.

122
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,968
As you have probably guessed it, it is possible

123
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,995
to make transitional configurations, as we can see it here.

124
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,903
Here, a half-harp configuration.

125
00:08:42,903 --> 00:08:44,387
The stay cables are not absolutely

126
00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:46,613
parallel but they are anyway well distributed

127
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,576
on the height of the mast, which enables

128
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:52,080
to have a little bit the advantages of both solutions.

129
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,740
It is also possible to make cable-stayed bridges with multiple spans.

130
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,693
However, if we remember of the necessity to anchor in the ground, as we had seen it

131
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,876
for the bridge of Arnodin, it is actually

132
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,368
necessary that the pillars should be stiff enough

133
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,272
to help support the vertical

134
00:09:06,272 --> 00:09:10,250
loads which are very significant in the exceptional cases.

135
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,870
But the bridge of Millau, which is in service since 2004, have shown that it was really

136
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,330
possible to make this kind of structure in an efficient and elegant way.

137
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,724
In this video about the cable-stayed systems,

138
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,992
we have seen how to solve them by means

139
00:09:24,992 --> 00:09:26,441
of graphical statics.

140
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,940
We have seen that there are several possible configurations

141
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,400
for the stay cables, particularly the fan shape or

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,662
the harp shape and we have seen that there is a

143
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:39,520
large compression in the deck of this type of structure.
