00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
Hello.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,985
In this lecture, I am going to introduce to you

3
00:00:06,985 --> 00:00:10,065
a new type of structures, called arch-cables, which

4
00:00:10,065 --> 00:00:13,904
will be the last type of structures which we will see within the framework of this course.

5
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,517
We will see that the arch-cables are a

6
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:19,377
type of structures in which the arches

7
00:00:19,377 --> 00:00:22,180
thrust, which we know well, is supported in

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,540
a different way, that is why we will need to introduce

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,440
a mobile support.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,540
We will see how to solve this kind of

11
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,520
structures and also how to model them by means of the applet i-Cremona.

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,865
What is a mobile support?

13
00:00:35,865 --> 00:00:38,560
Well, in my model, it is a support

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,780
which looks a little bit like a roller skate.

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:50,760
So, here, we have casters, which are going to be able to roll on the horizontal surface

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,663
on which I am going to place my cart.

17
00:00:55,663 --> 00:01:00,505
I call that a cart. What can

18
00:01:00,505 --> 00:01:05,970
we notice? A displacement is possible

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,290
in the horizontal

20
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:15,766
direction. It means that there cannot be 

21
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:18,610
a force at the support in this direction.

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,190
Thus, the only force at the support, here, will be a vertical force at the support.

23
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:34,430
We can notice that, as before, this kind of support also enables a rotation.

24
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,694
Let's also note that, even if we will not necessarily see it a lot within the

25
00:01:37,694 --> 00:01:40,829
framework of this course, we can absolutely have a mobile support which rolls on

26
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,349
a surface which is not horizontal, for example

27
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,700
a vertical surface, but also, possibly, an inclined surface.

28
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,710
We are going to see, obviously, in the rest of this

29
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,580
course, what the chain is used for.

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,999
Here, I have introduced the mobile support on the right in my arch.

31
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:01,220
When I have introduced two loads on my arch, obviously, the arch

32
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,131
wants to push, and as it cannot push since the mobile support cedes,

33
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,123
the whole structure collapses.

34
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:11,628
The solution, as we have already seen it in the picture, is

35
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:15,270
to link the mobile support to the fixed support by means of a chain.

36
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,920
In this case, we can see that we can normally load the arch.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,900
Let's look at the internal forces which act in our arch.

38
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,318
So, we have loaded 10 Newtons on our arch. Here, I already solve the case of

39
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,472
the arch and we will see afterwards the one of

40
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:40,360
the arch-cables to be able to compare.

41
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,864
So, for the arch, I have introduced

42
00:02:45,864 --> 00:02:50,114
2 forces of 10

43
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:56,500
Newtons, And the equilibrium, I do it very

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,540
quickly, because you have already done it several times, and we have done it together.

45
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,048
So the internal force in the right leg and in the left leg,

46
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:12,780
as well as in the horizontal part of the arch.

47
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,500
Thus, this arch is only in compression.

48
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,972
Then, if we take an interest in the forces at the support,

49
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:33,270
using the force in the right leg and in the

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,470
left leg, in the other direction, we obtain the usual forces at the support,

51
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,958
that is to say an horizontal thrust and a vertical force, which is equal to 10 Newtons

52
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:52,850
of course, here. And then, we have a force,

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:59,880
V and a force H at each support. How is it with the arch-cable?

54
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,218
We are also going to load it with twice 10 Newtons.

55
00:04:05,218 --> 00:04:10,653
Do not forget that there is a cable because, otherwise,

56
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:15,104
with the mobile support... You can see the symbol for the mobile support on the right, we will

57
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:19,001
come back to it a little bit later, it is a triangle which is on

58
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:22,768
1 or 2 casters, here, 2 casters, it symbolizes the fact that it can

59
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:25,378
move transversely, it is quite similar  

60
00:04:25,378 --> 00:04:27,360
to my little cart which you have seen before.

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:36,098
The Cremona diagram, with twice 10 Newtons,

62
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:40,981
is very similar to the one of the arch because, if we

63
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:45,738
make the equilibrium of the points of application of the

64
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:50,636
loads, we will obtain the same

65
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:56,301
thing. So, we are going to first take an interest

66
00:04:56,301 --> 00:05:01,145
in the free-body which is just next to the support

67
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:06,180
on the right. What do we have in this free-body,

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,252
acting on the free-body?

69
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:10,916
We obviously have an inclined leg of the

70
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,251
arch, we have the horizontal cable, and what

71
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:18,002
we know is that, we can only have a

72
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:22,338
vertical force at the support, which comes from the ground.

73
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:26,368
Well, let's come back to the Cremona diagram, it is this force,

74
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,480
here, in the leg along which we are going to travel in the other direction.

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,980
Then, we are going to add the tensile internal

76
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:44,260
force in the cable, and a vertical force at the support.

77
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,491
So, here, that is right, we only have a vertical force at the support

78
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:52,580
on this support.

79
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,562
Let's now look at the free-body close to

80
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,608
the left support, which I draw again.

81
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:04,003
What we have, acting on this free-body, is then an

82
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:09,450
inclined leg, which comes from the arch, the cable in

83
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:16,264
tension and, certain ground reactions which we will see a little bit later.

84
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:16,736
What we

85
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:20,764
know is that here, we have compression which acts and here,

86
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:26,440
we have tension, the force T which we have just determined before.

87
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,840
So, we have, acting on this free-body, the force T, well, I must draw it again

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,499
in the Cremona diagram, this time,

89
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,315
it is not possible to find a combination.

90
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:39,683
To this force, we add afterwards the diagonal internal

91
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:42,622
force in the leg and finally

92
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:48,994
we obtain that the vertical force at the support is the

93
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:55,360
only component which we have here, thus we only have a vertical component.

94
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,880
What is interesting to see is that, introducing only one mobile support,

95
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,800
actually, we get the effect that on both supports, there are only vertical reactions.

96
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,086
Now, be careful, we got this effect because there

97
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,610
only are vertical loads which act on the system.

98
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,608
If we had an inclined load which acted

99
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,084
on the system, of course the support on the right

100
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:22,556
could only support a vertical component, however,

101
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:26,800
the support on the left could support an inclined component.

102
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,948
Let's see what happens if I now add an asymmetrical load

103
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:32,806
on my arch.

104
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:35,252
Well, as on a normal arch, we can see that

105
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:38,210
the arch tends to go down under the additional load and that actually

106
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,460
it is necessary to give it the opposite shape, that is to say to make the arch go up

107
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,250
here, where we apply the load for it to be stable.

108
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,846
What it means, is that arch-cables

109
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,656
behave, for the arch part, exactly as arches.

110
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,592
So, the stability problems are still here, and we

111
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:57,414
still need to stiffen them but we have seen before

112
00:07:57,414 --> 00:07:59,070
that we know how to do it.

113
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,488
So, let's look at how to support the thrust

114
00:08:01,488 --> 00:08:03,782
and let's see how it can be advantageous.

115
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:09,020
We have, here, a cathedral and if I indicate, here, the internal space

116
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,114
of the cathedral, we can see that it is actually quite limited.

117
00:08:13,114 --> 00:08:16,830
There is a main nave and 2 secondary naves.

118
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,280
Everything we have around is essentially used for supporting the thrust.

119
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,180
On the right,

120
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,744
I have drawn the same cathedral, with still

121
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:31,178
the same volume which is useful for people

122
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:37,220
who are inside, and we have taken off everything which is used for supporting the thrust.

123
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,026
And, we can notice that it correspond to a lot of matter.

124
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:40,488
Of course, it makes the beauty and the

125
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:42,715
majesty of the cathedral, my purpose is not to take off

126
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:44,675
the flying buttresses, where they are, but if we

127
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,920
want to make modern and economical structures, it is interesting

128
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,606
to know that it is thrust.

129
00:08:51,606 --> 00:08:57,656
If I simply introduce a cable, here, the

130
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:03,252
forces at the supports, under vertical loads, will only be

131
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:06,380
vertical and can thus directly go down in the

132
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,480
columns which we have on the left and on the right.

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,540
And all the flying buttresses and the other systems of buttress are not necessary anymore.

134
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,640
We do not need either to introduce a mobile support,

135
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,920
there are no casters because in this

136
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,811
case here, these columns, which are very long, very high, they

137
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:32,280
are flexible and thus they enable a slight transversal movement.

138
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,279
By the way, I think that you have a feeling, if we take off all

139
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,482
the matter of the flying buttresses, we feel a little bit that the arch will want to open.

140
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:41,874
Yes, it will want to open but when it will start

141
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,288
to open, the cable will be put in tension and

142
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:46,999
it will say : "I do not go further, there

143
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,020
will only have vertical internal forces from now on".

144
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,265
Let's now look at how to model an arch-cable with the applet i-Cremona.

145
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:55,889
I start by modelling an arch.

146
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,510
Well, you can see that it is really very similar.

147
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,358
So, I introduce a support on the left, a support on the right.

148
00:10:02,358 --> 00:10:04,578
I activate the funicular polygon

149
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,116
and I give it the adequate shape.

150
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:10,140
There we go, it is probably the shape of the

151
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,712
funicular polygon of this vault.

152
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:18,990
Now, if I want to introduce a mobile support, I erase the second support.

153
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,130
If we introduce a mobile support, it will always be the second support.

154
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,138
I take it off, and I press the button "control"

155
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:29,985
on the keyboard or I click on the button "control" of the applet.

156
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:34,292
And I introduce, well, I am going to introduce it on the right, in this way you can

157
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:38,220
see well its symbol, a mobile support, which does not have the small

158
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,816
casters but we clearly see that the support is separated from the ground, it

159
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:46,067
can slide a little bit as on a air cushion, it is another symbol.

160
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:50,860
We can now place this support just at the place where it was before.

161
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,606
And, we can notice that, indeed, the thrust is

162
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:59,779
supported as for the other elements.

163
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,799
If I place my cursor in the middle of the cable, I obtain the internal force which acts

164
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,780
in this cable. Another example of arch-cable

165
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,169
structure, by necessity, it is a an arch, it has been used

166
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:20,678
for the shuttering of a big bridge, a quite imposing structure.

167
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:26,294
And because this bridge crosses a river, the builders of

168
00:11:26,294 --> 00:11:32,450
that time have decided to create this arch and to transport it

169
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:38,325
making it float on 2 barges which we have on the left and on the right.

170
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:45,300
So, here, we have a barge, and, here, we have another barge.

171
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,017
Obviously, in this case, the only load which acts on this

172
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:54,980
arch is its self-weight but it is enough to create a thrust.

173
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,400
But, in this case, it is very, very

174
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,471
clear, the only things that the barges can offer,

175
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:03,103
they are ships, are vertical thrust, it is

176
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:06,138
the Archimede's force, which is necessarily upwards.

177
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:09,425
So, it is absolutely impossible to support the thrust.

178
00:12:09,425 --> 00:12:10,426
The solution which

179
00:12:10,426 --> 00:12:16,533
has been adopted in this case, and we can see it in the water, with small marks,

180
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:23,049
small waves, is to introduce a series of cables, which link these

181
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:27,790
2 barges, in such a way that the thrust is compensated and that there is

182
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,680
only a vertical thrust, since obviously, it was impossible

183
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,460
to take an horizontal thrust with water.

184
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,526
Here is a picture

185
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:39,052
of the finished bridge, you can see the very ingenious aspect

186
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,574
of the solution which has been chosen, the

187
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,702
barge not only enables to move the formwork but

188
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,700
it also enables, once we have finished the arches,

189
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,156
lowering the formwork, to move it, to bring it

190
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:53,963
at the place where we want to build the second one, and so

191
00:12:53,963 --> 00:12:55,907
forth, and thus to have a system which has

192
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:59,130
certainly been very economical for the construction of this bridge.

193
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,582
Until now, we do not have,

194
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:04,620
actually, seen yet how to really make mobile supports.

195
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,957
You have, on the left, the symbol for the mobile support.

196
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:15,350
So, we can enable, here, an horizontal movement, and we will only

197
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:22,330
have a vertical force, perpendicularly to the surface of the support.

198
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,857
In practice, we sometimes use supports shaped like a roller

199
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,649
but it is important to say that if the displacement

200
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,281
which we must have, must be significant, it is not

201
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:32,697
very easy and on the other hand, the surface

202
00:13:32,697 --> 00:13:35,547
on which the rollers roll can easily becomes a

203
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:39,392
little bit dirty, if there are small stones which fall, if there is a little 

204
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,671
bit of dirt, and thus these supports get fulled up and

205
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:44,109
do not necessarily work very well in the long run.

206
00:13:44,109 --> 00:13:46,370
So, we have tried to find new solutions.

207
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,746
On the left, I show you a relatively old

208
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,500
solution, that is what we call a pendulum support.

209
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,022
By all appearance, we can see something

210
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:04,550
that we know well, something which is circular.

211
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,024
But actually, you can see that there is a small

212
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:09,776
tooth, on the top and on the bottom, that is a shape which is even

213
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:12,570
more particular, but there is a small tooth

214
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,413
which enables to control the way this support moves.

215
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:21,710
So, how does it work in reality ?

216
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,498
We have fixed to the ground

217
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:28,434
a plate with a slit, likewise, there is the same plate

218
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,671
with a slit which is fixed to the bridge.

219
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:35,570
And, our system, is placed between both, so,

220
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:40,804
that is a circle with a tooth which enters into this slit.

221
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:44,855
When a displacement occurrs, both

222
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:47,710
slabs remained where they were before,

223
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,980
but the system has diagonally moved

224
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,844
the slits still being aligned, in such a way

225
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:08,860
that the system does not get skewed. Thus, we have a displacement.

226
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:17,761
This displacement is caused by the fact that the

227
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:23,045
cable must lengthen to enable to support the internal forces, on the one hand,

228
00:15:23,045 --> 00:15:25,925
and on the other hand, by the thermal effects, if the

229
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,904
bridge lengthens or shortens, further to temperature differences.

230
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:32,590
Then mobile supports are common solutions

231
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,600
for bridges and various types of structures.

232
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,180
A more modern system,

233
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,012
that is what we call a sliding support, a

234
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:46,489
system which is quite common nowadays.

235
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:51,295
So, for this support, we have the same system, we have a piece which is fixed

236
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,296
in a permanent way to the foundation, another one

237
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:58,602
which is fixed in a permanent way to the bridge.

238
00:15:58,602 --> 00:16:04,255
It is generally steel. Inside,

239
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:09,212
we have, each time, a block of

240
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:14,294
rubbery products, it is

241
00:16:14,294 --> 00:16:19,360
generally a synthetic product, like neoprene,

242
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,492
a rubber which is very hard and which is very

243
00:16:26,492 --> 00:16:31,415
durable. Then, between both, we have two

244
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:36,592
layers of a material which we have already

245
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:41,613
seen, which enables well the sliding, which is Teflon.

246
00:16:41,613 --> 00:16:47,006
Well, both, neoprene and Teflon, are protected brands, there are non-protected

247
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:52,260
versions of these materials, but they really enable

248
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,531
the support to slide, without having any

249
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,775
friction or almost without having any friction.

250
00:16:56,775 --> 00:17:01,250
In this lecture, we have seen a new type of structure, the arch-cable, which is

251
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,885
the combination of an arch and a cable, in which the cable supports the thrust.

252
00:17:05,885 --> 00:17:09,880
The use of an arch-cable requires generally the use

253
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,112
of a mobile support, which is a support

254
00:17:12,112 --> 00:17:16,512
which enables a movement alongside the line between the supports of the arch.

255
00:17:16,512 --> 00:17:19,818
The consequence of the use of an arch-cable is that the

256
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,350
forces at the supports are vertical, in the presence of vertical loads.

257
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,810
We have also seen how to use

258
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:29,920
the applet i-Cremona to model an arch-cable.
