00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,974
Hello, in this lecture I will

2
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:11,120
show you how to use an arch-cable to determine the forces at the supports.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,026
It can be an auxiliary arch-cable, which will be used for

4
00:00:15,026 --> 00:00:20,260
determining the forces at the supports of other structures than the arches with ties.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,530
The method which we will use is simple and systematic.

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,554
Let's start with an arch-cable with one force, it

7
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:30,798
is an arch-cable a little bit more complex than

8
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,800
the ones we have seen until now since it has an

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,430
inclined force and the cable is not horizontal.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,450
Obviously, the method also remains valid for vertical forces and

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,560
horizontal cables but I prefer this

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,210
method which will enable us to be more general.

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,620
So, first, we draw the force which acts on our system F1 in

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:58,078
the Cremona diagram. Afterwards, we are going to take an interest

15
00:00:58,078 --> 00:01:03,854
in the free-body which surrounds this force and which is going to cut 

16
00:01:03,854 --> 00:01:09,110
the internal forces N1 and N2 in the arch with tie.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,798
Turning around the arch-cable in the counterclockwise 

18
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:16,230
direction, we first meet the internal force N1.

19
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,800
So, I trace a parallel to

20
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,236
N1, I do not exactly know

21
00:01:27,236 --> 00:01:31,710
until where it is going to go. Afterwards, I trace a

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,720
parallel to N2, there you go.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,484
So, here, I have the internal force N2 and

24
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:46,627
here, the internal force N1. Let's now take an interest

25
00:01:46,627 --> 00:01:51,242
in the support B. What do we have just next to the support B ?

26
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:56,200
We have the internal force N2 which pushes, then

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,770
the tension T in the cable

28
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:07,042
of the arch-cable, and finally, we will have a vertical force at the support.

29
00:02:07,042 --> 00:02:13,968
So, I first trace a parallel to T. And as

30
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:19,804
I know that the last force is vertical, I go until

31
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:25,000
the vertical projection of our force F1. Here, this is T and

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,330
finally, here, I have the vertical force

33
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,030
VB

34
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:40,476
If I now take an interest in the

35
00:02:40,476 --> 00:02:45,924
free-body near the support A. The force T acts on this system in

36
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:51,294
the other direction, the internal force N1 in the other direction and finally the

37
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:56,325
force at the support

38
00:02:56,325 --> 00:03:01,900
We can see that RA is greatly inclined,

39
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,340
almost horizontal.

40
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,480
It is like that for our configuration.

41
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,490
We now want to look at the case of an arch-cable subjected to two forces.

42
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,194
We are going to take an interest in the free-body which

43
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:21,611
includes both forces F1 and F2.

44
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:27,265
We are then going to copy them in the Cremona

45
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:33,830
diagram. So, two forces

46
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,690
F1 and F2, they do not need to have the same magnitude at all.

47
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,490
In this way, we can immediately obtain, in the Cremona diagram,

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,958
the magnitude and the direction of the resultant which

49
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:05,890
we copy in the sketch of the structure.

50
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,110
Well, here, it is deliberately a simple case, that is to say in which

51
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,373
both forces are converging, thus we do not have any complications to determine

52
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:19,130
the line of action but you are able to do it if

53
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,270
it is more complicated or if there are more forces,

54
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,311
we can obtain a resultant in every instance for

55
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:32,950
the set of loads which act on our structure.

56
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,893
We are now going to work with an auxiliary arch-cable, which is

57
00:04:37,893 --> 00:04:42,140
the arch-cable of the resultant, and I am going to draw this arch-cable here,

58
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,450
deliberately staggered in relation to the one which was outlined.

59
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,312
And then, obviously, we will have

60
00:04:53,312 --> 00:04:58,506
tension in the cable. We will have here

61
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:04,060
the internal force N1 and the internal force N2.

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,010
We are going to draw in the Cremona diagram, the figure which

63
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,960
corresponds to the equilibrium of this auxiliary arch-cable

64
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,269
which does not really exist but which is going to be useful for us to

65
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,406
determine the forces at the supports. So I

66
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:29,632
draw here, in parallel with

67
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:35,340
N1, and here, in parallel with N2.

68
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,724
In this way, we obtain the internal force here, N1 and

69
00:05:51,724 --> 00:05:56,623
the internal force N2. Taking an interest in the

70
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:01,380
the free-body near the right support, we have, acting

71
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,185
on this free-body, the internal force N2 in the other direction, and

72
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:11,569
the internal force in the cable T, which we extend until the

73
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,566
vertical projection of the resultant. So this, it is

74
00:06:16,566 --> 00:06:21,654
the internal force T in the cable. And finally, we obtain

75
00:06:21,654 --> 00:06:26,228
the vertical force at the support V on the right, I

76
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:31,378
would say, at the point B, VB. We will call

77
00:06:31,378 --> 00:06:36,587
the left bearing A. And afterwards, we are going to take an interest in

78
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:42,420
the equilibrium of the right support, we will have the tension

79
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,036
T and the internal force N1 in the other direction to finally obtain the

80
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:54,285
force at the support in A, which I denote RA, which I

81
00:06:54,285 --> 00:07:00,396
can copy here, on the real structure.

82
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:01,292
So RA,

83
00:07:01,292 --> 00:07:05,773
as before, is almost horizontal but it only

84
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:10,381
depends on the loads and on the configuration which we had used.

85
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:14,150
What is about the other types of structures ?

86
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,310
Well, it is important to consider that if we look at a free-body which

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,010
just cuts over the supports,

88
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,244
well, what do we have inside this system ?

89
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:31,840
We have have the resultant of the forces F1 and F2, maybe 

90
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,488
there will be more forces another time, they are going to make a resultant.

91
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,490
And then, we are going to have forces at the supports.

92
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,410
If we placed inside this system,

93
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,334
instead of having a truss on the top or

94
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:44,870
a beam on the bottom, if we placed an

95
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,910
arch with tie, we would exactly obtain the same forces at the supports.

96
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,298
So, we can define the following

97
00:07:51,298 --> 00:07:55,871
process to determine the forces at the supports.

98
00:07:55,871 --> 00:08:00,850
This process is called the process of the auxiliary arch-cable.

99
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,712
First : Consider the

100
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:11,978
free-body which passes

101
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:16,850
just over

102
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,270
the supports.

103
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,270
Second : solve

104
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,280
an auxiliary arch-cable

105
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,472
and to do this, it is necessary to start by tracing

106
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:54,190
the resultant of all the loads.

107
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:10,510
Third, we will be able to determine the forces at the supports.

108
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,238
You maybe asked yourself the question : yes but what would 

109
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,319
happen if I took another

110
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:20,055
arch-cable, would I obtain the same internal forces ?

111
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,187
Well, I encourage you, for the previous example or maybe

112
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,941
for the one which has only one force, to take another

113
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,410
arch-cable and to make the construction and you will notice that, unless

114
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,046
you make a drawing mistake of course, you will obtain the same internal forces.

115
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:35,888
So, any auxiliary arch-cable

116
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,480
will enable you to obtain the forces at the supports.

117
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
That is why I said :

118
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,768
solve "an arch-cable", not "the" arch-cable.

119
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:47,596
In this video, we have seen how to determine the forces at the supports 

120
00:09:47,596 --> 00:09:52,060
for arches-cables and we have also seen that the method of the auxiliary 

121
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,350
arch-cable enables to determine the forces

122
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,690
at the supports for all sorts of structures,

123
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,620
as long as they have, as arches-cables,

124
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,840
a fixed support and a mobile support.

125
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,534
It will be useful for us thereafter,

126
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:06,460
particularly for the forces at the supports

127
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,080
of the trusses and of the beams.
