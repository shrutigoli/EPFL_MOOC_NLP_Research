1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello, in this video, we are going to deal

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,300
with hinges, particularly with hinges in arches.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,300
We will see what are the hinges, how we can make

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,648
them, how we build them for the various building materials.

5
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:20,422
We will see what influence the presence

6
00:00:20,422 --> 00:00:23,600
of hinges has on the behavior of arches.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,038
Finally, we will conclude by a study of the mode of failure

8
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:33,715
of arches. Before continuing to talk about arches with

9
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:38,810
hinges, let's note that, whether it be during the time of the Romans, or like here, during

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,890
the Middle-Age, arches were historically built without any hinges.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,671
On the Ponte Vecchio, we have an arch, quite slender

12
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:55,407
by the way, which goes directly from one pier to the other one.

13
00:00:55,407 --> 00:00:59,302
It does not have the possibility to turn and it

14
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:03,790
works very well. A hinge is a mechanical

15
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,600
device which enables a relative rotation between two elements.

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,395
The supports which we have already used for the cables

17
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:23,780
and for the arches enable a rotation

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:31,910
of the element which is supported, which can go up or go down a little bit.

19
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,626
Obviously, cables are hinged but this is not really

20
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:40,791
important since we do not need to use hinges.

21
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:43,977
A cable is flexible enough for this to automatically happen.

22
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:48,830
That is not the case for arches. We can see in this picture on the left

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,630
the bottom of a big arch.

24
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,676
We will see a complete photograph of this arch later.

25
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:56,944
We have the part which comes from the bridge and

26
00:01:56,944 --> 00:02:01,570
we can see the support device, a metallic system,

27
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,442
which then is supported by a large system,

28
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:08,515
probably in concrete with masonry.

29
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:13,915
Between these two elements, we can see a big element which I indicate in

30
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:17,055
red which corresponds to the element of the hinge.

31
00:02:17,055 --> 00:02:20,605
On the right, we have another example of a very similar bridge,

32
00:02:20,605 --> 00:02:25,795
by the way designed by the same design office, it is the Eiffel office in Paris.

33
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:33,928
We have the part which comes from the bridge and the part which is linked to the foundation

34
00:02:33,928 --> 00:02:39,435
and between both, we have this hinge. Note the scale

35
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:44,530
which is given by the person who stands, looking at the bridge.

36
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,975
It is thus an extremely significant element and we can imagine that

37
00:02:48,975 --> 00:02:53,060
the forces which pass through this hinge are also very large.

38
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,986
By the way, that is why we can see

39
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:59,836
elements here, in diagonal, certainly under compression which

40
00:02:59,836 --> 00:03:02,338
bring the internal force which is

41
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:05,358
in the arch to the hinge.

42
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:11,510
What is sure is that all around the hinge, there is only

43
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:18,520
air. Thus, a hinge

44
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,330
is an obligatory point of passage for internal forces.

45
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,313
For us, that simplifies in a way

46
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:42,855
the reflection and it was probably one of the reasons why

47
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:46,390
hinges were introduced in the first place

48
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,854
during the industrial revolution.

49
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,598
Another reason for the introduction of hinges

50
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,960
is that they enable more easily to

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,020
link between elements, for example, which

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,525
would have been made separately, transported on the construction site,

53
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:05,590
and assembled on site. Here, we have an example of hinges

54
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,690
for a concrete structure. We have the hinge at the key.

55
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:16,035
What I draw in green is the edge of the concrete which

56
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:21,990
goes down, and here which goes up,

57
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:27,275
which has a

58
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:33,460
very little empty space between both, and here we have the concrete hinge.

59
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,780
We can see that there is a reinforcement which goes through these hinges. 

60
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,832
Obviously, there is also concrete.

61
00:04:41,832 --> 00:04:46,686
The key is the highest part of an arch while the

62
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:52,290
springings are its support. Here we have

63
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,158
a hinge at the springing, once

64
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:04,356
again, I quickly indicate the surface of the

65
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:10,265
concrete, and we have a hinge just in the middle.

66
00:05:10,265 --> 00:05:12,505
Concrete is different from steel

67
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,644
because we can very easily give it any shape.

68
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,588
In the concrete, which is poured

69
00:05:17,588 --> 00:05:20,509
in the fresh state, it is necessary to place

70
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,960
elements which are going to give it its shape.

71
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,180
What was used here is cork.

72
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,091
Cork is the material which is used to make stoppers.

73
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:36,194
It is a very compressible material because the rotation will tend to close

74
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:43,517
this joint and in the lower part which tends more to open,

75
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:49,814
at the key, we used wood. And at the springing, we use exactly

76
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:56,146
the opposite placement, with cork below and wood above.

77
00:05:56,146 --> 00:06:01,399
This is a construction detail, how to build a concrete hinge.

78
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:05,098
Note that we have modern materials which would facilitate this work.

79
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:08,912
We would probably use polystyrene

80
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:12,280
to make this kind of detail nowadays.

81
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,524
When the structure is in timber, it is

82
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:17,480
quite difficult to create a timber hinge.

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Generally, we will have a timber part

84
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,680
on the left, another timber part on the right.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,910
Here, this is a hinge at the key

86
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,690
once again, and we are going to use a metallic plate,

87
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,678
which we are going to nail to each

88
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:45,140
part, the left part and the right

89
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,442
part. And we will place the hinge afterwards,

90
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:55,770
we can see it here, in a sectional view, this is a cylinder, a bolt indeed.

91
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:58,682
We will place this hinge and the rotation will occur thanks to that.

92
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:00,145
That is a quite similar detail

93
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,545
to what we have in steel construction since actually

94
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:05,560
they are steel pieces which are assembled together.

95
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,672
Note that precisely, as I said,

96
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:10,110
this enables to transport the left half-arch

97
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,638
and the right half-arch separately to

98
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:16,220
the construction site, which can make the execution simpler.

99
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,625
Thus, sometimes, we will use a hinge

100
00:07:18,625 --> 00:07:21,420
simply to be able to assemble the structure.

101
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,718
We have the same detail, when we arrive on the support

102
00:07:25,718 --> 00:07:32,100
with two steel parts, an upper part and a lower part,

103
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,312
and a hinge, once again a big bolt, with a

104
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:40,430
very similar detail to what we had for steel construction.

105
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,460
This video shows the behavior of an arch with three hinges but subjected to

106
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,206
its self-weight which is not small, and then I exert on it an additional concentrated

107
00:07:51,206 --> 00:07:54,740
load and we can see that the arch deforms.

108
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:00,248
If we take a closer look, we can see that the internal forces must inevitably pass

109
00:08:00,248 --> 00:08:05,525
through these three points since just next to these elements, there is only

110
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:10,898
air thus the internal forces must pass here and somewhere here. The

111
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:16,354
funicular polygon must necessarily pass by these

112
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:18,220
three elements.

113
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,784
When we do a graphical resolution, we need to find a

114
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,468
funicular polygon corresponding to the loads and

115
00:08:25,468 --> 00:08:27,216
passing by these three elements.

116
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,412
It is not very difficult.

117
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,390
Sometimes, it is necessary to do an iteration to obtain this

118
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,690
result, but is is absolutely feasible.

119
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,393
Here, I show you an applet which solves this arch with three hinges.

120
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:39,310
So, to model the hinge at the base, I use supports

121
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,255
and I introduce the weight of each of the arch stones, that is how

122
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:57,725
these elements of vault are called, which weigh three Newtons.

123
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:01,910
And I introduce this weight on the center of gravity of each arch stone.

124
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,845
Now, it is necessary that the funicular polygon should pass by this point.

125
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:10,835
So, if I activate the solving as usually,

126
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:13,780
I can find a solution which passes by this point.

127
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,552
But actually, the polygon must always pass

128
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:21,489
by this point, even if, for example, I add a new force.

129
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:23,370
So here, I should do an iterative

130
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,682
work to each time find the good position.

131
00:09:26,682 --> 00:09:30,450
It is not necessary, the applet has a solution to this.

132
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,883
Using this button, here it is written : "initial tangent or point of passage of the

133
00:09:35,883 --> 00:09:40,900
polygon", you have maybe already activated it sometimes,

134
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,750
seeing a red ball which passes

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,050
and here you can see that the funicular polygon

136
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,610
always passes, even if I go to the other side

137
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,600
in tension, by the place I prescribe.

138
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,880
Note that there are places, for example here

139
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,844
on the right, which are impossible and the applet sometimes gets lost.

140
00:09:57,844 --> 00:10:00,930
If you get lost with the applet, simply

141
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,458
come back to the mode "initial tangent" and you will manage to get it back.

142
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:11,050
Here, I place the hinge at the proper position and now, we

143
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,005
can see that if I have a variable load, well, this variable load

144
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:21,210
makes change the shape of the funicular polygon but always make it

145
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:26,650
pass by the three prescribed points, both supports and the hinge

146
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,775
in the middle of the span. Note that in this case here, we can see that the

147
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:37,560
funicular polygon prettily remains inside the matter.

148
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,891
But if we had a different load, maybe it would be different.

149
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,560
We have here examples of arches with three hinges.

150
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,312
We have already seen these structures.

151
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:51,931
So, first, we have for the bridge over the Salginatobel, 

152
00:10:51,931 --> 00:10:56,310
hinges at the springing and at mid-span.

153
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,730
The viaducts of Austerlitz has a hinge at mid-span and

154
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,040
actually, hinges which are not at the springing,

155
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,128
maybe for reasons related to the construction process.

156
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:10,163
But in any case, it is also an arch with three hinges.

157
00:11:10,163 --> 00:11:13,660
There is no obligation about the actual positioning of hinges.

158
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,024
Let's now look at what happens for an

159
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:18,450
arch with two hinges.

160
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,142
We can see that its behavior is very similar,

161
00:11:21,142 --> 00:11:23,446
actually, to what we had seen before.

162
00:11:23,446 --> 00:11:25,994
Except that there are only two points which are very clear,

163
00:11:25,994 --> 00:11:30,100
both supports by which the funicular polygon must always pass.

164
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,150
Here, I have the applet for the second case, the arch with two hinges.

165
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:41,465
I activate the funicular polygon and now I do not have any constraints.

166
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:42,180
So, I know that

167
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,930
the funicular polygon has to pass either by the lowermost part,

168
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,980
either by the uppermost part, either by any intermediate position. 

169
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,200
Actually, we do not know.

170
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,967
And it can vary according to the loads. If I put, for example, a big load

171
00:11:55,967 --> 00:12:01,416
of maybe five Newtons on the left, then

172
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:07,208
maybe the good solution will be that the funicular polygon is quite

173
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,960
high on the left and relatively low on the right.

174
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,930
While if I place it on the other side, well, the

175
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:20,240
polygon will rathr be, low on the right and higher on the left.

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,504
But each time with an infinite number of solutions.

177
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:32,287
Note that if we are close to the supports, the shape of the funicular polygon just changes a little 

178
00:12:32,287 --> 00:12:37,550
according to the rotation because actually, precisely, it 

179
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:42,700
does not have a huge amount of place to go.

180
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,620
Thus, we could remove a part of the matter on the left and on the right.

181
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,104
And that is what we are going to see here, in the examples of two arches

182
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:56,206
with two hinges built by the Eiffel design office at the end of the 19th century.

183
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:57,391
The first one is

184
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:03,230
the one for which we had taken a closer look at the supports, the bridge over the Douro in Porto.

185
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,812
And indeed, we have a shape which enables the funicular

186
00:13:08,812 --> 00:13:15,252
polygon to be in all likelihood, just in the middle when there is no live

187
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,900
loads and when there are very high loads on

188
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,412
the left, that is a railway bridge therefore we can have a locomotive which

189
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:25,450
passes here, then the arch will tend to go up here and to go down on the right.

190
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,147
And conversely on the other side.

191
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:35,008
That is thus the same principle between this lower arch and this upper arch,

192
00:13:35,008 --> 00:13:41,650
there is an infinity of positions which can be taken by the arch depending

193
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:47,516
on the applied loads. Let's conclude this lecture by a failure

194
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:49,238
study of an arch.

195
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:55,140
Here it was the arch without hinges which I pushed until it falls down.

196
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,380
So, there is no surprise.

197
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,820
But let's look at what happens just before the arch collapses.

198
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,855
In the middle, on the top, it is the arch without hinges.

199
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:08,430
But what can we see ? We can see that the internal forces only pass

200
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,256
here, since there is air between both, only passes here,

201
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:19,115
only passes here, only passes here. What we can see is that just before the

202
00:14:19,115 --> 00:14:27,850
failure, we have four hinges. Note that we do not have the failure yet

203
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,915
when we have these four hinges.

204
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:33,148
Here I was quite far from the failure when I did the test

205
00:14:33,148 --> 00:14:36,870
with the arc with three hinges but we also had four hinges.

206
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,822
And in the arch

207
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:43,400
with two hinges, we also have a point of passage here, a point of passage here.

208
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,790
What does it means ? It means that the funicular

209
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:54,670
polygon must pass in this way.

210
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,390
It must inevitably, well, I do not know exactly its shape, it is going to

211
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,156
depend on the weight of the structure, but we are anyway 

212
00:15:04,156 --> 00:15:06,844
quite sure of where it passes since

213
00:15:06,844 --> 00:15:11,790
it must respect these four points of passage.

214
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,102
We can see that in the three cases, finally, the shape of

215
00:15:17,102 --> 00:15:22,441
the arch is quite similar with cracks which

216
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:28,310
open either on the internal side, either on the external side.

217
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,346
Here, we can also see

218
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:35,710
that it opens on the external side here, internal here, external here, internal here.

219
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,000
So, if we go in a Romanesque cathedral with a

220
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,495
vault shape and if we see longitudinal cracks

221
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:46,418
parallel to the axis, well, we will be able to see that maybe,

222
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:49,718
we are looking at the beginning of a failure phenomenon.

223
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:51,896
It does not mean yet that it is falling down.

224
00:15:51,896 --> 00:15:54,784
It is really necessary that the four hinges

225
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:56,906
should be activated and that the load should be

226
00:15:56,906 --> 00:16:00,550
maintained for the collapse to occur. 

227
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,844
A last thing that I wanted to tell you

228
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:07,160
is, what happens during the failure ?

229
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,555
Precisely, there are large internal forces

230
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:11,294
which must pass just by very limited places.

231
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:13,940
What is possible is that the stone

232
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,425
strength, if it is a stone

233
00:16:15,425 --> 00:16:19,850
arch, it is often the case, the stone strength is reached and that there is a

234
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,310
crushing in this zone. And at this moment, we would have a crushing,

235
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,930
and then the collapse further to the spreading of this failure.

236
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,465
In this video about hinges, we have seen what is

237
00:16:34,465 --> 00:16:39,495
a hinge, an obligatory point of passage for the internal forces, we have seen

238
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:42,690
how to build them in the various building materials, we have seen

239
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,402
what happens in arches with two and three hinges.

240
00:16:45,402 --> 00:16:47,467
I would like to take this opportunity to mention that we can absolutely

241
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,634
make an arch with only one hinge but

242
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,524
obviously we cannot build an arch

243
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:54,320
with four hinges because it would not be stable.

244
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,572
Finally, we have seen that precisely, failure occurs in an arch when

245
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,385
four hinges develop and at this

246
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:06,599
moment, it leads to the collapsing of the arch.
