00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:04,863
Hello.

2
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:09,230
In this video, I am going to introduce you to arched structures, to discuss about

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,999
their shapes and about a very important problem

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,540
which concerns them which is their stability.

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,751
We will start with an arch subjected to two

6
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:19,098
loads, we will solve its equilibrium and we will

7
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:23,090
see that it is very similar to what we have done until now with cables.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,655
We will make some comparisons, then we will see that the stability,

9
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,495
respectively the instability of the arches is what

10
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:34,376
enormously differentiates them from cables, and

11
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:39,680
we will see how to choose the proper shape to give to an arch.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,496
In this video, you can see a very simplified

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:47,120
arch which is constituted of three rectilinear wood elements,

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
on which I apply two symmetric loads of 10

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,757
Newtons which you recognize and this structure is

16
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:54,706
in equilibrium.

17
00:00:54,706 --> 00:01:00,052
We are now going to solve this structure and in a symmetric way, I am also

18
00:01:00,052 --> 00:01:06,095
going to solve what we have already done a long time ago, the case

19
00:01:06,095 --> 00:01:12,387
of a cable structure which is symmetric to this arched structure.

20
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:14,390
That is quite instructive.

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,395
Let's start by the cable structure that we know well.

22
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:23,768
So, we have a load of 10 Newtons on the top and a

23
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:28,822
load of 10 Newtons on the bottom. If we

24
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:33,818
look at a free-body on the

25
00:01:33,818 --> 00:01:39,050
left, we

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,965
have a horizontal rectilinear element, an inclined element,

27
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:48,960
the load of 10 Newtons, and the equilibrium

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,124
of this element will be obtained 

29
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:59,227
by having a horizontal line which corresponds to the

30
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:04,228
segment in the construction and then an inclined

31
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:09,550
line which corresponds to the segment which goes up towards the left

32
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,915
support. So, we know well this

33
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:20,527
construction. We thus obtain the internal force

34
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:25,543
in the horizontal segment and the internal force

35
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:30,430
in the inclined segment, what gives us tensile internal

36
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,420
forces because these internal forces pull on the free-body.

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,895
This is the contribution of the sky blue free-body.

38
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:44,559
If we proceed in the same way for an orange free-body on

39
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:49,682
the right, well, its equilibrium will be obtained using

40
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:55,076
the internal force in the horizontal part of the cable in the other direction, the

41
00:02:55,076 --> 00:03:00,320
force of 10 Newtons, and finally the inclined internal force.

42
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,870
I quickly draw the free-body nearby, a horizontal part,

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:13,979
an inclined part, the load of 10 Newtons and both internal forces which

44
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,304
are parallel to the internal forces in the Cremona diagram 

45
00:03:17,304 --> 00:03:20,780
which have the same orientation.

46
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,550
They are two tensile internal forces, thus all our structure is in tension.

47
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,728
Then, if we look at the equilibrium in the other direction for each

48
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:39,702
support, on the left, on the right, I am not going to draw the corresponding free-bodies,

49
00:03:39,702 --> 00:03:42,246
you can do it by yourself if you wish but we have

50
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:49,310
already done it in the past, we obtain

51
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,841
a vertical component which is equal to 10

52
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:58,750
Newtons and a horizontal component which has a certain value.

53
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,790
And if we copy them in the real system, we then have here on the right a vertical

54
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,582
force at the support and a horizontal force

55
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:13,240
at the support, and likewise, on the left.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,400
Let's now look at what happens with the arch.

57
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,110
We still have the load of 10 Newtons

58
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,672
as previously. Then,

59
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:39,940
we are going to have a horizontal component.

60
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,930
And an

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,920
inclined component.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,280
So the inclination, here,

63
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,698
is going to give us a force which

64
00:05:05,698 --> 00:05:11,294
pushes towards the left and a force which pushes upwards.

65
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:19,006
If I now draw again the corresponding free-body, I have

66
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:24,120
a horizontal part, an inclined part and a load of 10 Newtons.

67
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,305
I now have

68
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:30,519
an internal force which pushes on the free-body going up towards the right, that is an

69
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,924
internal force which pushes on the free-body thus it is a compressive internal force and, likewise

70
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:40,780
in the horizontal part, I have a horizontal internal force thus I can draw again,

71
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,926
in blue, these internal forces in the

72
00:05:45,926 --> 00:05:51,032
free-body. I can identify the sky blue

73
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:52,400
free-body here.

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,803
We can see that, by construction, the

75
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:58,942
internal forces are exactly the same as before but

76
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:03,955
they have changed sign, they have become negative, compressive internal forces.

77
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:06,860
If we look at the free-body on the right,

78
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,570
a horizontal segment, an inclined segment and a load of

79
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,364
10 Newtons, we are going to reuse the

80
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:24,410
horizontal segment, to introduce the second load of

81
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,278
10 Newtons, and here I

82
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:34,830
directly draw it in blue but we are going to check it, we 

83
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:39,630
have well a compressive internal force in the part which

84
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,447
goes up towards the support, and this internal force clearly goes in this direction, it pushes

85
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:49,284
on the free-body so it is in compression, likewise for the internal force here,

86
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:54,261
and we can identify the contribution of this

87
00:06:54,261 --> 00:07:00,260
free-body to the Cremona diagram.

88
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,890
We are now going to look a little bit more in detail

89
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,780
at the contribution of what happens at the supports.

90
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,490
We have an element and the beginning of a support.

91
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,756
We have a compressive internal force which acts here.

92
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:21,137
And for this to be in equilibrium, we are going

93
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:25,390
to have a vertical force at the support like that, and a

94
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,178
horizontal force at the support like that. We are going to check it in

95
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:34,814
the Cremona diagram for the left support.

96
00:07:34,814 --> 00:07:40,222
So, we have the inclined force in the other direction, then

97
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:45,130
the vertical force at the support,

98
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,400
and the horizontal force at the support which pushes towards the right.

99
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,614
So, we have here a vertical force and here

100
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:59,848
a horizontal force which pushes the structure inwards,

101
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:04,634
while previously, the horizontal force pulled the

102
00:08:04,634 --> 00:08:09,620
structure outwards. Likewise, we can analyze the right

103
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,500
support with a compression which

104
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,190
we will use in the other direction in the Cremona diagram.

105
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,402
Then, a horizontal force at the support which pushes towards the left

106
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,830
and a vertical force at the support which pushes upwards.

107
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,996
So, we have a vertical force at the support upwards and a horizontal force

108
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:40,700
at the support towards the right which we can copy in the

109
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,960
diagram of the real structure. We can identify the contribution

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,342
of the various free-bodies to the Cremona diagram.

111
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,377
There we are, that's all.

112
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:58,360
Thus, if you know how to solve a cable, you know how to solve an arch.

113
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,456
I am not going to do a very long lecture.

114
00:09:01,456 --> 00:09:02,940
We can stop now.

115
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,712
Not really, otherwise I may even

116
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,540
have started with arches. There is a little detail. 

117
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,376
Let's watch this video on the arch which we have seen before.

118
00:09:14,376 --> 00:09:19,426
I have added a force on the right. And what happens ?

119
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,410
Catastrophe ! The arch collapses.

120
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,732
That is the first time we have a collapse.

121
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:28,334
Until now, when we added a load on a cable,

122
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,090
the cable changed a little bit its shape and it was very happy.

123
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,042
But we have never had something which broke.

124
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,933
Here, the structure really

125
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,820
collapsed, and it is potentially dangerous.

126
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,225
Thus here, we have something which is not

127
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,938
similar to what we had until now with the cables.

128
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:44,583
Let's look at this in more detail.

129
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:49,805
What happens when we add a force on a cable which is subjected to

130
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:56,110
twice 10 Newtons and then on an arch which is also subjected

131
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,139
to twice 10 Newtons ? I am going to add a load of

132
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:06,129
10 Newtons on the right in both cases. What happens in the cable ?

133
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,100
We already know that, we have already seen it. What happens is that the cable is going

134
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:17,130
to go down a little bit on the right, and to go up a little bit on the left, then to change its shape.

135
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,790
So, this, it was one of the problems we had identified

136
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,262
with the cables, that is to say that they move a lot.

137
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,850
And that is all.

138
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,140
Now, we have well noticed that the construction

139
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,378
of the arch, it is the mirror shape of the construction of the cable.

140
00:10:39,378 --> 00:10:48,260
Then let's make a mirror. What it means is

141
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,704
that the shape of the arch, when we add a

142
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:59,280
force, should be like that. This, it the shape of the funicular

143
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,630
polygon of the loads. We could calculate it but it is like that.

144
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,568
However, when we add a load on the right around

145
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:12,012
the point here on the right, what does it want to do ?

146
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:13,312
It wants to go down, it certainly does

147
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:17,630
not want to go up. But, it would be necessary that it should go up for the arch

148
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,765
to change its shape. This, it is a fundamental difference which

149
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,230
makes us enter in the true problematic of arches.

150
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:32,630
If we add a force on a cable, the funicular polygon,

151
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:40,510
that is to say the cable,

152
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:46,195
changes its shape but follows the applied

153
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:51,880
loads.

154
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,692
Thus, the structure is always stable.

155
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:57,794
Actually, we never talked about stability

156
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:00,940
because we did not have this problem.

157
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,085
Except if we put so many loads that we

158
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,699
mangage to break the cable but otherwise there

159
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:06,835
is no problem.

160
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:12,680
If we add a load on an arch, the funicular polygon

161
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:24,520
moves away from the structure, we have seen that it goes up.

162
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,420
The structure itself, we have seen that it does not change its shape.

163
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,580
Think of stone arches for a minute, they cannot really change their shape,

164
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,070
at the least not in the way that a cable changes its shape as we have seen it.

165
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,740
The consequence of this, it is that we have an instability.

166
00:12:57,905 --> 00:13:02,070
Arches are fundamentally unstable.

167
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,698
The next videos in this 

168
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:07,620
lecture will show how we can

169
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,426
choose the correct shape of an arch to ensure

170
00:13:10,426 --> 00:13:13,170
that precisely, we do not have this problem of stability.

171
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,450
I even so reassure you about stability.

172
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,790
We have ancient constructions, which date back

173
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,010
from the Roman time for example, or from the Middle-Ages,

174
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,172
which use arches and which did not collapse, therefore the fact that an

175
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,916
arch is potentially unstable does not mean that it

176
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:28,548
is going to collapse, but we have to be careful.

177
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:32,719
This video shows how we can keep the symmetry, the mirror

178
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:36,470
effect between the cable and the arch if we add a load.

179
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,718
I am going first to add a load on the cable on the blackboard.

180
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:43,442
It automatically changes shape, then I have added a load on

181
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:48,365
the arch on the foreground, and making go up the point where I have added the

182
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:52,070
second load, and giving it a symmetric shape

183
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,517
in relation to the one of the cable, then, I have obtained a stable solution.

184
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:59,470
This is nice but generally, we do not have someone who is kindly going to change 

185
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,163
the shape of the arch therefore we cannot rely on this method.

186
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:08,417
So, what is the ideal shape that an arch should have ?

187
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:12,989
We have seen that it was the mirror shape of the one of a cable.

188
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:16,634
Indeed, here, you look at the opposite shape of the

189
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:20,136
Golden Gate bridge which we have already seen before.

190
00:14:20,136 --> 00:14:23,220
And, we compare it here, on the right, to a bridge

191
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,450
by the Swiss engineer, Robert Maillart, and we can see a very similar shape.

192
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:34,760
I use the applet i-Cremona to demonstrate the ideal shape of an arch.

193
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,708
We can see that there is a support here, another here.

194
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:47,729
I apply loads where there are the pillars which go down from the deck to

195
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:52,740
the arch and here, we do not see them very well, I guess where they should be.

196
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,900
I introduce these loads, this, it is okay.

197
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,769
Then I activate the funicular polygon and I give it

198
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,786
the proper shape and we can immediately see that,

199
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:07,630
indeed, that is the same shape that we would have typically obtained

200
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,950
for a suspension bridge, which is correct for an arch with lots of loads.

201
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,080
Thus, it is a parabola in the present case, a second order parabola.

202
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,728
In general, we will use the shape of the funicular polygon

203
00:15:21,728 --> 00:15:27,017
under the permanent loads to define the shape of the arch.

204
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:32,374
Once again, we have an arch designed by Christian

205
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:37,375
Menn, in canton Graubünden, in Switzerland. Here it is also quite clear where 

206
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:42,331
the loads act. And the initial shape of

207
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:47,421
the arch is defined by the permanent loads, the weight

208
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:52,082
of the structure, essentially the weight of the deck because the arch is not very

209
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:54,338
heavy, but, obviously, when we make an accurate

210
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:56,020
calculation, we take into account all of these weights.

211
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,668
To avoid the problem of instability, it is necessary that the

212
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,188
funicular polygon should be inside the matter all the time.

213
00:16:04,188 --> 00:16:06,740
I am going to show you an example of this later.

214
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,470
And, for that, we will define the thickness of the arch

215
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,270
under the influence of the variable loads. Thus, the variable loads

216
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:25,065
are used to determine the thickness of the arch.

217
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:30,812
This applet shows the bridge over the Salginatobel by Robert Maillart.

218
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:33,089
You can see that this bridge does not have a very 

219
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,610
classic shape, its thickness is variable.

220
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,972
Under the effect of the permanent loads, we can

221
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:43,190
give it this shape.

222
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,910
Actually, the internal forces are always going to pass by this point here on the top then I

223
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,692
am going to redo the solution defining that the

224
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:55,513
internal forces must always pass by this red point.

225
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:58,690
You are going to see the influence that it is going to have.

226
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,450
I now add a quite significant variable load.

227
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,939
For example, it can simulate a truck. Then, I make it move 

228
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,460
on to the bridge.

229
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,724
Look at what happens with the blue funicular polygon,

230
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:17,010
as well in the left part as in the right part.

231
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,846
It tends to go up under the load.

232
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:22,672
Remember, I have said that the arch had to go up where

233
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:26,510
the load is applied and to go down on the other side.

234
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,430
But, in any case, along all the length of the bridge, thanks

235
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,302
to the shape which has been given to it, the polygon of forces stays

236
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:37,149
all the time inside the concrete.

237
00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:40,180
This means that our structure is stable.

238
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:45,360
In this video, I have introduced the shape and the stability of arches.

239
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,040
I have shown that there is a big

240
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,610
similarity at the level of the solution with graphical statics

241
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,710
with what what we have done with cables

242
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,520
thus it is relatively simple since we are already experienced.

243
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
However, because of the phenomenon

244
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,720
of instability, the shape to give to the arches

245
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
is very important, as well as its thickness.

246
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,630
It is important to consider the permanent loads to define the main

247
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,920
shape of the arch and the variable loads to define the thickness.
