00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,795
Hello.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:07,075
In this video, we will see how we

3
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:09,590
can proceed to stiffen arches.

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:12,270
In the previous video, we have seen that

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,910
arches, when they are subjected to variable loads,

6
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,862
tend to take a shape which does not correspond

7
00:00:18,862 --> 00:00:22,570
to the one of the funicular polygon and thus, to become unstable.

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,143
The purpose of this lecture is to see

9
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:30,380
how we can stabilize arches, which is a process, as you will see,

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,182
similar to what we have already seen to stabilize cables.

11
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:38,684
The stiffening methods will be the same, with

12
00:00:38,684 --> 00:00:41,246
some methods which are not practicable for the

13
00:00:41,246 --> 00:00:45,220
arches, and a couple additional methods which are not used

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,160
for cables, even if we could for some.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
Let's see first the effect of a

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,245
load on an arch. We have a load g

17
00:00:56,245 --> 00:01:01,510
which is applied, it will also be present when we will have variable loads.

18
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:08,330
And we want to look at the shape of the funicular polygon

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,567
corresponding to the applied loads on this arch.

20
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:22,340
Well, the shape of the arch, it was already drawn, I

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,505
just draw it in blue because obviously the arch is in compression.

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:32,665
It is an arch, here, with two concentrated loads, or below, an arch

23
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:38,236
with a uniform load. It is exactly 

24
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:44,209
the symmetric of the figure which we have seen before with cables.

25
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:50,770
When we add a variable load q, whether it be a concentrated load,

26
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,337
or a distributed load on part of the span, there is

27
00:01:56,337 --> 00:02:02,040
a change of shape of the funicular polygon of the arch.

28
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,480
The arch remains

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,277
symmetric compared to what we had seen about the

30
00:02:08,277 --> 00:02:12,858
cable. Then, where the cable goes down, well, the

31
00:02:12,858 --> 00:02:17,538
funicular polygon goes up. Likewise

32
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:22,964
for uniform loads.

33
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:28,652
This is the shape of the funicular polygon

34
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:32,775
of the loads, but when we apply a load

35
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:35,155
on an arch, we have already seen it, the arch tends

36
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:40,150
to go down under the load, as long as there is a distance which is creating, and which tends to

37
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,150
increase between the position that the arch would like to take;

38
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,922
I get a load then I want to go down,

39
00:02:46,922 --> 00:02:49,626
and the position that it should take to have the

40
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:52,706
correct shape, according to the funicular polygon of the loads.

41
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,658
Thus, we really have

42
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:57,128
problem of stability. How can we solve that?

43
00:02:57,128 --> 00:03:00,782
Well, the first solution that we have seen, when we looked

44
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:05,266
at cables, is that it was a good solution to add weight.

45
00:03:05,266 --> 00:03:09,565
Is it also true for the arches ? Well, no.

46
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:13,315
If we remember of what we have seen, if we increase the

47
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:18,695
loads on the arch, as soon as we add a load which is a little bit asymmetrical,

48
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,770
the phenomenon of instability starts,

49
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,052
the arch goes down of one millimeter, while

50
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:28,271
the funicular polygon goes up of one millimeter, and it tends to increase.

51
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:35,166
Therefore this solution is not possible to stabilize and arch.

52
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:38,634
Now, you will see, we will see together that there are

53
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:42,010
solutions where there are arches with lots of matter.

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,808
That is true, but it is not

55
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,784
mainly because of the weight that the arch becomes

56
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:50,104
stable, but because of other properties which we will see shortly.

57
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:55,044
The second solution which we had seen to stiffen a cable was

58
00:03:55,044 --> 00:04:00,500
to use a stiffening beam.

59
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,688
This solution is also possible for an arch.

60
00:04:10,688 --> 00:04:12,844
The bridge over the Tschiel valley, which

61
00:04:12,844 --> 00:04:17,500
I have already showed you, has side parapets, that is to say

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,820
the edges of the bridge which are used to prevent

63
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,504
people or vehicles from falling down from the bridge.

64
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:28,844
So, it is something useful, but there, they work as

65
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:33,830
a stiffening beam to stabilize

66
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,614
this arch which by itself is very thin.

67
00:04:36,614 --> 00:04:41,420
This is a solution which works to stabilize an arch.

68
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,460
Let's look until the end at what happens if

69
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,675
I apply an asymmetrical load on this arch with two loads.

70
00:04:49,675 --> 00:04:52,890
Well, we can see that the arch falls down.

71
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,900
Then, it is really something serious.

72
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,670
But let's look at what happens, just before the arch falls down.

73
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,853
We measure the distance between

74
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:09,874
the support and the upper node which is the farthest from this support.

75
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:18,670
Here, this distance is, for me, roughly 240 millimeters.

76
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,938
For you, you have another distance,

77
00:05:20,938 --> 00:05:23,507
but the reasoning stays valid.

78
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:24,779
You can look at

79
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,196
this distance. In the other direction, the distance

80
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,689
is 290 millimeters. What

81
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:37,516
does it mean ? It means that if I number the

82
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:42,980
points A, B, C and D, well, the

83
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:49,948
distance A-C decreases and the

84
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:54,980
distance B-D increases.

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,426
What can we do to prevent it from happening ?

86
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:05,050
Well, in any case, we have good instruments to prevent the distance

87
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,306
B-D from increasing. We can see in this video, I introduce

88
00:06:10,306 --> 00:06:15,072
an additional cable between B and D, and once

89
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:19,755
this cable is in place, I can carry the additional load.

90
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,651
The structure remains stable.

91
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,484
Actually, I can even press quite hard, and the structure always

92
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:31,018
remains stable. The stiffening by additional cables

93
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:39,945
is thus a possible method of stiffening an arch.

94
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:45,300
We have in this picture, the example of the

95
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,980
Goum department store in Moscow, whose roof is constituted of

96
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,415
a large number of metallic arches, which are just next to

97
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,480
each other, very thin with a glass roof.

98
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,877
So, we obviously notice that these arches, being

99
00:07:01,877 --> 00:07:05,296
as thin, should have a problem of stability.

100
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:08,909
But actually, you can see, this structure is more than 100

101
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,601
years old; it still works very well. How does it work?

102
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:16,442
We can look at that in the picture in the bottom right-hand corner.

103
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:23,422
We have the arch corresponding to the structure, and in addition, we have a multitude of

104
00:07:23,422 --> 00:07:30,870
cables which link

105
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,094
one of the support to the arch

106
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:39,986
That is to say that if the arch wants to move away from this support, if the distance

107
00:07:39,986 --> 00:07:44,300
wants to increase, well, the cable is going to say "no, it is not possible".

108
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,430
And thus, these cables stabilize our structure.

109
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,122
We can find the same solution in

110
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:55,893
a much more recent structure, in Switzerland.

111
00:07:55,893 --> 00:08:04,120
Here, once again additional cables

112
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,760
with

113
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,933
a link on the supports, and afterwards on

114
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:21,270
various parts of the arch,

115
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,446
like that, and indeed

116
00:08:26,446 --> 00:08:32,420
this system stiffens the arch which as we

117
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,631
can see is very thin, by the way. It is a metallic 

118
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:42,864
tube, here, which is very thin and

119
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:48,580
which then comes onto a post.

120
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,984
Another solution is illustrated in this

121
00:08:51,984 --> 00:08:56,090
photograph of the bridge of Longeray, near Geneva.

122
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,850
Here, the structure

123
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,712
has a very significant thickness. It is a reinforced

124
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:07,846
concrete bridge which dates from the end of World War II,

125
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:12,890
then, relatively recent. And the concept,

126
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,589
is that

127
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:23,040
when the shape of the funicular

128
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,610
polygon changes

129
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:38,430
under the effect of variable loads,

130
00:09:42,745 --> 00:09:47,060
it moves,

131
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,640
but it stays

132
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,940
inside the matter.

133
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,735
Thus, as long as there is a possibility for the funicular

134
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:14,330
polygon to stay inside the matter, the structure will remain stable,

135
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:20,095
this is stiffening by a significant thickness.

136
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,010
The viaduct of Austerlitz in Paris shows us

137
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,500
another stiffening solution which we have already seen for cables.

138
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,750
That is to say that we can clearly notice that there are several arches, there is

139
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:44,020
an arch which begins below, which passes above, and once again

140
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,550
below, and finally which finishes above.

141
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:54,937
A second arc above which

142
00:10:54,937 --> 00:11:00,200
it antagonistic to it, which is above when the other one is below, and vice versa.

143
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:09,530
It absolutely looks like what we had for the bridge over the river Thames in London.

144
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,850
Except that, obviously, it was a solution for cables.

145
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,390
And as

146
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,505
in London, we can also notice the presence of vertical and

147
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:25,503
diagonal bars to stiffen the structure. It is thus,

148
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:30,240
here, a stiffening by additional arches.

149
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,560
I use the plural form, even if, here, there is only one

150
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,470
additional arch, and on the other hand, we have a

151
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,765
stiffening between both arches thanks to the diagonals,

152
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:50,470
as we had it for Tower Bridge in London.

153
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,781
Here, we have a very old structure which is

154
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:57,960
almost 2000 years old, nowadays, and which still stands.

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,634
So, we can ask ourselves the question.

156
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,172
Why does this structure still stand ?

157
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,034
Well, it is a question that we can ask ourselves in general.

158
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:05,640
Why?

159
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,385
Because the first thing that we notice, when we study the arches that

160
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:17,990
the Romans have left us, is that they are very often what we

161
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:25,620
call semicircular arches.

162
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,390
These arches have two particularities, the first one

163
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,022
is that they are circular, they have the shape of a circle.

164
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:35,677
And the second particularity, is that they finish

165
00:12:35,677 --> 00:12:39,140
vertically on the supports, on the left and on the right.

166
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,866
That is a good idea to finish vertically, as we will see it in

167
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:45,740
the next video, but now, it is not a very good idea, a

168
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,843
priori, to take a circular shape for an arch, since we have seen that,

169
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:51,734
pretty often, the right shape would rather

170
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:54,740
be a parabola, or possibly a catenary.

171
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,146
So,

172
00:12:55,146 --> 00:12:58,046
why does this shape work ?

173
00:12:58,046 --> 00:13:02,835
Because, obviously, it works, if these structures are here since 2000 years.

174
00:13:02,835 --> 00:13:04,870
Well, let's look at what helps them.

175
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:10,780
So, the arch itself, it is this zone which I indicate in yellow,

176
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,740
but it is surrounded

177
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,672
by all this system of masonry, on the left

178
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:29,780
and on the right, which we call reinforcement masonry.

179
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,620
The shape of this element, here, that is what we

180
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,046
call a spandrel, and the stiffening

181
00:13:40,046 --> 00:13:47,860
is made by the reinforcement masonry.

182
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,720
How does it work ?

183
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,890
So, I am just going to talk about the case of the variable loads, the distributed loads.

184
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,511
You will see, it can be solved in the same way than usually.

185
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,060
So, if I have, here, a big variable

186
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,850
load which acts, the funicular polygon, with all

187
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,000
the loads, should go up here and go down here, but that is not the case.

188
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,340
Now, what is the shape that the arch would tend to take ?

189
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,808
The arch, when we add it a big force, it

190
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:32,350
tends to want to go down, here, and to go up in the right part.

191
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,599
But in the right part, we precisely have this reinforcement masonry which

192
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:40,470
says : "no, no, I am not ready to let you go up".

193
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,555
And thus, this masonry has as effect to add

194
00:14:44,555 --> 00:14:47,901
a pressure on the arch, and this pressure is going

195
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:51,220
to stabilize the arch, making it come back to its place.

196
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,545
If now, my load moves to come on the other side,

197
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:59,884
then, that is the right part which now, tends to want to go down.

198
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:02,200
But the left part would like to go up, but on

199
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,104
the left, there is also this reinforcement masonry.

200
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,990
Thus, the structure is stable.

201
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,798
It also means that if you have such a bridge,

202
00:15:09,798 --> 00:15:14,055
well, there is no question of unwisely taking off this

203
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,525
reinforcement masonry, because

204
00:15:15,525 --> 00:15:17,779
it could easily lead to its collapse.

205
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:22,020
So, you have to proceed with caution during the restoration.

206
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,520
We have, here, the example of a big Gothic cathedral

207
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,650
which is surrounded by all a series of flying buttresses.

208
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,472
We are going to see that these elements are very important for

209
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:43,590
the stabilization of our cathedral. The vault, or the dome

210
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:50,074
which we have, here, tends to exert an inclined outwards force.

211
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,342
If there is nothing to resist to

212
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:56,172
this force, in all likelihood, the structure is going to collapse.

213
00:15:56,172 --> 00:16:00,830
So, that is why the architects of the Middle-Age have invented this concept of

214
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,860
flying buttresses, and why they have put them.

215
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,960
The flying buttress is going to act by its weight; to simplify, I only make it act

216
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,700
in the middle of the length of the flying buttress,

217
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,850
but it obviously acts in a distributed way.

218
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,150
What is the effect of this weight ?

219
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:20,840
If we look at the funicular polygon, well, the force which comes from the dome

220
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,266
pushes in this way, until it meets the yellow

221
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:29,874
force, which is going to change its direction, and to make

222
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:33,987
this force go down in an inclined way, and we can see

223
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:36,969
that, the funicular polygon stays

224
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:40,740
inside the matter and our structure remains stable.

225
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,240
But you have already seen in the lower part,

226
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,430
the line of the polygon of forces tends to want to get out of the matter.

227
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,990
Then, how does it work ?

228
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,950
Well, it works in two parts.

229
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,685
There is first, here, the weight of this column which is not negligible.

230
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,989
We can see that this column is quite

231
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:06,911
thick, and moreover, here, above, we have an element which we often

232
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:11,510
consider as decorative, but which actually has a structural function. It is called the

233
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,150
pinnacle, and the function of the pinnacle is to procure an additional weight

234
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,130
to the column.

235
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:24,424
Both together have the effect of significantly 

236
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:29,380
changing the direction of the new funicular polygon, in such

237
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,511
a way that it stays within the matter, and thus, a flying buttress

238
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:39,720
is a stabilizing element for a vault, or a dome of cathedral.

239
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,220
Approximately ten years ago,

240
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,434
we could read in the local newspaper

241
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:47,840
of Lausanne, "the cathedral stands by strings".

242
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,365
What was happening ?

243
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,683
If we look at the cathedral, we can see that in

244
00:17:51,683 --> 00:17:54,620
this zone, and it is the same thing on the other side,

245
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,750
there is a certain number of flying buttresses which have the

246
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,650
function of, precisely, stabilizing the main nave of the cathedral.

247
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,357
However, these flying buttresses were made of a relatively friable rock

248
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:10,840
which was degrading, and it was necessary to replace them.

249
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,632
But, as I told you, it is not

250
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:15,096
a good idea to remove flying buttresses.

251
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:16,870
So, what did we do ?

252
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:22,090
Well, we have replaced them by cables

253
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,842
which I call internal

254
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:33,490
cables. Why internal ?

255
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,910
Because these cables link together two

256
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,997
parts of the arch, but are not linked

257
00:18:39,997 --> 00:18:43,122
to the supports, unlike the first solution with

258
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,805
cables which I showed you.

259
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,972
Here we have a photo of the cathedral,

260
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:53,276
when the cables were present in the cathedral.

261
00:18:53,276 --> 00:18:55,940
There were four cables according to the paper, but

262
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,740
we can see three, here, and in the infographics

263
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,631
of the newspaper, we can see, well, maybe it is not very accurate, we are not

264
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:09,484
totally sure that these cables were located at these places, but they had

265
00:19:09,484 --> 00:19:14,844
the effect of exerting a inward force,

266
00:19:14,844 --> 00:19:19,160
in this way, on the cathedral, as a replacement for

267
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,200
the effect of the flying buttresses which pressed

268
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,053
in this way on the vault to stabilize it.

269
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,981
That is clear that it is not exactly the same effect,

270
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:33,604
but was sufficient during the maintenance works for 

271
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:36,530
the construction not to suffer, and for these

272
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,199
flying buttresses to be replaced, and the cables have been removed since.

273
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:45,860
We do not need to keep thinking in two dimensions.

274
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,337
We can also look at what happens in the third dimension,

275
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:52,265
and here, we have a very nice example, with the 

276
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:58,230
dome of the cathedral St. Peter of Rome, built in the 16th century. 

277
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:03,404
Soon after its construction, cracks were observed

278
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:08,580
in this dome which were approximately horizontal.

279
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,572
I am going to show you, later, how they were exactly.

280
00:20:13,572 --> 00:20:14,313
These cracks,

281
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:18,869
if we look at a vertical section of the cathedral, we can see that

282
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,986
actually, we have two domes, one internal

283
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:27,238
dome, one external dome, that is 

284
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:31,570
the one which we can see, and between both, we have an empty space.

285
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:39,497
This, it corresponds to the idea. It is necessary that the matter should be quite wide

286
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:43,940
for the funicular polygon to be able to stay inside the matter.

287
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,816
But it was not enough, and thus, it was observed, since

288
00:20:48,816 --> 00:20:54,028
there are stairs within the dome, that there were cracks in the

289
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:59,500
internal dome. It lasted some

290
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,895
time, and in the 18th century, the mathematician

291
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:09,220
Poleni was given the task of studying this problem and of finding a solution.

292
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,488
What he did was to

293
00:21:11,488 --> 00:21:15,420
look at how a sector of the cathedral works.

294
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:21,418
A sector, it is a slice which has not a constant thickness.

295
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:26,050
It is a little bit like a piece of cake, that is to say that in the middle

296
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,350
it is very, very thin, and on the edges, it is very large.

297
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,130
If we looked at

298
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,390
that in a plan view, it would have a triangular shape.

299
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,948
He represented the behavior of this arch, in a reverse

300
00:21:36,948 --> 00:21:41,440
way using a chain, on which he placed weights.

301
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,895
You can see, here, circles of varying diameters which represent

302
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:49,730
the various points. Thus, he has obtained, for this dome,

303
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:56,460
this shape, which is the shape

304
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,622
of the funicular polygon corresponding to the weight of the

305
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:08,150
structure. Afterwards, he reversed this drawing,

306
00:22:13,085 --> 00:22:21,125
and on the basis of this reversal, what can we notice ?

307
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,030
Well, we can notice that precisely, the funicular

308
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:30,420
polygon corresponding to the loads gets out of the matter,

309
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,213
which explains the presence of cracks.

310
00:22:33,213 --> 00:22:37,480
Now, the question is, how to repair this structure ?

311
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,325
Naturally,

312
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:40,925
we could have imagined to proceed as we proceeded

313
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:45,750
for the cathedral of Lausanne, that is to say to pull cables through.

314
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,129
But, I remind you, I have shown you before

315
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:50,935
a photo, there is a splendid golden ceiling.

316
00:22:50,935 --> 00:22:54,260
It would not be an extremely suitable solution,

317
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,770
we would really have lost a lot, from an artistic point of view.

318
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:03,482
The solution which was found was to place cables which surround

319
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:07,320
the dome, and which are put in tension.

320
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,804
There are several levels of cables which encircle this dome, and thus,

321
00:23:13,804 --> 00:23:19,620
from outside, they have this effect

322
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,043
of pushing inwards, and this has stabilized this dome.

323
00:23:25,043 --> 00:23:29,064
I do not want to tell you more about that, because you are going to have an exercise,

324
00:23:29,064 --> 00:23:31,656
this week about this dome.

325
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:36,264
So, I let you exactly discover how it worked.

326
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:41,350
To summarize the various stiffening methods which we have seen

327
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,456
in this lecture, we have seen

328
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:49,050
a stiffening by stiffening beam

329
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:07,750
which acts in the same way

330
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,768
than it acted for a cable. We have seen

331
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:20,220
a stiffening by multiple cables

332
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:26,510
which prevent the changing of shape of the arch,

333
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,520
when the arch tends to want to lift up under the effect of unsymmetrical

334
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,068
loads. We have seen a stiffening

335
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:44,680
by a significant thickness,

336
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:55,040
in which we enable the funicular polygon

337
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:59,430
to move while remaining inside the matter.

338
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:05,702
We have seen a stiffening 

339
00:25:05,702 --> 00:25:11,130
by additional cables,

340
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,642
as for the Tower Bridge in London. They are

341
00:25:19,642 --> 00:25:26,560
not additional cables, of course, they are additional arches,

342
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,753
and, these arches themselves,

343
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:38,960
were stiffened between themselves.

344
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:50,380
We have seen a stiffening by reinforcement masonry.

345
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:05,910
So, the reinforcement masonry is the masonry which is placed above

346
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:12,235
an arch, and which once again, in a quite similar way than the cables

347
00:26:12,235 --> 00:26:17,660
of the second solution, prevents the arch from going up when it would like to do it.

348
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,020
We have seen a stiffening by flying buttresses outside

349
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,390
the structure.

350
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,746
You will acknowledge that the flying buttresses take up quite a lot of space.

351
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:34,920
That is probably one of the reasons why

352
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,661
it worked well for a cathedral

353
00:26:38,661 --> 00:26:45,551
which was in a relatively unique place, and which had to remain a special place of the city.

354
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:49,690
But, it is not something which we can often see.

355
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:57,930
And finally, we have a stiffening by internal cables.

356
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,670
An internal cable being simply a cable which is not

357
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,674
linked to the supports, unlike the cables of the second solution.

358
00:27:06,674 --> 00:27:10,070
In this lecture, we have seen how arches

359
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,780
need to be stiffened to behave properly.

360
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,975
The purpose of the stiffening is to prevent

361
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:20,300
the arch from

362
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,900
deforming, and thus to ensure that the

363
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,980
funicular polygon remain inside the matter.

364
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,582
A solution which would only use the weight of the arch is not

365
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:36,735
possible, since an instability would still

366
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,210
occur with a small variable load.

367
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:39,858
There are

368
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:44,540
numerous solutions which call on cables,

369
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,740
on an increase of the thickness, on several arches with

370
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,243
a stiffening, on reinforcement masonry,

371
00:27:53,243 --> 00:27:57,960
on flying buttresses, or on internal cables.
