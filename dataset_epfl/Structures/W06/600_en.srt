Hello.

2
00:00:01,827 --> 00:00:07,640
We start today the lecture on the arches.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,620
When we talk about this kind of structure, we often think about the vaults of Antiquity.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,100
What you can see here, for example, they are 

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,014
vaults of the Roman thermal baths which have been built around

6
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:21,132
twenty centuries ago, by builders who did not

7
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:25,598
know the principles of statics and who did not know,

8
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:27,744
of course, how to calculate the structures.

9
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:31,978
The purpose of this lecture today is precisely to learn these principles.

10
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,870
The experience of builders of Antiquity were particularly based on what 

11
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,441
they have seen during the construction of the vaults, and

12
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:41,937
also during the collapsing of these structures, indeed there

13
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:44,280
were lots of them which collapsed in the past.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,088
We have here a model which reproduces quite well a masonry vault.

15
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:50,616
We can see,

16
00:00:50,616 --> 00:00:54,440
very well, for example, how such a vault can deform.

17
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,483
We can see here, for example, that we have the opening of

18
00:00:57,483 --> 00:01:00,950
joints between the arch stones which compose the vault, and we can

19
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,470
see very well by where passes the pressure

20
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,420
line, that is to say the internal force inside the vault.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,640
The study of the geometry of this pressure line is

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,064
fundamental to understand what is the ideal shape of a vault.

23
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:19,430
And that is what we are going to study, in this lecture.

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,542
That is from the moment when we have better

25
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,612
understood the functioning of this type of structure, that

26
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:28,088
we have developed graphical and analytical tools

27
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,904
which enable to determine the ideal shape of the vaults.

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:36,236
And it is from this moment that the architects and the engineers

29
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:40,992
have been able to design structures as for example the arch that you can see here,

30
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:46,558
it a structure of the 19th century, no longer only based on the experience,

31
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:51,113
but also on graphical and analytical methods.

32
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:54,239
It has also enabled to progress

33
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,504
towards much thinner structures like the reinforced

34
00:01:58,504 --> 00:02:01,294
concrete shell that you can see here, it is only

35
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:06,188
a few centimeters thick, or this one, it is also a reinforced concrete

36
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:11,512
shell of ten centimeters thickness, which I have designed a few year ago.

37
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:15,190
The learning center, this structures that the students

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,490
of EPFL know very well, it is also an example

39
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,735
of reinforced concrete shell which works exactly with

40
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:25,360
the principles that we are going to study in this lecture.
