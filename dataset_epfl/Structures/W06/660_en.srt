1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,525
Hello.

2
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:09,050
In this video, we will talk about the thrust of arches and about the pressure line.

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,370
We will see how thrust can be carried by adjacent arches.

4
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,911
We will see that the position of the pressure

5
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:19,830
line can vary inside the structure.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:25,610
We will see the stress dsitribution in the cross-section which can be elastic

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,800
or plastic.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,745
And, it will lead us to the limit eccentricity that the

9
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:36,040
pressure line can reach inside a given structure.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,295
And we will see that this eccentricity can

11
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:40,300
be exceeded and that the pressure line

12
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,560
can get out of the matter if the

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,235
material has a tensile strength.

14
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,765
In this applet, we have modelled an arch,

15
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:55,110
we have already introduced its two supports and the uniform loads which act on it.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,920
Then we introduce the funicular polygon.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,070
And we add a point of passage.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,880
It is thus an arch with three hinges, a hinge at each support, and

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,055
a hinge approximately in the middle of the arch, in this configuration.

20
00:01:12,055 --> 00:01:15,822
What we can see is that the blue line remains

21
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,423
in the center of the matter, not exactly

22
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:23,260
since it is an uniformly distributed load

23
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,280
and the arch has been designed for a load shaped like a catenary.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
But we are going to keep this shape. What we have seen in the applet, I quickly

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:41,196
draw it again. So, we have a

26
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:46,470
pressure line, roughly

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,485
in the middle of the structure. We call

28
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:56,274
this, the pressure line. The load

29
00:01:56,274 --> 00:02:01,705
which acts on our arch is a uniformly distributed

30
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:07,072
load, g. And our arch has a

31
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:12,770
span of l between both supports,

32
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,400
and its rise is the

33
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,680
maximum height of the arch

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,950
according to the line which links the supports.

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,075
We know that the forces at the supports of

36
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:37,070
the arch are, on the left and on the right, vertically, a force V,

37
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,910
which is equal to g times l over 2,

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:47,056
and horizontally, a force

39
00:02:47,056 --> 00:02:51,935
H, and this force H, I do not think we have done it for the arches but we had

40
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:57,483
done it in a symmetric way for the cables, its value

41
00:02:57,483 --> 00:03:03,030
is g times l squared over 8 times f. We can see that it is necessary to have

42
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:08,584
a force at the support which pushes the arch inwards.

43
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:15,925
It means that the arch pushes on its supports

44
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:21,210
horizontally

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,655
outwards.

46
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:33,940
That is what we call the thrust of the arch.

47
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,008
In our configuration, we

48
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:44,550
have supports which are able to support this thrust.

49
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,348
In reality, it will always be necessary

50
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:49,020
to be able to withstand it otherwise the arch will collapse.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,056
How can we withstand this thrust ? 

52
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:53,490
Always a load g.

53
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:57,138
And an arch which tends to push on its

54
00:03:57,138 --> 00:04:00,962
supports because it has an inclined compressive internal

55
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:05,210
force which arrives to the supports. Well, a solution, which we have seen, already a

56
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:14,730
certain time ago, it is to use flying buttresses.

57
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,123
A solution which is efficient,

58
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:21,947
the horizontal component of the thrust is

59
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:25,710
carried by the forces which are slightly inclined in the columns

60
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,208
and a little bit more inclined in the flying buttresses.

61
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,856
And the whole thrust H, on the left and on the right, is

62
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,560
carried by the pillars and by the flying buttresses.

63
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,750
But it is a solution which is relatively cumbersome and that is

64
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,050
a little bit a problem.

65
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,768
On the other hand, you have maybe note in certain cathedrals, for example,

66
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:48,280
there are intermediate pillars and they have no flying buttresses.

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,524
How does it work ?

68
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,300
This is an interesting property of the adjacent arches.

69
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,760
Let's take, for example, this bridge, which we have already seen in the heading of this lecture.

70
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,794
It has a certain length and it is a bridge which carries trains, so

71
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:09,880
locomotives, which are relatively heavy loads.

72
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:16,687
And yet, this bridge does not seem to have extremely thick pillars.

73
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:20,865
The ones I draw are rather thicker than they are in reality.

74
00:05:20,865 --> 00:05:26,725
What do we have here ? We have, on the top of each of these pillars, we

75
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:32,610
have an arch with

76
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,778
arch stones, and then a thrust.

77
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:41,950
What I draw is a little bit twisted but you get the message!

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,200
There is just at the end, we reach here,

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,020
what we call the abutment, it is the end of the bridge.

80
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,832
Then, here, we are going to find ourselves with a wall,

81
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:57,380
you have already seen that,

82
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,105
there we go, here we have our valley. What happens?

83
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,966
Let's look at a free-body, which is located here.

84
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,350
Let's draw again our free-body, bigger.

85
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,190
On the left, we have a part of arch, on the right, a part of arch.

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:22,820
And here, a part of pillar. We have a pressure which comes

87
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,490
from the left, a pressure which comes from the right.

88
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,419
Let's make a polygon of forces, what do we have ?

89
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,790
We have the internal force Pd, then the internal force Pg and we

90
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,025
can notice that both horizontal components 

91
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:48,990
cancel each other out in such a way that the internal force

92
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:56,410
in the column, here, on the bottom, is vertical.

93
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:00,110
That is very interesting. So, we can notice

94
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,824
that the thrust is canceled in adjacent arches.

95
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:06,635
So, it supposes that the arches are exactly identical, if they are

96
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:08,795
not exactly identical, the

97
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:11,760
thrust is only partially canceled but for the most part.

98
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,748
So, this is an interesting property

99
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,985
of adjacent arches which enables to

100
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:21,285
only carry the thrust on the abutment, because on the 

101
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:25,010
abutment, here, we are going to have a thrust

102
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,380
which cannot be offset.

103
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,230
However, the advantage we have is that we are close

104
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,339
to the ground, we are simply going to make a big

105
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,721
wall and this big wall is going to carry this thrust,

106
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:39,010
and to transmit it to the ground which does not move.

107
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,880
This is what

108
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:45,100
we have already seen in the applet. When we have an arch with three

109
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,851
hinges, well, the shape of the funicular polygon is

110
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:58,740
defined, there is only one solution. So, here we have the span, the

111
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,710
rise

112
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:19,126
and then the thrust, H is equal to g

113
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:26,120
l square over 8 f. We are totally sure of that.

114
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,230
The advantage of this solution is that it is insensitive

115
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,264
to temperature differences and

116
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:44,855
to support settlements.

117
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:49,275
Thus, if the supports move, which can happen since since we are going to apply

118
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:54,222
big forces on them, further to the arch construction, well,

119
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:59,200
this arch is not going to change its shape. And that is not going to pose an essential

120
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,064
problem for the structure.

121
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:04,474
Then, it is an advantage, and it explains why

122
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:08,082
arches with three hinges have been quite popular, at the

123
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:10,644
beginning of the industrial era, during the nineteenth 

124
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:12,230
century and at the beginning of the twentieth 

125
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,605
century because they were structures which were easy to understand.

126
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:19,028
They are also easier to calculate but

127
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:21,280
nowadays, it is not a problem anymore.

128
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,540
If we have an arch with two hinges,

129
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,615
well, the pressure line

130
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:34,639
is maybe in the middle as I have drawn it before, but it

131
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:44,610
can eventually go down until the lowermost part or go up until the uppermost part.

132
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,960
And actually, it can take any position between these two extremes.

133
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,480
We know the span, as before, it is still equal to l.

134
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:18,638
And the rise, at this moment, can vary between a minimal

135
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:25,750
value and a maximal value,

136
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,320
f min and f max

137
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,750
The

138
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,235
maximal

139
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:47,436
thrust, H max, is equal to g

140
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:53,435
l square over 8 f min.

141
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:58,025
So, it is the lower

142
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:03,372
configuration, for which the thrust is bigger

143
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:08,482
since the rise is smaller. The minimal

144
00:11:08,482 --> 00:11:13,806
thrust, H min, is

145
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:18,850
equal to g l square over

146
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,865
8 f max.

147
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:24,195
Well, I forgot to put it but g, obviously,

148
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:27,330
it was the load which was applied on our structure.

149
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,895
And if we have an arch without hinge, always with the

150
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:36,667
load g, the pressure line is even more free to change.

151
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:39,455
It can start here, on the lowermost part of the arch,

152
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:44,370
on the extreme external part of the arch, pass by the lowermost part

153
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:51,030
in the middle of the span, and go until the extreme external part on the right.

154
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,350
Or on the contrary, it can start on the extreme internal

155
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,100
part on the left, go until the uppermost part,

156
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:02,570
and go down on the extreme internal part, on the right.

157
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:09,540
These configurations does not have the same span anymore, we have a minimal

158
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:18,040
span and a maximal span,

159
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:36,130
as well as a minimal rise and a maximal rise.

160
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:08,228
The maximal thrust H max

161
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:13,290
is equal to g l max

162
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,550
square over 8 f min.

163
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,600
Then it is the flattest configuration.

164
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:33,862
While the minimal

165
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:38,041
thrust H

166
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:43,827
min is equal to

167
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:49,320
g l min square over

168
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,660
8 f max. It should be noted that it is a similar

169
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,670
solution to the one of the arch with two hinges, but which is even more

170
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,600
sensitive to the temperature

171
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,815
differences and to the support settlements. Then

172
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,875
it is a solution which

173
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:19,665
is absolutely adequate but we will avoid it, for example, if we have grounds which

174
00:14:19,665 --> 00:14:23,926
are a little bit soft because with this solution we will have a risk of movement of the arch.

175
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:27,465
However, if we are, for example, on a mountain, we can cross a valley,

176
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:31,177
it is a solution which is absolutely commendable.

177
00:14:31,177 --> 00:14:32,852
Let's come back to the case of the arch with

178
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:37,290
three hinges subjected to a uniformly distributed

179
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,405
load g and we want to look at the stresses which act in the cross-section.

180
00:14:43,405 --> 00:14:45,214
First, we have to know

181
00:14:45,214 --> 00:14:49,686
the dimensions of the section. Here we can see that the thickness of the arch has a

182
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:54,110
certain value, I am going to call it t.

183
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,934
And then, this arch has a

184
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:04,480
height h which is also identified here. We

185
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,630
are first going to look at the elastic stress

186
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:18,250
distribution which corresponds

187
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,346
to what we have seen until now in our course.

188
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:27,591
That is to say, when we have a compressive internal force N

189
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:32,010
which acts on a surface,

190
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,560
stresses act.

191
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,100
For everything to be in equilibrium, of stresses,

192
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,700
sigma is equal to N over A,

193
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,526
that is to say N over t times h. Thus, if we know

194
00:15:55,526 --> 00:16:01,788
t and h and if we know the internal force N, we can determine the elastic stresses.

195
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:02,880
However, you

196
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,400
will see that a plastic stresses

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,369
distribution will be useful to see how the pressure

198
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:22,905
line can indeed move inside a section.

199
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:26,331
This, without making a too complicated reasoning.

200
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:31,940
In a plastic stresses distribution, either the compressive

201
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:39,438
stress is equal to zero, either the compressive stress is equal to the

202
00:16:39,438 --> 00:16:41,790
compressive strength fc.

203
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,681
So, we cannot have smaller stresses, they must

204
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:47,927
be equal to zero, or equal to fc.

205
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,870
How are we going to do?

206
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,590
We still have the compressive internal force N.

207
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,470
What we can see is that here, clearly, the compressive stress

208
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,721
which we had on the left with the elastic distribution was low.

209
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:06,770
Here, what we are going to do is that we are going to have a zone with this stress fc.

210
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:13,270
And this stress fc, here, it strongly

211
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,022
acts. And obviously, it

212
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:25,101
means that we do not need to use all the width of the section h.

213
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:30,380
We are just going to use a small part of the section.

214
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,975
Well, that is not really like

215
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:34,285
that that it behaves in reality, but this way

216
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:38,405
to think, you will see, will help us later.

217
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:44,430
What we can see is that we have N is equal to fc times b times t.

218
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,760
What interests us is b since that is what we do not know.

219
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,340
So, b is equal to N divided by fc times t. If we reach

220
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,620
the maximum internal force which can be taken by this section, b becomes equal to

221
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,970
h and both approaches on the left and on the right are identical.

222
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,350
That will not happen very often with the arches, but it is theoretically possible.

223
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,706
In this arch with three hinges, to simplify the things, I

224
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:16,007
am going to place the hinge in the middle, in

225
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,047
such a way that the structure is symmetrical.

226
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,444
Obviously, it does not correspond exactly to the reality,

227
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:22,432
in what we have constructed or in what

228
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,788
we have observed in our model, but,

229
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:27,090
for this model, we can accept it.

230
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,565
What interests us is to see what is going to happen to

231
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:34,820
the pressure line if the loads which are applied on the arch change.

232
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,690
Well, how are they going to change ?

233
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,895
We are going to modify them. We are going to modify the forces which act here

234
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:47,929
on the left. We select them, the forces which act on the left

235
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,050
part, and I increase their value.

236
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:03,874
What we can notice is that when I increase the load on the left part,

237
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:10,404
the arch goes up until approaching the extrados here, the external

238
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:14,372
surface and then in this right part, we can see that on the contrary,

239
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:19,230
the pressure line approaches the lower surface of the arch.

240
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,786
Now, I have selected the loads

241
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:26,643
which act on the right part of the arch. Likewise, I increase their value.

242
00:19:26,643 --> 00:19:28,799
And what we can is is that, in the

243
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,845
same way, the arch goes up in the right part until

244
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:37,815
potentially touching the upper surface, and it goes down in

245
00:19:37,815 --> 00:19:42,260
the left part until potentially touching the lower surface.

246
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,110
I copy in this picture what we have observed,

247
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,712
then, with an hinge on the

248
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:57,640
top. When the loads are

249
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,841
symmetrical, the pressure line is centered, approximately centered.

250
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:07,465
When the loads are asymmetrical, the pressure line goes up

251
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:12,550
in the left part and goes down in the right part.

252
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:17,444
And the opposite occurs when 

253
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:22,490
we increase the internal forces in the right part of

254
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,040
the arch. We can observe that the pressure line

255
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,180
moves

256
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,320
inside the structure

257
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,340
according to the applied load.

258
00:20:56,265 --> 00:21:04,190
On the other hand, we can notice that, in zones close to the hinges,

259
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,590
the position of the pressure line

260
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:30,575
does not vary a lot. It means that maybe

261
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:35,893
we could take off matter in theses places, if we are interested.

262
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:38,051
We can notice this, we have already seen it

263
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:42,510
in certain examples of arches, particularly with two hinges.

264
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,604
Let's now look at what happens when the pressure line is

265
00:21:47,604 --> 00:21:52,800
a little bit eccentric and we are going to look at that only in a plastic point of view. 

266
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,880
We are going to have here, a pressure line a little bit

267
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,740
eccentric.

268
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,024
So, it was initially here, it

269
00:22:08,024 --> 00:22:12,826
also represents the axis of our element. We have an

270
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:16,832
eccentricity e which has been created

271
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,100
outwards. In this case, we could have done it inwards.

272
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:31,100
And the stresses are shared in the following way.

273
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,276
We still have the stress fc on a

274
00:22:43,276 --> 00:22:48,778
certain width b, and we can see that we are not yet 

275
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:54,060
arrived on the edge of the matter, we still could go a little bit more on the left.

276
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,670
Here we are going to go to the limit eccentricity

277
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,113
of the pressure line. What does it mean ?

278
00:23:10,113 --> 00:23:13,910
It means that we will have pushed our stresses, they are going to increase

279
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,970
a little bit because maybe we will have increased the force.

280
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:23,970
At this moment, our stresses will fill all the matter

281
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:31,050
until the edge.

282
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,417
So, we have the stress fc which acts, we have

283
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:46,010
a limit width

284
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,584
which I call b l, the limit width and we have in the same

285
00:23:51,584 --> 00:23:56,940
time here, the limit eccentricity.

286
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,080
So, what happens if we want to increase the eccentricity ?

287
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,752
Well, we still can go a little bit more on the left

288
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:08,812
with the internal force N, I should have written that this internal force was called N.

289
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:11,292
I think you had guessed it.

290
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,874
I could go further with the internal force N but

291
00:24:13,874 --> 00:24:16,730
I cannot take a larger stress.

292
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,467
Right ?

293
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:20,080
Because I am at the level of the material strength.

294
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,110
And if I want to have something which is symmetrical...

295
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,170
I mean, I must have something which is symmetrical for the

296
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,578
resultant of all these stresses to be in equilibrium with the internal force N.

297
00:24:30,578 --> 00:24:33,434
So, if I want to go further, I am going 

298
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:37,130
to have a surface which is going to decrease, thus the force is going to decrease. 

299
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,540
Actually, I could not go further than this eccentricity.

300
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,648
That is what we have a little bit in our case here.

301
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:47,157
We have an internal force which is supported on both

302
00:24:47,157 --> 00:24:51,132
sides, which reaches a certain limit value.

303
00:24:51,132 --> 00:24:54,432
If, instead of having rubber layer, we had a very fragile

304
00:24:54,432 --> 00:24:57,973
material, as there is only a very small width 

305
00:24:57,973 --> 00:25:02,569
of maybe one centimeter in which the internal force can pass in 

306
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:06,802
our timber arch, well, a failure could have occurred.

307
00:25:06,802 --> 00:25:10,580
In reality, it is absolutely a case which is realistic.

308
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,649
So, the pressure line, well, it

309
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:16,992
cannot get out of the matter by all appearances.

310
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:21,641
However, in this video, I use a trick to enable

311
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:24,644
the pressure line to get out of the matter.

312
00:25:24,644 --> 00:25:28,308
In a place where a crack largely opens, I

313
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:31,892
put a piece of adhesive tape which I seriously fix to the arch.

314
00:25:31,892 --> 00:25:36,544
And afterwards, when I press on the arch, well, obviously in this place here, this

315
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:38,924
crack cannot open, and the arch

316
00:25:38,924 --> 00:25:42,460
still works normally, but, in this place here

317
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,960
I can press stronger, without the crack opening.

318
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,064
What happens ?

319
00:25:48,064 --> 00:25:50,752
Let's look at how it works in reality. So, in reality, in

320
00:25:50,752 --> 00:25:56,280
this place here, the pressure line is outside the matter,

321
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:06,475
well, in principle, it is not possible if we only have masonry,

322
00:26:06,475 --> 00:26:10,390
we have seen it, we reach the limit eccentricity, we cannot go further.

323
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,040
We cannot get out of the matter.

324
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,150
However, we have seen that, thanks to my yellow

325
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,435
piece of adhesive tape here, I have been able to go further.

326
00:26:19,435 --> 00:26:21,190
What happened?

327
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,125
Let's have a look. We have here our internal force,

328
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:30,585
we have our eccentricity, which is greater than

329
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:34,900
the limit eccentricity which we had before. Why?

330
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,333
Because we have introduced here this

331
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:44,880
element of adhesive tape which obviously cannot really

332
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,640
support compression but it is a place 

333
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,040
where there is not a lot of compression.

334
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
We can see that there is a joint which tries to

335
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,820
open, thus we are going to have a tensile internal force here.

336
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,640
What does it mean ?

337
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,600
It means that our internal force will

338
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,530
now be supported by a compression part

339
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:10,236
and this compression part will correspond to

340
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:16,120
the limit eccentricity, with

341
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,965
stresses here,

342
00:27:20,965 --> 00:27:26,160
fc, and a certain width

343
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,855
and by the tensile internal

344
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:34,815
force T in the scotch. I propose you to look at how it

345
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:40,314
works by means of this applet. So, I apply here, a

346
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:45,356
force, which corresponds to the

347
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:50,525
compression, then it does not exactly act at the limit of the

348
00:27:50,525 --> 00:27:55,970
section but not very far. And then, I make act a second force

349
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,223
which is the one of the adhesive tape, which acts in the other direction.

350
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,320
It is not very large, because this piece of adhesive tape is small,

351
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,760
it is just here, on the edge, these two forces are in principle parallel.

352
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,840
They do not need to be exactly parallel, but in principle, they are.

353
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,880
And now, I am going to use this button

354
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,865
"resultant" of the applet, and what do I see ?

355
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:21,393
You could have seen it if you had made the resultant by yourself,

356
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,263
by hand, it is absolutely possible.

357
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,404
It is part of the reasons for which we oblige you to

358
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,320
master well the resultants and what happens.

359
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,280
I think that if I had asked you,

360
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,240
what is the resultant of two forces which are

361
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,130
opposite, you would have say "yes, it is

362
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,108
not between both forces, it is outside".

363
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:39,994
Well, we take advantage of it. So, you can see that

364
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:45,920
adding a small red force here, we make move the

365
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,440
resultant outwards.

366
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,612
If we modify this force, you can see that we can make it move quite enough

367
00:28:52,612 --> 00:28:55,350
outside but obviously, it will need

368
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,415
more adhesive tape, that is more matter.

369
00:28:57,415 --> 00:29:00,778
In a concrete arch, it means reinforcement, in a steel arch,

370
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:03,990
actually it means that we must have a steel section which

371
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,545
is able to resist to this tension but actually, you remember

372
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:11,307
that among the arches we have seen, there were lots of arches which were

373
00:29:11,307 --> 00:29:13,750
steel arches

374
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,426
which can support a certain tension. So, there are 

375
00:29:17,426 --> 00:29:20,242
the pure masonry arches, as the Pont du Gard,

376
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:23,958
the Roman arches, we are going to say the classic masonry arches.

377
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,698
But, there are also lots of arches

378
00:29:25,698 --> 00:29:28,250
made by technological products which can have

379
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,604
a small eccentricity thanks to the fact that they

380
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:32,770
resist a little bit tension.

381
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,480
In this video, we have seen what is the pressure

382
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,642
line and the thrust of an arch, we have seen that it is necessary to support

383
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:43,220
this thrust, and that it can be supported

384
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:47,205
particularly, by opposite thrust, when we have adjacent arches.

385
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:50,425
We have seen what are the elastic and plastic stress

386
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:53,980
distributions in the arch, we have seen that there can be

387
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,856
an eccentricity of the pressure line inside

388
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:01,302
the structure according to, particularly, the loads which are applied,

389
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:04,840
we have seen that this eccentricity can reach a limit value but

390
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,740
that this limit value can also be exceeded, if we are in the presence

391
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,602
of a material which resists tension, or at least of a

392
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,835
material which has 

393
00:30:14,835 --> 00:30:17,960
reinforcements which can resist tension.
