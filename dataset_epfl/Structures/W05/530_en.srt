00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:04,627
Hello.

2
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:08,526
In this video, we will see how to stiffen cables because, as you

3
00:00:08,526 --> 00:00:12,702
have already observed during the manipulations of the previous videos, when we

4
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:15,936
place a load on a cable, it deforms a lot, and

5
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:20,544
it is not very comfortable, and it can sometimes be problematic.

6
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:24,504
We will see how the big deformations of the cables

7
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:29,630
can be limited by using diverse types of stiffening,

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,769
to improve the comfort of the users,

9
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:35,957
it is not very enjoyable to cross a

10
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:39,060
footbridge which moves a lot, but also the safety.

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:44,989
For example, the deformations of a bridge while a high speed train

12
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:48,223
passes are going to determine the maximum speed which

13
00:00:48,223 --> 00:00:52,048
is possible to avoid a risk of derailment.

14
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,717
And for this, we will see various

15
00:00:54,717 --> 00:00:59,630
methods of stiffening which can often be combined together.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,265
In this video, we can see the effect that a load added

17
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,280
on the right on the cable has on the entire cable.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,205
The right part of the cable,

19
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:12,910
significantly goes down, while the left part goes up.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,088
There is no place along the cable which

21
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:18,825
which does not move when we add a vertical load.

22
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:19,930
We look at 

23
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,465
this example dealing with the case of two cables which have

24
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:28,160
shapes relatively close to the cables of real structures: one with a

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,276
polygonal shape, with only two permanent applied loads G, one with

26
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:38,960
a parabolic shape with a load uniformly distributed along the axis x.

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,587
And on the right, we will see how,

28
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:45,280
when we add to these loads, a variable load,

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,109
the shape of the cable is modified.

30
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,587
On the left, the shape of the cable, we already know it.

31
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,610
It is already drawn, by the way.

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,556
It is rectilinear between the supports and the loads for

33
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:10,727
both concentrated loads, and then it is parabolic,

34
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:15,151
well, in that case, with very small changes of angles when

35
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:20,262
we introduces loads, but it is pretty much a continuous shape.

36
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:25,562
When we add an additional variable load Q, for example the

37
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,300
passing of a vehicle, but it can also

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,566
be persons who gather in a

39
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,880
house, or even snow which piles up on a roof.

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,980
We add a variable load

41
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,418
Q, and we look at how these cables deform.

42
00:02:44,418 --> 00:02:50,042
Well, we have seen it in the video about the cable with concentrated loads.

43
00:02:50,042 --> 00:02:54,990
So, the cable goes down under the effect of the load Q, on

44
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,460
the right, and the rest of the cable goes up.

45
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:06,938
When we apply a load in addition to another distributed

46
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:10,010
load, we have the same thing which happens.

47
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,170
So, on the right part, the cable goes down, and on

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,481
the left part, it tends to become at once flatter and a little bit higher.

49
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:26,770
Everywhere, but particularly where we have applied

50
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,839
the additional loads, we have a large

51
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:36,520
displacement, also here,

52
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,016
which is a problem since, one more time, it can

53
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,750
scare someone who crosses a

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,310
footbridge, that is the example which we can see, here.

55
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,050
That is very funny to do that as sporting activity,

56
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,702
but it is less enjoyable to do that if we are

57
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:02,630
coming back to home

58
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,370
with shopping or a school bag, it becomes dangerous.

59
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,922
Likewise, if there are distributed loads which,

60
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:11,590
would maybe be more characteristic of groups

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,446
of persons, or of big trucks.

62
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:19,390
In this video, we first see the cable under its self-weight,

63
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,989
which has a certain shape, the shape of the catenary which we know well.

64
00:04:22,989 --> 00:04:25,673
If we add a weight to this cable, it takes

65
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,984
a triangular shape with 

66
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:31,050
very significant displacements.

67
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,110
In the second part of this video,

68
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,021
we have the same shape, but for

69
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,351
this shape, we have already added a series

70
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:43,777
of rectangular red weights which symbolize the weight of a

71
00:04:43,777 --> 00:04:46,633
structure, since structures always have a self-weight.

72
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,889
This structures, let's say that it is made

73
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,598
of concrete, it is quite heavy.

74
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:55,164
If now, we add to it one, then two loads, we can

75
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:59,264
notice that yes, it always moves in the zone of the

76
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:02,857
loads, but in a much less pronounced way.

77
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:07,820
So, we have a way to decrease the deformations, if we start with a

78
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,992
significant weight. The first solution of stiffening is

79
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:18,240
thus a stiffening by a significant weight.

80
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,648
If we first look at the case of the roof

81
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:28,630
of the airport of Dulles, on the left, which we have already seen.

82
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,654
Well, when we send a few people on the

83
00:05:31,654 --> 00:05:35,470
roof to do sealing works, for example,

84
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,738
we do not wish that these people be

85
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,654
in danger, respectively, that there are too much vibrations.

86
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,517
So, this structure has to be stiff enough.

87
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:48,525
Another case which often occurs, it is the presence of snow on the roof.

88
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:49,764
And if there is wind,

89
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:52,655
the snow will only pile up on one part of the roof.

90
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:55,832
For example, on the right, as I have shown.

91
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,420
The solution used for this roof to avoid

92
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,342
the problems, is that it is quite heavy, in concrete.

93
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:05,870
Thus, the weight of the persons is relatively

94
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,960
small compared to the weight of the roof.

95
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,560
Likewise, the snow load is relatively small.

96
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,348
The structure on the right, built by Le Corbusier, in France,

97
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:20,350
in Firminy-Vert, uses the same principle. We have a series of

98
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:25,160
load-bearing cables; here, we can

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,810
see them well; here, another pair.

100
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:46,240
And then I just draw one of both following cables, and so forth.

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,730
Note that this series of cable is not itself a roof.

102
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,268
It is necessary to add something to get a roof.

103
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,257
What Le Corbusier did, is that he has placed between these

104
00:06:57,257 --> 00:06:59,058
pairs of cables, precast

105
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:02,232
concrete panels which we can clearly see,

106
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:06,595
and these panels which touch each

107
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:11,740
other, provide watertightness, and thus create the roof.

108
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,390
Above, we have also added an

109
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,420
external watertight cladding, but it is relatively lightweight.

110
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,618
Then, we have the advantage

111
00:07:19,618 --> 00:07:21,953
that this solution has a certain weight.

112
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:24,017
So if someone, once more time, has to

113
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:27,331
go on the roof to do, for example, sealing works,

114
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:30,745
well, there is no problem

115
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:35,518
since the persons will be relatively light compared to the weight of these

116
00:07:35,518 --> 00:07:40,920
precast concrete panels.

117
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,755
The picture on the top is a photo which was taken during the construction of the building.

118
00:07:50,755 --> 00:07:53,305
At the bottom, a more recent picture in which we can see

119
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:56,605
that the structure has approximately the same appearance. 

120
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:58,540
We still distinguish the cables.

121
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,708
In this video, I try to make roll one of my 10 Newton weights on a

122
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:09,293
small board which is hung up from the cable. Note that under

123
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:11,168
this board, there still are the red

124
00:08:11,168 --> 00:08:13,352
weights which symbolize the weight of the structure.

125
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:16,860
A structure has always some self-weight, that is why I let these weights.

126
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,790
But the novelty is the addition of the horizontal deck on

127
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,089
which the weight of 10 Newtons rolls.

128
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:29,130
And we can see that when I place a weight, or even two weights of 10 Newtons, well,

129
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,396
the displacement where

130
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,710
the load is, is quite small.

131
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,448
If we turn this small timber board

132
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:40,552
on its edge, it becomes even stiffer, and

133
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,796
we can see that the deformation, whether it be

134
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:46,284
with one or two loads is almost invisible.

135
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:50,370
We have thus transformed our system into a very stiff system.

136
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:56,120
It is, in this case here, a stiffening

137
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,895
by a stiffening beam.

138
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,092
We have already seen, in the bottom left-hand corner, the case of the

139
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:11,080
Golden Gate bridge, on which we have a very large

140
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,041
stiffening beam, and we have said that it is called a

141
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:20,040
truss, with this system in zigzag which is very very common.

142
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:30,530
And below, we have the Chain Bridge in Budapest, on which we also have the

143
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,188
same system of stiffening which we can see enlarged in the bottom right-hand corner.

144
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:40,860
Here, we can see this beam with the vertical

145
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,640
and diagonal elements which constitute this stiffening beam.

146
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,266
This system is very efficient, and has been quite used

147
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,501
for the stiffening of the long span bridges.

148
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:59,207
Another solution is to add cables, in orange here, in diagonal which we

149
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:04,448
call stay cables; we can see that the stay cable on

150
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:09,420
the right directly carries the load which is applied on it,

151
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,562
whether we add one or two loads,

152
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:14,140
with a quite small resulting deformation.

153
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,274
We can see this system

154
00:10:15,274 --> 00:10:16,660
in the Brooklyn Bridge.

155
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,244
So, on the Brooklyn Bridge, we can first

156
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:22,760
notice that there is also a stiffening beam.

157
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,200
I told you, the systems are often combined.

158
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,160
And then, there is a series of stay cables which are cables which are hung

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,638
from the top of the pillars, and which go down to various

160
00:10:40,638 --> 00:10:44,502
locations to be directly connected to the deck.

161
00:10:44,502 --> 00:10:50,410
It is here, a stiffening by a system of stay cables.

162
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:56,755
If we look at the right part of the photo,

163
00:10:56,755 --> 00:11:02,890
we can recognize these stay cables which are hung on the top of the tower

164
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,510
and which are linked to the deck. There are different

165
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,006
families of stay cables. Here, I draw two of them which are hung from

166
00:11:20,006 --> 00:11:26,260
the central tower, but we have also a family of stay cables

167
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,970
which are hung from the edge towers,

168
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,380
on both sides

169
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,211
We can see here, another family of cables which

170
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:52,280
vertically goes down to also reach

171
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,400
the level of the deck. These cable are

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,512
classic hangers. As we can see

173
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:07,750
them, here, in the view, on the left, they are

174
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,930
classic hangers which link

175
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,376
the deck to the load-bearing cable, since on this

176
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:23,850
bridge, we also have, as bearing system, a parabolic

177
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,900
cable similar to the one we know for the Golden Gate Bridge.

178
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,518
Another solution to be able to carry variable loads,

179
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,863
always with the presence of the self-weight

180
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:38,074
of the structure, is to have multiple cables.

181
00:12:38,074 --> 00:12:41,885
We know that if we place the load more on the right part,

182
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,760
well, a triangular shape which goes down,

183
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,906
more on the right would be favorable.

184
00:12:46,906 --> 00:12:49,458
If we place the load more on the left, then a

185
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:53,199
triangular shape with the lowest part on the left would be favorable.

186
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:55,403
Then what we do, it is that we combine

187
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:57,874
two or several cables to get a shape

188
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,026
which is adapted.

189
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:01,329
If the load is more on the left, it will

190
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:03,926
be more carried, in our case, by the red cable.

191
00:13:03,926 --> 00:13:06,609
If it is more on the right, as in the case in which I

192
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,840
added two loads, it will be more carried by the white cable.

193
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,272
That is this system which we observe on the Tower Bridge in

194
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:20,030
London, for the lateral spans of this bridge, where we have two cables,

195
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:29,432
one which begins on the lower part and which goes up to the

196
00:13:29,432 --> 00:13:33,620
upper part, and the second one which

197
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,760
is first above, then it is below.

198
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,994
And these two cables collaborate together,

199
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:50,290
the pink cable tending to carry more

200
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:54,060
the loads when the vehicles are close to the support

201
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,842
of the left abutment, while the blue

202
00:13:56,842 --> 00:13:59,254
cable will tend to carry the loads,

203
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:02,620
when they will come closer to the intermediate tower.

204
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,090
Let's also note the presence of vertical and diagonal

205
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:09,360
elements between these two elements

206
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,570
of cable, which are here to stiffen the system even further.

207
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,305
It is here a stiffening by

208
00:14:20,305 --> 00:14:26,520
multiple cables.

209
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,798
In the case of this bridge, we have two cables, but

210
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:33,094
we could absolutely have a system with more cables.

211
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:34,565
When we

212
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:38,695
added weight to our structure,

213
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:41,623
in the first solution, what did we do ?

214
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:43,618
We placed internal forces in the cable of

215
00:14:43,618 --> 00:14:47,482
the top, the load-bearing cable, we increased the internal forces which

216
00:14:47,482 --> 00:14:50,682
acted in this cable, and the result of this increase

217
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,250
of the internal forces was a decrease of the deformation.

218
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,135
However, we had the drawback

219
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,865
to have had to put lots of weight,

220
00:14:57,865 --> 00:14:59,757
which is at once expensive because we

221
00:14:59,757 --> 00:15:00,675
must pay this weight,

222
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:04,285
and doubly expensive because we must have a cable which resists more.

223
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:08,380
A solution would be to be able to add the internal forces without adding weight.

224
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,960
Obviously, we should continue to pay for the increased internal forces.

225
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,012
That is the solution which is presented here, with what we

226
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:18,936
call a pretensioning cable, it is the lower red cable.

227
00:15:18,936 --> 00:15:21,064
This cable is oriented downwards.

228
00:15:21,064 --> 00:15:24,973
A priori, it would work well if the loads were upwards.

229
00:15:24,973 --> 00:15:26,809
Well, that is exactly the way they are.

230
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:29,628
The orange hangers between both cables transmit a

231
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,236
tensile internal force between both cables, the

232
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:37,008
consequence is that both cables are in tension,

233
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:39,920
even before the first applied load.

234
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,940
That is why we call this a pretensioning system.

235
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,208
And, we can see that when we add one or

236
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,190
two loads to this system, it only deforms a little bit.

237
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,019
Note that I did not add the self-weight

238
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,034
on this model, but if I had add it, it would not have

239
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:57,730
changed anything, it would have just deformed even less.

240
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:04,104
It is thus a stiffening by

241
00:16:04,104 --> 00:16:10,505
pretensioning cable. Be careful to vocabulary: it is not a pretentious

242
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:15,163
cable, it is a pre-tensioning cable. So, we observe, here, in this

243
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:18,400
structure, the load-bearing cable, which I draw, here, in red.

244
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,340
In the elevation, below, I also draw it in red.

245
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,468
It reaches the pylon and it goes down into the ground, we can see it here, on the right with

246
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:43,274
a double cable which is anchored in the ground. Then, there is a

247
00:16:43,274 --> 00:16:49,180
second cable which is this cable that I draw, here, in orange,

248
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,370
which is in tension between both supports of the vertical cables

249
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,970
which bring back the load-bearing cable to the ground. And between these two cables,

250
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,140
we have hangers,

251
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,320
which stabilize the system. And we finish with, obviously,

252
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,908
the compression which is carried by two

253
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:27,878
masts, on the left and on the right. We have then seen,

254
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:33,076
here, the load-bearing cable, and

255
00:17:33,076 --> 00:17:38,677
below, the pretensioning

256
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:44,265
cable. This

257
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:49,194
second structure illustrates the same

258
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:54,765
principle. That is what the engineer Jawerth

259
00:17:54,765 --> 00:18:00,310
has called a cables beam,

260
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,470
but it is really a pretensioning system.

261
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,582
What do we have in this system ?

262
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:14,974
Well, that is very similar to what we had before.

263
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:24,200
So, we have cables which are anchored in the ground, a load-bearing cable,

264
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,620
a pretensioning cable.

265
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,859
Then, instead of having

266
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:57,410
hangers, we now have a system of diagonals

267
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,140
which are all in tension, therefore they are all

268
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:07,680
represented by cables, which makes for a very lightweight

269
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,820
structure. Finally, we obviously

270
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,358
still have masts to carry the

271
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,702
vertical loads and bring them down to the ground.

272
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:23,423
There are other types of pretensioning systems.

273
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:28,799
There is a special video which follows this video which only deals with

274
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,490
variations of the pretensioning systems.

275
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,972
In this table, I am going to resume the six systems which we have

276
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:42,620
seen to stiffen the cables. The first stiffening is made

277
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:51,817
by means of a significant weight. What does it mean, significant ?

278
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:55,892
Well, it means that it clearly has to be more

279
00:19:55,892 --> 00:20:00,530
significant that the vertical loads which apply on the structure.

280
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,810
The second system,

281
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:07,020
it was a stiffening beam.

282
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:19,225
So, this beam is hung up from hangers which are hung up to the

283
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:24,166
cables, and it offers an adequate

284
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:29,812
stiffness to enable that, when a load is applied on the stiffening

285
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:34,441
beam, it is going to be transmitted, not to only to one hanger,

286
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,254
which would locally deforms the cable in a very

287
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:38,630
significant way, but it going to be transmitted to several

288
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:41,276
hangers, which is going to limit the deformations.

289
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:44,820
It is a little bit similar to what we have seen before with the weight.

290
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:53,490
The third solution, it is a solution with stay cables.

291
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:01,120
Here again, this solution can be combined with a system of hangers.

292
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,745
We have then, a similar system to the one used for the Brooklyn

293
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:09,016
bridge, with hangers, and we add stay cables which directly 

294
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:13,907
link the top of the pylon to the places where

295
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:18,880
the diverse hangers are connected. It is

296
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,330
also possible to build this type of structure

297
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:29,056
without having the load-bearing cable and the hangers, but simply

298
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:32,556
the stay cables. We will see again this system a little bit

299
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:36,825
later in this course. The fourth solution which we have seen,

300
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:42,870
it is a solution with multiple cables, two or several

301
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:48,634
cables. So, typically, a cable which is

302
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:54,130
lower in the left part, and a cable

303
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,228
which is lower in the right part.

304
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,580
In practice, this solution is usually

305
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,430
combined with the following solution.

306
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:08,173
So, we have the same two cables, pink

307
00:22:08,173 --> 00:22:13,036
and blue, than before. But as we have seen it in the case of

308
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:20,004
Tower Bridge in London, we add a stiffening system.

309
00:22:20,004 --> 00:22:25,810
Actually, it is a stiffening system of the cable,

310
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:36,681
itself, which enables to the

311
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:43,270
cable to resist when the loads are directly applied to it.

312
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,202
This solution is actually a combination of

313
00:22:47,202 --> 00:22:52,270
the solution two and of the solution four.

314
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,756
Finally, the last solution which we have

315
00:22:55,756 --> 00:23:01,330
seen, it is the solution with pretensioning cables.

316
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,686
We hang a cable which has an opposite curvature

317
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:16,488
to the load-bearing cable, with hangers which link

318
00:23:16,488 --> 00:23:21,447
both cables and which induce internal forces in the load-bearing cable,

319
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:26,188
in such a way that this one, when we will add it a variable load,

320
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,820
will just say : "yes, I have a variable

321
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,980
load, but as I already have large internal forces,

322
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,375
I am not going to deform a lot.

323
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,930
I do not need to deform a lot to be able to carry them."

324
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,120
During this lecture, we have seen

325
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,720
a number of methods to stiffen cables.

326
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,304
We have also seen, in the case of

327
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:46,782
examples, that these methods are often combined, always

328
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:48,791
with the presence of self-weight, because there

329
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:50,457
is no structure which has no weight.

330
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:55,125
Finally, in combination, stiffening systems by

331
00:23:55,125 --> 00:24:00,170
beam, by multiple cables, by stay cables, by

332
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:06,360
pretensioning and by stiffening of the cable itself.
