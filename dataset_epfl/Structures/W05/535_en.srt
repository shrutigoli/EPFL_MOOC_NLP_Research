1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,585
Hello. We have seen in the previous video

2
00:00:07,585 --> 00:00:13,490
that a pretensioning cable is an efficient system to stabilize a cable.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,378
In this video, we are going to see some

4
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,758
additional examples about shapes that the pretensioning

5
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:22,818
cables can take, particularly

6
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:25,062
we will finish with an expansion to the

7
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:28,760
third dimension, which is very interesting, since it

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,618
offers the possibility to cover spaces.

9
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:37,431
In this previous video, we have seen that the combination of a

10
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:42,880
load-bearing cable, we cannot really see well here, and

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,142
of a pretensioning cable, enables

12
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:52,910
to stabilize

13
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,278
a structure, decreasing its deformations,

14
00:00:57,278 --> 00:01:00,502
which happens, for example, during

15
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:05,940
the accumulation of snow or when the wind blows on the roof.

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,289
Here, we have another example which

17
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,700
is a small concrete pedestrian footbridge.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,390
The structure itself, it is a concrete strip,

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,308
we call it a ribbon, which is very,

20
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:22,260
very thin, and then its weight would not be sufficient

21
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,426
to limit the vibrations created by persons crossing it.

22
00:01:27,426 --> 00:01:30,882
It is also very thin, which means that its stiffness is not enough

23
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,493
to consider it as a stiffening

24
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,881
beam, at least not completely.

25
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,653
So, what we have, in addition, on this footbridge,

26
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:43,401
is a stiffening cable, we see

27
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:52,416
it better here, in the elevation. Thus the footbridge itself,

28
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:57,310
the concrete part, in which there are cables, is in tension.

29
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,020
It is the same solution than the solution used

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,536
by Freyssinet for the Youth House in

31
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:06,392
Firminy-Vert, except that in this case here, it has been

32
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:08,820
designed for the people to walk on the cable,

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:14,364
and, as in the solution of the cables beam, the stiffening

34
00:02:14,364 --> 00:02:20,710
is providing by a number of small diagonal cables, but

35
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:25,960
all these cables being in tension, are almost invisible,

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,052
if we look at the photo, it is difficult to distinguish them.

37
00:02:31,052 --> 00:02:34,383
Here, we can see in the lower part that the construction

38
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:38,010
to which the cables are anchored is also monolithic, and is

39
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,342
fixed to the rest of the abutment, but it could be independent.

40
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,120
We can thus have a system of

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,350
independent cables which also stabilizes a cable which needs it.

42
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,880
This configuration, with multiple cables, which

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,389
is characterized by a significant transparency,

44
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:59,653
has been used for greenhouses, that is to say places which need to let

45
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:03,722
enter a maximum of light. They are vertical elements

46
00:03:03,722 --> 00:03:07,340
which are essentially exposed to the wind pressure.

47
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:14,642
The effect of the wind is a pressure

48
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:19,670
which has the kiloNewton per square meter as unit of measure, we are not going to

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,936
make any calculations here, but there are two types of configuration.

50
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:29,850
When the wind blows towards the facade,

51
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,031
we have a pressures which presses where the

52
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:40,113
wind presses on the facade, and in this case,

53
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:45,090
the structure which we have here horizontally

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,245
works in the following way : the cable which is inside, I draw it

55
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:54,580
in red, it is the load-bearing cable, and

56
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:59,961
the cable which is outside, I draw

57
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:05,520
it in orange, it is the pretensioning cable.

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,740
Then, between these two elements,

59
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,770
we have here compression.

60
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,843
If, reversely, the wind blows in the other direction, we

61
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,555
have an effect of suction, then the wind pulls on

62
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,057
the facade, it can be a very important effect, especially

63
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:32,512
for lightwight structures like this type of glass facades.

64
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:37,435
Then, we have an inversion of the internal forces, the load-bearing cable becomes

65
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:43,980
the one which is outside,

66
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,890
and the cable inside

67
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:54,341
works as pretensioning cable. The

68
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:59,990
elements between these two cables

69
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,510
are still in compression.

70
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,136
If we consider the rest of the length of

71
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:15,134
these elements, when the wind presses on the facade, these elements are

72
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:21,459
in compression, these small elements here, as well as these

73
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:27,410
parts here, while if the wind pulls on the facade, the elements are in tension.

74
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,636
We can see that we have a part of the element which is in

75
00:05:29,636 --> 00:05:33,455
compression, and the other part which is in tension, it is absolutely possible.

76
00:05:33,455 --> 00:05:34,229
Note that

77
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:38,701
for these loads to be vertically transfer into the ground, we have on the left and

78
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:42,190
on the right, maybe I am going to draw them in pink to avoid 

79
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:47,311
the confusion, we have on the left and on the right, similar structures which

80
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:52,500
also work with pretensioning cables and load-bearing cables.

81
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,247
This structure is a much more complex

82
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,865
structure in which we really use the third dimension.

83
00:05:58,865 --> 00:05:59,468
It is

84
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:03,681
the Olympic skating rink in Munich, built in 1983.

85
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,080
First, there is an element which we have not seen yet in this course,

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,000
but as we are going to see it very soon,

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,420
it is not a problem to introduce it.

88
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,828
It is an arch, an element which works in

89
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,460
compression, that is why I draw it in blue.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,760
Afterward, we have a series of cables.

91
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,210
The cables which have curvature upwards

92
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:34,120
are load-bearing

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,098
cables. And,

94
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:44,390
to prevent their movement, they are stabilized by cables

95
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,350
which pull downwards, which are thus pretensioning cables.

96
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:08,125
With all this, we have a network of cables which cross each other, but we do not have

97
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,590
yet something which enables us to

98
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,217
be sheltered to attend a match of

99
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:18,375
hockey, and we can see in the picture on the right how it has been solved, we have put an

100
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:22,430
fabric, above this network of cables which

101
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:27,040
has hugged its shape and which offered watertightness 

102
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,087
when it was raining and where it was snowing, the spectators under were

103
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:34,000
not wet, since the water was evacuated onto the edges.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,990
There are also some elements whose we did not have seen the function.

105
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:43,506
All the load-bearing cables and the pretensioning cables, are anchored into

106
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:48,882
the edges, into these cables that I draw here in green, which are

107
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:53,580
edge cables.

108
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,501
They are normal cables which are subjected to forces which comes 

109
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:08,076
from the internal forces in the load-bearing and pretensioning cables, and which 

110
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:13,200
are themselves supported by a system with elements here in tension,

111
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,550
and elements

112
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,320
in compression. We maybe should also add that there 

113
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,196
are also here edge cables, and small hangers

114
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:33,350
which hang up the ends of these cables to the edge of the arch.

115
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,024
With this, we have explained how this part here works.

116
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,948
You can notice that there are lots of cables,

117
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:42,994
and this, it is a problem with this kind

118
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:46,266
of constructions, knowing that in addition, it will be necessary to carry out,

119
00:08:46,266 --> 00:08:48,546
to avoid that it moves, it will be necessary to carry out

120
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:51,358
connections at the intersection of each of the cables.

121
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:55,186
Thus, it becomes a relatively complex construction, and we have

122
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:58,752
quite quickly searched how to simplify it, and this is the way we can

123
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:03,205
simplify it : instead of using a real network of cables, we can directly

124
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:10,690
use the fabric which we envisaged to stretch above as bearing element.

125
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,750
Obviously, it will be necessary to reinforce it. By the way, we can notice that there

126
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,557
are reinforcing bands in the fabric I have taken

127
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:19,179
here as illustration, but let's look at the

128
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,135
various bearing elements of this structure.

129
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:29,020
We have a central pillar, which goes up until here and which hold this ring.

130
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:34,240
We also have inclined lateral pillars,

131
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,668
also one here, an so forth. We have cables which catch hold of

132
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:44,680
these pillars. It looks a lot like the details which we

133
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:53,940
had on the edge of the skating rink of Munich. We also have edge cables.

134
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:06,522
And then, all the rest of the structure

135
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:13,020
is constituted by this membrane,

136
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:21,210
which is made in a fabric which can resist to

137
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,141
tension in several directions, there is tension in the direction where

138
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:28,960
we would normally have load-bearing cables, and then we also have

139
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,708
tension in the direction where we would have pretensioning cables.

140
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,363
Altogether this yields a quite light structure, very

141
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,826
transparent since it has just very few

142
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:40,031
bearing elements, and the construction

143
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:43,685
cost is also radically lower since we did not have

144
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,487
had to make all these cables and all these intersections of cables.

145
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:51,520
We are going to summarize here the various pretensioning systems which we have seen.

146
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,818
The first solution with an external cable and hangers in tension.

147
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:03,715
The second solution that we have seen for the greenhouses

148
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:09,491
of the "Parc Citroën", we have a second cable, which uses the same supports, 

149
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:13,002
and then connecting components which are in compression.

150
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:15,870
The third solution, it is a combination of these

151
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,570
two solutions, that is to say a cable which is sometimes below,

152
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,305
so with hangers in tension, sometimes above, so

153
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:30,050
with elements in compression to transfer the pretension.

154
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,530
Fundamentally, it is a solution between the first one and the second one. 

155
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,800
We can also have a solution in which we call on external supports,

156
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,866
to anchor the cables which are going to stabilize the structure, and finally,

157
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:54,790
we can call on a three-dimensional system, as we have seen it.

(here I make a sketch which looks a little bit like a camping tent,

159
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:04,094
but it can be something more sophisticated as you 

160
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:10,790
have seen it), which enables the stiffening by means of networks of cables

161
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:18,820
or of membranes.

162
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:26,426
In this lecture, we have seen how to stabilize a cable by means of various

163
00:12:26,426 --> 00:12:31,147
pretensioning system, noticing that we could use multiple

164
00:12:31,147 --> 00:12:34,028
cables, and position them in various ways

165
00:12:34,028 --> 00:12:36,116
in relation to the load-bearing cables, it

166
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:37,844
had as consequence that we would have either

167
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,860
hangers, either elements in compression

168
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,210
to introduce the internal forces.

169
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,050
We have also seen that it is possible to make a three-dimensional stabilization

170
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,864
using cables which are not on the same plane, but which are on

171
00:12:51,864 --> 00:12:54,832
perpendicular planes to the load-bearing cables, and

172
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,126
that we can even use a

173
00:12:57,126 --> 00:12:59,840
membrane system, which is a well stabilized

174
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,870
system when it is put in tension.
