00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,510
Hello, in this video, we are going to look at

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,760
the case of the cables subjected to many loads and subjected to distributed loads.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,432
When loads are distributed, we will see that there is another unit of measure to

4
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:21,020
quantify these loads, we will see how to solve

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,920
the problems related to uniform loads,

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,837
we will see the shape that cables take under these kinds

7
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:33,847
of loads, the maximum internal forces, as well as the forces at the supports.

8
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:38,320
Let's start here with a cable subjected to eight loads.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,606
Well, it is a quite large number of loads, but it is something

10
00:00:41,606 --> 00:00:45,520
that we can solve by the methods which we have seen until now.

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,112
Let's first observe that the spacing between these

12
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:54,260
loads is constant according to

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,757
the horizontal axis. I am going to trace an horizontal straight line and

14
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:04,412
I copy the position of these loads, and we can note

15
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:09,732
that this spacing is regular. To my scale,

16
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:15,355
the spacing is roughly 35 millimeters

17
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:20,289
on the sheet, indeed, in reality, the spacing in

18
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:24,898
the model was 150 millimeters for each weight.

19
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:29,220
Let's look at how to solve this problem using the applet.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,164
To change a little bit, I have already

21
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:35,898
introduced in the applet the eight loads, but

22
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,080
I introduced them on top of each other,

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,680
at the position of the resultant. Since all

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,060
these loads are symmetric, it is clear that the resultant

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,852
is equal to eight times Q and acts in the middle of the span.

26
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:52,005
The problem which I am solving here, corresponds actually to the one

27
00:01:52,005 --> 00:01:57,111
that I would have, if I had taken a big free-body which includes all the forces,

28
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:01,980
and which cuts the first and the last segment of cable.

29
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,026
So, I take

30
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:12,340
each of these forces and I place them where they

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:17,220
must be placed, that is to say at the level of

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,220
each of the weights which act on the chain;

33
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,227
and what we can note, it is, in a non surprising way,

34
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,352
that the inclination which has initially been set

35
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:33,090
stays the same, since now, if I

36
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,060
draw once again a free-body, well, I include

37
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,775
all the forces, I have the resultant here, in

38
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:45,385
the middle, which did not change, and I cut the first and the last segment, thus the

39
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:51,490
system did not change, and it is logical that the inclination should still be the same.

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,590
What we can

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,870
also note, if we take a ruler, it is that the

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,334
distance between the line which links the supports here, and the

43
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:07,590
cable, is the same than the distance between the cable and the point

44
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,525
which corresponded to the hanging point of the eight forces before.

45
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,975
This s a very important geometrical

46
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,760
property, the ones among you who are very

47
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,335
good at mathematics may remember that it is

48
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,741
a property which is linked to second order parabolas.

49
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,160
Indeed, cables which are subjected to

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,275
uniform loads tend to take a parabolic shape.

51
00:03:32,275 --> 00:03:37,112
Obviously, we can also solve this problem with the classic

52
00:03:37,112 --> 00:03:42,620
graphical statics on the paper. So, we have here,

53
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,462
the angle which was specified, for the first

54
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:52,580
segment, we have already on the right, the

55
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,646
eight forces in the Cremona diagram, thus we

56
00:03:57,646 --> 00:04:02,842
can simply copy this orientation, in

57
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:07,694
the Cremona diagram. The orientation of

58
00:04:07,694 --> 00:04:14,636
the final part of the cable is also given by the position of the resultant

59
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:17,120
and of the last support, we can also

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,910
copy this inclination in the Cremona diagram.

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,870
So we know,

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,734
a piece of cable on the left end and on the right end, and we can, in

63
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:40,620
the Cremona diagram, determine all the transitional inclinations,

64
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,646
corresponding to

65
00:04:45,646 --> 00:04:50,480
the effect of deviation of each

66
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,050
of the loads which act on our cable.

67
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,208
There is no problem to do this, except

68
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:09,670
that it is, obviously, more tedious that what we did before.

69
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,102
So, we know that this part here will correspond to the

70
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:17,892
first segment of cable, we can copy the inclination of the

71
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:22,884
second segment, in the structural sketch, to obtain

72
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:28,760
the inclination of this second segment, and so forth.

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,744
Getting ready, I realized that I did not succeed to do a job accurate

74
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:40,290
enough on the tablet, that is why I directly prepared the right

75
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:45,259
solution electronically, but for you there should be no problem, on a sheet of paper, it is

76
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,070
not something difficult if we make the effort to be a little accurate.

77
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,020
We thus have here, this segment which corresponds to this first segment of cable,

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,950
the second one, the third one and so forth,

79
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,460
along all the cable.

80
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,010
If for example we make this drawing with

81
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,440
a electronic drawing program, as I

82
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,610
did myself, there is no problem

83
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:20,150
since the precision which we can reach is excellent.

84
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,870
We can observe certain things in

85
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,915
this diagram, first, in this configuration, 

86
00:06:26,915 --> 00:06:32,170
the largest internal force in the cable is observed

87
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:37,137
here, and in a similar way there, it means that is is,

88
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:42,182
each time, the segment which is closest to the support which has the largest internal force.

89
00:06:42,182 --> 00:06:46,943
It is not universally valid, but it is very often the case for the

90
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:48,346
cables which are subjected to

91
00:06:48,346 --> 00:06:52,136
uniform or regular loads, as it is 

92
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,196
the case here.

93
00:06:53,196 --> 00:06:56,740
Conversely, the segment in the middle of the cable,

94
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,150
is the one which has the smallest internal forces.

95
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,658
What does it mean ?

96
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,456
Well, it means that if you had to

97
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,000
build a cable in two segments, well, the

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,730
best would be to connect these two segments in

99
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,660
the middle, rather than do this near the supports.

100
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,150
The Golden Gate bridge is a typical

101
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,150
example of a cable subjected to lots of loads.

102
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,224
Let's first look at how this bridge works :

103
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:24,550
there are two main load-bearing cables,

104
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,722
which bear between both pylons and which

105
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:38,452
extend beyond them. We have a certain number of vertical

106
00:07:38,452 --> 00:07:43,580
cables, which link

107
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,502
the lower part of the bridge to these load-bearing cables, we

108
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:53,990
call these cables hangers,

109
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,498
because they hang up the load.

110
00:07:56,498 --> 00:08:02,568
The load itself, is located on the deck, which is the useful part of the bridge,

111
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:08,480
the one where the vehicles run, in this case, cars.

112
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,492
Then, we can see on the lower part of the hangers, a very big

113
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:19,614
element of structure, with horizontal elements, and diagonal elements,

114
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:24,320
as well as vertical elements by the way.

115
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,425
This structure is called a truss, this is a type of structure which we

116
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:36,470
will see in the second part of the course, which will not be in this MOOC.

117
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,710
The function of the truss is really to take the

118
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,510
loads of the deck, and to bring them into the hangers.

119
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,955
We want to talk

120
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,318
about the x axis, talking about the longitudinal

121
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:51,560
axis of the bridge, the axis that the vehicles follow.

122
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,410
If we look at this photo, it is very clear that there is much

123
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:59,882
more material in the deck and in the trusses than in the cables.

124
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:04,050
Admittedly, the cables are quite significant, they have a diameter of approximately one meter,

125
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,408
essentially in steel, but the deck itself

126
00:09:07,408 --> 00:09:09,880
is much larger and heavier.

127
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,000
What does it mean ? It means that the weight according 

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,760
to x, is approximately the weight of the

129
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,860
deck, there is, that is true, the contribution of the

130
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,180
cable, but essentially, it is a constant.

131
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,984
When a cable is subjected to a constant load, it takes

132
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:40,500
the shape of a second order parabola. This structural sketch represents the

133
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,870
central span of the Golden Gate bridge, we can identify

134
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:51,012
the span, which is the distance between both supports, and we will

135
00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:56,400
name it l, as before.

136
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,730
And this length is typically expressed in meters.

137
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,704
Then, the load which acts, q, we denote it with a lower case, and

138
00:10:10,704 --> 00:10:17,010
it is not expressed in kiloNewtons anymore, but in kiloNewtons per meter.

139
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,230
But if we look at the whole structure, well,

140
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,880
the resultant which acts in the middle, since the loads are

141
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,525
clearly distributed in a symmetric way, this

142
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:33,850
resultant has a magnitude of q times l, which clearly

143
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,200
has kiloNewtons as unit of measure, thus the resultant

144
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,970
stays a value of the same kind than the ones we are used to

145
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:52,830
work with. Let's now take this resultant

146
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,399
q times l, in the Cremona diagram,

147
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,712
we have this property of the parabola of the second order which says that if we double

148
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:08,630
the rise at mid-span, it directly

149
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,816
gives us the orientation of the tangent in the

150
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:19,490
left part, and in the right part of our cable.

151
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:25,980
It corresponds, as I showed you before in the applet,

152
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,913
to take a free-body which would cut very

153
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:38,410
close to the support, which would include all the forces,

154
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,224
and now, we can obtain the internal forces near the supports,

155
00:11:44,224 --> 00:11:50,700
simply by copying these inclinations in the Cremona diagram.

156
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,700
So, we will have the internal force

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,690
on the right and on the left,

158
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,180
which are also, in this case, the maximum internal force.

159
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:34,586
If we take an interest in the forces at the supports,

160
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:37,990
we are going to have a horizontal component,

161
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,592
and a vertical component, one half on the left side, the other

162
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:52,974
half on the right side. So, first

163
00:12:52,974 --> 00:12:58,940
V which is equal to q times l over 2, then V also here, and on

164
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,890
the top, we are also going to have the horizontal internal force H.

165
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,050
What is the value of these elements ? Well, we are going to work with

166
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,862
similar triangles to see that. What we can notice, is that this

167
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:19,615
triangle here, by graphical construction, has sides which are

168
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:26,140
parallel to this triangle here.

169
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,892
Thus, they are similar triangles and then using the properties

170
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:38,640
of the similar triangles, we can say that,

171
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,588
here we have f and f, and here we have l over 2, we

172
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:48,724
can thus say that 2 f divided by l over

173
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:53,786
2 is like what we have

174
00:13:53,786 --> 00:13:58,686
here on the right, q l over 2, divided by H.

175
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:03,250
Well, we know q l over 2, we

176
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,110
know everything, except H,

177
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,936
so H is equal to q l square

178
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:19,490
divided by 8 f.

179
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,320
If we want to know the magnitude of the maximum internal force in the cable, N

180
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,321
max, we can observe that this triangle is a right-angled triangle, then, N

181
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:34,346
max, will be equal to the square root of V

182
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:39,469
squared, we already know V, q l over 2, plus H

183
00:14:39,469 --> 00:14:44,580
squared that we just determined before. In this video,

184
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,835
we have seen how to work with cables

185
00:14:46,835 --> 00:14:50,135
with numerous loads, or with uniform loads.

186
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:54,935
We have seen how, working with the resultant of all the

187
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:59,813
loads and using the geometric properties related to the shape of the cables

188
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:04,102
which take the shape of a second order parabola, we can

189
00:15:04,102 --> 00:15:09,544
obtain the internal forces, as well as the forces at the supports, on a cable,

190
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:13,050
with numerous loads or uniform loads.

191
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,159
We have seen that the units of measure are different, the unit of measure of

192
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:24,650
the distributed loads is the kiloNewton per meter, or an unit of force

193
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:29,160
by unit of length, and we denote them with a lower case,

194
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,534
q, or g if it is a self-weight, rather than with a

195
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,634
capital Q or capital G, as we

196
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:40,760
did it for the concentrated loads until now.
