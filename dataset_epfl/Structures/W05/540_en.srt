00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,512
Hello. In

2
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:10,480
this video, I am going to show you how you can use the applet i-Cremona

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,036
to proceed to simple calculations of a

4
00:00:13,036 --> 00:00:15,950
structure which you are designing.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,350
In the previous video, we have

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,760
seen this covering of a public square, temporary

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,020
covering, which gives a good idea of what I want to design.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,871
For me, it will be a definitive structure, with an

9
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:36,840
accessible height of 4 meters at least,

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,805
a width of 15 meters and a

11
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:49,900
total length of 30 meters.

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,080
This is a square which is significantly

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,260
larger that the one of Bussigny, which I shown you before.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,760
I shall assume, but it is based on reflections,

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,260
which correspond to the reality, that the design load qd,

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,190
is equal to 1.5 kiloNewtons per square

17
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,570
meter of membrane.

18
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,032
This value takes into account the fact that the membrane

19
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:24,757
is inclined and that its weight is larger at

20
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:28,780
some places than at others, but with this value 1.5, I

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,460
include these parameters, at least in the case of a conceptual design.

22
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:41,056
Here is the idea that I have had to cover this place, it is to use

23
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:50,280
a membrane, with a main cable here, that we can see longitudinally,

24
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,593
like that, and a membrane which leans on this

25
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:04,550
cable, and which is anchored on both sides.

26
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:09,606
So, the membrane, that is what we can see here, with obviously edge

27
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:14,762
cables, we are not going to go into détails, but

28
00:02:14,762 --> 00:02:19,952
it is important that you should appreciate that it is, here, the

29
00:02:19,952 --> 00:02:24,914
transversal cross-section, and here it is the

30
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:30,130
longitudinal cross-section.

31
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:35,774
You can see in dashed lines the dimensions

32
00:02:35,774 --> 00:02:40,642
of the surface to cover, which corresponds to what I have

33
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:45,237
told you, then 15 by 4 meters height. The first thing that we

34
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:50,290
have to do is to upload the picture on the i-Structures server.

35
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,830
This functionality is available if we start the applet i-Cremona,

36
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,340
from the usual menu bar of the structures course.

37
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,800
It is not available if we start i-Cremona from an exercise.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,582
We are going to click here, on the bottom, on the button "Add/manage a

39
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:14,024
picture", and we are going to select the picture

40
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:17,750
that I have scanned, you can proceed taking a photo

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,170
of a drawing, or taking a photo of a structure, if

42
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,660
you wish to understand how a given structure works.

43
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,140
I upload the file with the transversal cross-section to the server.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:30,610
There we go, it is already done, and I open

45
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,386
the applet, with the background picture that I have defined.

46
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:35,986
The right part of the applet,

47
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:41,199
I will not need it this time, therefore I close it, and I use

48
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,310
the zoom functions to center, and enlarge the picture in such

49
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,040
a way that I can comfortably work.

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,179
Here, I am going to have a support, here, I am going to have a

51
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:58,640
second support, between these two supports, a distance of 15 meters.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,423
I want to make the calculation for

53
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:05,570
a band of membrane which is perpendicular to the screen, of 1

54
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,645
meter width, thus the load which acts on this

55
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:14,450
band of membrane, is equal to 15 times 1.5 kiloNewtons,

56
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,880
per square meter, times 1 meter of width, that is to say 22.5 kiloNewtons.

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,532
I could introduce 15 loads of 1.5 kiloNewton,

58
00:04:22,532 --> 00:04:29,540
but I prefer to introduce 10 loads of 2.25 kiloNewtons.

59
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:37,938
1, 2, 3

60
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:44,808
4, 5 loads on the left, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 loads on the right.

61
00:04:44,808 --> 00:04:50,660
I activate the funicular polygon and I adjust the initial tangent on the left.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,795
There we go, the structure that I obtain is not correct since

63
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,645
it is blue, it means that it is in compression.

64
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:58,070
What happens ?

65
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,482
Well, I forgot something, it is that in the middle of this

66
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:07,910
membrane, acts the load-bearing cable which pulls all the structure upwards.

67
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,528
So, I am going to introduce a force upwards,

68
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:14,280
quite large, I am going to put 10 kiloNewtons.

69
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,284
There we go, like that.

70
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:21,844
And this force does not pull enough

71
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:22,810
upwards.

72
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,170
To be able to work well, I need to

73
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,530
zoom in, to put to scale, the forces.

74
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,083
Then I push this button, scaling

75
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,011
of the forces, and I press on shift to get

76
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,130
the opposite effect and then I am going to get a

77
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,150
zoom-out on the forces, like that it is okay.

78
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,261
I unlock the scaling button, but I keep the shift

79
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:46,830
button which enables me to increase this force, without changing its orientation.

80
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,846
There I go, it goes down more and more, and 

81
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,665
suddenly, at once, the structure reappears in red,

82
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:56,064
in the upper part, until it can come

83
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,800
here, to be precisely superimposed on the structure that I had sketched. 

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,230
The required force is roughly 32 kiloNewtons.

85
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,857
We are going to remember of this value,

86
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:11,920
and we are now going to look at

87
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,180
the longitudinal cross-section. We come back to the list of our

88
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,220
pictures, we are going to search the picture of the longitudinal cross-section.

89
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:29,947
We upload it on the server, and we open it in the applet.

90
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,761
Once again, we do not need the right part.

91
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:37,000
So, we are going to use the zoom-in function to get

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
a little bit of space.

93
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,803
We are going to have a support on the left, here,

94
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:52,357
another support on the right, and then, on a distance of roughly 30 meters,

95
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:56,365
we will have 32 kiloNewtons per meter, which is the load

96
00:06:56,365 --> 00:07:01,709
which comes from each meter of membrane in the transversal direction.

97
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,750
32 times 30, it is equal to 960 kiloNewtons, I am going to introduce

98
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,890
10 loads of 96 kiloNewtons, along this cable.

99
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,498
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

100
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:27,292
7, 8, 9 and 10 loads. I activate the funicular

101
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:33,313
polygon and I give to the cable the same shape that I had envisioned.

102
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:36,840
We can see that there are little imprecision, I replace the support more

103
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,457
correctly, and I adjust one more time the geometry, and then

104
00:07:41,457 --> 00:07:44,530
I reach a geometry which is quite close to the one

105
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,200
I had sketched, it was a free-hand drawing,

106
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:53,837
with an internal force of roughly 2350 on the left, 2390,

107
00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:59,230
let's say 2400 kiloNewtons, which acts in this structure.

108
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,230
It is a quite significant internal force, if you make a dimensioning

109
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,637
calculation to get the required diameter of the cable, consider 300

110
00:08:06,637 --> 00:08:10,389
Newtons per square millimeters as strength, and you will see

111
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:13,656
that the required diameter of the cable is quite large.

112
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,640
I think that in this case, it will

113
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,248
probably be necessary to use more than one cable, as we

114
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,045
have incidentally seen it in other configurations of membranes,

115
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:27,250
because, probably, the internal forces will be too concentrated.

116
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,666
On the basis of what we have now, we use a

117
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:35,883
free-body, we know the internal force here, we can obtain

118
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:39,362
the internal force that I am only going to draw with a line,

119
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:44,626
the tensile internal force in this cable, the compressive internal force in this

120
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:49,970
compressed element, likewise, here on the left.

121
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,671
And thus we can quickly obtain all

122
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,730
the dimensions, diameters of the posts, diameters of the cables,

123
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,866
to have an idea of the amount of materials, and

124
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:04,596
it will enable us to quickly qualify, or to disqualify a structure.

125
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:09,652
In this video, we have seen how you can introduce yourself

126
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:14,246
a picture to be used as a basis for the calculations in i-Cremona.

127
00:09:14,246 --> 00:09:18,298
You have also seen how to quickly get an

128
00:09:18,298 --> 00:09:21,566
idea of the internal forces which act on a structure,

129
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:23,640
to be able to dimension it.
