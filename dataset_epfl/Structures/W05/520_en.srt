00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,996
Hello. In this video, we will look at which

2
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:11,220
shape takes a cable according to the type of load to which it is subjected.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,650
What we have seen until now, it the case of loads

4
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,680
which are distributed along the axis of

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,976
the structure, often horizontally.

6
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:24,910
But it is not a necessity, as it was the example of the case of the Golden Gate bridge.

7
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,056
There is also the possibility that

8
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:30,682
the load is uniformly distributed along the length of the

9
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:33,741
cable, and we will see that it leads to a

10
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,750
slightly different shape which has a particular name.

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,345
In this video, you can see a

12
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:44,255
cable subjected to 13 loads uniformly distributed,

13
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:50,537
and equal, with an equal spacing, which thus take the shape of a parabola.

14
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:53,804
Then, we superimpose on this white cable, a

15
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,800
red cable which is simply subjected to its self-weight.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,620
In the case of the self-weight, the self-weight acts

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,030
regularly, not along the horizontal axis, but along the axis of the cable.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,682
The cable weighs, for example, one kilogram per

19
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:10,710
meter, but per meter of length of the cable.

20
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,606
If we take a close look on these two cables, we can indeed notice that the

21
00:01:15,606 --> 00:01:21,035
red cable is lower than the white cable, than

22
00:01:21,035 --> 00:01:25,090
the cable which has loads uniformly distributed along the horizontal axis.

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,730
In the middle, they are approximately at the same level.

24
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,228
This, it is OK.

25
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:36,940
But here, on the left and on the right, it is always the red cable which is lower.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:37,600
Why ?

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,768
Well, because if we look at a small segment of cable,

28
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:45,860
I am going to draw it in red, which as a certain small weight which

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,890
acts along its length, let's say one Newton per meter.

30
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,908
Well, when this segment of cable is inclined, to cross

31
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:02,690
the same horizontal distance, I would need a longer segment of cable.

32
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,940
Thus, this cable here will be heavier

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,072
for an equal horizontal distance, for

34
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:12,640
example, the distance between two red weights.

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,827
We can see this in this figure.

36
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:20,420
On the left, we have a cable which is subjected to a uniform load,

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,530
q, one kiloNewton per meter

38
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:37,056
along the axis

39
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,950
x. On the right, we have a load

40
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:48,250
distributed

41
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,704
along the length of the

42
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:59,424
cable. If we represent it

43
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:04,247
along x, we obtain, here, in the

44
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:09,550
middle, the same load than on the left, q, one kiloNewton per meter.

45
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,158
But as the inclination increases, we get a

46
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:21,130
load which is larger than q, one kiloNewton per meter.

47
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,719
And since this load is larger

48
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,986
at the ends, well, it is logical that this cable should go down

49
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:35,100
more vertically. On the left, we have

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,009
a second order parabola which

51
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:45,760
is well-known.

52
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,311
On the right, we have a curve which we call the catenary.

53
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:49,780
Not very

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,750
surprising, since it is really the shape that

55
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,190
a chain (catena in latin) takes under its self-weight.

56
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,102
And it is a curve that some of you may have

57
00:03:58,102 --> 00:04:01,670
studied, which has a mathematical definition a little bit more complicated.

58
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,623
Well, I do not want to go into further detail for this course.

59
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:07,504
What is important is to be able to distinguish

60
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,916
that according to the nature of the loads, from where they

61
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,502
come, the shape of the structure,

62
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,862
the proper shape that the structure should take,

63
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:16,420
will be slightly different.

64
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,257
If we compare these two shapes, we can notice that,

65
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,733
for what I did on the blackboard,

66
00:04:23,733 --> 00:04:27,536
we have maximized, here, this distance between the black cable,

67
00:04:27,536 --> 00:04:31,480
so the second order parabola and the red cable, so the catenary.

68
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,882
In reality, our structures will usually be much flatter, and

69
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:38,090
the difference between a parabola and a catenary is quite small.

70
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,058
So, I would like that you

71
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:43,671
clearly keep in mind that these two shapes are not the same,

72
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:45,894
and that they exist and

73
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:48,245
you must be able to identify them.

74
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:50,693
However, at the same time, if you are looking for

75
00:04:50,693 --> 00:04:53,573
the proper shape to give to a structure, it is not very important.

76
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,503
If you you draw second order parabolas, and that afterwards

77
00:04:56,503 --> 00:05:00,170
we have to build catenaries, the geometric difference will be quite small.

78
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,530
To conclude, two examples of structures.

79
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,432
First, the exhibition hall of Portugal,

80
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,990
for the Universal Exhibition of 1998 in Portugal.

81
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,756
We have here, an extremely thin structure, with an

82
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:20,368
approximately 130 millimeters thick blade of concrete,

83
00:05:20,368 --> 00:05:26,150
thus, something which is extremely slender, taut between two supports.

84
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:30,500
What we can immediately notice, is that the supports themselves are significant.

85
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,136
Well, it is not very surprising, since we know that if

86
00:05:34,136 --> 00:05:38,572
we have an extremely taut cable, like this, what does it mean ?

87
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:43,104
It means that there will be large forces at the supports, particularly large

88
00:05:43,104 --> 00:05:48,366
horizontal components of the forces at the supports, and these horizontal

89
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:53,595
components must be carried by structures.

90
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:55,609
That is why these vertical structures

91
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:58,365
have numerous walls, a lot of intermediate walls.

92
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,167
But it is a very beautiful structure which

93
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,147
covers a public space in a very enjoyable way.

94
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:07,438
The second example it is this airport hall

95
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:11,208
in the United States, with also the requires to have a

96
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,746
large surface with the least amount of supports possible, which

97
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:17,238
is made possible by a cable-type structure.

98
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:20,830
Indeed, we have a structure with a quite

99
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,675
low thickness.

100
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:26,095
We do not see it well here, because there is an edge beam which has been introduced,

101
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:29,556
but we have a structure with a quite low thickness which is

102
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,890
taut between the supports that we have on the left and on the right.

103
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,194
Note that the supports, the more or less

104
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:39,620
vertical columns, are themselves quite significant to be able to carry,

105
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,782
the horizontal component of the internal force which is

106
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:45,944
very significant, since it is a structure which is

107
00:06:45,944 --> 00:06:47,130
also quite flat.

108
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,430
These two structures take the shape, essentially, of catenaries.

109
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,430
In this video, we have seen that the loads can be either

110
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,764
distributed along the axis of the structure, either distributed along the length of the cable.

111
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:04,846
It induces differences in the loads which act on

112
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:08,344
the cable, and in the shape which it takes.

113
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:11,422
If the load is uniformly distributed along the axis

114
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:16,042
of the main structure, then the cable takes the shape of

115
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:20,866
a of second order parabola, as we have seen in the previous video.

116
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:24,810
If on the contrary, the loads are, in a predominant way, distributed along the

117
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:30,080
length of the cable, then the cable takes the shape of a catenary.

118
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,212
These two shapes are however quite similar and it is not

119
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:36,740
very important, in any case at this stage of the design, to distinguish

120
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,000
which one is which one.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,110
However, within the framework of this course, you will be

122
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,636
asked questions about the type of shape that a cable takes.

123
00:07:45,636 --> 00:07:50,610
Thus, it is important to be able to make the distinction at the theoretical level.
