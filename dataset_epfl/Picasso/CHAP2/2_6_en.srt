1
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's now explain what happens
for the central finite difference formula

2
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:13,319
Unlike the forward and backward
finite difference formula,

3
00:00:13,428 --> 00:00:17,825
the error between f'(x0) and the
central finite difference formula

4
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:21,962
isn't of order 1 
but order 2 in h.

5
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:25,499
Let's precise this.

6
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:31,194
Let f a function from ℝ to ℝ,

7
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,247
now three times 
continuously differentiable,

8
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:41,529
let x0 in ℝ and let h 
be a positive number.

9
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:45,690
Now the Taylor exapansion is 
the following.

10
00:00:46,849 --> 00:00:50,737
Take f(x0+h/2)

11
00:00:51,462 --> 00:00:58,440
it is f(x0) plus the increment, 
h/2 times f'(x0)

12
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:06,033
plus the square of the increment, 
h²/4 divided by factorial 2, so 2

13
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:11,706
times f''(x0) plus our last term
in the Taylor exapansion,

14
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:19,135
the cube of the increment, 
h³/8, divided by factorial 3

15
00:01:19,135 --> 00:01:24,731
so 2*3=6, times the third 
derivative at some point ξ,

16
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:31,776
ξ being a point between 
x0 and x0+h/2.

17
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:38,428
We do the same for f(x0-h/2):

18
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:58,544
f(x0)-(h/2)*f'(x0)+*(h²/(4*2))*f''(x0)-...

19
00:01:58,544 --> 00:02:04,439
... (h³/(8*6))*f'''(η) for some
point η,

20
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:09,668
η between x0-h/2 and x0.

21
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,767
Take the difference between 
those two lines

22
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,196
since that's what we 
have in the formula,

23
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:27,576
so the difference, f(x0+h/2)-f(x0-h/2)

24
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:39,384
then the summands in f(x0) cancel
each other, and we're left with

25
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:42,804
h*f'(x0).

26
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:48,212
The summands in h² cancel each other
again, that's why we get a higher order

27
00:02:48,872 --> 00:03:05,313
and we're left with 
+h³/(8x6) (f'''(ξ)+f'''(η)).

28
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:10,727
Now I claim that the 
following theorem is true,

29
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,608
it is the Theorem 2.3 
in the book.

30
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,469
For all function f 3 times 
continuously differentiable,

31
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,171
since we went 
until the 3rd derivatives,

32
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:32,482
for all x0 in ℝ there is a positive C
such that for all positive h

33
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:44,378
less than or equal to 1, 
we have the error between

34
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:49,242
f'(x0) and its approximation by a 
central finite difference formula

35
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:55,258
f(x0+h/2) - f(x0-h/2) over h,

36
00:03:55,767 --> 00:04:00,557
this error is now less than 
or equal to C*h².

37
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:12,723
Same remark as before, 
C can depend on f and x0

38
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:17,418
because in our sentence C comes
after "for all f", "for all x0"

39
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,971
but C cannot depend on 
h because it appears 

40
00:04:21,372 --> 00:04:25,540
before "for all positive h less than 
or equal to 1".

41
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:29,265
So C can depend on f
and x0 but not h.

42
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:37,085
So the numerical interpretation is 
as follows : take f and x0

43
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:42,213
and take a look at the error
when h varies

44
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,144
the error, this quantity here, 
can be computed,

45
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,860
so if we know f'(x0), we compute 
this quantity here and make the difference.

46
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:59,944
This error is divided by 2²=4

47
00:05:00,496 --> 00:05:02,601
every time h is divided by 2

48
00:05:03,305 --> 00:05:10,083
or, if we divide h by 10

49
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:12,919
the error is divided by 10²=100.

50
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,017
We need to 
prove this thoerem.

51
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,780
Proof:

52
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:21,184
Be careful, as before
we cannot choose 

53
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:26,345
C as follows

54
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:33,337
1/(8*6) times the absolute value
of those derivatives here,

55
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:42,092
that is C equal to 1/48 times

56
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:49,248
the absolute value of f'''(ξ)+f'''(η)

57
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,531
because this would depend on h,

58
00:05:52,112 --> 00:06:00,168
since ξ,η do depend on h,
indeed ξ is between x0 and x0+h/2

59
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:04,275
and η between x0-h/2 and x0.

60
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,659
But as before, we can take

61
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:12,380
an upper bound with the maximum
of the derivatives on the bigger interval.

62
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:19,394
Here are x0, x0-h/2, x0+h/2.

63
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:23,883
I use again the fact that 
h≤1, it is an arbitrary choice,

64
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,717
we could have taken 
h ≤ 2,

65
00:06:28,428 --> 00:06:34,571
Thus x0-h/2 > x0-1/2

66
00:06:34,989 --> 00:06:39,447
and x0+h/2 < x0+1/2.

67
00:06:39,538 --> 00:06:43,855
Now take the maximum of the 
third derivatives on this interval 

68
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:50,499
and we can finally show the theorem
 and choose C with an upper bound

69
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:57,451
as the maximum of the 
third derivatives on this interval

70
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,032
and so we have 1/24

71
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:07,027
because we have 1/48 but 
we're adding 2 terms

72
00:07:07,045 --> 00:07:14,628
so we have C=1/24 times the absolute
value of the maximum of the 3rd derivative

73
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:23,203
in the interval x0-1/2 and x0+1/2.

74
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,059
Observe that C does depend
on the 3rd derivatives of f

75
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:34,339
and depends on x0
but not on h,

76
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:36,875
so we proved the theorem.
