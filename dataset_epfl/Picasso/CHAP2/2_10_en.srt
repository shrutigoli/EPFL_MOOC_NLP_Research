The four finite difference formula
to be known

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,127
in this chapter are the following.

3
00:00:10,137 --> 00:00:12,677
First, the derivative

4
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:16,868
f'(x0) can be approached by
the progressive finite difference formula

5
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:21,653
f(x0+h)-f(x0) divided by h.

6
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:24,604
This formula is order one in h

7
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,561
provided f is twice 
continuously differentiable.

8
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:33,828
Same thing for the backward
finite difference formula

9
00:00:33,828 --> 00:00:39,322
f(xo)-f(x0-h) divided by h,

10
00:00:40,992 --> 00:00:42,572
which is also of order one in h,

11
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:46,215
provided f is twice 
continuously differentiable.

12
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,170
Concerning the centered
finite difference formula

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,060
f(xo+h/2)-f(x0-h/2)

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,500
divided by h,

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,661
it is of order 2 in h,

16
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:08,858
provided f is three
times continuously differentiable.

17
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:14,043
Finally, concerning the second
derivative f''(x0),

18
00:01:14,043 --> 00:01:18,462
a division by h^2 occurs,

19
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:24,515
take 2 f(x0)
minus f(x0-h)

20
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:27,834
plus f(x0+h),
divide by h^2,

21
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:31,163
the error is again of order h^2, provided f is
4 times continuously differentiable.

22
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:36,277
Again progressive finite difference formula,

23
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,957
backward finite difference formula,

24
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:45,188
centered finite difference formula,

25
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,776
again, centered finite difference formula.
