The four finite difference formula to be known in this chapter are the following.
First, the derivative f'(x0) can be approached by the progressive finite difference formula f(x0+h)-f(x0) divided by h.
This formula is order one in h provided f is twice continuously differentiable.
Same thing for the backward finite difference formula f(xo)-f(x0-h) divided by h, which is also of order one in h, provided f is twice continuously differentiable.
Concerning the centered finite difference formula f(xo+h/2)-f(x0-h/2) divided by h, it is of order 2 in h, provided f is three times continuously differentiable.
Finally, concerning the second derivative f''(x0), a division by h^2 occurs, take 2 f(x0) minus f(x0-h) plus f(x0+h), divide by h^2, the error is again of order h^2, provided f is
4 times continuously differentiable.
Again progressive finite difference formula, backward finite difference formula, centered finite difference formula, again, centered finite difference formula.
