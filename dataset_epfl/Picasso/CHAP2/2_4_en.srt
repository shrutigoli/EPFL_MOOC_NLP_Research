1
00:00:03,749 --> 00:00:08,279
We've shown that the error
between f'(x0)

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:12,799
and the forward finite difference formula
is of order 1 in h,

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,959
This is the theorem
that we just shown.

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:21,859
We'll now check numerically 
this prediction.

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:26,979
Let's choose a function f,

6
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:28,089
for example the sinus function.

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:32,529
Also take x0 = 1 and 
let's write a program

8
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:39,289
that computes (f(x0-h)-f(x0))/h

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,799
and calculates the error, that is
the difference with f'(x0)

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:48,519
We used that program for
to get the error for

11
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,949
some values of h.

12
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:55,519
So for h= 10^(-1) the error is
4.3*10^(-2).

13
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,219
If I divide h by 10, 
the error is divided by 10.

14
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,519
If I divide again h by 10, 
the error is divided by 10 again,

15
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:05,419
and so on until 10^(-7).

16
00:01:05,419 --> 00:01:09,059
With h=10^(-7) the error is 4.3*10^(-8),

17
00:01:09,059 --> 00:01:11,359
so it has been divided by 
10 at each step.

18
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,679
But if I take h=10^(-9)

19
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:19,099
I observe that the error increases, 
goes from 4.3 to 5.3 times 10^(-8).

20
00:01:19,099 --> 00:01:23,689
And for h=10^(-11) 
the error increases again.

21
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,799
What we observe here is the 
effect of the truncation error,

22
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,949
the truncation in the Taylor 
expansion.

23
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:35,049
And what we observe
is the effect of rounding errors.

24
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:39,189
We'll explain later where
those rounding errors come from.

25
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:41,529
The thing to remember
for now

26
00:01:41,529 --> 00:01:45,469
is that for h less than 
or equal to 10^(-7)

27
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:50,559
the rounding error 
effect appears.

28
00:01:55,971 --> 00:02:00,241
Let's now go back to 
a finite difference formula

29
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:04,211
but not the forward one, 
but the backward one.
