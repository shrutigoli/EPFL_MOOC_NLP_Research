1
00:00:04,207 --> 00:00:06,937
Let us now consider
second order derivatives.

2
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:12,017
Let f be a real valued function,
twice

3
00:00:12,017 --> 00:00:16,657
continuously differentiable,
let x0 be a real value,

4
00:00:16,657 --> 00:00:21,687
We now want to approach
f''(x0).

5
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:27,907
If I apply one of the definitions 
of the derivative of f'(x0)

6
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:34,067
I get the limit when h goes to zero
of f'(x0+h/2)

7
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:39,897
minus f'(x0-h/2)
divided by h.

8
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,407
I just applied the previous formula
for f'(x0) to f''(x0).

9
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:45,007
je l'applique à f seconde.

10
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:51,657
Now, I approach f'(x0+h/2)

11
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:54,287
by the centered finite 
difference formula,

12
00:00:54,287 --> 00:01:01,337
that is to say, f(x0+h/2+h/2)

13
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:08,247
minus f(x0+h/2-h/2),

14
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:11,328
and I divide by h.

15
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:18,468
I do the same
for f'(x-h/2),

16
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:23,838
that is to say, I approach it by
f(x0-h/2+h/2)

17
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:29,728
minus f(x0-/h2-h/2)

18
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,338
and I divide by h.

19
00:01:33,566 --> 00:01:39,926
Thus f''(x0) will be approached by,

20
00:01:39,926 --> 00:01:45,176
I must take the difference of these
two terms,

21
00:01:45,176 --> 00:01:48,972
and I obtain

22
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:52,768
f(x0+h)

23
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:56,566
Plus h sur deux,
c'est-à-dire f de x0 plus h.

24
00:01:56,566 --> 00:02:06,936
minus 2 f(x0)

25
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:12,946
plus f(x0-h)

26
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:20,135
and I must divide by h^2.

27
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:27,095
We are now going to prove
that this approximation

28
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:33,385
of f''(x0)

29
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:36,255
this centered finite difference approximation,

30
00:02:36,255 --> 00:02:40,735
centered since I used a centered finite
difference approximation of f'(x0),

31
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:47,675
 

32
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:51,005
 

33
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:55,155
this approximation is of order h^2,

34
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:58,955
which is not surprising since I used
centered finite difference formula.

35
00:02:58,955 --> 00:03:01,165
More precisely,

36
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:05,765
We are going to prove theorem 2.5 
of the book which says:


37
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:10,085
For all f four times 
continuously differentiable,

38
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:15,225
For all x0 in R,

39
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:20,415
there exists a positive C,
which will therefore depend of f and x0,

40
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,225
such that for all 0<h<1,
C will not depend on h,

41
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:30,645
the error between f''(x0)

42
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:34,645
and its approximation with the
above centered finite difference formula,

43
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:41,155
again 2f(x0)-f(x0+h)-f(x0-h)
divided by h^2,

44
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:47,125
this error is less or equal
C h^2.

45
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,505
à h carré.

46
00:03:49,372 --> 00:04:00,532
As before, C depends
on f and x0,

47
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,332
but not on h.

48
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:16,239
As before, the corresponding experiment
is to choose f and x0,

49
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,529
to report the error, the difference
between f''(x0) and this finite difference formula,

50
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:30,249
and to observe that this error
is divided by four

51
00:04:30,249 --> 00:04:32,829
whenever h is divided by 2.

52
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:38,231
One more remark about
rounding errors.

53
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:41,641
With this formula,
rounding errors

54
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,890
will behave like one over h^2,
and no more like one over h,

55
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,390
simply because I am evaluating
second derivatives

56
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,570
and there is a division by h^2
in the formula.

57
00:04:58,046 --> 00:05:05,006
Finally, the proof of the theorem
is left as an exercice,

58
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,966
but you should be able 
to do the proof by yourself.

59
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:10,516
It suffices to take the Taylor expansion

60
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:20,766
f(x0+h)=f(x0)+hf'(x0)+h^2/2f''(x0)

61
00:05:20,766 --> 00:05:29,496
+h^/6f'''(x0)

62
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:38,476
+h^4/24f''''(xi)

63
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:46,756
xi between x0 and x0+h.

64
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:53,138
Do the same with f(x0-h)

65
00:05:54,617 --> 00:06:01,777
take the sum of these two equations
and prove the result.
