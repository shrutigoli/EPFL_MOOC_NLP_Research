Let's start with first-order numerical differentiation.
Given a function f from â„� to â„� that is  C1, that is that the function is continuous and its derivative f' is continuous, given x0 in â„�, we want to approximate numerically f'(x0).
The definition of f'(x0) is as follows : take f(x0+h)-f(x0), with h positive and divide by h when h goes to 0 then this quotient converges to the derivative f'(x0).
The corresponding drawing is on the right handside.
There is the x axis, the graph of f and a point x0. 
And here x0+h and f(x_0), here is the quotient.
The slope of this line is the quotient
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h . f'(x0) is the slope of the tangent so observe that when h goes to 0 the slope of this line converges to the slope of this tangent.
Another possible definition is to take the quotient f(x0)-f(x0-h) divided by h and let h go to 0. so now we take a value on the left, f(x0-h) to get another approximation
 of the derivative.
Finally, we can take the following formula : 
Still letting h go to 0, take f(x0+h/2) here on the graph. and take its value in x0-h/2 as well so f(x0+h/2)-f(x0-h/2) divided by h and let h go to 0.
Now consider a fixed h, positive. we compute our formulas with a computer so we want this fixed positive h to be small.
We'll approach f'(x0) by the quotient
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h and I look at the error.
The error is the absolute value of the difference f'(x0)-(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h.
We'll show that this error is of order 1 in h.
So we'll give a precise definition of this big O of h, O(h).
This is a finite difference formula.
It is a forward difference.
Why do we call it forward ? 
Well, because we want to evaluate the derivative at x0 and I use the value at x0+h so I take a value forward.
It is of order 1 so its precision is of the order 1 in h.
Likewise, I can approach the derivative f'(x0) with h fixed with a backward difference
 formula
(f(x0)-f(x0-h))/h.
Taking the absolute value, we get the error. as previously this error is of order 1 in 0.
So this time this is a backward finite difference formula.
Why backward ?
Because to approach the derivative at x0
I use the value in x0-h so we go backward.
Finally, we'll now use the centered difference formula.
So f(x0+h/2)-f(x0-h/2) divided by h.
Note that I divided by h because the distance between x0+h/2 and x0-h/2 is indeed h.
So here is the error now, and this error is not of order h anymore, but of order h^2.
This is a centered finite difference formula.
Why centered?
Because I want to approach the derivative at x0 and I use the values on the left and the right, x0-h/2 and x0+h/2 and this centered formula is of order 2 in h. so it is a big O of h squared, O(h^2).
In the following, we'll prove and give a clear definition of those O(h) and O(h^2).
