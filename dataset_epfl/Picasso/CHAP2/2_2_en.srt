1
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:06,616
Let's start with first-order
numerical differentiation.

2
00:00:06,616 --> 00:00:12,096
Given a function f from ℝ to ℝ
that is  C1,

3
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,536
that is that the function is continuous
and its derivative f' is continuous,

4
00:00:15,536 --> 00:00:19,376
given x0 in ℝ,
we want to approximate

5
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:21,956
numerically f'(x0).

6
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:24,117
The definition of f'(x0) is as 
follows :

7
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:29,587
take f(x0+h)-f(x0), with h positive

8
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:32,727
and divide by h

9
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:37,697
when h goes to 0 then this quotient
converges to the derivative f'(x0).

10
00:00:37,697 --> 00:00:40,077
The corresponding drawing is on 
the right handside.

11
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:46,997
There is the x axis, the graph of f
and a point x0. 

12
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,251
And here x0+h

13
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:55,271
and f(x_0),
here is the quotient.

14
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:58,641
The slope of this line
is the quotient

15
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,831
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h .

16
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:04,831
f'(x0) is the slope 
of the tangent

17
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:09,401
so observe that 
when h goes to 0

18
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:12,731
the slope of this line
converges to 

19
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:15,201
the slope of this tangent.

20
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:19,246
Another possible definition
is to take the quotient

21
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:24,356
f(x0)-f(x0-h) divided by h

22
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:30,236
and let h go to 0.

23
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:37,253
so now we take a value on 
the left, f(x0-h)

24
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:44,023
to get another approximation
 of the derivative.

25
00:01:44,842 --> 00:01:48,712
Finally, we can take 
the following formula : 

26
00:01:48,712 --> 00:01:50,702
Still letting h go to 0, 

27
00:01:50,702 --> 00:01:54,492
take f(x0+h/2)

28
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:57,504
here on the graph.

29
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:03,582
and take its value in x0-h/2
as well

30
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:07,961
so f(x0+h/2)-f(x0-h/2) divided

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,961
by h and let 
h go to 0.

32
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:15,841
Now consider a fixed h, 
positive.

33
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:21,841
we compute our formulas with a computer 
so we want this fixed positive h to be small.

34
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:28,691
We'll approach f'(x0) by the
quotient

35
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:35,741
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h

36
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:41,601
and I look at the error.

37
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:46,701
The error is the absolute value
of the difference 

38
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,801
f'(x0)-(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h.

39
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:54,051
We'll show that this error
is of order 1 in h.

40
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:57,721
So we'll give a precise definition
of this big O of h, O(h).

41
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:00,731
This is a finite difference formula.

42
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:02,973
It is a forward difference.

43
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,740
Why do we call it forward ? 

44
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,290
Well, because we want to evaluate
the derivative at x0

45
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,290
and I use the value at x0+h

46
00:03:15,953 --> 00:03:18,403
so I take a value forward.

47
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:21,667
It is of order 1

48
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:25,325
so its precision is of the order 1 
in h.

49
00:03:26,064 --> 00:03:31,824
Likewise, I can approach the derivative 
f'(x0) with h fixed

50
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:35,824
with a backward difference
 formula

51
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:41,314
(f(x0)-f(x0-h))/h.

52
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:43,365
Taking the absolute value, 
we get the error.

53
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,009
as previously this error
is of order 1 in 0.

54
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:50,506
So this time this is a

55
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:55,176
backward finite difference formula.
Why backward ?

56
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:59,156
Because to approach the 
derivative at x0

57
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:02,496
I use the value in x0-h

58
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:06,469
so we go backward.

59
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:12,927
Finally, we'll now use the

60
00:04:12,927 --> 00:04:14,397
centered difference formula.

61
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:20,747
So f(x0+h/2)-f(x0-h/2) 
divided by h.

62
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:25,237
Note that I divided by h
because the distance between 

63
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:29,777
x0+h/2 and x0-h/2 
is indeed h.

64
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,336
So here is the error now,

65
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:38,016
and this error is not of order h 
anymore, but of order h^2.

66
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:41,766
This is a centered
finite difference formula.

67
00:04:42,513 --> 00:04:43,473
Why centered?

68
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:50,083
Because I want to approach the 
derivative at x0 and I use the values

69
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,693
on the left and the right, 
x0-h/2 and x0+h/2

70
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:59,213
and this centered formula
is of order 2 in h.

71
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,003
so it is a big O of h squared, O(h^2).

72
00:05:01,003 --> 00:05:06,303
In the following, we'll prove
and give a clear definition

73
00:05:06,303 --> 00:05:09,213
of those O(h) and O(h^2).
