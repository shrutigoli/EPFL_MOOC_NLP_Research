1
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:07,517
We'll now explain the 
following result

2
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:12,135
about the error between f'(x0)
and its approximation

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:15,329
by a backward finite 
difference formula

4
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:22,027
so (f(x0) - f(x0-h))/h

5
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:26,440
We now state the
following theorem, 

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,414
Theorem 2.1 in the case of
the bacward finite difference formula.

7
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:38,717
For all function f
and for all x0 in ℝ

8
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:47,358
there is a positive c such that
 for all h between 0 and 1

9
00:00:47,358 --> 00:00:52,846
the error f'(x0) minus

10
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:58,125
its approximation by a backward 
finite difference formula

11
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:03,441
is as before less than or equal 
to c*h

12
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,724
As before

13
00:01:06,724 --> 00:01:11,062
because of the order
of quantifiers, 

14
00:01:11,062 --> 00:01:18,931
c can only depend on f
and x0 but not h.

15
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:23,511
As before we interpret
the result as follows :

16
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:28,064
choose a function f, 
and some x0

17
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:32,443
then the error, f(x0) 
minus its approximation

18
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:34,524
with the backward finite
 difference formula

19
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:39,003
is divided by 2

20
00:01:39,003 --> 00:01:42,305
or by 10 if h is divided by 10.

21
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:47,431
I leave the proof
as an exercise

22
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,344
it is similar to 
the previous proof

23
00:01:50,344 --> 00:02:00,130
we start by writing
f(x0-h)=f(x0)-h*f'(x0)+ etc

24
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,519
and to conclude we must 
find the c in the theorem

25
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,637
that can depend on 
f and x0 but not h

26
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:16,557
and this x will be 
the absolute value

27
00:02:16,557 --> 00:02:21,725
of half the maximum of 
the second derivative

28
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,741
because we have 
x0 and x0-h

29
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:31,576
and h is less than or equal to 1, 
so here lies x0-1

30
00:02:31,576 --> 00:02:38,128
then the maximum is between
x0-1 and x0

31
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:43,028
you can try numerically and
observe the same phenomenon

32
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:48,000
as for the forward
finite difference formula.
