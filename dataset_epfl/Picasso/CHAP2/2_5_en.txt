We'll now explain the following result about the error between f'(x0) and its approximation by a backward finite difference formula so (f(x0) - f(x0-h))/h
We now state the following theorem, 
Theorem 2.1 in the case of the bacward finite difference formula.
For all function f and for all x0 in â„� there is a positive c such that
for all h between 0 and 1 the error f'(x0) minus its approximation by a backward finite difference formula is as before less than or equal to c*h
As before because of the order of quantifiers, c can only depend on f and x0 but not h.
As before we interpret the result as follows : choose a function f, and some x0 then the error, f(x0) minus its approximation with the backward finite
difference formula is divided by 2 or by 10 if h is divided by 10.
I leave the proof as an exercise it is similar to the previous proof we start by writing f(x0-h)=f(x0)-h*f'(x0)+ etc and to conclude we must find the c in the theorem that can depend on f and x0 but not h and this x will be the absolute value of half the maximum of the second derivative because we have x0 and x0-h and h is less than or equal to 1, so here lies x0-1 then the maximum is between x0-1 and x0 you can try numerically and observe the same phenomenon as for the forward finite difference formula.
