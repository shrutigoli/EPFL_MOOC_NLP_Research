We'll now clarify the mathematical point of view.
We want to show that the error between the derivative f'(x0) and its approximation by a forward finite difference formula is of order 1 in h.
Let f be a function from â„� to â„� twice continuously differentiable.
Take x0 in â„� and take a fixed positive h.
The Taylor expansion of f at x0 yields the following equality f(x0+h)=f(x0)+h*f'(x0)+h^2/2*f''(Î¾) so we add h times the first derivative to f(x0) plus the square of the increment, h^2 over factorial of 2. so 2 times f'' at a certain point Î¾.
Î¾ is an indermediate point, between x0 and x0+h.
From this equality we can
easily deduce that f'(x0) minus f(x0+h)-f(x0)
over h which is the approximation by the forward finite difference formula this is equal to h^2/2 times the absolute value of f'(Î¾)
Now let's state a mathematical theorem it is Theorem 2.2 of the book.
I claim that for every function f, twice continuously diferentiable for all x0 in â„� there is a positive C such that for all h positive less than or equal to 1 we get that the error, so f'(x0) minus
its approximation by the forward finite difference formula f(x0+h)-f(x0) divided by h.
This quantity is less than C*h
Remark that according to the theorem for all f and for all x0 there is a constant C,
C depends only from what's before, that is f and x0 but C does not depend on what follows, so h hence C may depend on f and x0 but not on h.
The numerical interpretation that we'll see is the following:
Choose a function f and a point x0 and observe the error so that quantity. and let h vary.
I claim that the error is divided by 2 every time h is divided by 2.
Or the error is divided by 10 everytime we divide h by 10.
We now have to prove the theorem. we may be tempted to choose C as
1/2 * f''(Î¾), in absolute value, but we cannot, why?
So be careful, we cannot take
C = 1/2*f'(Î¾), why ?
Simply because Î¾ depends on h since it is between x0 and x0+h, so our C would depend on h.
But what we can do is find an upper bound for the second derivative at Î¾ that will not depend on h.
Let me explain more clearly.
Here is the point x0, here you have x0+h
Î¾ is somewhere between x0 and x0+h.
Now I use the assumption that h is less than or equal to 1. so x0+h is less than or equal to x0+1
So now we take the upper bound for the second derivative at Î¾ as the maximum of the second derivative on the interval [x0,x0+1].
So I claim that f'(x0) minus its approximation by the forward finite difference formula
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h but this time with an upper bound on the second derivative at Î¾ par le maximum des dÃ©rivÃ©es secondes on the interval [x0,x0+1], so it is less than or equal to h/2 times the maximum of the f''(x) in absolute value with all x between x0 and x0+1.
So we get our constant C:
C is half the maximum on the interval [x0,x0+1] of the second derivative.
This C depends on f, more precisely on f'', and it depends on x0 because the interval for the maximum depends on x0, but C does not depend on h.
So we proved the theorem.
