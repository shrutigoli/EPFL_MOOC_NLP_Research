1
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:06,953
We'll now clarify the 
mathematical point of view.

2
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:11,149
We want to show that the error
between the derivative f'(x0)

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,962
and its approximation by a 
forward finite difference formula

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,544
is of order 1 in h.

5
00:00:18,654 --> 00:00:22,490
Let f be a function from ℝ to ℝ

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
twice continuously differentiable.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:29,562
Take x0 in ℝ

8
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,023
and take a fixed positive h.

9
00:00:33,563 --> 00:00:38,088
The Taylor expansion of f at x0 yields
the following equality

10
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:45,071
f(x0+h)=f(x0)+h*f'(x0)+h^2/2*f''(ξ) 

11
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:49,094
so we add h times the first derivative 
to f(x0)

12
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:55,408
plus the square of the increment, h^2
over factorial of 2. so 2

13
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:58,339
times f'' at a certain point ξ.

14
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:04,526
ξ is an indermediate point, 
between x0 and x0+h.

15
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:07,872
From this equality we can
 easily deduce that

16
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:11,072
f'(x0) minus

17
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:15,472
f(x0+h)-f(x0)

18
00:01:16,182 --> 00:01:18,382
 over h

19
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,587
which is

20
00:01:19,587 --> 00:01:24,923
the approximation by the 
forward finite difference formula

21
00:01:25,053 --> 00:01:26,356
this is equal to 

22
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:33,266
h^2/2 times the absolute value of f'(ξ)

23
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:37,573
Now let's state a mathematical
theorem

24
00:01:38,103 --> 00:01:41,421
it is Theorem 2.2 of the book.

25
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:47,201
I claim that

26
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:53,162
for every function f, 
twice continuously diferentiable

27
00:01:53,752 --> 00:01:55,585
for all x0 in ℝ

28
00:01:56,705 --> 00:01:59,688
there is a positive C

29
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:06,071
such that for all h positive
less than or equal to 1

30
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:10,676
we get that the error, 
so f'(x0) minus

31
00:02:10,676 --> 00:02:14,996
 its approximation by the forward
finite difference formula

32
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:20,799
f(x0+h)-f(x0) divided by h.

33
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:25,868
This quantity is less than C*h

34
00:02:26,348 --> 00:02:27,377
Remark that

35
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,842
according to the theorem

36
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:36,327
for all f and for all x0 there
is a constant C,

37
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:40,612
C depends only from what's before, 
that is f and x0

38
00:02:40,752 --> 00:02:44,408
but C does not depend on 
what follows, so h

39
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:58,878
hence C may depend on f and x0
but not on h.

40
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:02,232
The numerical interpretation
that we'll see is 

41
00:03:02,732 --> 00:03:03,831
the following:

42
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,636
Choose a function f

43
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:13,661
and a point x0

44
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,087
and observe the error

45
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,085
so that quantity.

46
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:23,437
and let h vary.

47
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:27,921
I claim that the error
is divided by 2

48
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,227
every time h is 
divided by 2.

49
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:36,436
Or the error is divided by 10 
everytime we divide h by 10.

50
00:03:38,466 --> 00:03:42,516
We now have to prove 
the theorem.

51
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,446
we may be tempted to choose C as

52
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:52,296
1/2 * f''(ξ),
in absolute value,

53
00:03:52,296 --> 00:03:53,808
but we cannot, why?

54
00:03:54,008 --> 00:04:00,034
So be careful,
we cannot take

55
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:08,143
C = 1/2*f'(ξ), why ?

56
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:13,910
Simply because ξ depends on h
since it is between x0 and x0+h,

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:24,404
so our C would depend on h.

58
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,562
But what we can do is

59
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:31,444
find an upper bound for 
the second derivative at ξ

60
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,970
that will not depend on h.

61
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,382
Let me explain more clearly.

62
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:38,340
Here is the point x0,

63
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,779
here you have x0+h

64
00:04:41,429 --> 00:04:45,021
ξ is somewhere between 
x0 and x0+h.

65
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,761
Now I use the assumption that 

66
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:49,642
h is less than or equal to 1.

67
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:55,431
so x0+h is less than
or equal to x0+1

68
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:59,232
So now we take the upper bound for 
the second derivative at ξ

69
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:03,469
as the maximum of the second derivative
on the interval [x0,x0+1].

70
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:10,409
So I claim that f'(x0)

71
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,781
minus its approximation by the forward
finite difference formula

72
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:18,574
(f(x0+h)-f(x0))/h

73
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:22,539
but this time with an upper bound 
on the second derivative at ξ

74
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:25,769
par le maximum des dérivées secondes

75
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,828
on the interval [x0,x0+1],

76
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,892
so it is less than or equal to h/2

77
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:36,210
times the maximum of the f''(x)
in absolute value

78
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,181
with all x between x0 and x0+1.

79
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,272
So we get our constant C:

80
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:48,662
C is half the maximum

81
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:54,051
on the interval [x0,x0+1] of the second 
derivative.

82
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:58,564
This C depends on f,
more precisely on f'',

83
00:05:58,874 --> 00:06:03,144
and it depends on x0 because 
the interval for the maximum depends on x0,

84
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:05,333
but C does not depend on h.

85
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,307
So we proved the theorem.
