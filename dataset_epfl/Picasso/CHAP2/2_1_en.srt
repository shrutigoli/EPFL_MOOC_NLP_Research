00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:08,027
Welcome to Chapter 2 : 
"Numerical differentiation".

2
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:10,968
Today we'll discuss the 
following problems :

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:13,231
First-order numerical derivative :

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:18,917
we'll deal with truncation error
of Taylor series,

5
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,806
and we'll talk about
round-off errors.

6
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:25,610
Then we'll discuss numerical
 differientiation of order 2

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,064
so we'll have to know first-order
finite difference formula

8
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:31,797
and a second-order finite
difference formula.

9
00:00:31,797 --> 00:00:34,169
So the book chapters we'll
deal with are

10
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,991
chapters 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.
