00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,280
Hello, my name is Marco Picasso

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,850
and I will present my course:
numerical analysis for engineers.

3
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,590
This course contains the 
seven first chapters

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,638
of a bachelor course
given to the students

5
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:27,111
of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale
de Lausanne (EPFL).

6
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:30,011
First, what is numerical analysis?

7
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:32,722
Numerical analysis is a subset
of a larger discipline

8
00:00:32,722 --> 00:00:34,240
called

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,091
scientific computing or
computational sciences.

10
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:40,432
The goal is to simulate
complex phenomena,

11
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:42,849
for instance the flow around an airplane,

12
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,875
the future or past retreat of glaciers,

13
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,984
or even produce special effects
for the film industry.

14
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:52,038
The road map to produce a numerical simulation
is the following.

15
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:54,502
A mathematical model has to be derived.

16
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:57,101
For instance, when considering 
the flow around an airplane,

17
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:58,362
The velocity around the airplane

18
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:02,079
has to be related to the pressure.

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,222
In general, the mathematical model

20
00:01:04,222 --> 00:01:07,070
is too complex to derive an
explicit formula for the solution.

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,670
An algorithm is then needed
to approach the solution of the model.

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,160
This is precisely the goal of numerical analysis.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,764
Whenever possible,
we will quantify the error

24
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:23,164
between the output of the algorithm
and the exact solution of the model,

25
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:24,553
which is unknown.

26
00:01:24,553 --> 00:01:27,295
Then, the algorithm is implemented
on a computer,

27
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,082
it is validated,

28
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:31,662
and the results are eventually
compared to experiments.

29
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,756
This numerical analysis course
for engineers

30
00:01:33,756 --> 00:01:35,960
contains interpolation problems,

31
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,201
finite difference formula,
quadrature formula,

32
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,361
so as

33
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,901
methods to solve linear
and nonlinear systems,

34
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:44,616
and finally,

35
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:47,161
methods to solve differential equations.

36
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:48,426
Each week

37
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:51,288
a new Chapter will be presented,

38
00:01:51,288 --> 00:01:55,257
you will be asked to watch videos,
answer quizzes,

39
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:58,777
perform numerical experiments
with matlab or octave,

40
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:02,514
in order to illustrate the
theory presented during the lectures.

41
00:02:02,514 --> 00:02:04,725
I hope to see you soon
in this course:

42
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,760
numerical analysis for engineers.
