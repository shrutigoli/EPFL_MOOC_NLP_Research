1
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:07,403
We have seen that there are are situations
where the differential equation

2
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:10,863
has a unique solution at all 
time t,

3
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:14,565
and there are situations where there
are several solutions,

4
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:17,214
or no solution at all after 
a certain time.

5
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:18,558
il n'y a plus de solution.

6
00:00:18,558 --> 00:00:22,459
The following theorem

7
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:28,466
states that, under a certain assumptions,

8
00:00:28,466 --> 00:00:30,649
there is one and only one
solution.

9
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,952
Here is the theorem without proof,

10
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:35,594
theorem 9.1 of the book.

11
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:38,100
Recall that the data of 
the problem

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,568
are the initial value u0

13
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:45,233
and the function f that
depends on the two variables x, t,

14
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:47,209
x in ℝ, and t nonnegative.

15
00:00:47,209 --> 00:00:53,606
The problem to solve is to find
u, a function of t,

16
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:57,043
such that u'(t)=f(u(t),t)

17
00:00:57,043 --> 00:01:02,174
for t nonnegative

18
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,413
with initial value

19
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:07,271
u(0)=u0.

20
00:01:07,271 --> 00:01:11,383
The assumption on the function f is:

21
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:19,321
f is continuous, moreover I 
have to find another function l(t)

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,984
qui à t retourne l de t

23
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:26,009
t here is the time, it is nonnegative,

24
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:34,075
l(t) is in ℝ, and such that
if I take any x,y in ℝ

25
00:01:34,075 --> 00:01:38,250
and any t nonnegative,

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:46,630
I compute f(x,t)-f(y,t) multiplied
by x minus y,

27
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,935
it must be less or equal

28
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:54,870
than l(t) times (x-y)².

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:01,075
Let's repeat, from f, 
I must find a function l

30
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:06,686
such that for all x,y,t 
(f(x,t)-f(y,t))*(x-y) is less or equal

31
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,964
to l(t)*(x-y)².

32
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:14,901
In that case the conclusion
is as follows.

33
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:23,795
Ther exists a unique u such that
u'(t)=f(u(t),t), for all t, with u(0)=u0,

34
00:02:23,795 --> 00:02:29,574
we shall say that the problem 
has a unique global solution u.

35
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:35,869
c'est-à-dire pour tout temps t
et unique et une seule.

36
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:44,058
Corollary of this theorem: assume that
f(x,t) is now

37
00:02:44,058 --> 00:02:46,499
continuously differentiable with respect to
the first variable,

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:51,423
and assume that there exists K in ℝ

39
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:57,585
such that for all x in ℝ, 
for all nonnegative t,

40
00:02:57,585 --> 00:03:02,644
the derivative of f with respect to the 
first variable

41
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:09,197
is less than or equal to 
this K.

42
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:12,146
I claim that in this case

43
00:03:12,146 --> 00:03:16,283
the problem

44
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:20,492
has a unique global solution.

45
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:25,071
Proof of this corollary:

46
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:32,656
Take any real values x,y, 
take any nonnegative t,

47
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:43,080
compute  
(f(x,t)-f(y,t))*(x-y),

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,435
we want to show that quantity is less or equal

49
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,524
some l(t) that I must find, 
times (x-y)^2.

50
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:57,925
The mean value theorem 
tells me that f(x,t)-f(y,t)

51
00:03:57,925 --> 00:04:01,093
can be written as df/dx

52
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:04,907
alors c'est bien la première variable
qui change : xy

53
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:09,270
at some intermediate point, denoted ξ

54
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,995
(ξ between x and y)

55
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:21,247
so (f(x,t)-f(y,t))*(x-y)

56
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:24,478
is df/dx(ξ)*(x-y)^2.

57
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,060
that is the mean value theorem

58
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,482
and I  had still x-y here

59
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:36,261
donc pour finir, j'arrive à
un x moins y au carré.

60
00:04:36,261 --> 00:04:41,759
The assumption
is that df/dx is always less or equal K,

61
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,136
So his is less than or equal to K
times (x-y)².

62
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:49,925
Therefore, the function l(t) to be found

63
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:53,041
is defined by

64
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,842
l(t)=K.

65
00:04:55,842 --> 00:05:01,466
We can apply theorem 9.1 of the book
with l(t)=K,

66
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,321
the problem has 
a unique global solution.

67
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's consider the previous examples.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,608
Example 9.1 was:

69
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:20,070
u'(t)=3u(t)-3*t

70
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,076
u(0)=α

71
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:31,035
the function f(x,t) here is f(x,t)=3x-3t

72
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:35,511
I compute df/dx(x,t), it is equal to 3,

73
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:41,644
and I can use the corollary of theorem 9.1:

74
00:05:41,644 --> 00:05:44,657
the problem has a unique global solution.

75
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:48,716
We found explicitly the solution.

76
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,156
une exponentielle 3t 
et une solution particulière.

77
00:05:51,156 --> 00:05:53,347
Now, 

78
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:56,300
if I replace 3t in the definition of f(x,t) by
exp(t²) for instance,

79
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,198
I cannot find  the solution u explicitly anymore,

80
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:06,864
f(x,t)=3x+exp(t²),

81
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:09,567
but df/dx(x,t) is still equal to 3

82
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:11,598
so I can still use the corollary of the theorem

83
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,677
to state that there is a
unique global solution u.

84
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:15,498
que je ne peux pas expliciter.

85
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:18,114
Mais je sais qu'il y a une solution
globale unique.

86
00:06:18,114 --> 00:06:23,087
Another example was 
u'(t)=-u(t)³ 

87
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:28,302
égal U de t en cube, avec un signe moins

88
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,815
with an initial value u(0)=1.

89
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:33,584
Remark that in the corollary of the theorem,

90
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:38,206
the initial value u0 does not matter.

91
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:41,631
So u'(t)=-u(t)³

92
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:44,378
so the function f is 

93
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:46,788
f(x,t)=-x³,

94
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:51,888
its derivative with respect to the first variable is

95
00:06:51,908 --> 00:06:54,794
-3x², which is les or equal 0,

96
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:58,735
so I can apply the corollary
of the theorem

97
00:06:58,735 --> 00:07:01,859
with K=0, the problem has 
a unique global solution.

98
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:04,518
I can again do the same remark : 

99
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:07,608
I could add exp(t²) here,

100
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:11,884
f(x,t)

101
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:16,517
would be -x³ + exp(t²),

102
00:07:16,517 --> 00:07:18,882
the derivative with respect to x remains the same

103
00:07:18,882 --> 00:07:22,976
and so the problem still has
a unique global solution,

104
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:26,323
even if I cannot write down 
a formula for it.

105
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,873
Now we will solve numerically

106
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:30,912
differential equations having unique global solutions.
