1
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:07,129
Before presenting some of the numerical methods, 
we shall exclude some cases.

2
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:10,471
Consider example 9.1 of the book.

3
00:00:11,403 --> 00:00:15,063
We are looking for u such that 

4
00:00:15,655 --> 00:00:18,291
u'(t)=3u(t)-3t

5
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:22,831
with u(0)=α, a given
real number.

6
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:28,507
The solution to this problem
is exp(3t) times α-1/3

7
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:32,142
+ t+1/3.

8
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,770
et puis α moins 1/3

9
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:38,784
qui est la bonne constante.

10
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:44,428
So, take for example
the case where α=1/3,

11
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:48,079
in this case, let's

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,463
evaluate the solution at t=10,

13
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:55,564
u(10)=10+1/3.

14
00:00:56,948 --> 00:00:59,217
Consider a small error (for instance a rounding error)

15
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:00,476
on the initial value

16
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,375
α=1/3+ε.

17
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,324
In that case, at the time 10,

18
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:08,618
it is α-1/3,

19
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:13,378
that is, ε^30+10+1/3.

20
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:16,571
plus 10 plus 1/3.

21
00:01:17,053 --> 00:01:22,983
If ε=10^-6 for example,

22
00:01:23,397 --> 00:01:28,747
then ε^30

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,264
is of order 10^7,

24
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:33,174
Donc voyez que dans ce cas-là,

25
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:37,718
and the difference between the 2 solutions
is of order 10^7.

26
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,583
So we conclude that

27
00:01:41,972 --> 00:01:45,862
an error of 10^-6 on the initial value here,

28
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,807
induces an error of 10^7 

29
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,589
after 10 second.

30
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:59,897
Donc, vous voyez bien
que dans ce cas-là,

31
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:03,645
It would be then completely useless
to solve the problem numerically,

32
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,005
In that case, we shall say that the problem is
numerically ill-posed.

33
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,565
In what follows,
we will not consider such problems.
