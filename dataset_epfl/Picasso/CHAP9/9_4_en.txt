Before presenting some of the numerical methods, we shall exclude some cases.
Consider example 9.1 of the book.
We are looking for u such that u'(t)=3u(t)-3t with u(0)=Î±, a given real number.
The solution to this problem is exp(3t) times Î±-1/3
+ t+1/3. et puis Î± moins 1/3 qui est la bonne constante.
So, take for example the case where Î±=1/3, in this case, let's evaluate the solution at t=10, u(10)=10+1/3.
Consider a small error (for instance a rounding error) on the initial value
In that case, at the time 10, it is Î±-1/3, that is, Îµ^30+10+1/3. plus 10 plus 1/3.
If Îµ=10^-6 for example, then Îµ^30 is of order 10^7,
Donc voyez que dans ce cas-lÃ , and the difference between the 2 solutions is of order 10^7.
So we conclude that an error of 10^-6 on the initial value here, induces an error of 10^7 after 10 second.
Donc, vous voyez bien que dans ce cas-lÃ ,
It would be then completely useless to solve the problem numerically,
In that case, we shall say that the problem is numerically ill-posed.
In what follows, we will not consider such problems.
