00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:06,464
In chapter 9, 
Differential Equations,

2
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:08,375
we addressed the following points.

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:13,120
First we considered the case of 
a first order differential equation,

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,568
u'(t)=f(u(t),t).

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,556
We have presented several
examples,

6
00:00:21,556 --> 00:00:26,036
unique solution,

7
00:00:26,036 --> 00:00:30,017
several solutions,

8
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:33,335
unique solution and then blow-up.

9
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:37,386
We stated a theorem: under some condition of u,

10
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:41,859
the problem has a unique solution for all t.

11
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:45,881
For example, if the derivative of f
with respect to the first variable

12
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:49,066
is bounded, then the problem admits a unique solution.

13
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:54,582
We first presented the forward Euler scheme.

14
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:57,586
Let u_n be an approximation of u(t_n)

15
00:00:57,586 --> 00:01:01,353
t_n is n*h, h the time step.

16
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:06,802
The scheme is (u_(n+1)-u_n)/h=f(u_n,t_n),

17
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:11,030
it is explicit in the sense 
that we can write u_(n+1) as a function of u_n

18
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:15,569
u_(n+1)=u_n+h*f(u_n,tn).

19
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:22,197
Then we introduced the backward Euler scheme

20
00:01:22,197 --> 00:01:26,362
(u_(n+1)-u_n)/h=f(u_(n+1),t(n+1)).

21
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,978
This relation between u_n and u_(n+1) is now implicit,

22
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:34,706
donc on ne peut pas expliciter u^(n+1)
en fonction de u^n

23
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:40,775
finding u_(n+1) corresponds to solving a nonlinear equation,

24
00:01:40,775 --> 00:01:43,190
Newton's method can be used.

25
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,189
to find the 0 of the function.

26
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:48,425
Then we discussed about the stability 
of the Euler schemes,

27
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:53,473
when the differential equation is
u'(t)=-βu(t) for some nonnegative β,

28
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:57,235
the solution of this equation 
being u(0)-exp(-β*t).

29
00:01:57,235 --> 00:02:02,272
We defined the method to be stable, 
if the limit when n goes to the infinity

30
00:02:02,272 --> 00:02:07,892
of u_n is equal to 0. 
The forward Euler scheme is stable

31
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:12,337
under the condition

32
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:15,623
h less than 2/β.

33
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:19,868
This condition may be restrictive 
since it may require the use of small time steps.

34
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:23,528
On the other hand, 
the backward Euler scheme

35
00:02:24,308 --> 00:02:28,136
is stable for all h>0.

36
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:34,932
Both methods convergence with order 1 in h,

37
00:02:34,932 --> 00:02:37,408
for example, for this
differential equation,

38
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:39,982
it can be shown that
the error at final time

39
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:43,070
is of order 1 in h,

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,093
meaning that the error is divided by 2

41
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:48,188
every time h is divided by 2,
and the number of time steps

42
00:02:48,188 --> 00:02:51,188
is multiplied by 2.

43
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:55,942
This is also true when the function f(x,t) is Lipschitz
continuous with respect to x.

44
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:59,080
qui serait lipschitzienne 
par rapport à la 1ère variable.

45
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:05,313
We adressed briefly the question 
of higher order schemes,

46
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:08,738
the order 2 Crank-Nicolson scheme,

47
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:12,619
une grosse littérature sur des schémas
d'ordre plus élevé que l'ordre 1.

48
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:15,552
Then we extended the Euler schemes to
differential systems of first order.

49
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,875
Consider for instance the Euler forward scheme,

50
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:22,840
il suffit de mettre 
un vecteur sur u^(n+1)

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,304
(u^(n+1)-u^n)/h = f(u^n,t) now
all the u^n's are vectors.

52
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:32,282
It is an explicit method, 
we can write the vector u^(n+1)

53
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:38,415
as  u^n+h*f(u^n,tn), an equality between vectors.

54
00:03:38,415 --> 00:03:44,606
For the backward Euler method, 
(u^(n+1)-u^n)/h = f(u^(n+1),t(n+1))

55
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:48,723
to find u^(n+1), we have to solve a nonlinear 
system of equations

56
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:50,511
at each time step.

57
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:52,440
u^(n+1) en fonction de u^n

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,487
Newton's method can be used to solve this nonlinear system.

59
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:58,252
ce système d'équation non-linéaire.
