1
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:06,604
I will now discuss the stability 
of Euler's schemes

2
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:09,040
when solving the following differential equation:

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,106
On se donne un β positif, 
et on considère l'équation différentielle

4
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,585
u'(t)=-β*u(t) for β nonnegative

5
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:23,900
and with an initial value u(0)=u0.

6
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:30,550
The unique solution
is given by u(t)=u0*exp(-βt)

7
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,506
and so I can plot the solution,

8
00:00:36,506 --> 00:00:37,244
here is t,

9
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:38,750
start from u0,

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,153
here is u0*exp(-βt).

11
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:48,365
Note that the limit
when t goes to the infinity

12
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:51,339
of u(t) is 0.

13
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:58,122
I will require about the numerical scheme iss the 
following: given a numerical scheme

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:06,838
that allows to compute
approximations u_0, u_1, u_2, ..., u_n

15
00:01:06,838 --> 00:01:09,562
and from u_n, compute u_(n+1)

16
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:14,238
where u_(n+1) is an approximation of u 
at the time t(n+1),

17
00:01:14,238 --> 00:01:17,477
I would like to reproduce this property
from a numerical standpoint.

18
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,682
I require the following :

19
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:24,426
Definition: the 
method is stable,

20
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,958
there are several definitions of 
stability,

21
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,595
this is one the simplest,

22
00:01:28,595 --> 00:01:34,513
the method is stable if the limit
when n goes to the infinity

23
00:01:34,513 --> 00:01:36,432
of u_n is 0.

24
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:39,474
For instance, here are approximations, 

25
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,385
here u1, u 2, etc ...

26
00:01:42,604 --> 00:01:48,712
and I want these approximations to
go to 0 when n goes to the infinity.

27
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:54,231
Let's now consider Euler's 
forward method

28
00:01:55,368 --> 00:02:01,464
for this differential equation:
(u_(n+1)-u_n)/h

29
00:02:01,482 --> 00:02:03,587
h is the time step,

30
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,683
tn=n*h,

31
00:02:09,683 --> 00:02:13,612
equals -β*u_n,

32
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:20,109
that is to say 
u_(n+1)=(1-βh)*u_n

33
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:24,892
so it is a geometric sequence
of progression (1-βh),

34
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:30,793
so u_(n+1)=(-βh)^(n+1)*u_0,

35
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:36,717
which goes to 0 when 
n goes to the infinity if and only if

36
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:42,288
the progression (1-βh) in absolute value
is less than 1,

37
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:50,512
In other words if and only if
-1<1-βh<1,

38
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:58,647
β and h being nonnegative, 
1-βh is always less than 1

39
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:03,068
but the other inequality yields

40
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:11,232
βh is less than 2, so h is less than 2/β.

41
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:15,221
So Euler's
forward scheme

42
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,216
is stable when h is less than or equal to 2/β.

43
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,117
What happens when it's not the case?

44
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,191
If I take h, 
greater than 2/β,

45
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,151
u_n goes to the infinity

46
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:29,277
when n goes to the infinity, 

47
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:31,184
which is not a desired property

48
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,541
since the exact solution u
converges to 0.

49
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,026
This stability condition is a drawback,

50
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:40,863
because if β is large, then 
the time step h must be small,

51
00:03:40,863 --> 00:03:42,650
so if I want to make a simulation,

52
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,769
for example to forecast the weather 
for 24hour, I will 

53
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,834
have to use small time steps, 
which is not desirable.

54
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,480
Let's now go to Euler's
backward method.

55
00:03:54,618 --> 00:03:57,575
Euler's backward scheme on this
differential equation

56
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:05,414
reduces to (u_(n+1)-u_n)/h=-βu_(n+1)

57
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:11,772
so u_(n+1)=u_n/(1+βh).

58
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:17,222
Again, we have a geometric sequence, 
with progression 1/(1+βh),

59
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:27,711
by induction, u_(n+1)=u_0*(1/(1+βh))^(n+1)

60
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:32,781
and this quantity goes to 0
when n goes to the infinity

61
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:37,965
if and only if the progression
is less than 1,

62
00:04:37,965 --> 00:04:41,867
1/(1+βh)

63
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,737
β and h being nonnegative,

64
00:04:44,737 --> 00:04:46,186
cette quantité-là est positive

65
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,746
-je peux enlever la valeur absolue-

66
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,032
which is always the case,

67
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:58,898
for all nonnegative h, 

68
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:01,743
1/(1+βh) is less than 1.

69
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:05,056
It suffices to study the function 1/(1+x)

70
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:06,153
with x nonnegative.

71
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:10,524
So this backward Euler's scheme is 

72
00:05:10,524 --> 00:05:16,844
stable for any poistive h, we say it is
unconditionally stable.

73
00:05:16,844 --> 00:05:19,648
which means it is stable
without condition on h,

74
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:22,705
unlike Euler's forward method,

75
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:25,929
stable if h is less than or
equal to 2/β.

76
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,104
Let's now talk about convergence
of Euler's schemes

77
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:40,067
we used a finite difference formula,

78
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:43,132
forawrd or backward, both
are finite difference formulas

79
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:46,351
of order 1 in h.

80
00:05:46,698 --> 00:05:50,670
pour écrire les schémas d'Euler
progressif ou rétrograde.

81
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:55,627
Those two Euler's schemes

82
00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:00,260
converge at order 1 in h.

83
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:04,284
What does this mean?
Let's do the following experiment.

84
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:11,984
I start from u0,

85
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:19,497
and I want to compute u(t) at some final time T,

86
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,658
let tn=n*h, n=0,1,2,etc...

87
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:34,238
here I have t0, t1, t2, t3, etc ...

88
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,792
and the last time is tN, which is Nh,
equals to the final time T.

89
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:50,582
I claim that at the time T, 
u(T), which I do not know, 

90
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:54,242
minus its approximation u_N

91
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:57,464
ontained using an Euler's scheme,
forward or backward,

92
00:06:58,198 --> 00:07:02,786
in the case of forward Euler's method 
under the stability condition

93
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:09,956
this quantity is of order 1 in h,
this is not surprising since I used

94
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:14,828
finite difference formula, forward or backward, 
which are of order 1 in h,

95
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:21,317
to approach the derivative u'
t the time tn or t(n+1).

96
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:25,243
So this statement corresponds to the 
following experiment.

97
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:30,448
Fix the final time T, and 
choose some h

98
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:42,420
and compute, from u0, 
u1, u2, u3 until u4, 

99
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,315
and write down the error

100
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:51,974
u(tN)-u_N.

101
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,550
Now divide h by 2,

102
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:58,938
je prends un h deux fois plus petit

103
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,127
compute the u_n to arrive at the same final time T,

104
00:08:04,127 --> 00:08:08,207
I must multiply the number 
of time steps, N, by 2 as well,

105
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:16,368
in this case the error is 
approximatively divided by 2.

106
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,770
I do another simulation with 
a time step

107
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,785
twice as small,

108
00:08:26,497 --> 00:08:28,895
so I will do twice more computations

109
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,367
but at the end the 
error will be divided by 2.

110
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:38,734
Thus when the time step goes to zero,

111
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:43,198
et le pas de temps tend vers 0,

112
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:50,809
my numerical approximation will be closer and
closer to the exact solution.
