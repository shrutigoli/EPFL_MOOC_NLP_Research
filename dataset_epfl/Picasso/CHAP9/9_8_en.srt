1
00:00:03,667 --> 00:00:08,564
There are many schemes more precise
than Euler's schemes.

2
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:10,700
Schemes of order 2,3,4 and so on,

3
00:00:10,968 --> 00:00:14,448
there are books dedicated
to the study of such schemes,

4
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:17,359
I will only give one here, 
the Crank-NIcolson's scheme.

5
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:20,559
In Euler's schemes

6
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:24,808
we have the term (u_(n+1)-u_n)/h

7
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:26,715
-so the approximation of the derivative

8
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:32,362
equals f(u_n,tn).

9
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:34,793
or

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,804
qui s'écrit <i>(u^(n+1) - u^n)/h</i>

11
00:00:40,354 --> 00:00:44,076
f(u_(n+1),t(n+1)),

12
00:00:44,638 --> 00:00:47,638
and so if we average
both schemes we get

13
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:50,963
(u_(n+1)-u_n)/h

14
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:57,817
=1/2*[f(u_n,tn)

15
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:04,391
+f(u_(n+1),t(n+1))].

16
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:08,554
This is nothing but Crank-NIcolson's scheme.

17
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:12,587
This scheme is of order 2 in h, 
in the sense that

18
00:01:12,587 --> 00:01:14,451
si on refait l'expérience précédente,

19
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:19,955
if we approach u at 
some final time T=t_N,

20
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,750
we note u_N this approximation,

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,413
then the approximation
at the final time is in O(h²),

22
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:34,454
the error at final time is in O(h²)
which means that if h is divided by 2

23
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:38,578
and the number of time step is
multiplicated by 2,

24
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:42,323
the error at the same final time,

25
00:01:42,723 --> 00:01:48,499
the error u(t_N)-u_N

26
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:54,797
is divided this time by 4.

27
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,150
Let's study the stability of this scheme, 
still on the differential equation

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,680
u'=-βu  where  β is nonnegative.

29
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:09,065
Crank-Nicolson's scheme is 
written in this case : 

30
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,679
(u_(n+1) - u_n)/h

31
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:18,824
=1/2(-βu_n

32
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:22,371
-βu_(n+1)).

33
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:25,748
So I can write the scheme as following:

34
00:02:25,748 --> 00:02:29,684
I have u_(n+1)=u_n

35
00:02:29,684 --> 00:02:34,830
times 1-βh/2

36
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,518
divided by 1+ βh/2.

37
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:43,951
So by induction, u_(n+1)

38
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:48,004
is equal to the initial value, u_0

39
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:54,629
times the progression, here
(1-βh/2)/(1 + βh/2)^(n+1)

40
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,260
élevé à la puissance <i>(n+1)</i>

41
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,191
and u_(n+1) tends to 0
when n goes to the infinity,

42
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:10,002
if and only if the common ratio
is strictly less than 1 in absolute value.

43
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:12,473
(stricly less than 1).

44
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:18,618
So it suffices to study the function
(1-x)/(1+x)

45
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,654
for positive x,

46
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:24,390
when x=0 this function equals 1,

47
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:27,036
when x goes to +infinity

48
00:03:27,036 --> 00:03:33,784
this function, (1-x)/(1+x) is -1, 
and so for all h

49
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:40,002
ceci est toujours le cas,
sous-entendu pour tout <i>h</i> positif,

50
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:46,996
this quantity is strictly lesser than 1.

51
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:48,215
Je vous rappelle ici

52
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:52,974
que dans l'étude de la stabilité,
<i>β</i> est strictement positif.

53
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:55,184
So Crank Nicolson's scheme

54
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:05,185
is, as Euler's backward method, 
unconditionally stable.

55
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:11,037
comme le schéma d'Euler, rétrograde,

56
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:14,567
So stable without any condition on h.

57
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:19,585
There are obviously other schemes,

58
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:23,731
for example the BDF2 scheme,

59
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,062
Runge Kutta schemes,

60
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:34,417
that can be implicit or explicit, 
of order 1,2,3 and so on.

61
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:38,559
What I have presented in this course
is just a tiny part

62
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,272
of the available litterature.
