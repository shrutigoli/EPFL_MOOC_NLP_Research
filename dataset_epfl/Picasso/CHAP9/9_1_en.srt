00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:06,139
Hello and welcome to chapter 9:

2
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,724
differential equations.

3
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:08,528
In this course,

4
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,178
we'll only introduce

5
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,743
numerical methods for 
differential equations.

6
00:00:12,743 --> 00:00:16,023
There are entire books
dedicated to this subject.

7
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,523
I will mainly talk 

8
00:00:18,523 --> 00:00:20,720
about differential equations
of first order.


9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,820
I will state the problem, 

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,636
and will give an existence theorem, 
without proof.

11
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:29,861
We'll talk about problems
which are numerically ill-posed.

12
00:00:30,278 --> 00:00:31,691
Then the main part,

13
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:33,937
Euler methods, 
forward and backward,

14
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:35,520
which are order one schemes.

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,135
We won't talk about
higher order schemes,

16
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:41,720
but we'll generalize 
the Euler methods

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,950
to differential systems of first order.
