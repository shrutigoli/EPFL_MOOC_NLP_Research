1
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:05,450
First order differential equations.

2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's consider the following
problem:

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,337
given an initial
value u0 in ℝ,

4
00:00:16,337 --> 00:00:22,583
given a function f
or two variables (x,t)

5
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,083
which maps (x,t)

6
00:00:25,103 --> 00:00:29,190
x in ℝ, 
t is the time, so nonnegative,

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,448
and f(x,t) is in ℝ, 
f is a continuous function.

8
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:35,517
We're looking for

9
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:42,655
a function u, of one variable t, 
that returns u(t),

10
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:47,586
so t is nonnegative, u(t) is in ℝ,

11
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:51,907
that satisfies the following first 
order differential equation:

12
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:59,844
u'(t) (u dot t), dot is the notation 
in physics books

13
00:00:59,844 --> 00:01:03,080
for the derivative u'(t), we have
a function u of one variable,

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,044
and we consider the derivative d/dt u(t),
there is no ambiguity there about the derivative,

15
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:17,837
this function satisfies 
u'(t) =f(u (t),t) for nonnegative t,

16
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:21,517
with initial value u(0)=u0, 
which is given.

17
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:26,759
The problem is called Cauchy's problem,

18
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,868
or initial value problem.

19
00:01:31,868 --> 00:01:35,552
comme traduction de l'anglais :
initial value problem.

20
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:39,212
What is the physical motivation behind this 
differential equation?

21
00:01:39,212 --> 00:01:49,034
Consider the case of a parachutist,

22
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:54,842
falling at a velocity v, 
Newton's equations write:

23
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:58,311
mass * acceleration,
which is the derivative of velocity,

24
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:05,494
is equal to the external forces, so the gravity
 force, and the drag force due to the parachute,

25
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:09,674
so the external forces depend
on the velocity and eventually on time.

26
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,362
We have the external forces :

27
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:18,642
Gravity, that pushes towards the botton, 
and the drag force slowing the fall of the parachutist,

28
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:23,828
the given initial value v(0) being known.

29
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:26,862
Let's take a few examples from the book,
example 9.1 for instance,

30
00:02:26,862 --> 00:02:30,180
the differential equation is:

31
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,951
u'(t)=3u(t)-3t,

32
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:42,249
with initial condition u(0)= α, 
a given real number.

33
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:52,622
Here the function is 
f(x,t)=3x-3t, I replaced u(t) by x,

34
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:56,313
you have learned in your first year calculus
course how to solve this differential equation,

35
00:02:56,313 --> 00:03:02,985
it is a linear differential equation,

36
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:08,028
the solution of the homogeneous problem

37
00:03:08,028 --> 00:03:13,276
is proportional to exp(3t),

38
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:19,862
and  t+1/3 is a particular solution.

39
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:28,989
Thus u is a constant  times 
exp(3t) plus a particular solution.

40
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,356
The constant is such that u(0)
equals the initial condition a,

41
00:03:34,356 --> 00:03:37,483
here we find α -1/3.

42
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:41,519
So this is the unique solution.

43
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,569
Let's now consider
example 9.2 of the book.

44
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:52,895
Solve 
u'(t)=u(t)^(1/3)

45
00:03:52,895 --> 00:04:00,761
with initial condition u(0)=0.

46
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,135
I can solve this
differential equation,

47
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:07,293
it is of the type u'*u^α=1,

48
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,655
donc ce terme-là,
je le passe de l'autre côté,

49
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:16,345
with α=-1/3.

50
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:30,466
The integral of u'.u^(α)=1
is 1/(1+α)*u(t)^(α+1),

51
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:35,413
=t + a constant.

52
00:04:35,413 --> 00:04:39,726
Finally I get

53
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:49,276
u(t)=(2/3*t)^(3/2),

54
00:04:49,276 --> 00:04:53,716
we have this solution with a 
+ sign

55
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:56,349
and the same with a - sign

56
00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:00,353
and also we have the solution u(t)=0

57
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:03,234
since

58
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:07,151
0 is also a solution.

59
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:10,958
Therefore, there are 3 solutions which are:

60
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:17,379
the first,  (2/3*t)^(3/2),
then minus this solution,

61
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,483
and finally the 0 
constant function,

62
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,164
donc trois solutions à ce problème.

63
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:27,186
Finally, example 9.3,

64
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:36,281
which is u'(t)=u(t)^3

65
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:39,601
with initial value u(0)=1
this time.

66
00:05:39,601 --> 00:05:46,585
Still an equation of the type 
u'*u^α=1.

67
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:53,286
This times α is -3, 
the integral is

68
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:59,532
1/(1+α)*u(t)^(α+1)=t + c

69
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:09,189
I get the solution 
u(t)=1/square root of(1-2t).

70
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:19,690
At the time 0, u(0)= 1 and
when t approaches 1/2,

71
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,637
there is a blow-up in the

72
00:06:22,637 --> 00:06:29,230
sense that the limit when t goes to 1/2
with lower values, then u(t)

73
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,382
goes to + infinity.

74
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:38,621
J'ai explosion, on dit qu'il y a
explosion de la solution.

75
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:41,724
Note that if I 
just change the sign

76
00:06:41,724 --> 00:06:47,984
of the differential equation, 
u'(t) = -u(t)^3,

77
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:50,997
with the same initial value 
u(0)=1,

78
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:58,508
I still have an equation of the type
u'.u^(α) = -1,

79
00:06:58,508 --> 00:07:01,034
α is still -3,

80
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:07,690
and I find that the solution is given by 
 1/square root of (1+2t)

81
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,042
so the - sign that was here
became + sign,

82
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:14,483
à la place d'un signe moins avant,

83
00:07:14,483 --> 00:07:17,009
so I have no more blow-up,

84
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:21,025
I have a unique solution 
for all time t,

85
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,628
this solution goes from 1 at time 0,

86
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:25,697
to 0 when t goes to the infinity.

87
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,505
Ici il y a une solution unique.

88
00:07:29,655 --> 00:07:35,915
Now I will state a theorem
taken from the book,

89
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:39,983
this theorem states that there exists a unique condition
under a certain assumption on the function f(x,t).
