1
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:06,583
The problem I want to solve is the following.

2
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:08,454
Toy problem:

3
00:00:08,454 --> 00:00:11,277
for a given function f, 

4
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,557
defined on the interval [0,1],
with values in R,

5
00:00:17,034 --> 00:00:18,974
which for a value x returns f(x),

6
00:00:19,942 --> 00:00:23,502
search for a function u,

7
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:25,292
the unknown of the problem, 

8
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:30,513
defined on the interval [0,1] in R,
which for x returns u(x),

9
00:00:32,363 --> 00:00:37,266
this function u must satisfy the following differential equation:

10
00:00:37,266 --> 00:00:41,559
minus the second derivative of u,
here u second, 

11
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,869
is the second derivative with respect to
the only variable present which is x,

12
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:46,559
so minus u '' (x) = f(x),

13
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:49,291
x is in the (0,1),

14
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,286
with conditions:

15
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,306
u in x = 0 equals 0,

16
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:59,567
and u in x = 1 also equal to 0. 

17
00:01:01,733 --> 00:01:06,533
The problem corresponds to
the following physical situation:

18
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:09,281
we consider an elastic cord,

19
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:16,847
stretched and clamped in the ends. 

20
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:21,512
The ends are x = 0 and x = 1.

21
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:26,952
I can draw the following figure,
here is the interval [0,1],

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,998
by pushing on this elastic rope

23
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:35,152
with a force f(x) in point x,

24
00:01:35,152 --> 00:01:38,773
under the effect of this force,
the rope will deform,

25
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,783
I call u(x) the displacement,

26
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:48,899
as I am holding the rope in the ends,
which are x = 0 and x = 1.

27
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:54,276
the displacement is zero in x = 0 and x = 1.

28
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,789
This problem is a toy problem

29
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,289
as is it a simplification of reality,

30
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:05,797
a model problem.

31
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:12,679
We must remark that this
problem can be solved by hand,

32
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:16,777
by integrating twice.
I have two constants

33
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:19,346
which appear during this integration. 

34
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:24,506
These two constants are found by
using the boundary conditions.

35
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,538
Nevertheless, this problem is interesting enough
from the numerical point of view,

36
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,881
and a numerical method will be presented.

37
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,763
More interesting problems
are some of the following:

38
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,878
for example, I consider - u ''(x)

39
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,758
plus c(x) times, which is a function of one variable x,

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,270
times u(x) which is equal to f(x) given. 

41
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:54,095
This problem is linked to
the deformation of beams. 

42
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:58,773
If c(x) is positive for all x,

43
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:02,021
then the problem is well posed 
and admits a unique solution. 

44
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:04,281
Another boundary value

45
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,021
problem with second
derivatives is the following: 

46
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:15,581
d/dx of c(x) times du/dx

47
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:18,350
equal to f(x).

48
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,520
This time, I impose that c(x) is
strictly positive in all points, 

49
00:03:23,852 --> 00:03:29,520
and this problem could correspond to
a situation where the rope

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,280
has different properties
depending on x, for x in [0,1].

51
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:39,660
We call these problems
boundary value problems

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,948
since there are conditions on the boundaries. 

53
00:03:41,948 --> 00:03:47,328
This problem must not be
mistaken with initial value problems

54
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:49,520
which we saw in chapter 9. 

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,000
Beware !

56
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:58,073
Do not get confused

57
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:03,273
with initial value problems. 

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,560
The initial value problem we saw in chapter 9

59
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,254
was the following problem: 

60
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:15,613
it was mass times acceleration equal to force. 

61
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:22,073
A problem of type u dot-dot
equal to the forces

62
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:26,277
which I apply to a particle,
these forces can depend

63
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:30,297
on u(t), maybe u dot. (where u dot is
the derivative with respect to time)

64
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:33,278
for all t positive. 

65
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:37,184
So mass times acceleration is equal to
the external forces applied on the particle

66
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:39,514
with two initial conditions:

67
00:04:39,892 --> 00:04:45,752
u(0) is given and u dot
in 0 is also given.

68
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:49,531
You see here that there is
also a second derivative,

69
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:53,411
which is written "dot" in
the physics literature. 

70
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:56,909
Here the derivative is written " ' ".

71
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,345
Therefore, in both cases
there are second derivatives. 

72
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:02,528
But in this chapter we talk about
boundary value problems

73
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,705
where we have specified
two boundary conditions

74
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,131
which correspond to the fact that
the rope is held at both ends. 

75
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,758
Here, there are two initial conditions

76
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:15,378
which correspond to the fact that,
when a free the object, 

77
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,292
I must specify the position and velocity.
