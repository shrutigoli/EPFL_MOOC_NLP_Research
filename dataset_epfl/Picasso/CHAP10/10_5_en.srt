1
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:06,701
Now I want to solve
a nonlinear boundary value problem.

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:10,291
This nonlinear problem is the following.

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,551
u must satisfy the following equation: 

4
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,071
-u''(x)

5
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:23,161
plus a non linear term which
I write x times u(x)^3,

6
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:30,341
equal to f(x) with x in the interval [0,1]
with the boundary conditions

7
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:35,271
u (0) = 0 and u( 1 ) = 0.

8
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:42,745
I remind you that the
function f is defined on the 0,1 interval

9
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,935
and I am searching for
u which satisfies this equation.

10
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:49,985
In the previous linear example

11
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:53,225
dans le cas linéaire, c'est-à-dire
si cet terme n'existe pas,

12
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,191
when I apply 2 times f, 

13
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:00,207
well the solution to the problem
is 2 times u.

14
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:03,405
This is not the case in the nonlinear problem.

15
00:01:03,535 --> 00:01:05,685
As before, I subdivide

16
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:09,425
the interval [0,1] into sub-intervals.

17
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:13,085
Here in 2, 4 and 8 and so on.

18
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,254
And again like previously,
I name the first node x_1,

19
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,414
and x_N the last. 

20
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:19,060
So h, the space

21
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,466
between two consecutive nodes is constant;

22
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:27,124
it is 1 over N + 1.

23
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:33,474
I set x_i = i times h, for i from 0 to N + 1. 

24
00:01:35,188 --> 00:01:39,338
Here I have a node x_i, to its left the
node x_i-1 and to its right the node x_i+1.

25
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:42,458
And still like before,
the goal is to calculate u_i,

26
00:01:43,348 --> 00:01:47,848
an approximation of u
at point x_i.

27
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:50,398
la solution du problème au point <i>xi</i>.

28
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:51,648
So what do we do?

29
00:01:51,648 --> 00:01:52,998
Like the linear example,

30
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:55,538
we write the differential
equation at node x_i.

31
00:01:55,538 --> 00:02:00,928
So I have - u''(x_i) + x_i * (u(x_i)^3),

32
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:06,708
where x_i is i times h,

33
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:12,178
all this equal to f(x_i) which is known.
I can write these equations

34
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:16,248
for all i from 1 to N. 

35
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:20,436
Now I can approach the second derivative
using a central finite difference formula,

36
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:26,006
<i>FDF</i>, centrée, pour l'approximation
de la dérivée seconde,

37
00:02:26,006 --> 00:02:27,766
the same formula as before.

38
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:34,706
Hence I have 2u(x_i),
to the left minus u(x_i - h),

39
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:37,436
the same as u(x_i-1),

40
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:42,806
and to the right u(x_i+1), divided by h^2. 

41
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:45,266
comme tout à l'heure.

42
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,616
There is an extrra term

43
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:52,222
which is x_i times u(x_i)^3,

44
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:54,918
this must be equal to f(x_i).

45
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:58,306
And of course, I have approximated
the second derivative

46
00:02:58,306 --> 00:02:59,986
using a finite difference formula,

47
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:03,066
so we have a remainder term O(h^2),

48
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:05,636
this error term depends
on the fourth derivative of u.

49
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,326
Now I can write a scheme, as before,

50
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:13,876
I replace u(x_i) by its approximation u_i,

51
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:15,696
which I can compute using a computer. 

52
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:18,586
So the scheme is the following.

53
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,386
Scheme:

54
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:23,267
something
which can be implemented

55
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:24,417
on a computer.

56
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:29,700
I have 2 u_i, minus u_i-1 to the left

57
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,503
and u_i+1 to the right, all divided by h squared.

58
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:37,697
This term is the same as the linear example

59
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,737
since it corresponds to the second derivative. 

60
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:46,007
There is another term which is

61
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:51,027
x_i times u_i^3, which corresponds to x * u(x)^3,

62
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:54,737
with x_i equal to i times h.

63
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,757
These two terms are equal to f(x_i), 

64
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:58,617
and I insist that f(x_i) is known. 

65
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:02,237
Like the previous case I drop the term in O(h^2).

66
00:04:02,237 --> 00:04:06,767
So this must be satisfied
for all i from 1 to N,

67
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,087
with the same convention

68
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:14,507
where for i = 1 the term
u_0 which is involved

69
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:20,377
is given by the
boundary conditions: u_0 = 0.

70
00:04:21,277 --> 00:04:25,020
The same for i = N,

71
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,603
I have u_N+1 also equal to 0, 

72
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:32,057
u_N+1 = 0 from the other boundary condition.

73
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:36,354
Here we now have scheme
which can be implemented. 

74
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:40,364
Solving the linear boundary value
problem led

75
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:45,064
to solving a linear system,

76
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:48,296
and now a nonlinear system must be solved.

77
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:52,869
I started from a nonlinear
differential equation

78
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:59,089
and I have a nonlinear system to solve,
which I will re-write in a more compact form,

79
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:02,679
the vector F(u) = 0.

80
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,889
Here u is the vector of unknowns, 

81
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,349
u_1, u_2 up to u_N,

82
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,999
which are approximations

83
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,189
of u(x_1), u(x_2) up to u(x_N),

84
00:05:19,531 --> 00:05:25,801
and then F(u), here I make a reference to chapter 8,

85
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:32,961
about nonlinear systems, 

86
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:39,781
so F(u) can be written as F_1(u) where u is a vector,

87
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:45,711
but the vector u has the components u_1, u_2 up to u_N,

88
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,631
this is the first line,

89
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:53,494
F_2 depends on u_1, u_2 up to u_N,

90
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:57,767
and so on up to the last equation

91
00:05:58,437 --> 00:06:02,691
F_N depending on u_1, u_2, ... u_N. 

92
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:06,383
In this particular case,

93
00:06:07,573 --> 00:06:11,443
the first equation is

94
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:17,863
(2u_1 - u_2)/h^2  + x_1 * u_1^3 - f(x_1).

95
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:26,450
Here I have (2u_1 - u_2)/h^2,

96
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,193
plus x_1 * u_1^3

97
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:34,867
minus f(x_1).

98
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:37,567
This must be equal to 0, and is my first equation. 

99
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:40,241
In the same way  I can write the second equation.

100
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:46,304
It will be - u_1 + 2_u2 - u_3

101
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:48,767
all divided by h^2,

102
00:06:49,297 --> 00:06:52,031
now this term for i=2,

103
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:57,511
x_2 times u_2^3

104
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:05,551
minus f(x_2).

105
00:07:06,788 --> 00:07:09,768
And so on until the last
line which I will write.

106
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:12,021
So for i = N,

107
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:18,566
I have -u_N + 2u_N+1

108
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,341
all divided by h^2

109
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,743
plus x_N times u_N^3

110
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:29,685
minus f(x_N) and this
equation must be equal to 0.

111
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:35,528
This is indeed a
nonlinear system of N equations,

112
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:37,008
here the N equations. 

113
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:39,338
And I also have

114
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:45,478
N unknowns, these are u_1, u_2 up to u_N.

115
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:49,368
These equations can't be solved
independently one from another,

116
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:54,078
they are linked, u_1 is linked to u_2,
and u_2 is linked to u_3 and so on. 

117
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:57,138
These relations between the variables
are nonlinear,

118
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:59,548
so we have a nonlinear system to solve. 

119
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:02,328
To solve this system of
nonlinear equations,

120
00:08:02,328 --> 00:08:06,738
we shall use Newton's method from chapter 8.
