00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:06,336
Now a quick summary of chapter 10.

2
00:00:06,336 --> 00:00:10,144
One dimension boundary value problems
with the finite difference method.

3
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:12,951
I considered the problem of the elastic rope

4
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:17,108
- u''(x) = f(x), where f is
given force,

5
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,521
and u is the displacement of the rope,

6
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,792
this for x in the interval [0,1].
The boundary conditions are

7
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,612
u (0) = 0

8
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:25,841
and u(1) = 0.

9
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,751
The rope is clamped at both ends. 

10
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,460
I presented a finite difference scheme,

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,654
which was obtained using a
centered finite difference formula

12
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,664
of the second derivative.

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,898
The scheme can be written:

14
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:45,633
(-u_i-1 +2u_i - u_i+1) / h^2 = f(x_i),

15
00:00:45,633 --> 00:00:51,551
for all points x_i uniformly
distributed on the rope. 

16
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,462
Here h is the step size which
separates two consecutive points.

17
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,883
I write the scheme as a linear system,

18
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:01,305
A u = f, with A the tridiagonal matrix

19
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:06,122
with 2 on the diagonal and -1
above and below the diagonal,

20
00:01:06,122 --> 00:01:09,649
with a coefficient 1/h^2 in front
of this tridiagonal matrix.

21
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:14,149
We have proven that the error is O(h^2),

22
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:17,143
the maximum of the error between u(x_i), 

23
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,936
which is the unknown exact solution,

24
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,261
and its approximation u_i

25
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,631
which can be calculated by computer,

26
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:25,595
this error is in O(h^2),

27
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:28,363
this means that it is divided by 4
each time h is divided by 2,

28
00:01:28,363 --> 00:01:31,655
assuming that the solution u is four times continuously differentiable.

29
00:01:32,515 --> 00:01:36,942
I then applied the same method
to a nonlinear problem

30
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:38,875
a nonlinear toy problem:

31
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,155
-u''(x) +x u(x)^3 = f(x).

32
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,216
<i>u(x)</i> au cube ici,

33
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:45,252
donc <i>xu(x)</i> au cube,

34
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,495
et j'ai appliqué la même méthode.

35
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,008
Instead of obtaining a linear system A u = f,

36
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:54,839
I have a nonlinear system:

37
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:59,495
F(u) = 0 with F and u both vectors.

38
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:05,488
We used Newton's method to
approximate the solution to this problem,

39
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,096
and this method was written as:

40
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:12,881
u_n known, I will calculate u_n+1,
which is such that

41
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:18,996
Df(u_n) multiplied by u_n minus u_n+1

42
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:25,061
equal to F(u_n).

43
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:28,804
I did not say it, but thus method is also

44
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:31,538
O(h^2).

45
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:37,105
I suggest to perform numerical experiments 
during the exercice session.
