Welcome to chapter 10:
one dimensional boundary value problems.

2
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:12,310
The topics I will
cover are the following:

3
00:00:12,326 --> 00:00:14,976
I will firstly introduce a model problem.

4
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,563
This is paragraph 10.1 in the book.

5
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,702
Then I shall talk about the
finite difference method,

6
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:24,635
which shall be used to approximate
the solution to the problem. 

7
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:28,254
I will also consider a non linear problem,

8
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,343
this is paragraph 10.6 of the book.

9
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:32,377
Please note that 

10
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:35,607
I'll will not talk about the finite elements method.
