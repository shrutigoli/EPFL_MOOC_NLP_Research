1
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:12,179
I remind you that I subdivided
this elastic rope on the interval [0,1]

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:20,399
into sub-intervals of equal length h, here.

3
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:25,983
This is the exact displacement
of the rope which is unknown,

4
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,222
here is the experiment I will do.

5
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:31,174
I will first choose three points,

6
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:36,737
I will compute the approximation
of the displacement in 3 points,

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,686
here is the approximate deformed rope,

8
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:46,005
next I will divide h by 2,

9
00:00:46,005 --> 00:00:49,675
therefore I compute everything
in 7 points instead of 3,

10
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:51,928
I cut h in half and get

11
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:59,002
the first node, second up to seventh point.

12
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:05,873
Here is the approximation of the
displacement with seven points.

13
00:01:05,873 --> 00:01:08,337
The question is the following.

14
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:12,871
Does u_i, the approximation
of u in point x_i,

15
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,871
converge to the exact solution

16
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:20,446
u in point x_i, which is unknown, as h approaches 0?

17
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:24,280
I claim this is the case,
if you look here, 

18
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:33,429
you see the error for 3 points

19
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,348
this quantity was the error,
and by dividing h by 2

20
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:40,056
the error has been divided by 4.

21
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:49,920
I claim that the error is divided by
2^2 = 4 each time h is divided by 2.

22
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:55,882
This method converges at rate O(h^2).

23
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:58,442
I give now the precise mathematical statement

24
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:00,468
of this result.

25
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,804
Theorem: 

26
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:08,750
let u be 4 times
continuously differentiable

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,977
on the interval [0,1], in other words

28
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,810
the data must be such
that this function u

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,144
is 4 times continuously differentiable.

30
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:23,580
Then there exists
a C positive such that

31
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,433
for all h,

32
00:02:28,433 --> 00:02:32,547
positive and smaller than one,

33
00:02:32,547 --> 00:02:42,389
the maximum over i=1,...N,

34
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,214
of the error u(x_i)-u_i

35
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:49,039
in absolute value

36
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,672
I claim that this error is smaller than C times h^2.

37
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:56,385
Proof of this theorem. 

38
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:02,544
Here is the numerical scheme,

39
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:07,298
le schéma c'était schéma numérique,
je vous rappelle le schéma,

40
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:13,199
-u_i-1 + 2 u_i - u_i+1 all divided by h^2,

41
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,072
moins <i>ui + 1</i>, la valeur à droite 
divisée par <i>h²</i>,

42
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,149
equal to f(x_i)

43
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:23,858
for all i from 1 up to N.

44
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:28,759
It can be written in a more
compact form A u = f

45
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:31,716
where A is the tridiagonal matrix
with 2 on the diagonal and -1 off diagonal,

46
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:38,281
f the vector containing the
values f(x_i) for i from 1 to N.

47
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:41,373
Now the exact solution,

48
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:46,358
so u(x) satisfies the following
equation,

49
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:52,098
do not mix up u(x_i) with u_i,

50
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,079
u_i is the approximation

51
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:58,399
and u(x_i) is the exact value at
node x_i which I do not know. 

52
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:12,071
So u satisfies 2 u(x_i)
minus u(x_i-1) minus u(x_i+1) divided by h^2,

53
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:22,247
all this equal to f(x_i) plus a term of order O(h^2),

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,947
I will write these relations for i from 1 to N,

55
00:04:26,947 --> 00:04:29,158
Je vais écrire ces lignes 
sous la forme suivante :

56
00:04:29,158 --> 00:04:34,404
I write A w = f + ,

57
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:40,956
where w is the vector containing the
exact solution at nodes x_i,

58
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:49,667
so u(x_1), u(x_2) up to u(x_N), 

59
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:56,129
with the remainder is a vector

60
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:02,170
with components r_1, r_2 and so on up to r_N.

61
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:05,575
From chapter 2,

62
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:13,850
I have proven that r_i was
bounded by a constant time h^2,

63
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,855
if you go back to the proof

64
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:18,673
of the finite difference formula
for the second derivative,

65
00:05:18,673 --> 00:05:23,105
you can see that this remainder is

66
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:32,190
one twelfth of the maximum of the fourth derivative of x,

67
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,240
taken in absolute value over the interval [0,1].

68
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:41,872
So A u = f,

69
00:05:41,872 --> 00:05:45,895
and A w = f +r with w containing the
exact values at nodes x_1, x_2 up to x_N,

70
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,802
and r the errors which are bounded by h^2.

71
00:05:50,802 --> 00:05:53,439
By substracting these two lines,

72
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:04,090
I get A(w-u) = f+r-f, that is r.

73
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:10,718
This is the equation for the
vector containing the errors,

74
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:15,553
that is u (x_1) - u_1 and u(x_2) - u_2 and so on. 

75
00:06:16,286 --> 00:06:20,295
Now I state a lemma which
will allow me to conclude,

76
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,216
a linear algebra lemma
given without proof.

77
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:32,033
Let g be any vector of R^N,

78
00:06:32,805 --> 00:06:41,478
and let v such that A v = g, 

79
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:44,576
the matrix A being

80
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,365
1/h^2 times the matrix
with 2 on the diagonal and 

81
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,984
-1 above and below the diagonal.

82
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:55,254
So let g be a vector and v such that A v = g.

83
00:06:55,254 --> 00:07:03,788
Then the maximum of the absolute value of
the component v_i

84
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:09,585
is less than

85
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:13,553
the maximum of the absolute value
of the components g_i

86
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:21,564
times one over eight,

87
00:07:21,564 --> 00:07:24,683
g_i being the components of vector g.

88
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,883
Thanks to this lemma, I can now conclude.

89
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,901
I remind you that I have A(w-u) = r, 

90
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:35,213
so I apply this Lemma with g = r,

91
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:40,512
where r is the remainder coming from
the Taylor expansion

92
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:46,853
and v is w-u.

93
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:53,557
<i>x1</i><i>xN</i> - <i>u</i> qui est le vecteur 
qui contient l'approximation <i>u1 u2 uN</i>

94
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:59,141
I apply this result here,

95
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:07,201
and I have that the maximum
for all i from 1 to N,

96
00:08:07,201 --> 00:08:15,669
here v_i = u(x_i) - u_i,

97
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:24,612
u(x_i) is the exact deformation

98
00:08:24,612 --> 00:08:28,019
of the rope which I do not know,
and u_i its approximation

99
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:31,866
obtained
by solving the linear system A u = f.

100
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:37,525
The maximum of this error is,

101
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:40,282
thanks to this inequality, 

102
00:08:40,282 --> 00:08:51,283
upper bounded by one over eight times
the maximum of the components

103
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,947
of the vector r.

104
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,734
Since the r_i are
smaller than C times h^2

105
00:08:59,734 --> 00:09:04,900
here C is one twelfth times the maximum
of the fourth derivatives of u,

106
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,424
I finally obtain that the error is bounded
by one over 8 times 12,

107
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:20,779
times the maximum of
the fourth derivative of u (in abs. val.)

108
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:29,184
evaluated on the interval [0,1] times h^2. 

109
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:36,179
I have thus completed the proof
of the theorem.

110
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,630
The maximum of the error is
upper bounded by C times h^2,

111
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,479
here is C,

112
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:46,679
it depends on the fourth
derivative of u but not on h,

113
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,716
as stated in the theorem.

114
00:09:48,716 --> 00:09:51,651
This theorem says that if u is four
times continuously differentiable, 

115
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:56,372
then there exists a C such that for all h,
the error is smaller than C times h^2.

116
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:58,504
I have therefore proven this theorem.
