00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:02,747
The problem we want to solve
is the following:

2
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:09,747
for a given function f defined
on the interval [a,b],

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:15,449
we want to numerically approximate 

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,859
the integral between a
and b of f(x) dx.

5
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,409
If a draw a figure, given the x axis
and the interval [a,b],

6
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,765
the graph of the function f,

7
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,018
and I am searching for the area
between the x axis 

8
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:44,518
and the curve f.

9
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,730
Firstly I divide the interval [a,b]
into sub-intervals

10
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:55,940
of equal length. 

11
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,880
Here I have the first point,
which I name x0,

12
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,910
the last point is xn and between them
you have the points x1, x2 and so on

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,800
and in the middle you have the
nodes x_i followed by x_i+1.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,920
All these points are separated by a
parameter, a distance which I will name h. 

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,860
So we have N the number of
sub-intervals

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,930
which should be large,

17
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:25,082
h the distance between two
consecutive points 

18
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:27,962
equal to (b-a)/N which should be small

19
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:32,982
and the nodes x_i equal to
a plus i times h

20
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:38,412
for i between 0 up to N.

21
00:01:39,352 --> 00:01:43,912
Hence the integral between a and b
of f(x) dx

22
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:50,274
is nothing but the sum over all the
sub-intervals from 0 to N-1,

23
00:01:51,764 --> 00:01:58,334
of the integrals between
x_i and x_i+1 of f(x) dx.

24
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,114
Now I will do a change of variable

25
00:02:01,144 --> 00:02:07,154
which will take me from
[x_i,x_i+1] to [-1,1]

26
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,954
and the variable is now t.

27
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:14,115
Hence I decide that

28
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:24,632
x is equal to xi + h times t+1
divided by 2,

29
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:32,601
such that when t is equal
to -1, well x = x_i

30
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:43,274
and when t is equal to 1 well 
x = xi + h, also equal to x_i+1.

31
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:48,138
Of course we have that dx is
equal to h over 2 times dt

32
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:56,218
therefore the integral between a and 
of f(x) dx is equal to

33
00:02:56,218 --> 00:03:02,828
the sum for i between 0 and N-1 of
h divided by 2, which can be moved

34
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:12,582
outside of the sum and we now have the
integral between -1 and 1 evaluated in

35
00:03:13,746 --> 00:03:17,076
[xi+h (t+1)/2] dt. So now we have
the following problem

36
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,736
which involves integrals
on [-1,1].

37
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:26,292
The problem to be addressed
is now the following.

38
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:34,645
Given a function g defined now on [-1,1]
which is continuous,

39
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:46,910
I seek to numerically approximate the 
integral between [-1,1] of g(t) dt.
