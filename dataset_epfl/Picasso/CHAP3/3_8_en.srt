1
00:00:00,738 --> 00:00:03,338
It now remains to discuss about
the choice of the quadrature nodes.

2
00:00:03,338 --> 00:00:06,936
This will bring me to the definition
of the Gauss quadrature formula.

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,784
Consider a quadrature formula,

4
00:00:10,784 --> 00:00:12,860
 

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,151
which I write as J(g), so the sum
for i from 1 to M

6
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:28,530
of the weights omega_j times g
evaluated in t_j,

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,413
this to numerically approximate
the integral over -1 to 1 of g( t ) dt.

8
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:43,588
Once the nodes are chosen, 
the weights are given by theorem 3.2,

9
00:00:43,588 --> 00:00:46,757
omega_j is the integral 
from -1 to 1 of phi_j( t ) dt,

10
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:49,130
the functions phi_1,phi_2 up to phi_M

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,204
being the Lagrange basis of P_M-1

12
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:55,308
associated to the nodes
t_1,t_2,...,t_M.

13
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:58,312
donc <i>j</i> allant de 1 jusqu'Ã  <i>M</i>.

14
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,852
From theorem 3.2, I know 

15
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:06,167
that the quadrature rule
built this way

16
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:10,402
is exact for polynomials
of degree less or equal M-1.

17
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:15,611
Therefore the integral from -1 to 1
of p( t ) dt is equal to J(p)

18
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:19,875
for all polynomial p of order M-1.

19
00:01:21,205 --> 00:01:23,632
The question is:

20
00:01:23,632 --> 00:01:28,453
Is there a good choice of

21
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:40,914
the quadrature nodes t_1 up to t_M,

22
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:42,937
a choice better than others?

23
00:01:43,457 --> 00:01:47,710
The answer is yes! This choice corresponds
to the Gauss quadrature formula.

24
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,479
So, in the case M equal to 2,

25
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,799
I could choose as quadrature nodes

26
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:55,831
those of the trapezoidal formula, 


27
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,470
t_1 equal to -1 and t_2 = 1.

28
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:03,201
Now I will choose t_1 equal to -1 / sqrt(3)
and t_2 equal to 1 / sqrt(3).

29
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:11,499
I calculate the weights omega_1 and omega_2
using theorem 3.2,

30
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:15,395
and I get omega_1 equal to 1 and 
omega_2 equal to 1 as well. 

31
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,503
Now the quadrature formula is

32
00:02:17,503 --> 00:02:22,004
J(g) equal to g( -1/sqrt(3) )

33
00:02:22,654 --> 00:02:25,465
plus g( 1/sqrt(3) ).

34
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,827
By construction,
this formula is exact

35
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:31,466
for polynomials of degree 1.

36
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,956
Therefore the integral from -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt

37
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:41,961
is equal to J(p) for all polynomial
of degree 1, 

38
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,149
this being a consequence
of theorem 3.2.

39
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,228
in fact, it is even better then this.

40
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,960
Indeed, this can be seen from this figure,

41
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,788
where t varies from -1 to 1.

42
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:59,139
Let us choose a polynomial of degree 2.

43
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:04,293
I immediately see that by using 
the trapezoidal rule

44
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,627
I commit a certain error.

45
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,834
If I consider a polynomial of degree 2,

46
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,527
I do not have

47
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:14,499
J(p) equal to the integral
over -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt

48
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,362
for the trapezoidal rule. 

49
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,350
On the other hand, by using this
formula here things are much better,

50
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,087
why?

51
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:26,313
Since my quadrature nodes are
-1 / sqrt( 3 ) and 1 / sqrt( 3 ),

52
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:30,315
more or less -0.577 and 0.577,

53
00:03:30,735 --> 00:03:35,325
and reporting on the figure,

54
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:41,451
I observe that the
error committed here

55
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:44,620
is compensated by this error here.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,833
In fact, in this case the
integral between -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt

57
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:56,285
is equal to J(p) 

58
00:03:57,755 --> 00:04:01,547
for all polynomials of degree 2. 

59
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:04,750
It happens that things are even better,

60
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,427
this is also true for polynomials of
degree 3 by symmetry reasons. 

61
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:12,038
So the integral over -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt

62
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:19,080
is equal to J(p) for all polynomial
p of degree 3. 

63
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,658
And now, by considering the difference

64
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:29,317
between the integral between 
a and b of f(x) dx

65
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:34,423
and the corresponding L_h( f ) formula,

66
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,983
I don't have an error of order h to the
power 2 as in the trapezoidal rule,

67
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,405
but I obtain an error of order
h to the power 4.

68
00:04:41,405 --> 00:04:45,355
Of course assuming that f is
4 times differentiable on [a,b].

69
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:47,668
Now what is the L_h(f) formula?

70
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:51,969
I have not explicitly given
the formula for L_h(f),

71
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:54,950
here is the corresponding formula:

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,349
it is h / 2 times the sum over
each sub-interval, over i from 0 to N-1,

73
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:05,664
and one must evaluate the function f

74
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:07,729
in x_i + h times (t_1 + 1) over 2,

75
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,717
with t_1 equal to -1 / sqrt( 3 );

76
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:20,898
next f evaluated in 
x_i + h times (t_2 + 1) over 2

77
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:24,789
with t_2 equal to 1 / sqrt (3).

78
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:28,872
 

79
00:05:29,552 --> 00:05:31,746
All this can be generalized

80
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,628
for any M.

81
00:05:36,348 --> 00:05:40,107
For t_1, t_2 up to t_M

82
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,250
being the zeros

83
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,771
of the polynomials

84
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:49,091
of Gauss - Legendre,

85
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:56,814
there is exactly
M zeros on the interval [-1,1]

86
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:02,117
of the Gauss - Legendre polynomials
of degree M to be defined,

87
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:07,894
I get the general result, that is

88
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:12,967
the quadrature formula is exact for
polynomials of degree 2M-1,

89
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:16,985
well the integral from -1 to 1 of
p( t ) dt equal to J( p )

90
00:06:18,055 --> 00:06:22,816
for any polynomial p of degree 2M-1.

91
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:27,248
For example for M = 2, the quadrature
formula is exact for a polynomial of degree 3.

92
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,939
Now, the error I commit

93
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,103
between the integral over a and b of f(x) dx

94
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:41,298
minus L_h( f ), the corresponding
approximation formula,

95
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:44,850
this error is of order
h t the power 2M

96
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,578
if the function f 
is 2M times differentiable

97
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:52,904
on the interval [a,b].

98
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:56,193
In fact, compared to a conventional
quadrature formula

99
00:06:56,193 --> 00:07:00,411
we double the order of convergence,

100
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:06,058
so for example for the
trapezoidal rule we have order 2

101
00:07:06,428 --> 00:07:10,260
but here for the Gauss formula
with 2 nodes we have order 4

102
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,285
only by choosing these magical nodes

103
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:17,445
t_1, t_2 equal to -1 / sqrt(3) and 1 / sqrt(3).
