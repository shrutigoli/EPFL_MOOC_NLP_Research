1
00:00:01,304 --> 00:00:03,246
We are trying to solve 
the following problem:

2
00:00:03,676 --> 00:00:08,500
given a continuous
function g on the inteval  [-1,1]

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,787
we wish to numerically approximate

4
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:19,290
the integral between -1 and 1 
of g(t) dt.

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,409
The variable t varies
between -1 and 1,

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,205
here is the graph of g(t),

7
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:32,532
this is the integral we are trying 
to approximate.

8
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,602
We will now define what a 
quadrature formula is,

9
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:39,853
quadrature formula

10
00:00:44,473 --> 00:00:46,394
to numerically approximate

11
00:00:46,394 --> 00:00:48,621
the integral between -1 and 1
of g(t) dt.

12
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:51,190
We define an integer M,

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:01:00,663
in general M has value 1,2 or 3, 
occasionally 4 or 5

14
00:01:00,663 --> 00:01:03,064
but rarly more. 

15
00:01:03,244 --> 00:01:07,605
We define quadrature nodes,

16
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,384
values t1 strictly smaller then t2

17
00:01:11,844 --> 00:01:14,542
and so on up to t_M

18
00:01:15,522 --> 00:01:18,411
which are in
the interval [-1,1].

19
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,598
Here is a the quadrature node t2.

20
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:29,715
 

21
00:01:30,095 --> 00:01:35,965
The idea is to evaluate the function g
at these points t_1, t_2, t_M.

22
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:40,689
We shall also define the weights, 
named omega_1, omega_2

23
00:01:42,089 --> 00:01:43,472
and so on until omega_M,

24
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:45,536
which we call quadrature weights.

25
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:51,791
We want to approximate the integral
between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt

26
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:55,021
by a quadrature rule,
which is obtained by

27
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:58,824
evaluating the function g in the node t1

28
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,160
the function g in t_2

29
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,818
and so on until evaluating g in t_M.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:10,244
Again g in t_2, g in t_3
up to g in t_M.

31
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:13,149
Then you multiply these values

32
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:19,234
by the weights omega_1, omega_2
until omega_M.

33
00:02:19,234 --> 00:02:24,781
This will be the approximation of the integral
between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt. 

34
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:30,123
For example one can use the midpoint
rule (also called rectangle rule)

35
00:02:32,073 --> 00:02:33,793
which consists in the following:

36
00:02:33,793 --> 00:02:37,510
for a function g

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,836
which you want  to integrate
over the interval -1 and 1

38
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,270
and you can decide

39
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,353
to take only one single point.

40
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:51,412
So, choosing one single point

41
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:55,428
M = 1, then the point is t1=0,

42
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:57,048
the middle of [-1,1].

43
00:02:57,518 --> 00:03:02,482
Hence I will approximate the
integral on [-1,1] of g(t) dt

44
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:06,146
by the area of the
corresponding rectangle. 

45
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:12,050
Since the rectangle has
width 2

46
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,252
and height g(0),

47
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:20,945
the area will be 2 times g(0).

48
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:25,998
This defines J(g) for the
midpoint rule,

49
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,732
again J(g) = 2 g(0).

50
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,849
Another example is the trapezoidal
quadrature rule. 

51
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,640
In this case I will consider two
quadrature nodes.

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,593
By choosing two
quadrature nodes,

53
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:42,686
here the variable t in the
interval [-1,1],

54
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:47,891
I am trying to numerically approximate
the integral over -1 and 1 of g(t) dt.

55
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:55,195
I will choose for both quadrature
nodes: t1 = -1 and t2= 1,

56
00:03:55,595 --> 00:03:58,389
now I can approximate the area
of the trapeze 

57
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,928
which is hashed here. 

58
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:08,262
So for M = 2, t1 = -1 and 
t2 = 1.

59
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,992
The area of the trapeze is

60
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:15,007
given by g(-1) plus g(1),

61
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:19,593
which is the area of this rectangle,

62
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:23,162
plus the area of the triangle
above the rectangle. 

63
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:27,047
VoilÃ .

64
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:32,491
Returning to the initial problem:

65
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:41,458
I remind you that we we want to compute the
integral over [a,b] of f(x) dx,

66
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:48,043
the notations are:

67
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:51,057
the variable x is in the interval [a,b]

68
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:56,984
and we are trying to approximate numerically
the integral of the function f between a and b.

69
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,751
Here is the graph of the function f

70
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:02,261
and we divide the interval [a,b]
into sub-intevals.

71
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,803
Therefore the integral is
equal to h/2

72
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:10,235
times the sum for 0 to M-1

73
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:16,275
of the integrals between -1 and 1

74
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:22,135
of f(x_i +h (t+1) / 2) dt.

75
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:24,327
This was the result we
reached previously,

76
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:27,437
and here are the nodes
x_0,x_1 up to x_N.

77
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:31,381
The idea is to use 

78
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:33,465
this quadrature formula

79
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:36,520
to approximate the function g,

80
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,291
defined on each interval,

81
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:43,512
by g(t)= f(xi + h(t+1) / 2)

82
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:46,983
and we then have the
following numerical approximation:

83
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,312
for h divided by 2,

84
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:54,471
we have the sum over
all the intervals xi,

85
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,282
all of these intervals here,

86
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,352
first, second,third, fourth,

87
00:06:01,142 --> 00:06:05,262
and now you have the sum

88
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:10,074
omega_1 times g( t_1 ), omega_2
times g( t_2 ) and so on until

89
00:06:10,434 --> 00:06:16,420
omega_M times g( t_M ), which we can
write as the sum for j from 1 to M

90
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,682
of omega_j, which can
be found here,

91
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,687
omega_1, omega_2, etc,

92
00:06:23,237 --> 00:06:28,933
times the function f here,
evaluated at t_j.

93
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,398
Therefore you now have

94
00:06:31,398 --> 00:06:37,603
f(xi + h ( tj+1 )/2).

95
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:42,719
So here is the approximation
of this integral.

96
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,854
I obtain this approximation here

97
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,460
I have used this quadrature formula

98
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,663
defined here.

99
00:06:52,873 --> 00:06:56,933
This quantity here, which I will
denote L_h(f)

100
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:00,902
is the approximation

101
00:07:00,902 --> 00:07:04,510
of the integral between a and b
of f(x) dx,

102
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,059
by using this quadrature rule,

103
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,365
defined by a certain
number of nodes

104
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:10,812
and weights.

105
00:07:11,092 --> 00:07:13,683
Now the obvious questions that
arise are the following,

106
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:20,950
there are at least two:

107
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,720
how do I choose the 
quadrature nodes

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,218
t_1, t_2 and so on until t_M

109
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:39,760
with their respective weights,

110
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:41,964
and the second question is

111
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:46,480
what error am I making

112
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,129
when I approximate the integral
between a and b of f(x) dx,

113
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:59,766
using this new quantity that
I have defined

114
00:07:59,766 --> 00:08:02,424
to approximate this integral, namely L_h ( f ).
