1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:03,997
The Simpson quadrature rule
is a formula with three points.

2
00:00:03,997 --> 00:00:08,687
Remeber that we want to approach

3
00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:10,597
 

4
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:14,387
the integral of the function g

5
00:00:14,387 --> 00:00:15,807
on the interval [-1,1].

6
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,897
Here we use three nodes, thus M=3 and

7
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,347
t_1 the first node is -1,

8
00:00:20,347 --> 00:00:22,987
the second node t_2 = 0

9
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:26,987
and the last one t_3 is equal to 1.

10
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:34,573
So J(g), the quadrature formula,
is omega_1 times g(-1) plus

11
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:41,743
omega_2 times g(0) plus
omega_3 times g(1).

12
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:50,123
I am using theorem 3.2, thus
the weights omega_j

13
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:56,123
are equal to the integral between
-1 and 1 of phi_j( t ) dt,

14
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,583
here j is equal to 1, 2 and 3.

15
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:04,743
Remember that

16
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:09,503
phi_1, phi_2 and phi_3 are the
Lagrange basis of polynomials of degree 2

17
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,273
associated to the nodes t_1, t_2 and t_3. 

18
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:20,923
So phi_1( t ) is the polynomial of
degree 2 which cancels in t_2 and t_3,

19
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,083
and is worth 1 in t_1.

20
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:29,983
Here I divide by t_1 minus t_2 and 
t_1 minus t_3.

21
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:40,643
Therefore phi_1(t) is t times t-1
divided by 1 minus 0

22
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:44,643
times -1 plus  -1,

23
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:49,273
thus phi_1(t) is equal to t times (t-1)
divided by 2,

24
00:01:50,274 --> 00:01:56,264
and I must integrate this function
over the interval [-1, 1].

25
00:01:58,117 --> 00:02:03,997
We must Integrate between -1 and 1,
t squared minus t over 2.

26
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:10,543
Since the function t is odd,

27
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:12,033
the integral over -1 and 1 of the t is 0.

28
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:20,073
This leaves t squared over 2 dt to
integrate between -1 and 1,

29
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,413
and we get one third. 

30
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:28,258
So omega_1 is worth 1 / 3.

31
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:33,257
By symmetry, omega_3 is 
also equal to 1 / 3. 

32
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:34,867
You can check this by yourself.

33
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:38,867
Now by using the fact that the sum
of all the weights is equal to 2,

34
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,297
this is the length of the interval [-1,1],

35
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:45,107
we can deduce that

36
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:45,967
phi_2 is equal to 4 / 3.

37
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:55,521
Thus, the quadrature formula
J(g) is equal to

38
00:02:55,521 --> 00:03:04,241
1 / 3 times g( -1) plus 4 / 3 times g(  )
plus 1 / 3 times g(1).

39
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:09,407
The formula L_h( f ) to approximate
numerically the integral between [a,b]

40
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:15,547
of f(x) dx is now worth h divided by
2 times 3 over 6

41
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:19,737
times the sum over all
the sub-intervals, i from 0 to N-1,

42
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:27,767
of f( x_i ) plus 4 times

43
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:35,037
f( x_i + h / 2 ), plus f( x_i+1 ).

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,740
The quadrature formula I have used is
exact for polynomials of

45
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,370
degree 2,

46
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,620
I know this from
theorem 3.2,

47
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,620
the quadrature
formula is exact for polynomials

48
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,110
of degree 2,

49
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:59,480
in other words the integral over -1 to 1 of p(t) dt
is equal to J(p),

50
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,990
where J(p) is 1 / 3 p( -1 )

51
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,720
plus 4 / 3 times p( 0 ) plus
1 / 3  times p( 1 ),

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,650
for all polynomials of degree 2,

53
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,650
again, this is true from theorem 3.2.

54
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:21,022
I have three nodes t_1, t_2, t_3
and the formula is exact

55
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:22,962
for polynomials of degree 2.

56
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,252
Now could this quadrature formula

57
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:29,252
be exact for polynomials of degree 3?

58
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,110
I already know that the quadrature formula
is exact for polynomials of degree 2,

59
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,450
thus, to check whether it is also exact for
polynomials of degree 3,

60
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,290
it is sufficient to try with p( t )
equal to t to the power 3.

61
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,190
So I calculate the integral
over -1 and 1 of t to the power 3,

62
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,470
since

63
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,230
t to the power 3 is an odd function,
and by integrating over -1 to 1

64
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,290
I get 0,

65
00:04:54,913 --> 00:05:01,593
and J(p) with p(t) equal to
p to the power 3,

66
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,603
J(p) is equal to

67
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:14,343
 1 / 3 times -1 power 3 plus 
4 / 3 times 0 power 3 

68
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:17,953
plus 1 / 3 times 1 to the
power 3,

69
00:05:17,953 --> 00:05:20,553
and I get also 0. 

70
00:05:21,077 --> 00:05:23,807
So this quadrature formula is exact

71
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:26,547
 

72
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:31,217
for all polynomials of degree 3.

73
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:35,217
Now I could try with p( t ) equal to 
t to the power 4

74
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:37,737
and could check that
the quadrature formula is not exact

75
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,907
for polynomials of degree 4. 

76
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:43,074
Therefore, the formula is exact
for polynomials of degree 3, not more.

77
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:46,654
It is exact for polynomials of degree 2,
by construction,

78
00:05:46,654 --> 00:05:53,654
since I used the formula
of theorem 3.2,

79
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:56,214
and it happens that,
from symmetry reasons,

80
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,404
it is also exact for polynomials of degree 3.

81
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:04,485
now I can apply theorem 3.1

82
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:13,155
which tells me the following:
if the function f is four times

83
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:20,495
differentiable on [a,b], well the error
between the integral between a and b

84
00:06:20,495 --> 00:06:24,495
of f(x) dx and the
approximation L_h( f ), 

85
00:06:24,495 --> 00:06:28,305
which is here,

86
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,885
well this error is of order h
top the power 4.

87
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:37,775
This means that the error is divided by
2 to the power 4,

88
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:39,675
i.e. 16,

89
00:06:39,675 --> 00:06:42,728
each time h is divided by 2.
