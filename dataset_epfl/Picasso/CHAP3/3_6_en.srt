1
00:00:00,766 --> 00:00:03,806
Let us now consider the calculation

2
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:05,926
of the quadrature weights.

3
00:00:05,926 --> 00:00:18,146
Let J(g) be the sum over from 1 to M
of omega_j times g( t_j )

4
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,586
be a quadrature formula.

5
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:36,418
such a quadrature formula is used to
numerically approximate the integral

6
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:37,618
between -1 and 1 of g( t ) dt.

7
00:00:37,618 --> 00:00:40,488
Choosing a quadrature formula
comes down to specifying

8
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:44,968
integration nodes t_1, t_2,...,t_M,

9
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,788
 

10
00:00:47,788 --> 00:00:51,188
and quadrature weights
omega_1, omega_2,...,omega_M.

11
00:00:51,188 --> 00:00:55,378
By doing the linear combination
of these values

12
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,378
I seek to approximate the integral
between -1 and 1 of g( t ) dt.

13
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:03,144
The question is now the following:

14
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:13,114
given the nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M,
how to calculate the weights

15
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:17,114
omega_1, omega_2 up to omega_M?

16
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,214
The idea is the following.

17
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:24,214
 

18
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:32,636
Let p a polynomial of degree
lower or equal to m-1.

19
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:40,236
From chapter one: interpolation,

20
00:01:40,236 --> 00:01:45,746
I claim that p( t ) can be written as
a linear combination of 

21
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:54,256
the functions phi_1( t ),
phi_2( t ) up to phi_M( t )

22
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,636
where phi_1, phi_2 and
so on up to phi_M

23
00:01:56,636 --> 00:02:00,966
is the Lagrange basis of polynomials

24
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:11,866
of degree smaller or equal to M-1

25
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,736
associated to the 

26
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:21,306
quadrature nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M.

27
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:25,306
jusqu'Ã  tm.

28
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:29,006
Thus p( t ) is a 
linear combination

29
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,996
of the functions phi_1, phi_2 and
do on up to phi_M

30
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:34,916
with phi_1, phi_2 up to phi_M
the Lagrange basis

31
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:37,956
associated to the
nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M. 

32
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:43,196
I recall, for example that phi_1( t )
was the polynomial

33
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:53,526
of degree M-1 which is worth 0
in the nodes t_2, t_3 up to t_M,

34
00:02:53,526 --> 00:02:55,576
and is worth 1 in t_1.

35
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,746
Hence I divide by (t_1-t_2)

36
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:03,816
(t_1-t_3) ...(t_1-t_M),

37
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:07,816
this polynomial phi_1 (t) is indeed
a polynomial of degree M-1,

38
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:12,786
it is the product of monomials,
M-1 monomials in total

39
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:16,586
and it is a polynomial equal to 0
in the points t_2, t_3 .. t_M

40
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:20,276
and equal to 1 in t_1. 

41
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:31,715
Sine we have proven that
these functions form a basis

42
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:34,855
of polynomials of degree M-1,

43
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:38,065
thus I can write any polynomial 
of degree M-1

44
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:40,425
as a linear combination
of these basis functions.

45
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:44,685
Moreover, the
coefficients of the linear combination

46
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:54,185
are given by p( t_1 ), p( t_2 ) 
up to p( t_M ).

47
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:59,025
 

48
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:00,655
de p de t.

49
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:04,346
Now if we use this representation
formula of p(t) and

50
00:04:04,346 --> 00:04:08,986
integrate between -1 and 1
on both sides

51
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:10,666
we obtain the following:

52
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:21,296
the integral between -1 and 1
of p( t ) dt is equal to

53
00:04:21,296 --> 00:04:26,406
the sum over j=1 to M

54
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,826
 

55
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:37,756
of p( t_j ) times

56
00:04:37,756 --> 00:04:45,496
the integral between -1 and 1 
of phi_j( t ) dt.

57
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:53,120
Let us denote omega_j this quantity,
I have obtained a quadrature formula

58
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,980
and this formula is exact for
polynomials of degree M-1.

59
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:10,445
If omega_j is equal to the integral
over -1 and 1 of phi_j( t ) dt,

60
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:13,425
I have built a quadrature formula
such that

61
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:19,365
the integral over -1 to 1 of
p( t ) is equal to J(p)

62
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:21,845
for all polynomial p of degree M-1.

63
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,975
I have therefore built a quadrature
formula which is excat

64
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,175
for polynomials of degree M-1. 

65
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:29,845
I can now state a theorem which allows us

66
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:34,275
to compute the weights given the nodes
of a quadrature formula.

67
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:36,645
Theorem 3.2 of the book.

68
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:43,723
Let J(.) be a quadrature formula

69
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:47,583
that is a positive integer M,

70
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:51,813
t_1, t_2 up to t_M some quadrature nodes,

71
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:56,903
omega_1, omega_2 up to omega_M
the weights,

72
00:05:56,903 --> 00:06:01,963
thus J(g) is equal to

73
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:09,833
the sum over j from 1 to M of
g( t_j ) times omega_j,

74
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:16,303
J(g) being here to numerically approximate
the integral over -1 and 1

75
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:17,933
of g( t ) dt. 

76
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:24,927
I state the following: the 
quadrature formula is exact

77
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:27,287
for all polynomials of degree M-1,

78
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:29,717
that is ti say the integral
between -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt,

79
00:06:29,717 --> 00:06:32,627
Ihere p is any polynomial of degree M-1,

80
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:37,437
the integral over -1 to 1 of p( t )dt
is equal to J(p)

81
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:41,267
for all p, polynomial of degree M-1

82
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:51,367
if and only if the weights omega_j
are equal to

83
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,637
the integral between -1 and 1
of phi_j( t ) dt,

84
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:57,777
for all j from 1 to M.

85
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:03,707
Here the functions phi_j( t ) are the
basis function of P_M

86
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:07,707
associated to the nodes
t_1, t_2,...,t_M.

87
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:14,579
We now have a formula
for the weights.

88
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:17,339
Donc, qu'est-ce qu'on va faire
maintenant ?

89
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:19,519
The interpretation of theorem 3.2
is the following.

90
00:07:22,297 --> 00:07:30,337
We choose quadrature nodes t_1, t_2
up to t_M in the interval -1 to 1,

91
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:37,997
We compute the weights omega_j:
integratal from -1 to 1 of

92
00:07:37,997 --> 00:07:43,427
phi_j( t ) dt for j from 1 to M.

93
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:51,589
Let us go back to theorem 3.1.

94
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:57,489
I claim that the integral
between a and b of f(x) dx

95
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:01,789
minus the corresponding 
approximation L_h( f ),

96
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:06,579
well this error is of order h to 
the power M,

97
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:11,919
iprovided f is M times differentiable

98
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,539
in the interval [a,b].

99
00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:17,629
This means that the error

100
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:26,149
is divided by 2 to the power M
each time h is divided by two.

101
00:08:30,642 --> 00:08:34,642
Now we will build, thanks to
this formula of the weights

102
00:08:34,642 --> 00:08:37,622
the Simpson quadrature rule
using three points.

103
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:40,182
Then we shall ask ourselves:

104
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:45,282
Does there exist a good choice of the 
quadrature nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M?

105
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,992
First, the Simpson quadrature rule.
