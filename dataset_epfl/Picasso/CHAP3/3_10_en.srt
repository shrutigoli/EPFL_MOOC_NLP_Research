1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,378
Now lets give a summary
of chapter 3, probably

2
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:06,708
the hardest one in this course.

3
00:00:06,708 --> 00:00:11,878
So, we want to approximate
numerically, for a function f

4
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:16,448
defined on the interval [a,b] in R and
continuous on that interval,

5
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:22,718
we seek to approximate numerically the
integral between a and b of f(x) dx.

6
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:25,928
So how do we do this?

7
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:31,268
We divide the interval [a,b] into
sub-intervals x_i to x_i+1

8
00:00:31,268 --> 00:00:36,348
and we have proven that the integral
between a and b of f(x) dx can be written

9
00:00:36,348 --> 00:00:44,228
as a sum: h / 2 with h equal to b
minus a over N;

10
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:48,228
it is a sum over each sub-interval,
for i from 0 to N-1;

11
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:53,138
with the integral over -1 to 1.

12
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:56,808
We have done a change of variable
to have the integral over -1 to 1.

13
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:04,788
The function f evaluated in
x_i plus h times (t+1) dt.

14
00:01:05,364 --> 00:01:11,814
Next we give ourselves 
the quadrature formula J(g)

15
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:14,664
to numerically approximate
the integral over -1 and 1

16
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:17,504
of a function g( t ) dt.

17
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:29,469
Then J(g) is omega_1 times g(t_1) plus
omega_2 times g(t_2) up to omega_M times g(t_M).

18
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:32,149
When I give myself a quadrature rule,

19
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:36,050
this means that the nodes
t_1, t_2 up to t_M

20
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,050
and the corresponding weights omega_1,
omega_2 up to omega_M are prescribed.

21
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:47,039
This quadrature formula is
to numerically approximate

22
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,589
the integral between -1 and 1 of g( t ) dt.

23
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,025
  

24
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:58,875
By applying the quadrature formula
to this function, we have an approximation,

25
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:05,195
denoted as L_h( f ),
which was equal to h over 2

26
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:09,355
times the sum over all the intervals,
for i from 0 to N-1,

27
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:15,185
of the sum over all the nodes times weights,
for j from 1 to M,

28
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:23,035
the weights omega_j times the function f
evaluated in x_i + h times (t_j + 1) divided by 2.

29
00:02:25,822 --> 00:02:31,952
Next we stated a theorem, 
theorem 3.1, 

30
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,342
which is the following:

31
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:41,002
if the quadrature formula is exact
for polynomials of degree r,

32
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:43,422
thus suppose that
the quadrature formula is exact

33
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,432
for polynomials of degree r,

34
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:50,562
that is the integral over -1 to 1
of p( t ) dt equal to J(p),

35
00:02:50,562 --> 00:03:02,752
equals the sum of the omega_j times
p(t_j) for all polynomial p of degree r,

36
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:10,406
then the error I commit
when I approximate the integral

37
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:15,056
between a and b of f(x) dx
by the formula L_h( f ),

38
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:21,416
then the error is of order h to the
power r+1 assuming that the function f

39
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:25,526
is sufficiently smooth, that is
r+1 continuously differentiable

40
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:27,506
in the interval [a,b]. 

41
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:31,779
Next, theorem 3.2 states the following:

42
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:34,919
that is if the nodes are given,

43
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,839
say t_1, t_2 up to t_M on the interval [-1 ,1]

44
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,949
are given,

45
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,287
we can then build the functions

46
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:50,967
phi_1, phi_2 up to phi_M which are
the Lagrange basis functions

47
00:03:50,967 --> 00:04:03,517
of the polynomial p of degree M-1
associated to the nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M.

48
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:11,387
The weights omega_j are then
computed from the following formula

49
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:17,427
omega_j equal to the
integral over -1 to 1 of phi_j( t ) dt,

50
00:04:17,797 --> 00:04:20,997
for all j from 1 to M.

51
00:04:21,578 --> 00:04:26,688
In this case I state that the
quadrature formula is exact

52
00:04:26,688 --> 00:04:31,898
for all polynomials of degree M-1.

53
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:38,796
If the function f is smooth enough,

54
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:43,106
the error I commit with this formula here is 

55
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:49,726
an error of order h to the power M, 

56
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,346
this is true if f is M times continuously
differentiable on the interval [a,b].

57
00:04:53,606 --> 00:05:01,666
Now it happens that there exists a smart
choice of the nodes t_1, t_2 up to t_M.

58
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:12,986
If t_1, t_2 up to t_M are the zeros
of the Gauss-Legendre polynomial,

59
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:22,228
this can be considered as a
good choice, since 

60
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:33,098
the quadrature formula is exact
for polynomials of degree 2M-1,

61
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,338
instead of M-1.

62
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:39,538
We shift from M-1 to 2M-1 just by
choosing adequately the nodes.

63
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:44,288
Then the error,

64
00:05:44,288 --> 00:05:51,038
the integral from a to b
of f(x) dx minus L_h( f ),

65
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:53,488
L_h(f) which is defined here,

66
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:58,878
the error is of
order h to the power 2M,

67
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:04,358
provided f is 2M times continuously differentiable

68
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:06,478
on the interval [a,b].

69
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:11,894
For instance,

70
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:17,424
the trapezoidal formula and
the midpoint formula

71
00:06:17,424 --> 00:06:20,964
are quadrature formula

72
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,724
of order h to the power 2.

73
00:06:24,915 --> 00:06:28,645
Simpson's formula, 
a rule with 3 nodes,

74
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,975
is of order h to the power 4.

75
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:35,633
The Gauss formula with 2 nodes,

76
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:41,385
the 2 nodes being
-1 / sqrt(3) and 1 / sqrt(3),

77
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:44,255
has convergence
of order h to the power 4.
