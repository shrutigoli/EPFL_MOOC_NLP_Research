Hello and welcome to chapter 3:

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:05,723
"Numerical integration and
quadrature formulas"

3
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:09,782
Today we will deal with the following
problems.

4
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,717
First we will define the problem.

5
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:13,609
The goal is to numerically approximate

6
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:16,848
the integral of a continuous function f
on the interval [a,b].

7
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:20,445
Say the function f is exp(x^2),

8
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,650
there is no explicit primitive for this function. 

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,540
We will introduce the quadrature formula,

10
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,291
we will talk about quadrature weights,
quadrature nodes,

11
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:32,354
we will build the rectangle rule
(or mid-point rule), the trapezoidal rule,

12
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,326
which are straight forward rules.

13
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,680
Next Simpson's rule which is a bit
more complicated,

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,917
but more accurate.

15
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,857
And finally, the interesting topic, 

16
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:43,897
the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules.
