00:00:00,562 --> 00:00:05,942
Lets apply the results of theorem 3.1
to the midpoint and trapezoidal rules.

2
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:06,972
et du trapÃ¨ze.

3
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:09,562
For the midpoint rule,

4
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:18,077
I recall that the goal is to
numerically approximate

5
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:24,007
the integral between -1 and 1
of the function g( t ) dt.

6
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,037
The midpoint rule corresponds to

7
00:00:27,037 --> 00:00:29,263
choosing only one
quadrature node t_1

8
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,959
which is 0

9
00:00:31,959 --> 00:00:34,947
thus we evaluate 

10
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:40,477
the function g at 0 and approach
the integral

11
00:00:40,477 --> 00:00:43,537
between -1 and 1 by

12
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:50,467
the area of the rectangle of height g(0),
equal to 2 times g(0),

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,467
since the length of the interval is 2.

14
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:59,527
Therefore the formula L_h( f ) which
numerically approximates the integral

15
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:07,217
between a and b of f(x) dx
is defined by the sum over all sub-intervals,

16
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,357
for i from 0 to N-1,

17
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:17,517
of f( x_i + h / 2 ).

18
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:23,439
Let us illustrate the formula
L_h(f).

19
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,019
x varies from a to b,

20
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:31,049
I want to integrate the function
f between a and b.

21
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:37,069
I divide the interval into
sub-intervals

22
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,749
of equal length,

23
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:42,749
I consider the value in the
middle of each sub-interval

24
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:51,129
and I approximate the integral by the
sum of the area of each rectangle. 

25
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:55,996
Clearly the formula is exact for

26
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:57,856
polynomials of degree 0,

27
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:04,766
that is, let p(t) be a
polynomial of degree 0,

28
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:13,326
the integral between -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt
is equal to J(p).

29
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:14,886
This is true by construction.

30
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:21,296
This is true for all polynomials
of degree 0,

31
00:02:21,296 --> 00:02:27,246
but this is also true for
all polynomials of degree 1. 

32
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:30,875
We should check this,
but I claim this is true.

33
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:37,432
Let us apply theorem 3.1.

34
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:41,432
If the function f is twice
differentiable

35
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:43,818
on the interval [a,b],

36
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:49,194
the error between the
integral over [a,b] of f(x) dx 

37
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:54,562
and its approximation L_h( f )

38
00:02:54,562 --> 00:03:01,272
is of order h^2.

39
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,030
This means that each time h is
divided by 2

40
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,650
the error is divided by 4.

41
00:03:06,188 --> 00:03:08,478
For the trapezoidal rule

42
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,588
we have a similar result.

43
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,221
I recall the trapezoidal rule:

44
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,441
 

45
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,841
for t varying between -1 and 1,

46
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:24,351
here is the graph
of the function g,

47
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:30,631
and we approximate the integral
by the area of the trapeze.

48
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:36,221
This area is given by J(g),

49
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,621
the area of the trapeze is
g( -1 ) plus g( 1 ).

50
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:44,858
The formula for L_h( f ) to approximate
the integral between a and b of f(x) dx

51
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:49,228
is this time given by h over 2
times the sum over every sub-interval,

52
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:54,708
for i from 1 to N-1

53
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:58,298
of f(x_i) plus f(x_i+1).

54
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,600
Let p be a 

55
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:10,770
polynomial p of degree 1
as in the figure here,

56
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,890
I claim that the integral

57
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:20,460
between -1 and 1 of p(t) dt is
equal to J(p).

58
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,852
This is false for polynomials of degree 2. 

59
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:26,902
For example by taking a polynomial
of degree two as this one, 

60
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:31,022
you see immediately that the area
of the trapeze is not equal to

61
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:33,632
the integral between -1
and 1 of p(t) dt.

62
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,122
 

63
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:37,152
So this property is true for a
polynomial of degree 1.

64
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:41,282
By applying theorem 3.1 we obtain the same

65
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,242
result as for the midpoint rule. 

66
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:48,372
If f is twice differentiable
on the interval [a,b],

67
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:55,462
the error between
the integral over a and b of f(x) dx

68
00:04:55,462 --> 00:05:00,292
with the formula L_h( f ) found here,

69
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:05,262
is also of order h to the power 2. 

70
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:11,196
This means that each
time h is divided by 2

71
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:14,736
then the error is divided by 4.
