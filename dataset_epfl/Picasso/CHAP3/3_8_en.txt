It now remains to discuss about the choice of the quadrature nodes.
This will bring me to the definition of the Gauss quadrature formula.
Consider a quadrature formula, which I write as J(g), so the sum for i from 1 to M of the weights omega_j times g evaluated in t_j, this to numerically approximate the integral over -1 to 1 of g( t ) dt.
Once the nodes are chosen, the weights are given by theorem 3.2, omega_j is the integral from -1 to 1 of phi_j( t ) dt, the functions phi_1,phi_2 up to phi_M being the Lagrange basis of P_M-1 associated to the nodes t_1,t_2,...,t_M. donc <i>j</i> allant de 1 jusqu'Ã  <i>M</i>.
From theorem 3.2, I know that the quadrature rule built this way is exact for polynomials of degree less or equal M-1.
Therefore the integral from -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt is equal to J(p) for all polynomial p of order M-1.
The question is:
Is there a good choice of the quadrature nodes t_1 up to t_M, a choice better than others?
The answer is yes! This choice corresponds to the Gauss quadrature formula.
So, in the case M equal to 2,
I could choose as quadrature nodes those of the trapezoidal formula, t_1 equal to -1 and t_2 = 1.
Now I will choose t_1 equal to -1 / sqrt(3) and t_2 equal to 1 / sqrt(3).
I calculate the weights omega_1 and omega_2 using theorem 3.2, and I get omega_1 equal to 1 and omega_2 equal to 1 as well. 
Now the quadrature formula is
J(g) equal to g( -1/sqrt(3) ) plus g( 1/sqrt(3) ).
By construction, this formula is exact for polynomials of degree 1.
Therefore the integral from -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt is equal to J(p) for all polynomial of degree 1, this being a consequence of theorem 3.2. in fact, it is even better then this.
Indeed, this can be seen from this figure, where t varies from -1 to 1.
Let us choose a polynomial of degree 2.
I immediately see that by using the trapezoidal rule
I commit a certain error.
If I consider a polynomial of degree 2,
I do not have
J(p) equal to the integral over -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt for the trapezoidal rule. 
On the other hand, by using this formula here things are much better, why?
Since my quadrature nodes are
-1 / sqrt( 3 ) and 1 / sqrt( 3 ), more or less -0.577 and 0.577, and reporting on the figure,
I observe that the error committed here is compensated by this error here.
In fact, in this case the integral between -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt is equal to J(p) for all polynomials of degree 2. 
It happens that things are even better, this is also true for polynomials of degree 3 by symmetry reasons. 
So the integral over -1 and 1 of p( t ) dt is equal to J(p) for all polynomial p of degree 3. 
And now, by considering the difference between the integral between a and b of f(x) dx and the corresponding L_h( f ) formula,
I don't have an error of order h to the power 2 as in the trapezoidal rule, but I obtain an error of order h to the power 4.
Of course assuming that f is
4 times differentiable on [a,b].
Now what is the L_h(f) formula?
I have not explicitly given the formula for L_h(f), here is the corresponding formula: it is h / 2 times the sum over each sub-interval, over i from 0 to N-1, and one must evaluate the function f in x_i + h times (t_1 + 1) over 2, with t_1 equal to -1 / sqrt( 3 ); next f evaluated in x_i + h times (t_2 + 1) over 2 with t_2 equal to 1 / sqrt (3).
All this can be generalized for any M.
For t_1, t_2 up to t_M being the zeros of the polynomials of Gauss - Legendre, there is exactly
M zeros on the interval [-1,1] of the Gauss - Legendre polynomials of degree M to be defined,
I get the general result, that is the quadrature formula is exact for polynomials of degree 2M-1, well the integral from -1 to 1 of p( t ) dt equal to J( p ) for any polynomial p of degree 2M-1.
For example for M = 2, the quadrature formula is exact for a polynomial of degree 3.
Now, the error I commit between the integral over a and b of f(x) dx minus L_h( f ), the corresponding approximation formula, this error is of order h t the power 2M if the function f is 2M times differentiable on the interval [a,b].
In fact, compared to a conventional quadrature formula we double the order of convergence, so for example for the trapezoidal rule we have order 2 but here for the Gauss formula with 2 nodes we have order 4 only by choosing these magical nodes t_1, t_2 equal to -1 / sqrt(3) and 1 / sqrt(3).
