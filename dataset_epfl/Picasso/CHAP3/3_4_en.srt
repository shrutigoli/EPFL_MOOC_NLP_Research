1
00:00:01,508 --> 00:00:05,465
The choice of the quadrature 
nodes and weights

2
00:00:05,465 --> 00:00:07,739
is guided by the following theorem,

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:13,352
theorem 3.1 of the book.

4
00:00:14,172 --> 00:00:15,782
I recall the data:

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,511
we have a quadrature rule

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:26,453
that is M a positive integer,
for example 1,2,3,4 or 5,

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:32,579
quadrature nodes named t_1,
t_2 up to t_M,

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,778
quadrature weights called omega_1,
omega_2 up to omega_M,

9
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:48,100
so I have quadrature rule
J(g) which is the sum

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,327
over j from 1 to M

11
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:58,274
of the weights omega_j times g( t_j).

12
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:02,742
This formula is here to
numerically approximate

13
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:12,568
the integral between 
-1 and 1 of a function g( t ) dt,

14
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:16,481
for g( t ) a continuous function
defined on the interval [-1,1].

15
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:21,051
Next, once I have specified this
quadrature formula,

16
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:26,797
this comes down to using a formula
to approximate numerically

17
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,962
the integral between a and b of f(x) dx.

18
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,508
I denoted
this formula L_h (f),

19
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,613
and by using these
nodes and weights

20
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:38,943
I obtain a quadrature rule
which can be written this way:

21
00:01:39,453 --> 00:01:44,397
h over 2 times the sum over
all the sub-intervals [x_i, x_1+1]

22
00:01:44,397 --> 00:01:48,348
which comes down to 
the sum for i from 0 to N-1

23
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:53,030
then you have the sum
for j from 1 to M

24
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,039
of the quadrature nodes times
their weights,

25
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,834
the weights omega_j,

26
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,353
and the function f
must be evaluated 

27
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:06,572
in the points (x_i + h (t_j + 1) / 2.

28
00:02:07,082 --> 00:02:11,312
That is the numerical approximation

29
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:19,221
of the integral between
a and b of f(x) dx.

30
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:22,441
This is the problem statement.

31
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,045
The assumptions
are the following.

32
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,427
Assumptions.

33
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,180
There are two for this theorem.

34
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,984
The first is the exactness of

35
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,918
the quadrature formula, written J(g),
that is the sum of omega_j times g( t_j )

36
00:02:51,488 --> 00:02:52,493
for polynomials

37
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:57,307
of degree r.

38
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:06,711
de degr√© <i>r</i>,

39
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:08,645
Here r is any positive integer,

40
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,771
This means that for any 

41
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:16,957
polynomial of degree r,

42
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:19,485
remember that I denoted, in chapter 1,
P_r 

43
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:24,218
the vector space of polynomials
of degree smaller or equal to r,

44
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:27,902
let p be a polynomial of degree
smaller or equal to r,

45
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:31,872
I can calculate the integral
on the interval [-1,1] of p(t) dt,

46
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:37,782
I can compare it with J(p)
which by definition is

47
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:44,377
the sum over j from 1 to M of the
weights omega_j times p( t_j ),

48
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,336
and I assume these
two quantities,

49
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:50,827
the integral and the approximation
of the integral are equal.

50
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:53,972
Thus, I assume that the quadrature
rule is exact

51
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:56,638
for all polynomials of degree
small or equal to r.

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:02,121
Next, the assumption is on the
function f. I recall that my goal

53
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:07,114
is to numerically approximate
the integral between a and b of f(x) dx.

54
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:14,109
The assumption on f is
that it is (r + 1) times continuously differentiable,

55
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:18,624
where r is the polynomial degree here.

56
00:04:20,464 --> 00:04:25,541
So f is (r + 1) times differentiable
on the interval [a,b].

57
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,471
The conclusion is the following.

58
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:29,409
Conclusion.

59
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:37,411
For each function f (r + 1)
times continuously differentiable

60
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,623
on the interval [a,b],

61
00:04:38,953 --> 00:04:42,905
there exists a positive constant C
such that for all h,

62
00:04:43,475 --> 00:04:47,733
h being the parameter tending to 0,

63
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:51,586
that is the distance between
two consecutive points x_i and x_i+1

64
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,329
which is assumed to be constant,

65
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:55,265
so for all h positive, 

66
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,382
h smaller than b minus a

67
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,963
and strictly positive,

68
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:04,355
for all f there exists a constant C
such that for all h

69
00:05:04,645 --> 00:05:08,618
we have the integral over
a and b of

70
00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:13,701
f(x) dx minus L_h( f ),

71
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,496
L_h( f ) given by this formula,

72
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,438
well this quantity
is the error,

73
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:24,935
and the error is smaller than C
times h to the power (r + 1),

74
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:32,749
we will use the notation O(h^(r + 1)).

75
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:35,719
The conclusion of the
theorem reads:

76
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,373
if the assumptions are fulfilled that is,


77
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,405
if the quadrature rule is exact
for polynomials of degree r,

78
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,746
and if f is r + 1 times differentiable,

79
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,582
then the error is of order
h to the power r + 1.

80
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:52,574
The consequence of this theorem

81
00:05:55,004 --> 00:05:56,177
is the following:

82
00:05:56,717 --> 00:06:03,619
choose a function f which is r + 1
times differentiable,

83
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:09,288
compute the error,

84
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,452
and we can observe that

85
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:16,906
the error, this quantity here,

86
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:21,796
the error is divided by 

87
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,471
2 to the power r + 1,

88
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:29,362
this power r + 1 here,

89
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:32,997
each time that h

90
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:43,431
is divided by 2. 

91
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:46,270
This is the result.

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,003
Therefore,

93
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:57,159
we should choose the

94
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:10,174
quadrature nodes

95
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,779
and weights

96
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,635
which specify the quadrature formula J(g),

97
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:16,641
and therefore the formula L_h( f ),

98
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:22,585
we should choose
the nodes t_j and weights omega_j

99
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,088
for j from 1 to M,

100
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:27,305
so that

101
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:34,865
r , the polynomial degree

102
00:07:34,865 --> 00:07:38,287
for which the quadrature rule 
coincides with the integral,

103
00:07:39,097 --> 00:07:44,378
so that r is the
largest possible. 

104
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:54,663
For the rest of the lesson
we will

105
00:07:54,813 --> 00:08:00,154
answer these two questions:

106
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:05,069
suppose the quadrature
nodes t1, t2, .. t_M given,

107
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:10,622
how do you calculate the weights

108
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:20,560
omega_1, omega_2 up to omega_M?

109
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,426
Given the nodes of the quadrature formula,
how to compute the weights?

110
00:08:23,496 --> 00:08:24,722
And the second question is:


111
00:08:26,252 --> 00:08:29,360
what is a good choice

112
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,921
for the quadrature nodes 
t_1, t_2 up to t_M ?

113
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:50,023
These two questions will be answered by
the end of the lesson.
