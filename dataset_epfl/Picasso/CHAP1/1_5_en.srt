00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:08,838
Now I will talk to you about polynomial interpolation
of continuous functions.

2
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:17,579
This topic is covered in the
book by chapter 1.4

3
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:25,882
Given a continuous function f defined on 
the interval [a,b] in R (real numbers).

4
00:00:26,26 --> 00:00:35,65
I choose regularly spaced interpolation points,
such that  t_j = a + (b-a)*j/n for all j in 0,1,...,n.

5
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:43,242
 

6
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:53,118
Here is the interval [a,b], 
I choose five equidistant points, t0,t1,t2,t3,t4.

7
00:00:53,422 --> 00:01:02,693
cinq points Ã©quidistants. Je vais prendre 
ici le graphe de la fonction f et je 

8
00:01:02,847 --> 00:01:09,611
and search for the polynomial p_n of degree n

9
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:18,87
which matches the function f in the equidistant
points t_j; thus

10
00:01:18,87 --> 00:01:29,36
p_n equals the function f in t_j for all j in 0,1,...n.

11
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:38,607
Here are the values f(t0), f(t1),f(t2),f(t3) and f(t4)

12
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:47,586
and I can draw the polynomial p_4 of 
degree 4 through these five points.

13
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:56,116
Given the polynomial p_4 of degree 4
passing through

14
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:02,291
the equidistant points t0,t1,t2,t3,t4 which
coincides with f in these points.

15
00:02:02,394 --> 00:02:07,347
The question we are looking to answer is the following:

16
00:02:07,454 --> 00:02:12,431
when I increase the number of points n,

17
00:02:12,528 --> 00:02:18,201
say n goes to infinity, does the
polynomial get closer and closer

18
00:02:18,293 --> 00:02:23,676
to the function f ? I suggest a short numerical 
experiment with a java applet.

19
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:29,320
In this java app you see the graph

20
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,765
of the function f in red; 
this function is the following

21
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:41,966
f(t) = 1/(1+25*t^2) in the interval [-1,1].

22
00:02:41,966 --> 00:02:47,110
In blue you can observe the 
polynomial of degree 4

23
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,316
through the five equidistant points.
You can see that

24
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:57,367
the polynomial and the function coincide.
So the question to answer is:

25
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:02,204
when we increase the number of points
does the blue curve

26
00:03:02,204 --> 00:03:07,315
get closer to the red one ?
Let's try !

27
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:12,391
This time I set eleven points. We can observe
that the blue curve gets closer to the red one

28
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:17,352
in the center, but moves further away in the edges.
So we can carry on and

29
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:22,274
instead of taking eleven points I take
21 points and build the polynomial

30
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:27,334
of degree 20 through these 21 points; 
same remark, in the center

31
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:31,763
the blue and red curves are nearly overlaid,

32
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:36,980
but on the edges of the interval [-1,1] the blue curve 
 is further and further away

33
00:03:37,73 --> 00:03:42,50
from the red one, hence p_n moves away from f.

34
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,760
If I do the same thing except with 41 points,
I build the polynomial of degree 40

35
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:53,407
through the 41 points I observe that
the trend is even more pronounced.

36
00:03:53,652 --> 00:04:00,767
The polynomial p_40 and the function f
are close to each other in the vicinity of 0.

37
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:08,61
Unlike close to -1  and 1 where they
are far away from each other.

38
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,300
Let's do the same experiment
with the sinus function

39
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:20,193
on the interval [-1,1], in red the sinus
function and in blue the polynomial

40
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:25,738
of degree 2 through three equidistant 
points. You can see that 

41
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:31,415
there is a little difference between the
polynomial and the sinus function.

42
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:36,971
Using 5 equidistant points,
the red and blue curves 

43
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:42,326
are now overlaping. With 11 points
no difference can be seen. 

44
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:47,813
Again with 21 points the difference
can't be seen with one's nacked eye.

45
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:53,33
So the question: can a polynomial p_n converge
to f when n approaches infinity ?

46
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:58,557
i.e. when I take more and more equidistant points ?

47
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:04,782
The answer from numerical observtion is:
it depends !

48
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:10,570
It depends mainly on the function f. 
So I suggets to you

49
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:15,862
a theorem to allow us to conclude
in a certain number of cases. 

50
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,984
nombre de cas.
