A short summary of this first chapter on interpolation.
The problem we tried to solve was the following: we search for a polynomial of degree n such that p( tj )= pj. The values tj and pj are given for all indexes j = 0, 1, ..., n. The solution to the problem can be written as a linear combination of the functions phi_0, phi_1, ..., phi_n which form the Lagrange basis of polynomials of degree n and depend on the choice of points t_0, t_1, ... , t_n. Hence the solution is a linear combination of these functions phi_0, phi_1, ... phi_n, and the coefficients of the linear combination are the values given by the p_j. So we have p(t) equal to the sum over j = 0, ... n of the product of p_j times phi_j(t). The k-th basis function of the Lagrange basis is a polynomial of degree n which must cancel out for all points, except for j equal to k. 
The numerator is monomials of the form
(t - t_j), and the denominator is composed of monomials (t_k - t_j) such that phi_k(t_k) is equal to 1. 
That must be understood for the exam.
Next we considered a function f defined on a continuous interval [a,b].
We built the polynomial of degree n which coincides with the function f in a given number of points t_j equidistant on the interval [a,b]. Again, we have p_n a linear combination of these fixed functions, the functions forming the Lagrange basis.
The coefficients of the linear combination are the values of the function f evaluated at points t_j. As n approaches infinty, we want to know if the polynomial p_n approaches the function f ? The answer is given by a theorem which depends on the derivative of order n+1 of the function f.
We have considered another problem : interpolation by intervals.
We built f_h, the interpolant by interval of the function f, with equidistant points. h is the distance between two consecutive points which will approach zero. So f_h is a function which is continuous, but not differentiable. This function coincides with the function f at these equidistant points and the function f_h is a polynomial of degree 1 on each subinterval. In this case the error between f and f_h is an error which follows h^2, this is true only if f is twice differentiable. 
Now if you consider an interpolant f_h of degree 2 on each subinterval, well you get that the distance between f and f_h is of order h^3, so the error is divided by 2^3 = 8 every time h is divided by two.
