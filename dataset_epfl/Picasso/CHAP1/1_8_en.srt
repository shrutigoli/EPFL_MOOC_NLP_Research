1
00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:07,281
This time we will consider the
interpolation by interval of degree 2. 

2
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:15,627
As previously, we take the function f
defined on the interval [a,b] in R

3
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:23,437
and consider the equidistant points x_i
on the interval  [a,b] such that

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:33,986
x_i = a + (b-a)/N * i for i = 0, 1, ... , N.
The parameter h is still the (b-a)/N.

5
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:44,830
Again the graph of the function f
on the interval [a,b].

6
00:00:45,8 --> 00:00:54,277
I take five equidistant points x0, 
x1, x2, x3 and x4. The graph of 

7
00:00:54,423 --> 00:01:02,654
the function f. I will build the function f_h
which is continuous on the interval [a,b]. 

8
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:10,720
We must impose that this
function f_h coincides with 

9
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:17,526
the function f at the points xi:
f_h(x_i) = f(x_i) for i = 0,1, ... , N.

10
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:24,456
I will add one extra constraint,

11
00:01:24,577 --> 00:01:31,634
I will impose that

12
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:38,97
the function f_h coincides with the
function f in the middle of the

13
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,866
sub-intervals: x_(i+1/2) for i = 0, 1, ... N-1.

14
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:52,397
These x_(i+1/2) points are the middle points
of the sub-intervals x_i to x_(i+1). 

15
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:59,891
So x_(1/2) is the middle point
of the interval x_0 to x_1. 

16
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:06,928
So the functions f_h and f must
be equal on these intermediate points.

17
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:12,575
Finally,  I impose that the function f_h

18
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:18,168
is a polynomial of degree 2 on each
sub-interval x_i to x_(i+1)

19
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:23,190
passing through the three points of
each sub-interval. Previously we

20
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:29,183
imposed that the function f_h was a
polynomial of degree 1. 

21
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,708
Here is the interpolant of degree 2,

22
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:38,741
this for all intervals for i = 0, 1, ... ,N-1.
Now I can draw this interpolant. 

23
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:43,728
On the first interval x1 to x2,
we have three points.

24
00:02:43,808 --> 00:02:47,949
This is the unique polynomial of degree 2
through these three points. 

25
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:52,725
On the interval x1 to x2 there are also
three points. Again this is the only

26
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:57,142
polynomial of degree 2 through these points.
You can observe that the left derivative

27
00:02:57,142 --> 00:03:01,613
isn't equal to the derivative to the right
at point x1.

28
00:03:01,613 --> 00:03:05,661
So the function is continuous, but not
once differentiable. By moving on

29
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:09,701
to the next interval x2 to x3, we get the
unique polynomial of degree 2.

30
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:14,148
Finally, on the interval x3 to x4 we also 
have the unique polynomial of degree 2

31
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:19,119
passing through these three points. 
I have now built my interpolating function

32
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:23,991
of degree 2 by intervals. Again I
must evaluate the error.

33
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:29,866
Here is the maximum of the error.
Will this error approach 0

34
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:35,766
as the parameter h, still the distance between
two points, approaches 0 ?

35
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:41,999
So does f_h converge, somehow, towards
f as h approaches 0,

36
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:48,429
equivalent to, as N approach +infinity. 

37
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:53,651
The answer is yes, given by theorem
1.2 of the book.

38
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:59,60
Let C be a positive constant such that
for all f three times differentiable

39
00:03:59,60 --> 00:04:04,232
on the interval [a,b]. I must here assume f
three times differentiable. 

40
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:09,471
Previously for the interpolating function
of degree 1, f needed to be twice

41
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:14,765
differentiable. So there exists C such that

42
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,123
for all h positive, again h
does not depend on f nor h,

43
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:25,847
the maximum of the error on the
interval [a,b], f_h(x)-f(x) taken in

44
00:04:25,953 --> 00:04:32,45
absolute value. I consider the maximum
of this error on the interval [a,b]. 

45
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:38,881
Well this error is upper bounded by C * h^3
times the maximum of the third derivative,

46
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:46,157
taken in absolute value.

47
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:53,36
Again the signification, or the numerical
experiment which can be done,

48
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:59,965
is the following. We choose a function
three times diferentiable,

49
00:05:00,77 --> 00:05:06,317
we then calculate the error between f 
and f_h. We can observe that this

50
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:13,269
quantity, the maximum of the error on
the interval [a,b] is divided by

51
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:19,407
2^3 = 8 each time h is divide by 2.

52
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:22,674
chaque fois que H est divis√© par deux.
