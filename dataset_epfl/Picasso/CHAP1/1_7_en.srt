00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:09,728
In this video I will talk to you about interpolation
of degree 1 by interval. 

2
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:19,262
I will consider a function f
defined in the interval [a,b].

3
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:26,501
Let x_i be equidistant points in the interval [a,b]
such that x_i = a+((b-a)/N)*i for i=0,1, ... N.

4
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:33,964
Here the interval [a,b], the variable x.

5
00:00:34,86 --> 00:00:40,78
The function f defined on the
interval [a,b]. I choose

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,250
a certain number of equidistant points on 
this interval [a,b] called x0, x1, x2, x3 and x4.

7
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:55,0
So here is the function f(x) on
the interval [a,b]

8
00:00:55,132 --> 00:01:02,850
and I will build the function f_h
the following way

9
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:11,429
This function f_h will be the interpolant by
intervals of degree 1 of the function f.

10
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:20,200
This function is continuous on the interval
[a,b] and should coincide with the function

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:28,464
f at points x_i for all i = 0,1, ... N.
In this notation

12
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:36,461
we used the letter h, but what is it ?
It is the following: h = (b-a)/N, the distance

13
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:42,88
between two consecutive points. 

14
00:01:42,88 --> 00:01:47,655
This h approaches 0, or equivalently
N approaches infinity.

15
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:53,934
So the functions f and f_h must
be equal at nodes x_i. 

16
00:01:54,45 --> 00:02:02,551
Furthermore f_h restrained such that
on every sub-interval x_i to x_(i+1)

17
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:11,705
f_h is a polynomial of degree 1
for i = 0,1, ... N-1.

18
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:20,485
So f_h on the interval x0 to x1 is a 
polynomial of degree 1

19
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:29,114
passing through (x0,f(x0)) and (x1,f(x1))
and so on for the sub-intervals x1 to x2, 

20
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:37,630
x2 to x3 and x3 to x4. Each time it is a
different polynomial of degree 1.

21
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:45,211
Here is the function f_h of x; the question
I want to answer is:

22
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:52,94
does f_h converge, somehow, to the function
f as h approaches 0, or 

23
00:02:52,94 --> 00:02:58,768
as N approaches +infinity. 

24
00:02:58,768 --> 00:03:05,604
The error is here. I will consider the maximum

25
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:14,482
of this error on the interval [a,b].
The theoretical result is the following:

26
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:22,135
theorem 1.2 in the book: 
a positive C exists such that

27
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:29,653
the function f is twice differentiable
on the interval [a,b]. 

28
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:36,175
This is the case for my drawing.

29
00:03:36,175 --> 00:03:42,669
For all h positive we have the error

30
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:48,735
(f_h(x)-f(x)), by taking the absolute value
of this error and considering the maximum

31
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:55,931
on the interval [a,b]; we get the error
visible here.

32
00:03:55,931 --> 00:04:03,705
This error is smaller then C*(h^2) times
the maximum of the 

33
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:11,549
second derivative of f on the interval [a,b].

34
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:17,871
According to this theorem, C does not
depend on neither h nor f,

35
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:23,507
hence there exists for all h and all f
a value C depending on neither h nor f.

36
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:30,71
The meaning of this theorem is the following
in practice: 

37
00:04:30,71 --> 00:04:37,421
we choose a function twice differentiable
on the interval [a,b]. For a given h

38
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:45,55
we measure the error and must
observe that this error

39
00:04:45,55 --> 00:04:56,385
is at least divide by 2^2, so 4, each time
h is divide by 2.

40
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:56,621
