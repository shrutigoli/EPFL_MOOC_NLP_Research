A short summary of this first
chapter on interpolation.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,574
The problem we tried to solve was the following:
we search for a polynomial of degree n

3
00:00:12,788 --> 00:00:17,683
such that p( tj )= pj. The values tj and pj
are given for all

4
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:22,202
indexes j = 0, 1, ..., n. The solution to
the problem can be written

5
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:27,243
as a linear combination of the
functions phi_0, phi_1, ..., phi_n

6
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:32,316
which form the Lagrange basis of polynomials
of degree n and depend on the choice of

7
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:37,43
points t_0, t_1, ... , t_n. Hence the solution
is a linear combination of these functions

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,911
phi_0, phi_1, ... phi_n, and the coefficients
of the linear combination are the values

9
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:46,379
given by the p_j. So we have p(t) equal
to the sum over j = 0, ... n of the product

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,785
of p_j times phi_j(t). The k-th basis function
of the Lagrange basis is a polynomial

11
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:57,770
of degree n which must cancel out for
all points, except for j equal to k. 

12
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,250
The numerator is monomials of the form
(t - t_j), and the denominator is

13
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,461
composed of monomials (t_k - t_j) such
that phi_k(t_k) is equal to 1. 

14
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:17,94
That must be understood for the exam.

15
00:01:17,94 --> 00:01:23,986
Next we considered a function f
defined on a continuous interval [a,b].

16
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:29,619
We built the polynomial of degree n which
coincides with the function f in a given

17
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,386
number of points t_j equidistant on the 
interval [a,b]. Again, we have p_n a

18
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:38,993
linear combination of these fixed functions, 
the functions forming the Lagrange basis.

19
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:43,110
The coefficients of the
linear combination

20
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,843
are the values of the function f evaluated
at points t_j. As n approaches infinty,

21
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:52,487
we want to know if the
polynomial p_n approaches 

22
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:58,627
the function f ? The answer is given
by a theorem which depends on the

23
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:03,990
derivative of order n+1
of the function f.

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,635
We have considered another problem :
interpolation by intervals.

25
00:02:08,635 --> 00:02:13,481
We built f_h, the interpolant by interval
of the function f, with equidistant points.

26
00:02:13,481 --> 00:02:18,195
h is the distance between two
consecutive points

27
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:23,209
which will approach zero. So f_h is a 
function which is continuous, but not

28
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,971
differentiable. This function coincides
with the function f at

29
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:33,346
these equidistant points and the function
f_h is a polynomial of degree 1 on each

30
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:38,222
subinterval. In this case the error
between f and f_h is an error

31
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:43,240
which follows h^2, this is true only if f is
twice differentiable. 

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,769
Now if you consider an interpolant f_h

33
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:54,169
of degree 2 on each subinterval, well

34
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:59,785
you get that the distance between f and f_h
is of order h^3, 

35
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:03,261
so the error is divided by 2^3 = 8 every
time h is divided by two.
