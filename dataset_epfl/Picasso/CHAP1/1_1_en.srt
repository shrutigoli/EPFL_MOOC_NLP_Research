Hello, welcome to chapter 1 interpolation,
the problem to be solved

2
00:00:06,562 --> 00:00:13,305
is the following : given n a nonnegative integer

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:19,611
supposed to be large, and n+1 values, denoted

4
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:25,896
t0,t1,t2 up to tn.
Is is important for these values to be

5
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:31,425
pairwise distinct, so t0
different from t1, different from t2,

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:37,853
and so on... we take now n+1 values
that we note p0,p1,p2 up to pn.

7
00:00:37,853 --> 00:00:44,309
These values can all be equal.

8
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,436
We are looking for a polynomial p

9
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:56,470
of degree n that goes through the points (t0,p0), 
(t1,p1) ... up to (tn,pn).

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:02,592
So I am looking for p in Pn.
Here Pn is the set of polynomials

11
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:08,700
of degee less or equal to n
such that p evaluated at tj gives pj

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,921
for the subscripts j from 0 to n.

13
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:21,166
Then I can draw the situation with n=1,

14
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:27,670
In this case I have 2 points, 

15
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,477
the corresponding value, and I look for the unique
degree 1 polynomial that goes through

16
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:41,185
those two points, I write it a0+a1*t.

17
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:48,742
Now if n=2 I have three points so here are t0, 
the point (t0,p0), the points (t1,p1), and (t2,p2)

18
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:56,22
and I look for the unique degree 2 polynomial
going through those three points.

19
00:01:56,22 --> 00:02:02,814
I can write it p2(t) = a0+a1*t+a2*t^2.


20
00:02:02,814 --> 00:02:08,784
There is a java applet that
allows us to continue with n=3,4,5.

21
00:02:08,784 --> 00:02:14,150
I can use this java applet to 
do a few experiences.

22
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:20,40
I place 2 points here, and
here is the unique

23
00:02:20,40 --> 00:02:25,61
degree 1 polynomial going through 
those 2 points.

24
00:02:25,61 --> 00:02:29,582
I add a third point, here we get the 
unique degree 2 polynomial going through

25
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,846
those three points. I add a 4th point
 and see that 

26
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:38,481
the concavity of the function changes once.
And so on I can keep

27
00:02:38,481 --> 00:02:43,467
adding as many points as I want and get
here for instance 6 interpolation points

28
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:47,860
and the unique degree 5 polynomial
going through those points

29
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,761
I can add even more points if I wish so. 
Now we wonder

30
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:56,930
what would happen if I put a point
right below an existing one ?

31
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,902
Well, what will happen is that we
indeed get

32
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:06,745
the polynomial, of degree 8 here, 
going through those 9 points.

33
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:11,306
But the price to pay is that this polynomial
oscillates a lot more.

34
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:15,935
we try now a new experiment, 
take the function exp(-x^2).

35
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:20,287
Now when I put a point, it 
belongs to the graph of

36
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:24,741
this function, so I try to approach this 
function exp(-x^2)

37
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:29,642
by a polynomial. So here I have 
3 points here

38
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:34,645
now 4,5 points. And the question 
I ask is : if 

39
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:39,778
I add a lot of points, will
my polynomial approach correctly

40
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:44,246
the function ? The answer depends on
the placement of these points..

41
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:48,650
For example, here I have a few points.
Observe that if I put one

42
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,222
here, then things go well
in the center, but quite

43
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:58,272
bad on the edge of our interval.
So I add some points

44
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:03,872
on the side of the interval, and now
I get a polynomial of high degree

45
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:09,152
since I have 15 interpolation points.
My polynomial has degree 14

46
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:14,872
that approaches reasonably well
this function 

47
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:15,565
exp(-x^2)
