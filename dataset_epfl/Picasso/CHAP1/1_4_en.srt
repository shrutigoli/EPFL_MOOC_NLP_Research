1
00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:08,831
We'll now solve the problem
for any n.

2
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:18,101
We define φ0, φ1, ..., φn

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:28,117
the Lagrange basis for polynomials
of degree n, Pn, which 

4
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:38,321
depends on the points t0, t1, t2,..., tn.
Take an integer k, between 0 and n


5
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:47,179
k is fixed. Then φk 
is a degree n polynomial

6
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:55,502
defined as follows :
we want


7
00:00:55,635 --> 00:01:03,120
φk(tk)=1 and φk(tj)=0
for all tj

8
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:10,910
with the subscript j different
from k, and between 0 and n.

9
00:01:11,45 --> 00:01:18,51
The formula for φk is the following 

10
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:25,671
φk(t) is the product on 
j from 0 to n, j different from k, 

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:34,82
the numerator is of the type (t-tj)
such that φk(tj)=0

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:44,105
and on the denominator we have 
tk-tj, so that φk(tk)=1.

13
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:54,130
I claim now that φ0, φ1, φ2, ..., φn
is a basis 

14
00:01:54,451 --> 00:02:02,665
for polynomials of degree n.
The dimension of the space

15
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:11,170
of degree n polynomials
is n+1 because any

16
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:16,311
polynomial of degree n is a linear
combination of the functions

17
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:20,592
1, t, t^2, ..., t^n
so there are n+1

18
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:25,312
functions in the basis, so the 
dimension of Pn is n+1

19
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:30,30
So we just need to check that
φ0, φ1, φ2, ..., φn are linearly independant

20
00:02:30,262 --> 00:02:39,551
Take any coefficients α0, α1, ..., αn

21
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:47,195
and a linear combination 
α0*φ0 +α1*φ1 +...+αn*φn

22
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:53,952
Suppose this linear combination is 0

23
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:59,654
That is to say 0 for all t in R.
We must show that this implies that 

24
00:02:59,654 --> 00:03:05,680
all the coefficients α0, α1, ..., αn
are 0. I choose for example 

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,295
t=t0 and I get φ0(t0)=1, 
φ1(t0)=0, ... φn(tn)=0 so

26
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:18,704
α0*φ0(t0)+α1*φ(t1)+...+αn*φ(tn)
 = a0*1+α1*0+...+αn*0=α0

27
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:24,221
So I get α0=0.
Likewise if I choose 

28
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:30,96
t=t1 I get α1=0 and so on.

29
00:03:30,96 --> 00:03:35,415
So I indeed showed that those 
functions are linearly independant.

30
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:41,206
Recall that I am looking
for a polynomial

31
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:46,521
of degree n going through 
(t0,p0), (t1,p1), .... (tn,pn)

32
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:51,291
and I claim the solution of the problem
is given by p(t).

33
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:56,154
p(t) is a degree n polynomial so we can 
write it as a linear combination

34
00:03:56,154 --> 00:04:00,998
of the basis functions φ0, φ1, ..., φn
and the coefficients of the linear combinations

35
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:06,766
are the values p0, p1, ..., pn

36
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:13,489
so p(t) = p0*φ0(t)+p1*φ1(t)+ ... +pn*φn(t).

37
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:20,516
We can indeed check that it is
the solution to our problem.

38
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:27,460
Firsly, this polynomial is a linear
combination of the functions

39
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:33,276
φ0, φ1, ..., φn the Lagrange 
basis, so it is a polynomial

40
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:39,282
of degree n. And I must check that 
p(tj)=pj.  For instance, let us show that p(t0)=p0

41
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:45,960
p(t0)=p0*φ0(t0)+p1*φ1(t0)+...+pn*φn(tn)
but φ0(t0)=1, φ1(t0)=0, ..., φn(t0)=0

42
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,369
so we have p(t0)=p0.

43
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:59,515
and we continue likewise until
 we get p(tn)=pn
