1
00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:06,816
The bad way of dealing with the problem is the following : 

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:13,744
I am looking for p, a polynomial
 of degree n that I write 

3
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:25,311
p(t)+a0+a1*t+a2*t^2+...+an*t^n.

4
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:32,513
So I have n+1 unknown quantities, 
which are the coefficients a0, a1, a2

5
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:38,350
up to an, the coefficiants
of the polynomial in the canonical basis

6
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:45,189
1,t,t^2 up to t^n. I get n+1 equations


7
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:53,996
that correspond to p(t0)=p0 for the first
equation, so 

8
00:00:54,152 --> 00:01:02,359
a0+a1*t0+a2+t0^2+...+an*t0^n=p0

9
00:01:02,502 --> 00:01:10,997
likewise for p at t1, that
should give us p1, which gives

10
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:18,646
a0+a1*t1+a2*t1^2+...+an*t1^n=p1.

11
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:25,223
and so on until p(tn)=pn.

12
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:30,962
I can write those n+1 equations
as a linear system

13
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:37,644
since a0,a1,a2...,are linear factors 
of our canonical basis

14
00:01:37,753 --> 00:01:45,414
The unknown quantinies are 
a0,a1,...,an

15
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:52,982
We can see the ai's as coordinates
of the vector a. 

16
00:01:53,109 --> 00:02:00,185
On the right handside of the equality
we get the given values p0,p1,...pn

17
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:08,306
as entries of the vector p
Now I have to write down the entries

18
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:16,333
if the matrix T such that Ta=p.
The first line is 

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,789
a0+t0*a1+t0^2*a2+...+t0^n*an = p0.
So

20
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:30,896
on the second line we have 1,t1,t1^2,... until t1^n

21
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:37,807
And finally on the last line
we have 1 tn tn^2 ... tn^n

22
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:43,778
We're now down to solving

23
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,592
a linear system. This method is
bad because the number

24
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:57,244
of operations to solve a linear system is 
high. We'll see in the chapter 4

25
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:02,783
that this number has the size of 
n cubed, n^3.

26
00:03:02,887 --> 00:03:08,27
On the other hand we have another method
that will give us an explicit formula

27
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:13,45
for the polynomial p(t). Here the 
formula isn't explicit because I have 

28
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:18,21
to solve a linear system to get the coefficients.


29
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:25,557
We'll see later an explicit formula for the 
polynomial, we're now going to 

30
00:03:25,557 --> 00:03:27,635
talk about Lagrange interpolation.
