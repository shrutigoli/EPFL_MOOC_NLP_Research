1
00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:07,238
Now we'll solve the 
problem with n=2.

2
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:14,747
We have three pairwise distinct values
t0, t1, t2 from which 

3
00:00:14,873 --> 00:00:22,894
we'll construct φ0, φ1, φ2
the Lagrange basis

4
00:00:23,37 --> 00:00:32,716
for degree 2 polynomials, 
associated with t0, t1, t2.

5
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:41,350
Those three functions 
φ0, φ1 and φ2

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,999
Are 3 polynomials of degree 2
built as follows : 

7
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:56,204
Here are our points 
t0,  t1, t2

8
00:00:56,204 --> 00:01:06,595
the first polynomial φ0 is a 
degree 2 polynomial such that

9
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:16,147
φ0(t0) = 1, φ0(t1) = 0 and φ0(t2)=0

10
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:25,299
We can draw this φ0 and we can even
write a formula for φ0 since

11
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:32,622
it is zero at t1 and t2, so 
we can write it as

12
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:39,159
(t-t1)*(t-t2) and I want it 
to be equal to 1 at t0

13
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:45,877
so I divide it by (t0-t1)*(t0-t2).
So we get the formula for φ0

14
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:52,816
Likewise I can build the polynomial 
φ1, degree 2 polynomial such that

15
00:01:52,816 --> 00:02:00,878
φ1(t0)=0 φ1(t1)=1 φ1(t2)=0

16
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:08,951
So here is the polynomial φ1

17
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:14,930
and again we have a formula for
φ1 which is 

18
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,940
(t-t0)*(t-t2) to get 0 at t0 and t2

19
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:28,481
and I want it to equal 1 at t1
so I divide it by

20
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:37,711
(t1-t0)*(t1-t2).
Finally we can build

21
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:47,266
φ2 of degree 2 such that
φ2(t0)=0 φ2(t1)=0 φ2(t2)=1

22
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:57,387
and we get an analogue formula.
I now claim that those 3 functions

23
00:02:57,387 --> 00:03:04,452
φ0, φ1, φ2 are a basis for the
set of polynomials of degree

24
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:09,757
2 or less. Indeed we 
have three functions in 

25
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:14,983
P2 the set of degree 2 polynomials.
The dimension of the space of 

26
00:03:14,983 --> 00:03:20,595
degree 2 polynomials is 3.
Why 3 ?

27
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:27,338
Because if p is a degree 2
polynomial, write it a0+a1*t+a2*t^2.

28
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:35,156
So {1, t, t^2} is the canonical 
basis for the degree 2 polynomials.

29
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:42,742
There are 3 elements in this basis
so the dimension of P2 is 3


30
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:48,283
Hence the only thing to check to 
get that φ0, φ1, φ2 are a basis is that

31
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:53,869
those three functions are 
linearly independent, so

32
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:59,220
I take 3 coefficients α0, α1, α2
and I write the linear combination

33
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,311
α0*φ0+α1*φ1+α2*φ2
and suppose

34
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:13,78
this equals 0.

35
00:04:13,78 --> 00:04:20,673
I have to show that this implies
that all coefficients

36
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:26,625
α0, α1, α2 are 0.

37
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:32,711
To show this, it suffices to take


38
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,561
t=t0 to get α0=0

39
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:44,186
t=t1 to get α1=0 and
t=t2 to get α2=0.

40
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:49,305
so those 3 functions are 
linearly independent which means

41
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:55,367
that if p is a degree 2 polynomial, 
we can write p(t) as

42
00:04:55,367 --> 00:05:02,507
a linear combination if those 
3 functions

43
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:09,195
α0φ0(t) +α1φ1(t) +α2φ2(t)

44
00:05:09,195 --> 00:05:15,540
Now I will give the solution of 
the problem.

45
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,446
Recall I am looking for 
a degree 2 polynomial that

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:27,374
goes through the points 
(t0,p0), (t1,p1), (t2,p2). The solution

47
00:05:27,374 --> 00:05:33,962
is just a linear combination of 
φ0, φ1 and φ2, and the 

48
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:40,414
coefficients of this linear combination
are p0, p1 and p2. So 

49
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:45,744
p(t)=p0*φ(t)+p1*φ(t)+p2*φ(t).
We can easily check that 

50
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:51,768
this is the solution to our problem.


51
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:57,282
p is a degree 2 polynomial, because
it is a linear combination of those 3

52
00:05:57,282 --> 00:06:03,907
functions, φ0, φ1 and φ2.
And one can check that for example

53
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:11,421
p(t0)=p0. Why ?  
Because φ0(t0)=1 and 

54
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:19,357
then p1*φ1(t0)=0.

55
00:06:19,357 --> 00:06:27,736
and p2*φ2(t0)=0. 


56
00:06:27,736 --> 00:06:35,42
so we indeed have p(t0)=p0.
Likewise p(t1)=p1 and p(t2)=p2.
