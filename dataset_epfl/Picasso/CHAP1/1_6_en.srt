00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:06,796
Now I will present theorem 1.1 from the book,
which allows us

2
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:13,796
to explain the results in some cases. 
I remind you that 

3
00:00:14,10 --> 00:00:21,251
the problem is the following:
let us consider a function f defined

4
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:29,119
on an interval [a,b] in R. We considered t_j
equidistant interpolation points,

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:36,719
t_j = a + (b-a)*j/n for j=0,1,...,n. 
These t_j points are equidistant.

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:46,571
Let p_n a polynomial of degree n which
coincides with 

7
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:55,240
the function f in the points t_j.
So p_n is equal to f in t_j, for j = 0,1,..,n.

8
00:00:55,405 --> 00:01:03,894
p_n is a linear combination of the
functions phi_0, phi_1, ... phi_n

9
00:01:04,41 --> 00:01:11,725
which are the Lagrange basis polynomials
of degree n associated

10
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,682
to the points t0,t1,...,tn. So p_n of t is 
f of t0 times phi_0 of t plus

11
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:25,708
f of t_1 times phi_1 of t plus...
 f of t_n times phi_n of t.

12
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:32,651
Again, phi_0, phi_1, ... phi_n are the 
Lagrange basis polynomials of degree n

13
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:40,135
associated to the points t0, t1, ... tn.
The hypothesis is that f is

14
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:48,76
(n+1) times continuously differentiable
on the interval [a,b] and the

15
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:55,781
conclusion of the theorem is the following:
I am interested in the error, i.e. the difference

16
00:01:55,912 --> 00:02:01,139
between the function f and the
polynomial p_n of degree n

17
00:02:01,252 --> 00:02:08,357
also known as the interpolant of f
associated to the points t0,t1,t2, ... tn.

18
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:15,107
I track this error at all points t, 
and consider the maximum of the

19
00:02:15,223 --> 00:02:21,893
error on the interval [a,b]. I then claim that
such this error is upper bounded by 1/(2*(n+1)).

20
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:29,278
times (b-a)/n
elevated to the power (n+1).

21
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:36,40
times a term which 
brings in the (n+1) derivative

22
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:43,36
of the function f on the interval [a,b],
in absolute value

23
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:49,845
and consider the maximum of this quantity
on the interval [a,b]. Hence the error between

24
00:02:49,845 --> 00:02:55,611
the function f and the polynomial is upper
bounded by a term which approaches zero

25
00:02:55,715 --> 00:03:01,675
as n approaches infinity and another term
which uses the derivatives of increasing order.

26
00:03:01,777 --> 00:03:07,570
Let's consider two cases

27
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:14,249
which correspond to both examples
done in the java apps.

28
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:19,822
In the case where f(t)= sin(t)

29
00:03:19,932 --> 00:03:27,458
I know that all derivatives of sin(t)
are upper bounded by 1 ,

30
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:35,567
this for all t in [a,b] or even R. 

31
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:42,355
This quantity is bounded by 1,

32
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:48,551
this one approaches 0 as n approaches infinity.
So we must have

33
00:03:48,657 --> 00:03:54,89
the limit of the maximum of the 
error between the function f

34
00:03:54,192 --> 00:04:00,330
and the polynomial p_n goes to

35
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:07,515
zero as n goes to infinity. 

36
00:04:07,637 --> 00:04:13,944
In the case when f(t)=1/(1+25*t^2),

37
00:04:14,64 --> 00:04:20,905
an explicit formula of the derivative can not be given.
Neverthless I can observe that

38
00:04:21,17 --> 00:04:26,723
the (n+1) derivative of f goes to 
infinity as n goes to infinity.

39
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,797
Hence there is one term which
goes to infinity

40
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:36,982
as n goes to infinity, and a second 
one which goes to zero

41
00:04:37,72 --> 00:04:41,117
so no conclusion can be made.
Nevertheless the numerical examples

42
00:04:41,202 --> 00:04:46,433
show that the polynomial moves further away
from the function f.

43
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:51,413
At least the maximum of the error
goes to infinity when 

44
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:57,470
n goes to infinity. The conclusion is the
following: choosing equidistant interpolation

45
00:04:57,572 --> 00:05:03,613
points is not a recommended when the
number of points goes to infinity

46
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:10,66
i.e. when the degree of the polynomial gets
higher and higher. 

47
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:16,363
One method to resolve this issue is by
choosing points with adequate spacing

48
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:21,224
on the interval [a,b].

49
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,836
By experimenting with the java app,
you can see that by placing more points

50
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,88
towards the edges of the interval, things get
better. The other solution

51
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:36,20
which I will do next in the course, is
interpolation by intervals.

52
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,606
This is what is done in

53
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:42,396
finite element softwares.
