00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:06,691
Now I state theorem 3.1
from the book.

2
00:00:08,271 --> 00:00:13,256
Let g be a function from R to R,

3
00:00:14,587 --> 00:00:16,476
assumed to be C1,

4
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:19,106
that is once differentiable,

5
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:25,074
and let x bar be a fixed point of g,

6
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:28,096
that is g(x bar) = x bar.

7
00:00:28,096 --> 00:00:31,780
Thus it is assumed that there exists a
fixed point of this function g,

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:40,896
moreover, it is assumed that the absolute value
of g'(x bar) is strictly smaller than 1.

9
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:43,421
The claim is:

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:51,600
there exists a positive epsilon such that,

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,855
if the initial guess x_0 is between
x bar minus epsilon and x bar plus epsilon,

12
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:09,219
then the sequence
defined by x_n+1 equal to g(x_n)

13
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,553
converges to x bar.

14
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:21,103
We have a C1 continuous function g, x bar
a fixed point of g,

15
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,825
and g'(x bar) in absolute value smaller than 1.

16
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:27,336
In this case, there exists
a neighborhood of x bar

17
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:30,137
such that by choosing x0
in this neighborhood,

18
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:33,868
insures that the sequence x_n+1 equal to g(x_n)
converges to x bar.

19
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:36,726
There is an extra information:

20
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:40,709
furthermore, the convergence is linear. 

21
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:49,140
This means there exists a positive C
strictly smaller than 1,

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,056
such that for all n,

23
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:53,563
n the iteration index,
x_n+1 equal to g(x_n),

24
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:54,696
for all n,

25
00:01:54,696 --> 00:02:01,712
well the error at step n+1
is smaller or equal to C,

26
00:02:01,712 --> 00:02:06,154
being strictly smaller than one,
times the error at step n.

27
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,954
Hence the error decreases at each step,

28
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:14,787
since the ratio between the error
at step n+1 and the error at step n,

29
00:02:14,787 --> 00:02:17,315
is strictly smaller than 1.
