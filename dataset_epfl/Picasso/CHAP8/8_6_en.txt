The example which was considered previously was the following.
Here is the graph of the function g, the two fixed points x_1 bar and x_2 bar.
We observed that if x_0 was chosen smaller than x_2 bar, then the sequence x_n+1 equal to g(x_n) converges to x_1 bar.
If x_0 is larger than x_2 bar, the sequence defined by x_n+1 = g(x_n) diverges.
Now we can apply theorem 8.3 to this function g.
This function g is C1,
I observe that g' at x_1 bar is strictly smaller than 1, since the slope of the first bisectrix is 1. la dÃ©rivÃ©e est strictement plus petite.
Now I can apply theorem 8.3.
According to theorem 8.3, there exists a positive epsilon,
I will quantify it shortly, such that for all x_0 chosen in the interval x bar plus epsilon  to x bar minus epsilon, well the sequence defined by x_n+1 equal to g(x_n) converges to x_1 bar.
This is what I observed since
I took x_0 smaller than x_2 bar, I can quantify epsilon, which must be smaller than the difference between x_2 bar and x_1 bar.
I will take a fraction of this difference, say 0.9 times the difference for instance.
Here is epsilon, and if I choose x_0 in this neighborhood, x bar minus epsilon to x bar plus epsilon, then the sequence converges to x_1 bar. 
On the other hand, in the case when x_0 is too far away from x_1 bar, I cannot say anything.
But I observe in this case that the sequence diverges. The theorem does not say that the sequence diverges when x_0 is far away from x_1 bar. It says only that if the starting point x_0 is sufficiently close to x_1 bar, then the sequence will converge.
In the next part of this chapter, we will try to improve this method. ce rÃ©sultat, parce que le point critique ici c'est,
Indeed, there are two things
I don't master in theorem 8.3.
Is g'(x bar) strictly smaller than 1?
What is epsilon?
Eh bien, ces deux grandeurs ne me sont pas donnÃ©es de maniÃ¨re prÃ©cise.
We shall now see Newton's method which will allow us to remove the condition that g'(x bar) must be strictly smaller than 1.
