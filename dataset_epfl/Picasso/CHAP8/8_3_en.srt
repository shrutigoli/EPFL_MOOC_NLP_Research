00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:09,816
I remind you that g is a
given, continuous, function,

2
00:00:11,486 --> 00:00:16,986
and that I search x_bar which is a fixed point of g,
hence x_bar = g(x_bar).

3
00:00:17,543 --> 00:00:19,224
The method is the following:

4
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:24,720
we give ourselves x_0
and then for n=0,1,2 ...

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,442
we calculate x_n+1 from x_n
simply by setting x_n+1 equal to g(x_n).

6
00:00:30,442 --> 00:00:32,411
The question is:

7
00:00:32,411 --> 00:00:34,989
does the sequence x_n converge?

8
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:38,759
If it does converge, and since the
function g is continuous,

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,680
then it converges towards x_bar such
that g(x_bar) is equal to 0.

10
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,008
I suggest a little
graphical illustration:

11
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:52,393
I choose a function g which
has the following aspect.

12
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,540
So here is the x-y plane,

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,623
the first bisectrix,

14
00:00:57,623 --> 00:01:02,576
and the function g, which has
two fixed points.

15
00:01:02,576 --> 00:01:05,048
Here is the graph of
the function g.

16
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:08,460
There exist two x_bar such
that x_bar = g(x_bar).

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,765
The first is located here, I'll denote it x_1 bar,

18
00:01:11,765 --> 00:01:17,152
the second is found here, denoted x_2 bar. 

19
00:01:17,917 --> 00:01:27,219
I therefore have x_i bar equal
to g(x_i bar) for i=1,2.

20
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:35,446
I start from a point x_0
which is smaller than x_2 bar.

21
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:38,336
it is even between x_1 bar and x_2 bar,

22
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:44,807
so if x_0 is strictly smaller
than x_2 bar, what happens?

23
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:50,726
I calculate x_1, here

24
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:54,590
x_1 equal to g(x_0),

25
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,423
I report x_1 on the x axis,

26
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:04,313
I calculate afterwards x_2
equal to g(x_1),

27
00:02:04,613 --> 00:02:06,204
again I report the new
value on the x axis.

28
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:15,427
We observe that the
sequence converges

29
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,357
as n approaches infinity, towards x_1 bar. 

30
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:23,032
Therefore the limit as n approaches
infinity of x_n equals x_1 bar.

31
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:28,180
Starting from x_0, I computed x_1, x_2

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,433
and the x_n, when n increases,
get closer and closer to x_1 bar.

33
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:37,653
Now, what happens if I choose
x_0 larger than x_2 bar ?

34
00:02:38,003 --> 00:02:44,814
If x_0 is beyond x_2 bar, what happens ?

35
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:46,690
Well, for example, this x_0,

36
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:59,263
I compute x_1 equal to g(x_0) and
then carry it on the x axis,

37
00:03:00,493 --> 00:03:03,077
here it is,

38
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:06,011
next I compute x_2 equal to g(x_1)

39
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:10,527
and I observe that x_2 is
beyond x_1 and so on.

40
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:16,921
Well on this case,
we observe that the limit

41
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:23,790
as n goes to infinity of x_n equals
plus infinity; the sequence diverges. 

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,664
How to explain this experiment?

43
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:31,693
Well we need to 

44
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:37,979
study theorem 8.3 in the book.
