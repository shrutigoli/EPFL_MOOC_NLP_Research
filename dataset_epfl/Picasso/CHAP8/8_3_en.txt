I remind you that g is a given, continuous, function, and that I search x_bar which is a fixed point of g, hence x_bar = g(x_bar).
The method is the following: we give ourselves x_0 and then for n=0,1,2 ... we calculate x_n+1 from x_n simply by setting x_n+1 equal to g(x_n).
The question is: does the sequence x_n converge?
If it does converge, and since the function g is continuous, then it converges towards x_bar such that g(x_bar) is equal to 0.
I suggest a little graphical illustration:
I choose a function g which has the following aspect.
So here is the x-y plane, the first bisectrix, and the function g, which has two fixed points.
Here is the graph of the function g.
There exist two x_bar such that x_bar = g(x_bar).
The first is located here, I'll denote it x_1 bar, the second is found here, denoted x_2 bar. 
I therefore have x_i bar equal to g(x_i bar) for i=1,2.
I start from a point x_0 which is smaller than x_2 bar. it is even between x_1 bar and x_2 bar, so if x_0 is strictly smaller than x_2 bar, what happens?
I calculate x_1, here x_1 equal to g(x_0),
I report x_1 on the x axis,
I calculate afterwards x_2 equal to g(x_1), again I report the new value on the x axis.
We observe that the sequence converges as n approaches infinity, towards x_1 bar. 
Therefore the limit as n approaches infinity of x_n equals x_1 bar.
Starting from x_0, I computed x_1, x_2 and the x_n, when n increases, get closer and closer to x_1 bar.
Now, what happens if I choose x_0 larger than x_2 bar ?
If x_0 is beyond x_2 bar, what happens ?
Well, for example, this x_0,
I compute x_1 equal to g(x_0) and then carry it on the x axis, here it is, next I compute x_2 equal to g(x_1) and I observe that x_2 is beyond x_1 and so on.
Well on this case, we observe that the limit as n goes to infinity of x_n equals plus infinity; the sequence diverges. 
How to explain this experiment?
Well we need to study theorem 8.3 in the book.
