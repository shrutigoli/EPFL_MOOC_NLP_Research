Hello !
Today we will discuss chapter 8 of the book and we will solve numerically nonlinear systems of equations.
We will start with a nonlinear equation.
We shall introduce fixed point iterations followed by the method of choice,
Newton's method. 
Later on we will extend
Newton's method to nonlinear systems of equations.
We shall work on paragraphs
8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 in the book.
