1
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:06,709
The example which was
considered previously was the following.

2
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:10,053
Here is the graph of the function g,

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:12,991
the two fixed points x_1 bar and x_2 bar.

4
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,550
We observed that if x_0 was chosen
smaller than x_2 bar,

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,143
then the sequence x_n+1 equal to g(x_n) converges to x_1 bar.

6
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:29,204
If x_0 is larger than x_2 bar, the
sequence defined by x_n+1 = g(x_n) diverges.

7
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:34,990
Now we can apply theorem 8.3 to this function g.

8
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,122
This function g is C1,

9
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:45,632
I observe that g' at x_1 bar is strictly smaller than 1,

10
00:00:45,632 --> 00:00:52,898
 

11
00:00:52,898 --> 00:00:56,028
since the slope
of the first bisectrix is 1.

12
00:00:56,028 --> 00:00:58,320
la dérivée est strictement plus petite.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,057
Now I can apply theorem 8.3.

14
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:05,714
According to theorem 8.3,
there exists a positive epsilon,

15
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:07,997
I will quantify it shortly,

16
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:12,609
such that for all x_0

17
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,642
chosen in the interval

18
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:18,332
x bar plus epsilon  to x bar minus epsilon,

19
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:25,117
well the sequence defined by x_n+1 equal to g(x_n)

20
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:29,124
converges to x_1 bar.

21
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:34,419
This is what I observed since
I took x_0 smaller than

22
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:37,432
x_2 bar, I can quantify epsilon,

23
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:42,567
which must be smaller than
the difference between x_2 bar 

24
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:49,851
and x_1 bar.

25
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:54,178
I will take a fraction of this difference,

26
00:01:54,178 --> 00:02:00,308
say 0.9 times the difference for instance.

27
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:05,410
Here is epsilon, and if I choose x_0

28
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,925
in this neighborhood, x bar minus
epsilon to x bar plus epsilon,

29
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:11,223
then the sequence

30
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:12,728
converges to x_1 bar. 

31
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:17,203
On the other hand, in the
case when x_0 is too far away

32
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,434
from x_1 bar, I cannot say anything.
But I observe in this case that

33
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:25,626
the sequence diverges. The theorem
does not say that

34
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:28,856
the sequence diverges when x_0 
is far away from x_1 bar. It says only

35
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:31,992
that if the starting point x_0
is sufficiently close to x_1 bar,

36
00:02:31,992 --> 00:02:33,869
then the sequence will converge.

37
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:39,497
In the next part of this chapter,
we will try to improve this method.

38
00:02:39,497 --> 00:02:43,595
ce résultat, parce que
le point critique ici c'est,

39
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:47,777
Indeed, there are two things
I don't master in theorem 8.3.

40
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:53,167
Is g'(x bar) strictly smaller than 1?

41
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:56,137
What is epsilon?

42
00:02:56,137 --> 00:03:00,257
Eh bien, ces deux grandeurs 
ne me sont pas données de manière précise.

43
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:02,695
We shall now see Newton's method

44
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:05,507
which will allow us to
remove the condition

45
00:03:05,507 --> 00:03:09,192
that g'(x bar) must be strictly smaller than 1.
