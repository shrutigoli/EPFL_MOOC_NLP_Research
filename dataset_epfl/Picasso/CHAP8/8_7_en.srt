1
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:07,746
Up to now, we have considered a method
to find the fixed point of a function g.

2
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:11,259
Let x bar such that x bar equals g(x bar),

3
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:16,282
Starting from x_0,
we have computed

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,703
the sequence x_n from the scheme
x_n+1=g(x_n).

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:27,935
We have seen that

6
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:34,318
if g'(x) in absolute value
is strictly smaller than 1

7
00:00:34,516 --> 00:00:43,426
and if x_0 is in a neighborhood of x bar,
that means sufficiently close to x bar,

8
00:00:43,597 --> 00:00:47,312
-nous avons vu la définition mathématique
précise de ce 'suffisamment proche'-

9
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,504
then the sequence converges. 

10
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,509
However, 

11
00:00:53,509 --> 00:00:55,612
I don't know g'(x_bar)
since I don't know x_bar

12
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,712
and what "sufficiently close" means.

13
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:02,657
The Newton method will not allow us
to improve the "sufficiently close" condition

14
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:07,968
but will allow us to
remove the condition g'(x bar) smaller than 1.

15
00:01:08,243 --> 00:01:09,548
So the question is 

16
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:19,265
how to remove the condition 
g'(x bar) smaller than 1?

17
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:22,640
The answer is: use Newton's method. 

18
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:27,755
Newton's method is the following:
coming back to my initial problem,

19
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:34,419
which was to find x bar such that f(x) equals 0.
I come back to the initial problem

20
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:38,120
which was to find the zero of a function f,

21
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:45,622
here is the graph of the function f,

22
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,437
y equal to f(x),

23
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:51,402
I seek x bar such that f(x bar) is equal to 0.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,475
Assume x_n is available: I have calculated
the approximation x_n of x bar

25
00:01:56,752 --> 00:02:03,600
and now I want to compute x_n+1.

26
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,153
The procedure is the following:

27
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:14,775
I consider the derivative at point x_n
and search for the intersection

28
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:19,647
of this line with the x axis,

29
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:22,739
this will be x_n+1.

30
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:26,538
et ensuite je vais pouvoir calculer <i>x(n+2)</i>
et ainsi de suite.

31
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,073
What is the expression of x_n+1?

32
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:41,554
Here is x_n, this is f(x_n)
and the derivative f ' (x_n)

33
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,382
is the increment in y divided
by the increment in x.

34
00:02:48,312 --> 00:02:56,201
So the increment in y is f(x_n) minus 0, this distance here,

35
00:02:57,161 --> 00:03:01,630
and the increment in x,
beware of the sign,

36
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:04,931
is x_n minus x_n+1,

37
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:18,830
thus x_n+1 is equal to (x_n minus f(x_n)) divided
by f ' (x_n).

38
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,315
à partir de<i>xn</i>.

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:30,358
First remark: the Newton
method is a fixed point method

40
00:03:33,424 --> 00:03:42,112
to find the zero of f. I can write this 
expression as x_n+1 equal to g(x_n),

41
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:47,800
<i>x(n+1) = g(xn)</i>

42
00:03:48,899 --> 00:04:00,220
where the function g is defined for all
x in R by g(x) equal to ( x - f(x) ) / f ' (x).

43
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:06,417
If the function f is C2 and does not vanish


44
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:14,013
then the denominator is not zero,
I can compute g'(x).

45
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:21,095
To check if this fixed point method converges

46
00:04:21,801 --> 00:04:26,048
I have to compute g'
at x bar and check that

47
00:04:26,263 --> 00:04:28,116
is smaller than 1 in absolute value. 

48
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:33,652
I now compute g'(x) for any x, and I obtain

49
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:37,910
(f ' (x) )^2 in the denominator,

50
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:42,534
for the numerator I get

51
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:50,600
f ' (x) times the denominator that is 
(f ' (x))^2 minus the numerator

52
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,763
f(x) times the derivative of the
denominator f '' (x).

53
00:04:54,443 --> 00:05:04,022
Now, I note that f(x bar) equals zero. 

54
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,095
Therefore when computing g' at x_bar

55
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:17,128
this term vanishes

56
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:18,690
since f(x bar) is null,

57
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:31,056
it remains 1 - (f ' (x bar))^2 / (f ' (x bar))^2
that is 1-1 = 0.

58
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:39,090
0 is smaller than 1, so from
theorem 8.3 I know that,

59
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:47,607
if the starting point x_0 is sufficiently close to
the x bar, the zero of f,

60
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:54,896
then the sequence defined by

61
00:06:00,646 --> 00:06:03,388
x_n+1 equal to

62
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:14,312
x_n - f(x_n)  / f ' (x_n), this
sequence converges to x bar. 

63
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:20,970
More precisely, I will state theorem 8.4 from the book.
