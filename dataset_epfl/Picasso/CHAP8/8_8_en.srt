1
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:06,201
Let me now state theorem 8.4
from the book.

2
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,256
this theorem allows to better
understand Newton's method.

3
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:19,628
Let f from R to R be of class C2,

4
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:21,308
twice continuously differentiable. 

5
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:26,471
Let x bar be a zero of f, x bar
such that f(x bar) is equal to 0,

6
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:28,733
I assume that such a zero exists,

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:35,774
and I also assume that
f ' (x bar) is different from 0,

8
00:00:36,594 --> 00:00:39,034
c'est une quantité qui
intervient au dénominateur.

9
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:45,230
The claim is that there
exists an epsilon positive,

10
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,074
such that for all x_0, the
starting point for Newton's method,

11
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,633
between x bar minus
epsilon and x bar plus epsilon,

12
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:57,559
in other words x_0 is sufficiently close to x bar,

13
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,157
well in this case,

14
00:01:02,417 --> 00:01:08,315
the sequence defined by x_n+1

15
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:13,833
 equal to x_n minus f (x_n) / f ' (x_n),

16
00:01:15,113 --> 00:01:19,571
converges towards x bar;

17
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:22,011
this is in fact a consequence of theorem 8.3,

18
00:01:22,061 --> 00:01:23,395
the fixed point theorem.

19
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,620
There is some extra information,

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:32,563
furthermore the convergence is quadratic,

21
00:01:33,783 --> 00:01:35,504
which means very fast,

22
00:01:38,634 --> 00:01:43,505
more precisely, there exists C

23
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:45,766
such that for all n,

24
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:51,717
at step n+1, x bar minus x_n+1

25
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:56,269
is smaller or equal than C
times the error at step n,

26
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,793
(x bar minus x_n) squared.

27
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:02,045
voilà la fin du théorème.

28
00:02:05,245 --> 00:02:07,386
Before doing the proof

29
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,346
of the second part of the theorem,

30
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:14,373
we shall discuss

31
00:02:15,573 --> 00:02:18,807
about the quadratic convergence.

32
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:23,847

The theorem says that

33
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:29,797
if x_0 sufficiently close to x bar,

34
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:33,097
donc ça c'est la condition :
il existe un <i>ε</i>

35
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:39,375
tel que pour tout <i>x0</i> minoré
par <i>x</i> barre - <i>ε</i> et majoré par <i>x</i> barre + <i>ε</i>,

36
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:45,459
then the convergence is fast. 

37
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,695
An example situation,
to settle some ideas

38
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:55,879
say that C=1,

39
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,478
and x bar minus x_0 the initial error, 

40
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:02,614
donc l'erreur, je choisis un <i>x0</i>,

41
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:05,298
the initial error is 0.1.

42
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,422
Now I compute x bar minus x_1,

43
00:03:09,712 --> 00:03:15,602
which is smaller than (x bar minus x_0) squared,
thus 10^-2,

44
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,931
the error at step 2, x bar minus x_2,
is smaller than

45
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:25,756
C times the error at the previous step,
(x bar minus x_1) squared, thus less than 10^-4,

46
00:03:26,636 --> 00:03:32,663
the error at the third step, x bar minus x_3,
is smaller than 10^-8,

47
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:40,175
therefore in three iterations I have
approximated the zero up to 10^-8.

48
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:42,792
The convergence is therefore very fast.

49
00:03:43,032 --> 00:03:45,234
Now there exists cases where

50
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:52,929
Newton's method does not converge. 

51
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,754
For example, consider the following case.

52
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:02,150
I consider the function f

53
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,307
given by x^3 minus x minus 1,

54
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:10,144
 a java applet is available,

55
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,471
to illustrate the calculations. 

56
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:18,128
From an initial guess x_0, here, 

57
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:21,671
you arrive very rapidly, by
taking the tangent, here,

58
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:28,063
you reach x bar very quickly.

59
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,808
On the other hand,
from an x_0 here,

60
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,914
by applying Newton's method,

61
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:36,444
you take this tangent,

62
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:41,726
x_1 will be here,
next x_2 will be here,

63
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:46,793
so you will either oscillate
between two values, or even diverge. 

64
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:53,713
Therfore, we observe that the condition 
on x_0 being sufficiently close to x bar,

65
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:54,479
qui est ici,

66
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,284
this condition cannot be removed.

67
00:04:58,514 --> 00:05:00,926
Now we can prove the result. 

68
00:05:01,056 --> 00:05:02,300
Proof: 

69
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,658
Donc, j'ai tout à l'heure calculé,

70
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:08,952
I already said that Newton's method
was a fixed point method,

71
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,659
x_n+1 equals g( x_n ),

72
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,905
with g(x) equal to x minus f(x) / f ' (x).

73
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:21,868
J'ai calculé--

74
00:05:22,858 --> 00:05:29,541
Let's note that is f' (x bar) is different from 0,

75
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:33,993
it remains different from 0 
in a neighborhood of x bar.

76
00:05:34,253 --> 00:05:38,536
I already compute the derivative

77
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:45,189



78
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,665
g ' (x) = 1 - ( f ' (x)^2 - f '' (x) ) / ( f ' (x)^2 )

79
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:57,431
divisé par <i>(f'(x))²</i>,

80
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:03,697
and I observed that g ' (x bar)
was equal to 0,

81
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,419
which is strictly smaller than 1.

82
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,586
Therefore, from theorem 8.3,

83
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:17,548
there exists an epsilon positive
such that, if my starting point x_0

84
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:20,904
is between x bar minus
epsilon and x bar plus epsilon,

85
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:25,916
then the sequence given by
x_n+1 equal to g(x_n),

86
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:30,902
wheer g(x_n) = x_n - f(x_n) / f ' (x_n),

87
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,394
this sequence converges. 

88
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:39,421
We still need to prove the
quadratic convergence,

89
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,364
the second part of the result;

90
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,789
how can we do?

91
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,941
I compute a Taylor expansion,

92
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,712
I compute f(x bar) equal to

93
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:58,654
f(x_n) plus

94
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:01,665
(x bar - x_n) f ' (x_n), plus

95
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:07,963
(x bar - x_n)^2 * f '' (eta) divided by
2 factorial.

96
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:11,545
fois <i>f''</i> en un point intermédiaire <i>ξ</i>.

97
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:14,601
Here is x bar

98
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:19,874
the zero of f,

99
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:23,706
here is x_n,

100
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:30,694
here we have the interval x bar
minus epsilon to x bar plus epsilon

101
00:07:31,594 --> 00:07:35,085
in which I placed the initial starting point x_0,

102
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,848
et je sais que l'erreur
diminue à chaque itération.

103
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:41,352
eta is somewhere

104
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:47,286
between x bar and x_n, 

105
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,711
but I also know that it is between
x bar minus epsilon and x bar plus epsilon.

106
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:56,212
Now I can calculate x bar minus x_n+1 in absolute value. 

107
00:07:57,762 --> 00:07:58,787
<i>x barre - xn</i>

108
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:02,132
<i>x barre - xn+1</i> en valeur absolue, pardon.

109
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:07,747
It is equal to (x bar - x_n)^2

110
00:08:08,547 --> 00:08:09,622
divided by 2,

111
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:14,658
I have divided this relation,
here, by f ' (x_n),

112
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:21,438
and I still have f '' (eta) in absolute value,

113
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,195
divided by f ' (x_n) in absolute value. 

114
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:30,251
Now, 

115
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,009
I must prove that there exists C

116
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,581
such that for all n,
thus C does not depend on n.

117
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:42,156
The candidate for C is
half f '' (eta) times f ' (x_n),

118
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,958
where eta is between x bar and x_n,

119
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,981
but this quantity depends on x_n, thus n.

120
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,970
But I can bound this quantity

121
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,114
by (x bar - x_n)^2 times 1/2,

122
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:02,376
times the largest value

123
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,367
on the interval x bar minus epsilon
to x bar plus epsilon,

124
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:08,866
and the denominator by the smallest value

125
00:09:08,866 --> 00:09:11,853
on the interval x bar minus epsilon
to x bar plus epsilon,

126
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:18,509
thus maximum of
f '' (x) in absolute value,

127
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,874
over

128
00:09:22,444 --> 00:09:26,299
the interval x bar minus epsilon
to x bar plus epsilon,

129
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:30,950
divided by the smallest value,

130
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,061
hence the min of f ' (x) in absolute value,

131
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:36,849
for x in 

132
00:09:37,049 --> 00:09:42,497
[x bar minus epsilon, x bar plus epsilon],

133
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:48,857
and this the C in the theorem,

134
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:51,962
C is equal to 1/2 times the maximum
of the second derivatives

135
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,243
divided by the minimum of the first derivatives

136
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:57,351
on the interval x bar minus epsilon
to x bar plus epsilon.

137
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:59,283
I have proven the theorem.
