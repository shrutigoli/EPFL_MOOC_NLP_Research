00:00:03,703 --> 00:00:06,195
The proof of this
theorem is very instructive,

2
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:07,697
and we will study it.

3
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:08,850
" Proof "

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,370
Here is the function g',

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:17,553
the graph of g',

6
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:21,021
I know that g'(x bar) is
smaller than 1 in absolute value,

7
00:00:21,551 --> 00:00:26,817
the graph of the function g',

8
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:30,167
I know that in x bar,

9
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:35,201
g'(x bar) is strictly smaller than 1.

10
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:37,835
Since the function g' is continuous,

11
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:43,825
I claim that this function
g' remains smaller than one

12
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:45,414
in a neighbourhood of x bar,

13
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:49,898
that is, there exists
a positive epsilon

14
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:55,376
and chi positive
but strictly smaller than 1,

15
00:00:55,866 --> 00:00:58,270
such that for all x

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,564
between x bar minus epsilon
and x bar plus epsilon,

17
00:01:04,494 --> 00:01:07,808
g'(x) in absolute value

18
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:12,402
is smaller or equal to chi,

19
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,916
which is strictly smaller than 1. 

20
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:16,949
I can draw the
corresponding figure,

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,853
here is the neighbourhood,

22
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:23,732
here x bar plus epsilon,

23
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:28,206
and this is x bar minus epsilon,

24
00:01:28,966 --> 00:01:34,373
in this neighborhood, the function
is smaller or equal to chi,

25
00:01:34,443 --> 00:01:36,375
which is strictly smaller than 1.

26
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:44,775
Choose x0 be in this neighborhood,

27
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:48,029
x bar minus epsilon
to x bar plus epsilon,

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,047
here for instance.

29
00:01:52,957 --> 00:01:56,412
We can do the following calculation.

30
00:01:58,462 --> 00:02:04,263
I want to calculate x bar minus x1,

31
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:07,481
why x bar minus x1, because I want
to prove that x bar minus x_n+1

32
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,016
is smaller or equal than something strictly smaller than 1

33
00:02:11,026 --> 00:02:12,056
times x bar minus x_n,

34
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,369
therefore I start with x1.

35
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:16,969
Take x bar minus x1, in absolute value,

36
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,686
x bar is by definition equal to g(x bar),

37
00:02:19,686 --> 00:02:22,170
since it is a fixed point of g,

38
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,217
and x1 is equal to g(x0).

39
00:02:27,117 --> 00:02:30,245
Now I use the fundamental
theorem of calculus;

40
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:35,401
well this is equal to the integral
between x0 and x bar

41
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,746
of g'(s) ds.

42
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:42,344
This is smaller or equal to
the length of the interval,

43
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:43,467
in absolute value,

44
00:02:44,317 --> 00:02:49,343
x bar minus x0,

45
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:55,472
times the maximum of g'(s),

46
00:02:56,422 --> 00:02:59,112
which is the integrand.
First I stated that

47
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,799
the absolute value of the
integral is smaller than

48
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,405
the integral of the absolute value.

49
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,697
I take the integrand g'(s)

50
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:10,988
and search for the maximum 

51
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:17,119
over the interval [x bar,x0].

52
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:19,291
In the figure,

53
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,658
here isthe maximum 
over the interval [x bar,x0].

54
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:25,942
But on this interval,

55
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:30,836
I know that the function
is smaller or equal to chi;

56
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:36,180
therefore I can state that x bar minus x1

57
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,339
is smaller or equal than x bar minus x0

58
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,294
times chi, which is strictly smaller than 1. 

59
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,699
Lets carry on,

60
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,636
this time for x bar minus x2, I start over:

61
00:03:52,496 --> 00:03:55,409
x bar is equal to g(x bar), this comes
from the definition of a fixed point,

62
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,399
x2 is equal to g(x1),

63
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:03,656
which is the integral
between x1 and x bar

64
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:07,791
of g'(s) ds taken in absolute value. 

65
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,946
As previously, I bound this quantity,

66
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,851
here I have x bar minus x1,

67
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:16,979
and I must take the maximum

68
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:21,196
on the interval [x bar , x1] or [x1 , x bar].

69
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:27,462
Previously, I said that the
error x bar minus x1

70
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:30,260
was strictly smaller than x bar minus x0,

71
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,623
this means I can put x1
here for example in the graph.

72
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:41,285
I repeat, x bar minus x0 is larger than x bar minus x1.

73
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:49,323
The maximum, on this interval,

74
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:52,581
of g'(s) on the interval [x bar , x1]

75
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:55,619
is again smaller or equal,

76
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:02,486
so x1 is in this interval and the derivative is smaller than chi,

77
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:06,562
and hence this will be smaller or equal than x bar minus x1 times chi.

78
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:08,316
And so on, you can observe

79
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:10,932
that this methodology can
be recursively repeated,

80
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:13,336
and I get that x bar minus x_n+1

81
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:18,840
is smaller or equal to x bar minus x_n times chi.

82
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,566
Et donc, comme cette quantité-là,

83
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:26,652
Well by induction I get that,

84
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,866
x bar minus x_n+1

85
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:34,980
is smaller or equal to x bar minus x0
times chi to the power n+1,

86
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,994
since chi is included in (0,1),

87
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:42,152
as n approaches infinity,
this quantity approaches 0.

88
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:44,530
I have therefore proven that

89
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,749
the sequence defined by x_n+1
equal to g(x_n) converges,

90
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,843
and that this convergence is linear.

91
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:52,886
This means that the error at step n+1

92
00:05:55,076 --> 00:05:57,522
is strictly smaller than the error at step n.

93
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,813
Now I suggest to come back to,

94
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:06,256
the previous example. 

95
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:12,958
Lets illustrate this theorem
using the previous example.

96
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,717
the example from the previous page.
