Hello !

2
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,295
Today we will discuss
chapter 8 of the book

3
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:10,287
and we will solve numerically 

4
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:13,165
nonlinear systems of equations.

5
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,859
We will start with a nonlinear equation.

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:18,560
We shall introduce fixed point iterations

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,792
followed by the method of choice,

8
00:00:20,792 --> 00:00:22,339
Newton's method. 

9
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:25,265
Later on we will extend
Newton's method

10
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,198
to nonlinear systems of equations.

11
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:32,064
We shall work on paragraphs
8.2, 8.3 and 8.4 in the book.
