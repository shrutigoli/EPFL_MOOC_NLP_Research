1
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:06,531
Lets start by a nonlinear equation.

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:09,436
The problem we wish to
solve is the following:

3
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:12,585
Let f be a  continuous function

4
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:16,884
defined from R to R,

5
00:00:17,424 --> 00:00:19,792
we are searching for x_bar

6
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:24,630
such that f(x_bar) is equal to 0.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,108
Here is the graph of the function f
in the x-y plane:

8
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,414
y is equal to f(x).

9
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,809
I search x_bar such that
f(x_bar) is equal to 0.

10
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:42,612
We say that x_bar is the
zero of the function f,

11
00:00:43,226 --> 00:00:45,774
I will write the problem
in another equivalent way:

12
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:51,214
that is I seek x_bar,

13
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:57,396
the same x_bar as this one,
such that x_bar = g(x_bar).

14
00:00:59,228 --> 00:01:01,890
In this case we say that x_bar
is a fixed point

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,337
of the function g. 

16
00:01:04,779 --> 00:01:08,521
I draw the graph of the function g

17
00:01:09,261 --> 00:01:10,626
in the x-y plane.

18
00:01:10,626 --> 00:01:13,327
You see here the first bisectrix,

19
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,783
and here the graph of the function g,

20
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:21,138
and I seek x_bar

21
00:01:21,638 --> 00:01:23,915
such that x_bar is equal to g(x_bar).

22
00:01:25,444 --> 00:01:28,688
How to get from the function f
to the function g? 

23
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,342
Well, for example,

24
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:35,966
we define g(x) equal to x minus f(x),

25
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:39,591
so that when I evaluate
this function in x_bar,

26
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:45,495
I get g(x_bar) equal to x_bar minus
f(x_bar) which is null.

27
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:53,837
I could also define g(x) equal to x minus

28
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:54,786
alpha times f(x) for any non-zero alpha.

29
00:01:56,386 --> 00:02:00,189
Well in this case, like previously, 

30
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,632
x_bar is a zero of f(x) if and only if

31
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:07,006
x_bar is a fixed point of g.

32
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,438
In the case of Newton's method
we can observe that,

33
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:14,056
and this will be done later on,

34
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:17,164
that alpha is nothing but

35
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:21,742
1 over the derivative of f.

36
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:26,644
The method I suggest to find x_bar

37
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,641
a fixed point of g
is the following.

38
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,950
It is called a fixed point method. 

39
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,794
Given x_0 in R, 

40
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:38,468
which is an approximation of x_bar,

41
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:40,922
for example, here is x_0.

42
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:46,946
We shall calculate x_1 equal to g(x_0).

43
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,259
Here we have x_0, 

44
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,502
and this is x_1 equal to g(x_0).

45
00:02:56,472 --> 00:03:02,776
I carry x_1 on to the x axis, here is x_1.

46
00:03:03,276 --> 00:03:09,443
Next I calculate x_2 equal to g(x_1),

47
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:11,137
and by continuing on this figure,

48
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:14,987
x_2 equal to g(x_1) will be here. 

49
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:19,569
I carry on the x-axis
the value of x_2.

50
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,686
In general, for a given x_n,

51
00:03:22,686 --> 00:03:26,408
I can calculate x_n+1
defined as g(x_n).

52
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:34,175
The first remark is that the
sequence x_n converges,

53
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:38,892
and if the function g is continuous

54
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:45,601
then the limit when n goes to infinity
of x_n satisfies,

55
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:48,150
let x_bar be this limit,

56
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,969
x_bar is the limit of x_n as
n goes to infinity,

57
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,944
then x_bar is equal to g(x_bar). 

58
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:59,964
This means I have effectively found
x_bar which is a fixed point of g.

59
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:02,928
Why? well it is sufficient to take
the limit in the left hand side

60
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:06,187
and the limit in the right hand side
of this equality, since g is continuous

61
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:08,235
I can swap the limit
and the function g,

62
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:11,597
and I get x_bar equal to g(x_bar).

63
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:14,595
Now the fundamental question is:

64
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:16,999
Does the sequence converge?

65
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:23,334
The sequence x_n, defined by x_n+1 equal to g(x_n),

66
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:25,256
does it converge? 

67
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:32,317
The answer, we shall see later
in theorem 8.3,

68
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:35,313
depends on the function g at x_bar,

69
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:39,659
x_bar being the fixed point of g, 

70
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:41,795
and on the initial guess x_0.
