00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:07,182
Here is a short
summary of chapter 8.

2
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:13,526
Firstly we considered a zero of a function f,

3
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:16,026
x bar such that f (x bar ) = 0.

4
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,940
We wrote this zero as
a fixed point,

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:23,845
x bar, still the same x bar, is such that
x bar = g(x bar),

6
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:28,155
and we have used the fixed point method
x_n+1 = g(x_n).

7
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,625
We have proven that
this method converges

8
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:34,447
provided |g'(x bar)|  is smaller than 1, 

9
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:38,786
and provided the initial guess x_0 
is sufficiently close to x bar. 

10
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:42,366
We can't get rid of this
second condition,

11
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44,574
it is restrictive

12
00:00:44,574 --> 00:00:46,058
since we do not know x bar,

13
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:49,517
we only know that we must
start sufficiently close to x bar,

14
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,131
which is unknown. 

15
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,574
On the other hand, we can
avoid the condition

16
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:56,846
|g'(x bar)| is smaller than one,

17
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,445
using Newton's method:

18
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:01,974
x_n+1 = x_n - f(x_n) / f ' (x_n). 

19
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:04,449
We have proven that Newton's
method converges

20
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:07,240
if the starting point x_0 is
sufficiently close to x bar.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,633
cette condition reste.

22
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,814
Furthermore, we have proven that
this method converges very quickly

23
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:15,669
if the derivative f'(x bar)
is different from 0.

24
00:01:15,669 --> 00:01:18,075
We have then extended this method

25
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:21,523
to nonlinear systems of equations.

26
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:25,375
<i>x barre vecteur</i> tel que
<i>f vecteur de x vecteur = 0 vecteur</i>

27
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,340
Newton's method can be written:

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,786
the jacobian matrix at x^n, the matrix
containing all the derivatives,

29
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:37,601
times the vector x^n minus x^n+1,

30
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:45,647
x^n+1 is unknown, equals f (x^n)
which is known as soon as x^n is known. 

31
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,422
At each iteration, a linear system 
has to be solved,

32
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:53,084
matrix times unknown vector
equal a known vector,

33
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:58,135
to obtain x^n+1 from x^n. 

34
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,844
To conclude, in order to solve 
a nonlinear system of equations,

35
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:04,999
we need to solve
many linear systems.
