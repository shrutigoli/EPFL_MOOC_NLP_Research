1
00:00:00,259 --> 00:00:05,506
We'll now study the algorithm of 
LU decomposition

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,849
with a tridiagonal matrix A.

3
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:13,452
So we start with the tridiagonal
matrix from before.

4
00:00:13,452 --> 00:00:18,691
It is the matrix with 3's on the diagonal,

5
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:25,396
-1 just below the diagonal
and -2 just above.

6
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:32,290
That's the matrix A.

7
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:40,364
I now want to write it as the 
product of matrices L and U.

8
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:54,061
The matrix L is a lower 
triangular matrix,

9
00:00:54,966 --> 00:01:01,446
so I'll note L1, L2, ..., LN, 
the diagonal coefficients.

10
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:10,053
Then the subdiagonal m1, m2, 
until m(n-1),

11
00:01:10,624 --> 00:01:12,683
L is a lower triangular matrix

12
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:15,059
so the upper 
triangular part is 

13
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,504
only contains 0's.

14
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:20,863
Because of this tridiagonal 
structure on the matrix A, 

15
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:23,973
we have 0's outside
those 3 diagonals,

16
00:01:23,973 --> 00:01:29,457
so this matrix will be 
lower triangular,

17
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:33,004
with only a main diagonal and a 
diagonal below.

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,308
Likewise with the matrix U.

19
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:39,433
We decided that it'll have 1's
on the diagonal,

20
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,477
it is upper triangular
so only has 0's

21
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:47,194
on the lower triangular part,

22
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:51,732
and this matrix only contains one
vector above the diagonal.

23
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:57,129
I wrote its entries U1, U2, ..., UN-1

24
00:01:57,129 --> 00:02:00,108
and the other entries are 0.

25
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:08,050
As said before I must identify
 the coefficients of A

26
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,891
with the coefficients of the product
LU in the appropriate order.

27
00:02:12,904 --> 00:02:23,009
Here I identify the coefficients
of the first column of A

28
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,202
so the non-zero coefficients
which are 3 and -1,

29
00:02:25,202 --> 00:02:30,246
I will get the coefficients of
the first column of L.

30
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:38,614
So, 3 equals 

31
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,898
the inner product between the 
first line of L

32
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,989
and the first column of U.

33
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:50,861
I simply get L1*1, 
so L1.

34
00:02:50,861 --> 00:02:52,761
Now I have L1.

35
00:02:52,761 --> 00:03:01,513
Then -1 equals the inner product
of the second line of L

36
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:07,177
with the first column of U, 
it's the coefficients 21.

37
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:11,589
I obtain m1*1=-1

38
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,858
So I have m1 and L1.

39
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:23,180
Then I must identify the 
coefficients of the first line of A

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,771
with the first line of the product LU

41
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:32,165
and I claim that I'll get the coefficients
of the first line of U,

42
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:34,550
so here the entry U1.

43
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:39,735
I claim that identifying
this coefficient

44
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,321
I will get that entry.

45
00:03:43,346 --> 00:03:47,324
Here, -2 is the first line, 
second column.

46
00:03:47,324 --> 00:03:52,254
I must do the inner product between
the first line of L

47
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:54,411
and the second column of U

48
00:03:54,411 --> 00:04:05,338
and I get -2 = L1*U1,

49
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,033
-2 = L1 * U1 
and I get 

50
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:19,400
U1= 2/L1.

51
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,761
Let's continue : 

52
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:32,895
I must identify the coefficients of the second column of A

53
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:37,363
with the corresponding entries 
in the product LU.

54
00:04:37,363 --> 00:04:44,408
I claim that I'll obtain the entries
of the second column of L.

55
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:53,692
3 is the result of the inner product

56
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:58,522
between the second line 
and the first column.

57
00:04:58,544 --> 00:05:10,802
3= m1*U1+L2*1.

58
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:17,827
I get that L2=3*m1*U1.

59
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:27,738
Let's continue, here the entry -1,
third line, second column.

60
00:05:27,757 --> 00:05:29,819
I do the inner product : 

61
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:32,704
third line and second column, 

62
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:36,210
which will give me -1=m2.

63
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,574
So, observe 
that things repeat

64
00:05:43,775 --> 00:05:47,404
since -1=m1, -1=m2,

65
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:52,134
I can compute m2 if 
we so desire

66
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:54,483
to check that things repeat.

67
00:05:54,516 --> 00:06:00,994
If I calculate the coefficient,

68
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:05,111
here the entry -2, 

69
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:08,062
it's the third line, second column,

70
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:15,761
so here the second line, 
third column, 

71
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:25,488
I'll get -2 = L2*U2,

72
00:06:25,517 --> 00:06:29,573
and before I had -2=L1*U1.

73
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:32,592
Now I can write an algorithm.

74
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:47,912
The algorithm will give me the vectors

75
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:53,557
L, N-vector of coefficients Lj, 

76
00:06:54,377 --> 00:07:00,278
the vector n, the diagonal 
of the matrix L,

77
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:03,702
m the lower diagonal of the matrix L,

78
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:09,767
it is a vector of length N-1, 
with entries mj

79
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,201
and then u is the upper diagonal of the matrix U,

80
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:19,092
is a (N-1)-vector with entries Uj.

81
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:26,062
Let us start the algorithm.

82
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:38,775
L1=3, that is
the initialisation.

83
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,683
Then I do a loop, 

84
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:50,667
for i going from 1 to N-1.

85
00:07:50,674 --> 00:07:55,639
So I calculated L1, I have
to compute m1,

86
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,117
so in the loop, 

87
00:07:58,117 --> 00:08:06,440
mi=-1, m1=-1, m2=-1, 

88
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:12,683
then once I have m1
I can compute U1.

89
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:18,730
Ui=-2/Li,

90
00:08:22,394 --> 00:08:25,217
here U1=-2/L1,

91
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,466
U2=-2/L2.

92
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:35,082
And then once I have m1 and U2,

93
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,291
I can compute L2.

94
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:40,259
When I have mi and Ui I 
can compute L(i+1),

95
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:51,598
L(i+61)=3-mi*Ui.

96
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,600
I check the subscripts 
are correct:

97
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:59,028
L2 = 3-m1*U1, 
that's correct,

98
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:00,675
and for the last subscript, 

99
00:09:00,675 --> 00:09:03,135
(always check the first and the last),

100
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:05,307
when i=N-1,

101
00:09:05,307 --> 00:09:09,356
I will compute LN=3-m(N-1)*U(N-1),

102
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,205
u indice N moins 1

103
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:12,754
so the algorithm is correct.

104
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:18,088
Again, two remarks concerning
this algorithm:

105
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:22,021
it requires O(N) operations,

106
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,437
since it must go through a loop
from 1 to N-1,

107
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:35,095
and again, can I have divisions by 0 ?

108
00:09:36,556 --> 00:09:39,198
The answer is the same as before: 

109
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,656
if all the principal submatrix of A 
are regular, 

110
00:09:54,717 --> 00:09:57,570
that is to say invertible,

111
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,288
then I do not have a division by 0.

112
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:15,138
To solve a linear
 system Ax=B

113
00:10:15,138 --> 00:10:16,896
all is left to do is solve

114
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:19,944
the two linear systems 
Ly=b

115
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:21,279
and Ux=y

116
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,603
but those are easy operations 
since we are dealing with

117
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:29,058
lower and upper triangular
 matrices.
