1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:03,750
Let's now go to 
chapter 5 of the book :

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,696
LU decomposition, 
Choleski decomposition.

3
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:10,305
I want to solve the linear system 
Ax=b,

4
00:00:10,305 --> 00:00:17,425
I will decompose the matrix A
(NxN matrix),

5
00:00:20,815 --> 00:00:28,954
as a product of a matrix L
and a matrix U.

6
00:00:31,392 --> 00:00:34,998
All those matrices are NxN matrices.

7
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,655
The matrix A has as entries
a11 on the first row,

8
00:00:39,655 --> 00:00:43,042
...a1N first row, last column,

9
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,942
here the first column ends at aN1

10
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:51,808
and here is the last entry aNN,

11
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:54,816
that's our matrix A.

12
00:00:54,816 --> 00:00:59,925
As for matrices L and U: 
we already talked about the matrix U,

13
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:03,969
it is an 

14
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:06,423
upper triangular matrix

15
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:08,240
and we decided before 

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,563
that we'll want 1's on the
diagonal,

17
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,495
0 in the lower triangular part.

18
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:21,787
Here we have the entries 
u12 and u1N

19
00:01:21,787 --> 00:01:27,748
until u(N-1,N)

20
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:38,267
The matrix L is a lower triangular 
matrix (or just lower matrix).

21
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:44,476
So the upper triangular part 
only contains 0,

22
00:01:44,476 --> 00:01:50,442
and here I have the coefficients
L11, L22 until LNN here

23
00:01:50,442 --> 00:02:00,507
with here the entry LN1,
last line first column.

24
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:03,414
Thus we know A

25
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:08,239
and the goal is to find the
matrices L and U,

26
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,665
upper and lower triangular matrices,

27
00:02:10,665 --> 00:02:12,485
such that A=LU.

28
00:02:12,485 --> 00:02:15,212
Again, we're given the matrix A

29
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,620
and what we're looking
for the matrices L and U

30
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,640
such that A=LU.

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,848
If we do such an operation,

32
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,849
then it is easy to solve a
linear system with A as a matrix. Why? 

33
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,835
Recall that we want to solve 
the linear system Ax=b.

34
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:36,032
We have A = LU,

35
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,903
so we must solve LUx=b,

36
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:44,357
and we will split 
this linear system into 2.

37
00:02:44,357 --> 00:02:51,576
Let y=Ux,

38
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:56,654
I must solve Ly=b
which is easy : 

39
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:03,331
recall that L is a lower triangular
matrix

40
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:08,233
so when I solve Ly=b, 

41
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:13,173
I will start from the top.

42
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:19,708
I have L11*y1=b1 then I will 
compute y2 and so on until the bottom,

43
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:23,781
so solving Ly=b when
L is lower triangular

44
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:25,326
is an easy task.

45
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:30,471
Once I found y, I must
solve Ux=y.

46
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:36,326
I now know y since 
I solved Ly=b,

47
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:40,242
so solving Ux=y
is also a simple task,

48
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,090
we saw that earlier ; 

49
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,432
We have U an upper 
triangular matrix,

50
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:48,774
here we have 0's and 
here 1's on the diagonal,

51
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:52,117
and so we know the vector y,

52
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:56,385
since we solved Ly=b

53
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:59,962
and now we must solve 
Ux=y,

54
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:04,197
and now we'll start from the bottom,

55
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:09,910
we have xN=yN and so on
up to the top.

56
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,471
The question we have now

57
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:17,804
is how to find the coefficients
of L and U? 

58
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:23,765
It is quite simple, to find
 the coefficients of L and U.

59
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:27,765
We identify the coefficients
of the matrix A,

60
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:32,593
with the coefficients of the 
product LU in the appropriate order.

61
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:44,339
To know the coefficients 
of matrices L and U,

62
00:04:48,435 --> 00:05:00,959
we identify the entries of the matrix A
and the matrix LU in the following order.

63
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:10,823
What we need to remember, is the order
in which we identify these coefficients.

64
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:20,517
The first step is as follows :

65
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:45,627
We identify the entries 
of the first column of A and LU.

66
00:05:46,727 --> 00:05:48,927
Here is the first line of A.

67
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,697
If I identify coefficients of the 
first column of A

68
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:55,034
with the coefficients of the 
first column of the product LU,

69
00:05:55,034 --> 00:06:03,030
I claim that we get 
the entries

70
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:13,720
of the first column of 
the matrix L here.

71
00:06:15,182 --> 00:06:19,608
Indeed, let's do an example 
with the first coefficient,

72
00:06:19,608 --> 00:06:26,120
we have the coefficient A11, 
which is the product of the first line of L

73
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,959
with the first column of U.

74
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,388
Observe that when I do the product of 
the first line of L with the first column of U

75
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:37,388
I must do the inner product
of this line with that column,

76
00:06:37,388 --> 00:06:40,259
I simply obtain L11 * 1

77
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:48,966
so I can write 
A11=L11 * 1,

78
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:51,873
so I found L11.

79
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:55,550
I can now find L12.

80
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,427
Here I have A12.

81
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:09,834
I must do the inner product
between the second line of L

82
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:12,693
and still the first column of U.

83
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:21,267
So here I have the coefficients

84
00:07:21,803 --> 00:07:32,102
A21, here is L21, 
so when I calculate

85
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:39,651
I get A21 = L21 * 1.

86
00:07:39,651 --> 00:07:47,737
So A21 = L21 * 1 
and so on.

87
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:51,829
So if I identify the coefficients
of the first column of A

88
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,758
and the first column of LU,

89
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:58,720
I get all the coefficients
of the first column of L.

90
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:04,869
Now I continue, 
step 2.

91
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:16,229
This time we identify
the coefficients of the first line of A

92
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:21,278
with the coefficients of the first 
line of the product LU,

93
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:26,251
and now I want to get the
entries of the first line of U.

94
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:33,901
I take all the entries here.

95
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:39,007
And I'll identify them with 
the product LU,

96
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:42,957
and I will get all the entries
that are here.

97
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:46,283
For example, for the first one : 

98
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:51,942
we have the entry A12,

99
00:08:52,804 --> 00:08:58,308
I must do the inner product
of the first line of L

100
00:08:59,051 --> 00:09:02,263
and the second column of U.

101
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,045
I will find the entry U12

102
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,399
and so on, on all the entries.

103
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:14,947
When I identify A1N, the 
inner product between the first line of L

104
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,680
and the last column of U,

105
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,302
I will get the coefficient U1N.

106
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,777
Then we continue with the same method.

107
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:40,858
Step 3: identify the entries
of the second column of A

108
00:09:42,838 --> 00:09:45,283
and the second column of LU,

109
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:51,364
and get the coefficients of the 
second column of L.

110
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:57,376
Here are all the entries
that I'll identify.

111
00:09:58,082 --> 00:10:02,059
It's those in the second column of A

112
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:09,525
and I'll find the entries
of the second column of L

113
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:15,273
so all the entries from L22 to LN2,

114
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,872
and I continue likewise
until the end.

115
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:22,496
I identify these entries

116
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:25,620
and will obtain those entries

117
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,911
and then these ones 
to get those,

118
00:10:27,911 --> 00:10:31,125
and so on until the end,

119
00:10:32,061 --> 00:10:35,584
and I'll have all the entries of 
L and U.

120
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:39,683
We'll now study

121
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,899
this LU decomposition

122
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,067
on a tridiagonal matrix A.
