00:00:01,303 --> 00:00:03,854
Hello and welcome to chapter 4.

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:07,103
Today we'll discuss chapters 
4, 5, and 6 of the book:

3
00:00:07,103 --> 00:00:09,734
solving linear systems.

4
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:12,453
The problem we want to solve is 
the following:

5
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:15,879
Given N a positive integer

6
00:00:16,218 --> 00:00:18,946
supposed to be large,

7
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:23,215
N goes from 10 to 10^9, a billion,

8
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:28,333
given a matrix A

9
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:32,454
with N rows and N columns,

10
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:40,326
we'll note the entries by aij, 
both i and j going from 1 to N,

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:44,687
I assume that this matrix 
is regular,

12
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,544
regular is the numerical analysis term for

13
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:52,391
invertible, that is
A^-1 exists

14
00:00:52,391 --> 00:00:55,636
(we never compute A^-1),

15
00:00:55,636 --> 00:01:01,358
or the determinant of A
is different from 0 and so on,

16
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,809
here are other characterisations 
of a matrix being invertible,

17
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,694
we're also given

18
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:16,820
a vector b with N coefficients
its entries are denoted bj

19
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,232
j going from 1 to N.

20
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:26,186
Those are the data of the problem.

21
00:01:27,146 --> 00:01:33,882
And we're looking for x a vector 
with N entries, denoted xj

22
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,414
j going from 1 to N,

23
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:40,127
such that Ax=b.

24
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:46,717
In the book,

25
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:51,299
chapters 4, 5 and 6 are about this problem.

26
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:59,732
In this course we'll only present
chapters 4 and 5.

27
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:03,135
Those are direct methods.

28
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:10,109
The keywords are : Gaussian elimination,

29
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:17,223
it is a method you already used
in the linear algebra course,

30
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:21,671
we'll study again this
 method and another one

31
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:26,840
which is called: LU decomposition
of a matrix A, thus A=LU,

32
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,498
and finally the Choleski decomposition,

33
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:33,248
that is  A=LLt with Lt the transpose of L
and A is a symmetric positive definite matrix.

34
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:36,330
Why do we call those methods 
direct methods?

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,135
It's because the solution of Ax=b is obtained

36
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:44,199
after a finite 
number of operations.

37
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:58,535
Counting the number of operations
 is something important

38
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:02,480
because solving a linear
 system is costly,

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,582
which means it requires a lot
of operations,

40
00:03:04,582 --> 00:03:08,269
so we have to wait a long
 time to obtain the solution.

41
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:10,472
So, we must be able to answer the question:

42
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:13,670
how many operations have to be done
to obtain the solution of the linear system?

43
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,274
With direct methods x is obtained
after a finite number of operations

44
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:23,173
unlike the iterative methods,

45
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:28,681
which is the goal of chapter 6

46
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:32,094
but we won't see this chapter
in this course.

47
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:39,012
Shortly, what is an iterative method?
We want to solve Ax=b,

48
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:42,989
we take a starting guess, vector x0,

49
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:49,563
then from x0 we compute 
a first approximation x1 of x

50
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,632
and so on. In general

51
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:56,421
given xn we compute x(n+1)

52
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,341
which should be a better
approximation of x,

53
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:01,446
the solution of Ax=b.

54
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:05,971
The natural question about 
iterative methods is:

55
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:12,091
Does xn when

56
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:16,161
n goes to infinity

57
00:04:16,161 --> 00:04:21,621
converge to the solution x of 
the linear system Ax=b ?

58
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:28,608
The following example
can be for instance considered.

59
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:35,010
I want to solve Ax=b,

60
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:41,366
knowing xn, I can compute
the residual b-A*xn.

61
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:46,266
If b-A*xn=0 then I found the solution
of the linear system

62
00:04:46,266 --> 00:04:49,512
otherwise I'll computer x(n+1)

63
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:55,492
by writing x(n+1)=xn+α*(b-A*xn),

64
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:59,799
where α in ℝ is a nonzero parameter.

65
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:04,657
Then the question is:
for which values of α

66
00:05:04,657 --> 00:05:08,759
does the method converge, which means

67
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,977
the limit of xn when n goes 
to the infinity is x

68
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:19,347
and this for all right hand side b

69
00:05:19,347 --> 00:05:21,865
and for all starting point x0.

70
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:24,337
That is the focus of 
iterative methods,

71
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:27,407
how many iterations are needed
to obtain convergence?

72
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:29,375
We do not know whether the method 
will converge or not,

73
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,711
therefore important 
theoretical questions

74
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:34,459
must be answered
when considering iterative methods.

75
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:39,266
In this course we'll focus on direct methods,

76
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:42,523
Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition.
