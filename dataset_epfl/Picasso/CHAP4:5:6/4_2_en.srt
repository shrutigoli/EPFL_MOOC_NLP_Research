1
00:00:00,713 --> 00:00:02,713
We'll start this lesson 
by recalling

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:06,800
Gaussian elimination, you have already
introduced this method in your linear algebra course.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,162
We'll see this method again 
in a more algorithmic form.

4
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:13,827
So we want to solve the 
linear system Ax=b

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,039
where A is a NxN matrix.

6
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:20,721
Here is A, with N rows and N columns,

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,004
its first entry is a11

8
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:26,783
and goes to a1N, first row,
 Nth column

9
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:31,281
Then we have the first
 column here,

10
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,689
so the entries a11 to aN1,

11
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:38,151
and finally, at the last row, 
last column

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:39,812
we have the coefficient aNN.

13
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,893
Here is our matrix A.

14
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:50,676
I am looking for the unknown
vector x such that Ax=b

15
00:00:50,836 --> 00:00:53,746
with entries x1, x2, ..., xN,

16
00:00:54,226 --> 00:00:57,150
and b the right side of the equation

17
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,861
with entries b1, b2, ..., bN.

18
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:04,052
Here are x and b.

19
00:01:05,002 --> 00:01:07,463
The principle of 
Gaussian elimination

20
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:10,133
is to transform the linear system

21
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:13,174
making linear combinations of
rows and columns,

22
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,755
in a linear system
that I'll write,

23
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:20,407
a linear system with N lines and 
N columns,

24
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:24,847
I'll call the matrix of the system, U

25
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:27,630
U stands for 

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,465
upper triangular matrix,

27
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:37,095
this upper triangular matrix has 1's 
on its diagonal

28
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:40,899
and 0 below.

29
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:43,087
The solution of the linear system,

30
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:47,405
is still the vector x
with entries x1, x2, ..., xN,

31
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:52,104
and the right side of the equation changed,

32
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:54,554
I'll call it d, with entries 
d1, d2, ..., dN.

33
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,072
Here is d, and here is x.

34
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:05,107
And the coefficients of the matrix U

35
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,662
are U12 in first row, second column,

36
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,934
until U1N at the first row, 
Nth column

37
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:17,166
and so on we have the entry U(N-1)N.

38
00:02:21,146 --> 00:02:24,215
So the goal is

39
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,199
starting with Ax=b

40
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,892
to end up with this system Ux=d

41
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:30,859
in N steps.

42
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:34,024
The first step is as follows.

43
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:42,155
Here is the matrix A,

44
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:43,531
what we do is

45
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:49,325
put a 1 here, 
instead of coefficient a11,

46
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:52,826
by simply dividing the line by the 
first entry a11,

47
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:54,293
provided it's nonzero,

48
00:02:55,903 --> 00:03:02,818
then we put a 0 here at the coefficient a21,

49
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:05,341
and so on on the first column,

50
00:03:05,341 --> 00:03:08,517
we do several operations 

51
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,999
to get zeroes on the 
first column.

52
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,244
That's the first step.

53
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:14,947
Then comes the second step,

54
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:22,410
The matrix is basically the same

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,360
except that we have 1, 0, 0, ... 
on the first column

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,462
so in the second step we'll put a 1
instead of the entry a22,

57
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:38,838
we'll do so by dividing the line
by this entry a22,

58
00:03:39,168 --> 00:03:42,243
then we'll make a 
linear combination

59
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,415
of the second and third lines

60
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:48,408
to get a zero here, 
and so on until the end of the second column,

61
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:49,805
so that's the second step.

62
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:55,524
And we can imagine that in 
the last step, the Nth one

63
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:58,764
I will end up with

64
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,037
 a linear system Ux=d

65
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:05,069
as this one there,
Ux=d.

66
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,983
Thus, the matrix A was
 transformed in a matrix U

67
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,769
with here 1, 0, 0, ....

68
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,229
here 1,0,..., and 0 down here,

69
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:15,839
until the end,

70
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,578
at the last but one column we have 1, 0,

71
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:21,341
and on the last column we have 1.

72
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,276
So that's our matrix U,

73
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:28,931
la matrice que vous obtenez
du système linéaire <i>U<b>x</b> = <b>d</b></i>,

74
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,431
that we now have to solve.

75
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:35,094
Solving the linear system Ux=d 
is easy

76
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:39,327
simply because we start 
with the last line,

77
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:41,391
and get xN=dN,

78
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:43,265
then on the last but one line we get

79
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:49,190
x(N-1)= d(N-1) minus

80
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,905
this term here, which is u(N-1)N

81
00:04:52,905 --> 00:04:56,061
times xN, which we know

82
00:04:56,061 --> 00:04:56,879
and so on.

83
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,818
So that solves easily our upper
 triangular linear system.
