1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,775
Let's study the decomposition LLᵀ

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:05,650
with the example of a tridiagonal matrix.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,651
So the matrix A

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:14,422
is the tridiagonal matrix with 2's 
on the main diagonal,

5
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:20,031
-1 on the diagonal subdiagonal

6
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,656
and -1 on the diagonal superdiagonal.

7
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:31,333
We will first show that this matrix A
is symmetric and positive definite,

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:36,020
we know that

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,634
ithere is a decomposition LLᵀ,

10
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:45,680
where L is a lower triangular matrix, 
and consequently Lᵀ is an upper matrix,

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,424
moreover, the coefficients on the diagonal 
of L are stricly positive.

12
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:56,207
I will note those entries L1, L2, until LN

13
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:02,304
and so for Lᵀ I will also have
L1, L2, ..., LN.

14
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,833
The matrix L is lower triangular,

15
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:07,622
so there are 0's in the 
upper triangular part,

16
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:11,590
and so here 0's on the lower
triangular part of Lᵀ.

17
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,081
Actually, the lower part of L
reduces to a subdiagonal.

18
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:18,576
The subdiagonal of L

19
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:22,769
has coefficients m1, m2, 
until m(N-1)

20
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:28,173
and so Lᵀ is reduced to a
superdiagonal m1, m2, 

21
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:32,367
until m(N-1).

22
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,421
Here is L(N-1).

23
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:39,957
First of all, let's show 
that this matrix A

24
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,990
is indeed symmetric positive definite.

25
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,899
We take any x
in ℝᴺ

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,639
and compute xᵀAx,

27
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:56,992
So xᵀ is the vector with entries 
x1, x2, until xN,

28
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:58,690
laying down.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,300
We have the matrix A, 
with 2 on the diagonal, 

30
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,864
-1 on the subdiagonal, 
-1 on the superdiagonal, 

31
00:02:08,924 --> 00:02:12,473
and the vector x, 
x1, x2, ..., xN.

32
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:16,201
If I do the computation of xᵀAx
I obtain

33
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,403
2*x1² plus

34
00:02:18,863 --> 00:02:21,492
2*x2² 

35
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:23,639
donc il y a <i>2x1²</i>,

36
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,108
then, 

37
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:30,657
here I have -x1*x2,

38
00:02:31,177 --> 00:02:33,954
donc j'ai <i>- x1 x2</i>, et en fait, j'ai

39
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:39,732
-2*x1*x2+2*x2²,

40
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:45,700
-2*x2*x3, 

41
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,849
+2*x3², until the end,

42
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:53,608
where there is -2*x(N-1)*xN,

43
00:02:54,248 --> 00:02:57,487
and the last term will be 2xN².

44
00:02:57,917 --> 00:03:02,764
I'd like to show that 
xᵀAx is nonnegative,

45
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:05,994
so a possibility is to 
make squares appear,

46
00:03:09,204 --> 00:03:13,510
2x1² is x1²+x1²,

47
00:03:14,326 --> 00:03:18,192
We have the double product -2*x1*x2,

48
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:20,063
and I have x2²,

49
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:23,159
so I can keep this term, 
I observe a square,

50
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:30,507
then I'll have x2²-2*x2*x3+x3²,

51
00:03:30,507 --> 00:03:33,348
and so on until the last term

52
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,626
which will be here

53
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:42,444
x(N-1)²+2*x(N-1)xN+xN², 

54
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:44,504
and again xN².

55
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:50,049
So observe now that
squares appear,

56
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:54,323
x1²+(x1-x2)²

57
00:03:54,933 --> 00:04:01,827
+(x2-x3)² + ... etc...

58
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:08,132
(x(N-1)-xN)²+xN².

59
00:04:08,752 --> 00:04:13,123
So xᵀAx is indeed a sum of squares, 

60
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,180
so this term is nonnegative.

61
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,698
Moreover, xᵀAx =0

62
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:26,616
if and only if all those terms are 0, 
since they are squares.

63
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:28,375
So I'll have x1=0,

64
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:34,591
if x1=0 I'll get x2=0, and 
so on until I get xN=0.

65
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:38,566
Obviously this matrix is 
symmetric,

66
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:40,589
so I've shown that

67
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,972
this matrix A 
is sdp.

68
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:48,967
Let's move to the Cholesky decomposition algorithm.

69
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:56,053
I told you that we have to identify
 the coefficients of A and LLᵀ

70
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:57,385
in the right order, 

71
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:59,701
so I will start with the 
first column.

72
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:03,176
The entries of the first
column of A

73
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,998
will give me the coefficients of
the first column of L, 

74
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:11,528
indeed the coefficient 2
here is the entry 1,1 of the matrix A,

75
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:16,834
I must do the inner produt between 
the first line and the first column, 

76
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:22,262
so I get 2=L1²,

77
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:25,278
so L1=√2.

78
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:29,327
I continue, I get

79
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:34,596
the coefficients of the
second line and first column, 

80
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:37,165
-1 equals

81
00:05:38,655 --> 00:05:42,432
the second line times the first
column, m1*L1.

82
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:52,553
I get m1=-1/L1.

83
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:56,192
And so on

84
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:02,810
I identify the coefficiens here

85
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,420
of the second column of A, 

86
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,360
with the coefficients of the 
second column of the product LLᵀ,

87
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,797
and I'll get the coefficients
of the second column of L.

88
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:17,412
I continue, 

89
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:23,646
I have 2, the entry 2,2
of the matrix A

90
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,155
which equals

91
00:06:25,155 --> 00:06:31,236
the inner product of this line
with this column, 

92
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:36,506
which is m1²+L2²,

93
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:43,814
I get L2 = √(2 - m1²),

94
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:45,982
and so on.

95
00:06:46,182 --> 00:06:48,475
Now I can write

96
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:52,732
the LLᵀ decomposition algorithm.

97
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:53,855
« Algorithm »

98
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:58,158
This algorithm uses
the vector L, 

99
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:03,391
the vector of entries 
L1, L2, ..., LN, 

100
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,079
the vector m, 

101
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:11,751
which is the vector with entries
m1, m2 until m(N-1).

102
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,323
et le vecteur <i><b>u</b></i>, qui est --
et c'est tout <i>(<b>u</b> barré)</i>.

103
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:22,415
So I initialize the algorithm, 

104
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:29,699
the initialization is 
L1=√2,

105
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:37,093
and then I do a loop for 
i from 1 to N-1,

106
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:44,658
From L1, I will compute m1,

107
00:07:44,658 --> 00:07:46,746
from Li I will compute mi,

108
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:49,504
which equals -1/Li.

109
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,053
Then I am able to compute l(i+1)

110
00:07:56,163 --> 00:08:02,076
which equals √(2 - mi)².

111
00:08:03,086 --> 00:08:04,380
That is our algorithm, 

112
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,893
as previously, we can check
several things.

113
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,798
The first one is:

114
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:16,450
is there is division by 0 or 
a negative square root?

115
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,838
- the square root of a 
negative number.

116
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:28,318
The answer

117
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:33,157
is no.

118
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:42,186
Why? Since the
matrix is sdp,

119
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:43,181
it is regular,

120
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,623
and what I did not mention is,

121
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:50,053
that if this this matrix is 
symmetric positive definite,

122
00:08:50,053 --> 00:08:54,057
then all the principal submatrix
are also regular.

123
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,883
Finally if you get

124
00:08:57,653 --> 00:08:59,951
the square root of 
a negative number,

125
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:01,691
then by contraposition,

126
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:06,762
then the matrix A
isn't symmetric positive definite.

127
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:10,898
So there are no divisions by 0
and no square root of negative numbers.

128
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:13,302
The number of operations


129
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,202
is still O(N),

130
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:22,893
which means it's doubled 
each time we double N,

131
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:27,122
simply because there
is only one loop from 1 to N.
