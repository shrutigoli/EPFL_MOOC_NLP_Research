1
00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:05,207
Let's move to the LLᵀ decomposition,
also called Cholesky decomposition,

2
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:08,837
which is applied in the case where

3
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:11,217
the matrix A is a symmetric 
positive definite matrix.

4
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:13,597
First of all, let's 
give a definition.

5
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:17,916
Let A be a NxN matrix.

6
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:25,804
This matrix is symmetric positive
definite,

7
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,273
if the three following 
conditions are met.

8
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:41,363
First, A is symmetric,

9
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:46,343
A=Aᵀ (transpose of A) in the sense where
the entries aij=aji

10
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:51,463
for all i,j between 1 and N.

11
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,593
Second condition: 

12
00:00:55,743 --> 00:01:00,323
if I take any vector x
in ℝ^N,

13
00:01:01,913 --> 00:01:04,863
and compute xᵀAx,

14
00:01:05,253 --> 00:01:08,203
then this quantity is always positive
or 0.

15
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:11,659
Let me remind you that here,  xᵀAx

16
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,255
is the same at the inner product
between x and Ax,

17
00:01:19,905 --> 00:01:24,223
that is, the sum for i from 1 to N,

18
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,476
of the ith entry of the vector xi

19
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:34,739
with the ith entry of the vector Ax,

20
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,303
which is the sum over 
all the subscripts i,j from 1 to N,

21
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:43,509
so the sum over i, from 1 to N, 
sum over over j from 1 to N

22
00:01:44,029 --> 00:01:48,825
of aij*xi*xj.

23
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:55,953
Thus the second condition is that
xᵀAx is nonnegative.

24
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,333
c'est un scalaire.

25
00:01:57,793 --> 00:02:04,023
And the last condition,
xᵀAx =0

26
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:08,643
if and only if x is the 0 vector.

27
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:15,459
So if A is a symmetric definite positive 
matrix,

28
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,779
we will abbreviate symmetric 
positive definite with  "sdp",

29
00:02:20,109 --> 00:02:23,175
if A is sdp, 

30
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:24,761
then

31
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:32,369
we can show that there exists
a unique decomposition A=LLᵀ,

32
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,979
so there exists a lower matrix L,

33
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:38,549
with diagonal entries Lii
that are stricly positive,

34
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,660
such that A=LLᵀ,

35
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,041
again L is lower triangular.

36
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:52,474
Donc triangulaire inférieure,
<i>lower metrics</i> en anglais.

37
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:54,664
I can draw the following.

38
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:56,064
Here is the matrix A, 

39
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:04,105
with entries a11, ..., a1N on the 
first line,

40
00:03:05,745 --> 00:03:11,095
a11, ..., aN1 on the first column, 
until aNN.

41
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:17,130
If A is sdp, this matrix,

42
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,593
can be written as the product of L

43
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:22,927
which is a lower matrix,

44
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,667
since it is lower triangular, 

45
00:03:26,597 --> 00:03:31,567
it has coefficients L11, L22, ..., LNN, 

46
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:33,167
that are strictly positive.

47
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:37,805
The upper triangular part has only zeroes, 

48
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,425
and here we have the coefficient LN1, 
and so on.

49
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:46,075
And then Lᵀ is the transposed of L.

50
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,335
Donc transposé.

51
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:55,512
The diagonal entries are the same, 
L11, L22, ...,LNN.

52
00:03:56,664 --> 00:04:01,414
La partie triangulaire supérieure
qui avait des coefficients nuls

53
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:04,604
se retrouve dans la partie, cette fois-ci,
triangulaire inférieure,

54
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,234
So the lower part of L^T has only 0's,

55
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:13,034
And here are the coefficients 
LN1, and so on.

56
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:19,295
To get the Cholesky (or LLᵀ)
decomposition algorithm

57
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:22,255
we need to do 
half the operations

58
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:24,415
needed for the LU 
decomposition algorithm.

59
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:30,055
So we identify the coefficients
as before.

60
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:36,792
We identify the entries

61
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:43,039
of A and LLᵀ in the following order : 

62
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,136
As before, when I identify 
all the entries of 

63
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:02,186
the first column of A 
with the entries 

64
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:05,636
of the first column of 
the product LLᵀ,

65
00:05:05,826 --> 00:05:11,676
I will get all the coefficients of the
first column of L.

66
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:16,676
This time I can 
directly 

67
00:05:17,356 --> 00:05:23,826
identify the coefficients of
the second column of A

68
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,386
with the coefficients of the second
column of the product LLᵀ

69
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:34,616
to get the coefficients of the 
second column of L.

70
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,586
We do half the work, 
and so on

71
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:41,706
If I take the third column, 

72
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:48,906
I will get the coefficients 
of the third column of LLᵀ

73
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:51,626
and in the end, I will have identified 
all the entries,

74
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:57,516
say, half of the coefficients of A, 
the lower triangular part

75
00:05:57,516 --> 00:06:00,136
with the coefficients of 
the product LLᵀ,

76
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:03,856
and I will have all 
the coefficients of L, 

77
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:07,296
and so, since Lᵀ is the 
transpose of L,

78
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,526
we have all the entries of L
and  Lᵀ.

79
00:06:10,098 --> 00:06:14,398
We'll now consider the algorithm in the
case of a tridiagonal matrix.
