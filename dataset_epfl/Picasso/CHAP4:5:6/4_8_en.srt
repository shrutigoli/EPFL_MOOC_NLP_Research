00:00:01,306 --> 00:00:05,727
Here is a summary of chapters 4,5,6 : 
Resolution of linear systems.

2
00:00:05,727 --> 00:00:09,415
Given a matrix A and a 
vector b, 

3
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:12,498
we want to solve the linear 
system Ax=b,

4
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:20,381
so here N, the number of lines
and columns of A is large,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,683
in applications, N will go from 10
to 10^9 (a billion).

6
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:33,786
So we have direct methods,

7
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:35,753
or iterative methods.

8
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:37,801
The direct methods are :

9
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,479
Gaussian elimination (chapter 4),

10
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:54,792
or the LU decomposition
for any matrix, 

11
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:57,006
or LLᵀ in the case of 
a symmetric positive

12
00:00:57,027 --> 00:00:59,436
definite matrix, that's chapter 5.

13
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,603
Then we have iterative methods : 
we still didn't study this chapter

14
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:06,227
which is important in practice,

15
00:01:06,227 --> 00:01:11,022
since if we solve partial 
differential equations in dimension 3

16
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,443
we have to use the 
iterative methods.

17
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:24,950
It is important in practice but not
studies in this course.

18
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:31,514
Let's go back to chapter 4 :
Gaussian elimination.

19
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:36,823
Here is our linear system Ax=b,

20
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,747
we want to transform 
this linear system

21
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:49,476
in an equivalent one, Ux=d.

22
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,445
Equivalent means that I have the same
vector x of unknowns,

23
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:54,907
x1,x2,...,xN.

24
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,642
We changed the right side of 
the equation and

25
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:57,944
changed the matrix.

26
00:01:57,944 --> 00:02:02,954
The matrix U is the upper 
triangular matrix with 0's

27
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:06,071
on the lower triangular part,

28
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,765
we decided to put 1's
on the diagonal, 

29
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,966
and its entries in 
the upper triangular part.

30
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:14,885
Then it is easy to solve
the linear system Ux=d.

31
00:02:15,306 --> 00:02:21,083
To end up with this linear system Ux=d,

32
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,170
we proceed in N steps.

33
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,037
First step, we put a 1
on the diagonal instead of the

34
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:35,220
coefficient, and 0 on the 
other entries of the first column.

35
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,967
On the second step we put a 1 on the 
entry 2,2

36
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,977
and then 0's, and so on

37
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:45,771
until the last but one step 
where we have 1 0,

38
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:47,979
or the last one where we have a 1.

39
00:02:47,979 --> 00:02:52,370
Then we saw chapter 5

40
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:58,682
the LU decomposition, here 
we wanted to write A as the product

41
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:02,862
of a lower triangular matrix L

42
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:08,715
with 0's in the upper 
triangular part

43
00:03:09,261 --> 00:03:14,952
and a matrix U, which is 
upper triangular with 0's 

44
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:18,474
on the lower triangular part, where
we chose to have 1's on the diagonal.

45
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:27,680
We get the coefficients of the
matrices L and U by identifying

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,388
the entries of the matrix A 
with the entries of the product LU

47
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:37,929
and identifying the entries
in the first column of A

48
00:03:37,929 --> 00:03:40,774
with the coefficients of the first
column of LU

49
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:42,670
we get all those entries.
(first column of L)

50
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,704
Then, identifying entries 
of the first line of A

51
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,568
with the first line of the 
product LU

52
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:53,734
we'll get the coefficients of 
the first line of the matrix U

53
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:56,039
and so on.

54
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,606
We get those entries, 

55
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,881
we identify those entries

56
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:04,292
and get the second column of U, 
and so on until the end.

57
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,164
In the case of a symmetric positive 
definite matrix, the A=LU decomposition

58
00:04:10,164 --> 00:04:13,819
will be a decomposition A=LLᵀ 
(Lᵀ the transpose of L)

59
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:18,750
the coefficients Lij on the
 diagonal of L

60
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,793
are positive which
simplifies the algorithm.

61
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:25,916
This algorithm requires roughly 
twice as less operations.
