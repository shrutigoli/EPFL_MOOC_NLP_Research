00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:04,710
Hi there

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,090
and welcome back.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,549
In this video we will briefly

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,980
discuss how the market

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,620
opportunity navigator complements

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,630
other well-known business tools

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,690
and was actually designed

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,499
to work seamlessly

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,550
with them.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,889
As we mentioned before the

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,840
market opportunity navigator

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,000
is an easy to apply business tool

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,210
that helps you to identify

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,380
and assess potential opportunities

15
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,850
in a systematic

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,679
and rigorous manner as you

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,600
choose which options to focus on.

18
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,890
It not only gives you the ability

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,599
to deliberately plan

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,830
your strategy

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,199
but also to reflect on

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:45,950
your learning

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,990
and to adjust your strategy

24
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,819
as you progress through your
learning

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:50,820
journey.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,620
To make this learning process

27
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,460
broader

28
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,500
and even more complete

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,809
we recommend that you use the market

30
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,270
opportunity navigator together

31
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,950
with other key methods

32
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,150
and business tools.

33
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,260
Specifically,

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,599
the navigator is designed to

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,860
work seamlessly

36
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,570
with the Business Model

37
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,490
and Value Proposition Canvases

38
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,259
created by Alexander Austovade

39
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:18,090
and Eve Vienia

40
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,150
and with the Lean's Startup
Methodology

41
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,130
created by Eric Reese

42
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,320
and Steve Blank.

43
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,140
While the canvases are

44
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,870
outstanding frameworks for planning

45
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
your strategy, the Lean's

46
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,010
Startup is a key method for

47
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,700
validating your strategy.

48
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,299
Together with the Market Opportunity

49
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,970
Navigator they form

50
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,709
a powerful suite of

51
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,569
tools that clearly lays

52
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,190
out the planning

53
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,259
and validation processes as

54
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,759
you strive to find your promising

55
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,670
path.

56
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:53,559
In fact these tools work

57
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,780
together like cogwheels

58
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,030
with one reinforcing the other

59
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,129
as they provide different aspects

60
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,439
that are all essential for setting

61
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,590
of strategy.

62
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:04,900
So,

63
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,630
let us briefly examine this

64
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,950
reinforcement.

65
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,960
The business model canvas

66
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,060
and the value proposition canvas

67
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,979
offer valuable frameworks

68
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,439
that help you to find out

69
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,990
how you create value for your
customers

70
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,239
and how you create value

71
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,220
for your firm.

72
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,290
The Navigator which provides

73
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,059
the macro view of the landscape

74
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,520
of opportunities has

75
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,929
an essential level of analysis

76
00:02:32,515 --> 00:02:34,480
with the micro planning

77
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,830
of the Business Model

78
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,720
and the Value Proposition Canvases.

79
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,890
Together these tools

80
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,440
provide the comprehensive planning

81
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,629
that is required for finding your

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,670
most fertile ground.

83
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,190
The Lean's Startup Methodology

84
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,199
offers an important validation

85
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,170
process for discovering

86
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,790
and developing customers

87
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
through rapid experimentations

88
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,110
and continuous pivoting.

89
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,050
The combination of the Navigator

90
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,300
with the Lean's Startup Methodology

91
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,279
were two powerful process

92
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,900
for validating a winning strategy.

93
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,440
First,

94
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,660
the navigator provides an

95
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,240
ongoing tool for planning,

96
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
reflecting,

97
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,419
and adjusting as you

98
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,099
go through rapid Lean's cycles

99
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,720
of experimenting.

100
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,340
And second,

101
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,679
the navigator makes sure that

102
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,629
you will always keep track of the

103
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,549
broad picture in addition

104
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,370
to the path that you're currently
testing.

105
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,410
Overall,

106
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,750
we strongly recommend

107
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,060
that you combine these different
tools

108
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,880
as you search for a promising
strategy.

109
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,120
In fact this suite

110
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,919
of business tools can help

111
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,449
you understand fundamental

112
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,150
questions in a manner

113
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,889
that none of the tools by itself

114
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,240
would allow you to.

115
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,940
So the hole

116
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,889
is actually greater than

117
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,220
the sum of its parts.

118
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,320
To understand this in more details

119
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,320
we will discuss how to use the
navigator

120
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,330
in concert with these tools

121
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,830
in week five of this MOOC.
