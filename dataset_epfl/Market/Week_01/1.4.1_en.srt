1
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,580
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,500
Now that you know what this course
is

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,119
all about, we're going to show you
some

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,650
of the practical details

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,520
and deliverables.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,300
Yes.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,390
So as we already said before

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,490
this course will take you by the
hand

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,379
as we go through the three steps of
the Market

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,000
Opportunity Navigator.

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,480
There is a Chinese proverb

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,910
that says "Give a man a fish

13
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,830
and he'll eat for the day,

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,840
teach a man how to fish

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,279
and he will eat for the life".

16
00:00:32,835 --> 00:00:33,629
In case he likes fish.

17
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:33,847
In case he like fish.

18
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,380
This is exactly what we

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,820
aim to do in this course.

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,650
We want to give you a tool

21
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,629
that will help you whenever you need
to

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,940
make this profound strategic
decision.

23
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,340
You can always go back to your

24
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,120
toolbox

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,710
and implement it

26
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,109
and to make sure that you make

27
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,700
the right choice.

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,770
So the goal for this course

29
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:56,939
is pretty straightforward,

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,219
we sketched out four of

31
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,180
the main goals here.

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,459
So at the end of the course you will
actually be

33
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,410
able to tackle this all important
market

34
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,900
opportunity decision in a very
structured

35
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,310
and full-time manner.

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,349
Yes. You will be able to make

37
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,419
an informed decision that will

38
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,020
increase your chances

39
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,839
on focusing on the promising market

40
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,830
opportunity.

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,690
You will be able to balance focus

42
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,519
and flexibility two very critical

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,230
elements as we have pointed out.

44
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,269
And lastly, you will be able to
develop

45
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,250
the proper mindset

46
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,470
for setting a winning strategy

47
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,290
one that nurtures openness

48
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,810
and receptiveness to

49
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,190
adaptation. Adaptation.

50
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes.

51
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,741
To accomplish these goals we
designed this MOOC

52
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,639
to a five weeks each dealing

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,960
with a separate topic.

54
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,389
We go on as an introduction to the

55
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,860
Market Opportunity Navigator

56
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,240
and to the course itself.

57
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,009
Week 2: We will deal

58
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,110
with the first step of the Navigator

59
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,549
and will teach you how to generate

60
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,460
your Market Opportunity Set.

61
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,149
Week 3: We will deal

62
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,220
with the second step of the
Navigator

63
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,980
and it will teach you how to
evaluate the attractiveness

64
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,570
of your market opportunities.

65
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,429
Week 4: We will deal

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,500
with the third step of the Navigator

67
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,749
and will teach you how to design
your

68
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,460
Agile Focused Strategy.

69
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,499
And then finally in Week 5:

70
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,630
we will summarize the implications

71
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,370
and the benefits of the Navigator

72
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,530
to help you use it more effectively.

73
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,260
So let's look at each week in more
detail.

74
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,939
Yeah we are just about to finish

75
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:23,910
up week one,

76
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,420
small congratulations already.

77
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,879
If you remember what we did we
talked about

78
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,424
the challenges in commercializing
innovations.

79
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,170
We talked about this important

80
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,969
choice that you do in
commercialization

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,460
which is the market opportunity
choice.

82
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,649
We introduce to you the Market
Opportunity

83
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,600
Navigator. And we are just

84
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,429
about to give you the course
overview.

85
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:45,639
Yes. In week

86
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:46,250
two

87
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,369
we will discuss how to generate your
Market

88
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,299
Opportunity Set.

89
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,369
At the end of this week you will be
able

90
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,560
to describe your core abilities

91
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,630
or technology in

92
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,000
its own right detached from

93
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,709
any product that you have in mind so
that

94
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,969
you will be able to think

95
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,370
and discover more applications

96
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,829
and identify different types of

97
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,030
customers.

98
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,850
In order to open up your your
creativity.

99
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,050
Exactly, and the result will be

100
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,570
your Market Opportunity Set.

101
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,859
In Week 3: we will focus on how

102
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,720
to evaluate market opportunities.

103
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,240
At the end of the week you will be
able to rate

104
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,949
each market opportunity along two
key

105
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,910
dimensions.

106
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,679
No. 1: The potential inherent

107
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,030
in the market opportunity.

108
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,649
No. 2: The challenges associated

109
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,150
with the market opportunity.

110
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,429
And then you would place this in the
two

111
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,200
by two metrics shown here on the
screen

112
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,270
which will allow you to

113
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,219
not only see where each opportunity
is place

114
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,169
but to get a visual impression of
how

115
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,250
these opportunities met

116
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,270
relative to each other.

117
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,940
So we get a big picture view

118
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,804
of your Opportunity Set.

119
00:03:46,157 --> 00:03:48,310
In week 4:

120
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,569
We will focus on how to design your

121
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,140
Agile Focused Strategy.

122
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,410
At the end of this week you'll be

123
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,269
able to understand the major

124
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,489
consideration for choosing your
primary

125
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,290
Market Opportunity

126
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,750
and also how to evaluate

127
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,489
other alternatives and check if they

128
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,620
are suitable to be

129
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,000
your growth

130
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,350
or backup options,

131
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,569
so that you can decide which options
you're

132
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:12,770
going to keep open

133
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,320
and which one you're going to place
in storage.

134
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,900
The outcome of this week

135
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,969
will be your Agile Focus Strategy

136
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,009
which you can then depict on the
Agile Focus

137
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,000
Dartboard.

138
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,720
In Week 5:

139
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,000
We are going to focus on the ongoing
implications

140
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,460
and benefits of the market
opportunity navigator.

141
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,509
At the end of the week,

142
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,429
you will first understand

143
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,530
how the Agile Focused Strategy

144
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,689
influences other key decisions in

145
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,920
new venture creation

146
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,450
and in the innovation process.

147
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,609
Second, you will have learned how to
benefit

148
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,590
from the Market Opportunity
Navigator

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,720
over time in an ongoing manner.

150
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,000
And third, you will have understood
how the

151
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,160
Market Opportunity Navigator will
works

152
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,639
actually in concert

153
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,440
with other business tools

154
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,660
so to create a richer more

155
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,789
extensive learning experience for

156
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,060
you.

157
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,459
In terms of deliverables you

158
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,240
will have

159
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,470
quizzes at the end of each topic

160
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,090
and you also have to submit three

161
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,949
assignments based on the three steps

162
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,160
of the Market Opportunity Navigator.

163
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,110
This would be peer graded
assignments

164
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,940
and you will have to submit all of
them

165
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,320
in order to pass this course.

166
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,329
We designed those deliverables in a
way

167
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,310
that you are running journey

168
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,630
is getting more profound

169
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,490
and that you actually make sure that
you understand

170
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,464
the key steps of the navigator.

171
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:25,299
Exactly.

172
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,239
Now, if you have an idea in

173
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,740
mind for a startup

174
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,179
or if you work in a company

175
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,309
that is looking for additional
market

176
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,409
opportunities you can base your

177
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,300
assignments on these

178
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,990
ideas.

179
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,690
However, if you don't have any idea

180
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,119
you can still do the assignments

181
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,489
based on case studies that we

182
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,400
will provide you in the course.

183
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,900
So, it doesn't really matter

184
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,260
if you have an idea already,

185
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,019
it doesn't really matter if you're
working in an existing

186
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,640
firm or in a startup.

187
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,450
If you want to improve your skills
in commercializing

188
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,009
new technology innovation

189
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,419
bring it to the market,

190
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:02,549
