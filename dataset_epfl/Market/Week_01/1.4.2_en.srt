00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,010
Hi there.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,379
One last thing before we actually

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,479
dive into the details of

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,880
how to implement the market
opportunity

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,510
navigator.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,450
Because examples

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:16,919
and case studies have an important

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,870
role in this learning process.

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,420
We will present different examples

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,950
whenever it is possible.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,320
One firm however,

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,569
will accompany us throughout the

13
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,070
entire process.

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,620
So we would like to take the time

15
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,230
and introduce you to Flyability.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,299
Flyability will accompany

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,669
us from week to week as

18
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,649
we progress through the three steps

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,000
of the Navigator.

20
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,130
At the end of each week,

21
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,289
we will take a close look at

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,759
how this firm implemented

23
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,290
their Market Opportunity Navigator

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,409
and initially chose which

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,790
markets to play in.

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,400
So to begin with,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,054
let's meet Marc Gandillon,

28
00:00:58,307 --> 00:00:59,879
Flyability marketing

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,020
manager

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,179
and take a closer look at

31
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,830
what this film does.

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,480
Flyability introduces

33
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,759
Elios, the world's first
collision-tolerant

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,020
drone,

35
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,849
access can find in complex

36
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,919
spaces without any risk of crashing.

37
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:16,290
Elios features a full

38
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,190
HD camera endothermy

39
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,656
camera embedded on the drone.

40
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,850
The robots

41
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,489
live video feed allows the operator

42
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,950
to get the drone to the most
inaccessible

43
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,689
places up to five kilometers when

44
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,160
in direct line of sight.

45
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,859
Gather close up images for high
resolution

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,220
data with a sub-millimeter
resolution,

47
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,120
on-board LCD lighting system

48
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,769
and a complete remote control of the
camera

49
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,600
settings allows to navigate

50
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,090
and inspect even in pitch dark
environments.

51
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,820
Flyability is a space based startup,

52
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,309
it was founded in September

53
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,100
2014 as a spinoff

54
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,350
of EPFL which is a famous

55
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,450
University in Lausanne in
Switzerland.

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,270
It is

57
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,420
the outcome of thesis from

58
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,860
Dr. Adrian Breo,

59
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,260
who invented basically

60
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,090
drone ways

61
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,250
with a protective frame around it
that

62
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,779
makes its collision tolerant,

63
00:02:10,154 --> 00:02:12,480
which means it can fly

64
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,489
pretty much everywhere without risk

65
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,470
of crashing.

66
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,420
The whole story started

67
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,970
actually back in 2011 when

68
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,859
Adrian and his cousin Patrick

69
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,440
who are the two co-founder of the
company

70
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,599
were looking at the news after

71
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,670
the incident that happened in

72
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,450
Fukushima.

73
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,819
And they were seeing all these
images

74
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,280
of robots trying to

75
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,830
get into the reactor to to

76
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,719
have to collect images of what

77
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,760
was going there

78
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,749
and rolling robots were stuck

79
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,399
on their way as soon as they

80
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,310
were you know facing an obstacle.

81
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,349
And they they've been trying to

82
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,399
fly drones in there,

83
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:52,320
but that was very tricky

84
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,569
even you know because you had to fly

85
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,619
that beyond line of sight,

86
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,880
so not seeing the drone

87
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,859
and they were crushing the drone as
soon as they

88
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,759
entered the place.

89
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,040
So, basically they were

90
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,719
thinking you know there there should
be a

91
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,190
better way of doing that.

92
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,959
And this is how the whole story

93
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,909
started and brought Adrian

94
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,260
to to build that first drone

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,820
that is collision-tolerant.

96
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,930
And yeah from there great

97
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,790
great story has been

98
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,750
has been following this

99
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,800
this invention.

100
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,150
So,

101
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,540
as we just heard Flyability

102
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,429
develops drones that can be

103
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,890
used safely inside buildings

104
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,549
and in contact

105
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,690
with people,

106
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,450
thus enabling new interactions

107
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:37,689
and services

108
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,759
with unmanned aerial vehicles.

109
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,040
Flyabilty

110
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,350
aims at becoming the leader

111
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,600
in this segment of flying robotics,

112
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,390
and be at the forefront of
innovation

113
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,030
to continuously deliver value,

114
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
safety

115
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,180
and fun to its customers.

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,339
But who should be

117
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,690
their customers?

118
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:00,654
Clearly, Flyability

119
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,969
can serve different types

120
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,069
of users that have the need

121
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,840
for this safe drone.

122
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,299
In other words there are

123
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,250
many Market Opportunities

124
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,720
which they can pursue.

125
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,210
Which one should they focus on?

126
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,820
Join us throughout the weeks

127
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,859
to see how they chose which

128
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,170
markets to play in.
