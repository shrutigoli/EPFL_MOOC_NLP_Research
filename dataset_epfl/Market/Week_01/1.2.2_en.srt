1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,980
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,960
Yes

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,609
in this segment we wish to briefly

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,980
describe the underlying logic

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,380
behind The Market Opportunity
Navigator.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,299
As pointed out before The Market
Opportunity

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,900
Navigator is easy to apply

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,500
business tool that helps you to make

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,270
the right market opportunity

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,470
choice. Exactly

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,840
but to make the right choice

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,030
you actually need to understand

13
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,740
three important questions;

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,180
First,

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,490
what are the market opportunities

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,800
that are actually available for us.

17
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,030
Second,

18
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,979
what are the most attractive market

19
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,480
opportunities for us.

20
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,160
And then third,

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,139
what market opportunities should

22
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,640
we focus on.

23
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:45,680
Corresponding

24
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,999
with these three important questions
The

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,099
Market Opportunity Navigator
includes

26
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,690
three steps.

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,120
First, the "Market Opportunity Set"

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,610
which helps you to identify the most
attractive

29
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,830
market opportunities for your
technologies

30
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,060
or for your resources.

31
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,090
Second, the "Attractiveness Map"

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,139
which helps to understand the

33
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,610
value inherent

34
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,319
and the challenges inherent in each
of the market

35
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,220
opportunities.

36
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
And third, the "Agile Focused
Strategy"

37
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,599
which helps to make a smart
strategic

38
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,610
choice, where to focus

39
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,560
but also which other options to keep
open.

40
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,599
Exactly, and this is how

41
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,210
the main design board of the
Navigator

42
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,050
looks like

43
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,090
with the three steps that Marc just

44
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,080
described.

45
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,390
You can actually use sticky notes

46
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,550
to represent each market opportunity

47
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,040
and mark them on the dartboard.

48
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,150
First,

49
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,890
your market opportunity set,

50
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,480
second,

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,830
your attractiveness map;

52
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,329
and third,

53
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,350
your agile focus dartboard.

54
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,830
Overall this tool guide you

55
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,880
step by step

56
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,980
as you progress from the many
possible options,

57
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,049
to recognizing patterns among

58
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,149
these options to make distinctions
between these

59
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,370
options to ultimately arriving

60
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
at a well-designed strategy

61
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,530
for your venture.

62
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,289
Yes, and the final

63
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,599
outcome of this process is

64
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,610
the Agile Focus Strategy.

65
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,860
Let's take a moment to understand
what it

66
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,880
actually means.

67
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,769
The Agile Focused Strategy clearly

68
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,480
defines the market opportunities

69
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,940
that you will pursue now

70
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,790
and the opportunities that you will
keep open

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,070
as backup all growth options.

72
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,259
This helps you to manage your
startup

73
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,670
with foresight

74
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,680
and agility while facing

75
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,369
uncertainty. And what you create

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,820
is ultimately a smart portfolio of
options

77
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,109
and smart portfolio of options,

78
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,910
these options are actually

79
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,979
very essential, very important to
run

80
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,210
in the right direction

81
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,290
and do so

82
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,160
with agility.

83
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,169
Also in case you need to pivot over

84
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:37,430
time.

85
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:39,090
Eventually,

86
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,319
and that's what we've seen

87
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,114
with many startups already it

88
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,249
will help you to unleash the

89
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,320
potential inherent in your resources

90
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,540
and create the most value from your
effort.

91
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,160
And also,

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,049
the Agile Focus Strategy has

93
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,999
many implications for how you

94
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,010
build and design your venture.

95
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,460
Exactly.

96
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,429
In addition to the benefits of the
Agile

97
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,589
Focus Strategy which is the outcome
of

98
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,419
this process using a framework

99
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,670
for making this profound decision

100
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,529
can actually help you in making

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,540
a more informed choice

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,609
one that will increase your
likelihood

103
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,100
for succeeding.

104
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,700
And it will also come to think about
it

105
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,479
provide you with a shared language
within the team

106
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,500
when you want to debate discuss
about

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
market opportunities but also

108
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,380
with other people around.

109
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,050
Think about when you talk about

110
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,170
talk with venture capitalists
business agents

111
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,649
anyone who might have an interest in
your startup,

112
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,990
this provides a very precise
language.

113
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,770
Exactly,

114
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,050
and not just that

115
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,179
you know market opportunity choice
might

116
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,410
change over time.

117
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,729
So you can always go back

118
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,010
to the structured evaluation

119
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,870
trace it track it

120
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,459
and update your strategy if
necessary.

121
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,409
Accountability is one thing,

122
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:48,420
and looking forward is another
thing.

123
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,170
Exactly.

124
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,990
Have you been asking yourself
lately,

125
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,149
how do I identify blockbuster market

126
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,230
opportunities?

127
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,690
Have I missed out on any?

128
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,799
How do I know what is the most
attractive

129
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,990
market opportunity for us?

130
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,639
Okay now, let go of seemingly
attractive

131
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,720
options,

132
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,399
and if market opportunity

133
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,380
choice is so important,

134
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,330
how can I hedge my bets?

135
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,270
If you have been asking yourself
those questions

136
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,340
and perhaps others this MOOC

137
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,060
is for you.

138
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,039
Yes it will show

139
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,869

choice

142
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,849
and therefore make sure that you are
running

143
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,320
in the right direction

144
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,720
and remaining agile while doing so.

145
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,700
Join us.
