00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,020
Hi there

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,209
and welcome to the final video of

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:07,840
this week.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,819
As we finalize the introduction

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:11,370
week of this MOOC,

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,389
and just before we get started

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,980
with the Market Opportunity
Navigator

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,480
itself,

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,679
we wanted to share

10
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,599
with you some common questions

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,030
that we frequently hear about

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,469
the Navigator. Entrepreneurs

13
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,270
and Innovators

14
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,670
often ask us whether the navigator

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,809
is relevant for their situation,

16
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,239
and why should they invest

17
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,400
the time and effort to apply it?

18
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,279
Well, here are some of

19
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,600
their common questions

20
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,970
and the answers that we provide,

21
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,219
we hope it could clarify some

22
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,350
of your question marks as well.

23
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:45,790
First,

24
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,270
some entrepreneurs argue that the
technology

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,709
they are developing is quite

26
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,019
specific for the product that

27
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,010
they have in mind.

28
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,679
They wish to understand if

29
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,780
the Market Opportunity Navigator

30
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,579
will be relevant for them in that

31
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,300
case.

32
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,180
Well,

33
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,100
some technologies

34
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,929
or capabilities are clearly

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,300
more fungible than others,

36
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,150
they can more easily be applied

37
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,250
to serve different applications

38
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,030
and different market domains.

39
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,420
Yet,

40
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,640
almost any technology

41
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,739
can be dealing from its

42
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,060
current product

43
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,610
and be characterized in its

44
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,590
own right to understand

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,350
its generic functionalities.

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,949
As we will explain in week two.

47
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,150
The Market Opportunity Navigator

48
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,949
can therefore help to discover

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,209
new market opportunities,

50
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,639
even if you think that your

51
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,560
technology is quite specific

52
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,899
and thus, to make sure that your

53
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,760
firm will not get locked in

54
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:46,890
and lose its agility.

55
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,019
Another common question relates

56
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,359
to the time that needs to be
invested

57
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,520
for applying the navigator.

58
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,460
There are so many things to do in a
startup

59
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,989
and so little time.

60
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,759
Entrepreneurs ask

61
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,829
us why should they take the

62
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,260
time to invest in this process?

63
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,400
Indeed,

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,799
time is one of the scarce

65
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,660
resources for entrepreneurs,

66
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:11,800
we know that.

67
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,120
However,

68
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,340
because it is so rare

69
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,650
it must be spent wisely.

70
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,869
Usually, our natural tendency

71
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,810
is to invest our time in
troubleshooting

72
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,460
and short term problems.

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,039
But this approach may

74
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,019
turn out to be problematic in

75
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,890
the long term.

76
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,619
Remember, that your choice of market

77
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,749
opportunities is one of the

78
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,970
most important decisions you will
make.

79
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,309
You should therefore take the

80
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,290
time to think widely

81
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,819
and comprehensively about

82
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,859
your options before you commit

83
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,530
to a specific direction,

84
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,090
and make sure that your choice

85
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,799
is smart so that

86
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,689
you will not regret it when it's

87
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,290
too late.

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,319
Either way you should also keep

89
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,269
in mind the learning curve in

90
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,660
applying the navigator.

91
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,750
A significant investment

92
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,519
is usually required when you begin

93
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,719
working with the navigator,

94
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,630
but over time

95
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,640
you will be able to use

96
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,050
and benefit from it

97
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,210
with much less effort.

98
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,730
Last but not least,

99
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,009
the common assumption among
entrepreneurs

100
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,409
and investors as we already

101
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,140
mentioned is that startups

102
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,579
must adopt a 'laser

103
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,034
sharp focus' approach,

104
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:29,560
simply because their resources

105
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,490
are scarce.

106
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,760
So how does this approach

107
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,799
fit with the Agile Focus approach

108
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,150
of the Navigator?

109
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,420
In our studies we have done

110
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,069
comprehensive research involving

111
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,509
hundreds of firms to understand

112
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:45,700
this question.

113
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,490
Our studies clearly show,

114
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
that a 'laser sharp focus'

115
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
on one market opportunity

116
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,160
doesn't pay off for most firms.

117
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,930
On the contrary firms

118
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,459
that implemented a wider

119
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,250
approach by consciously

120
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,749
keeping related market

121
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,520
options open

122
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,700
outperformed those who didn't

123
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,520
mainly because of their greater
agility.

124
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,730
Laser Sharp Focus therefore

125
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,910
comes at the price of flexibility,

126
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,099
while Agile Focus

127
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,959
helps you manage the delicate

128
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,960
balance between staying focused

129
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,699
and staying flexible,

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,169
and this is very

131
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,710
important especially for

132
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,190
startup.

133
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,700
Well that's it.

134
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,189
We believe that you have all the

135
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,080
necessary information by now

136
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,280
to understand what this MOOC

137
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,080
is all about

138
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,390
and why is it important for

139
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,309
anyone interested in commercializing

140
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,990
innovations.

141
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,749
It's time for you to roll

142
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,830
up your sleeves

143
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,170
and dive into the details

144
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,390
of the Market Opportunity Navigator.

145
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,280
This would be interesting

146
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,420
and fun.

147
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,639
So we hope you enjoy

148
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,570
the ride.
