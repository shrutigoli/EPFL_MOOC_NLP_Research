00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,500
Hi there and welcome.

2
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,689
In this segment we will briefly

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,699
discuss the different use cases

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,310
for the Market Opportunity Navigator

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,499
so you can understand if this is
applicable

6
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,540
to your own situation

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,790
or dilemmas.

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,690
The Navigator offers

9
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,250
a structured process

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,349
to support your market opportunity

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,470
choice.

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,559
It can be applied in

13
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,330
many business situations

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,730
by different types of users.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,879
Probably the most important

16
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,989
point to begin

17
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,330
with is that you can apply

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,270
the three steps of the Navigator

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,710
according to your own needs.

20
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,779
Although we portray the Navigator's

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,240
process in a stage manner,

22
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,340
is actually possible

23
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,710
and sometimes even more useful

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,510
if you apply the navigator

25
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,190
in a different order

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,869
or simply use the individual

27
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,119
parts according to your specific

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,830
questions or dilemmas.

29
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,599
It is also possible

30
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,270
to start the process from different

31
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,129
entry points depending on

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,840
what you already know

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,000
and what you have already decided.

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,590
For example,

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,320
you may use the navigator to compare

36
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,180
potential market opportunities

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,490
but not to generate alternatives

38
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:23,520
or to build a smart portfolio

39
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,929
around the target market opportunity

40
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,240
that you already pursue.

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,950
Other than that,

42
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,259
the navigator is suitable for

43
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,609
different types of entrepreneurial

44
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,050
beginnings.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,119
Some firms start

46
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,249
with the intention to address a
specific

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,930
market need.

48
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,420
This approach is typically called

49
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,440
Market Pull.

50
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:44,889
If your firms

51
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,260
and falls in this category

52
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,480
you will find great value

53
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,960
in applying the market opportunity
navigator

54
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,709
because it allows you to evaluate

55
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,960
your initial target market.

56
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,239
If this proves to be a worthwhile

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,429
opportunity you can then

58
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,070
build an Agile Focused Strategy

59
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,870
around it.

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,779
If it turns out to be a

61
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,390
weak opportunity the navigator

62
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,430
will assist you in discovering more

63
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,750
valuable options.

64
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,130
On the other hand,

65
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,380
some firms may start

66
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,780
with developing a technological
invention

67
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,759
and search for potential uses

68
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,569
for their technology,

69
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:26,540
they are typically called

70
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,130
Technology Push Firms.

71
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,879
If your film falls in this

72
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,589
category you will find

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,290
great value in applying the
navigator

74
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,450
because it allows you to discover

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,610
possible market opportunities

76
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,230
to evaluate them

77
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,020
and to develop your Agile Focus

78
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,750
Strategy.

79
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,389
But the navigator is not

80
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,520
only useful for setting your

81
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,590
initial market entry strategy.

82
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,230
In fact,

83
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,449
finding the right direction for your

84
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,060
run is a difficult question

85
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,779
that bothers entrepreneurs

86
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,969
and innovators not only

87
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,040
as they choose their initial path,

88
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,440
but also overtime

89
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,000
as they strive to pursue it.

90
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,069
Because things may constantly

91
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,420
evolve

92
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,910
and new parameter may require

93
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,140
additional attention.

94
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,940
So with the navigator

95
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,360
you can capture your ongoing

96
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,590
learning and update your situation

97
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,440
effectively.

98
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,160
It allows you to trace back,

99
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,270
track

100
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,470
and update your decision.

101
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,220
If strategic changes are required

102
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,740
you will see them more easily.

103
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,699
It will also come handy when
pivoting

104
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,050
is required.

105
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,300
If you hit the wall

106
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,840
and need to recalculate your route

107
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,059
the navigator will assist you in

108
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,190
discovering evaluating

109
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,960
and choosing your new strategy.

110
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,540
Lastly,

111
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,970
running in the right direction is

112
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,829
also a relevant question when it's

113
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,870
time to grow your business.

114
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,270
Whether you are still a startup

115
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,070
or a larger enterprise

116
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,260
the navigator will be useful

117
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,149
as you search for your next pathway

118
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,500
to success.

119
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,700
Because the navigator is valuable

120
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,259
not only for a setting your initial

121
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,490
strategy

122
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,559
but also over time as you grow

123
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,700
and evolve.

124
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,100
It is suitable not only for

125
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:18,999
startups

126
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,420
but also for well-established

127
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,000
firms.

128
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,709
Startups that face

129
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,750
an inherent uncertainty

130
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,909
usually struggles to find their path

131
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,990
to success.

132
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,299
They need to focus on pursuing the
most

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,339
valuable opportunity on the one

134
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,000
hand,

135
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,160
and to hedge their bets

136
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,210
on the other

137
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,120
and all with limited resources.

138
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,519
The navigator can guide
entrepreneurs

139
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,620
to do just that.

140
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,440
It will help them to identify

141
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,760
and map their options

142
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,919
and to choose a path that can lead

143
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,090
them to success.

144
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,210
As for established firms

145
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,910
they often struggle to create

146
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,319
the most value from their existing

147
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,490
assets

148
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,109
and to identify opportunities

149
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,790
for new growth.

150
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,889
The navigator will help establish

151
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:09,379
firm to identify the next

152
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:10,820
BIG thing

153
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,799
and to manage their innovation

154
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,420
funnels smartly,

155
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,926
so that their entrepreneurial
endeavors

156
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,289
are better positioned

157
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,660
for success.

158
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,170
In addition to small

159
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,180
and large firms there are

160
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,099
other types of users that can find

161
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,199
the navigator valuable for their

162
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:28,920
needs.

163
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,430
First,

164
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,470
technology transfer offices

165
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,419
that attempt to commercialize
innovative

166
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,420
technologies stemming from their
laboratories

167
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,639
can use the navigator to find

168
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,749
potential applications

169
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,540
and customers for these inventions.

170
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,220
Second,

171
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,289
investors that are constantly

172
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,930
looking for promising businesses

173
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,479
can use the navigator as a

174
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,339
screening tool to evaluate

175
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,959
the attractiveness of an
opportunity,

176
00:05:56,845 --> 00:05:58,629
and if it proves to be

177
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,099
interesting to encourage

178
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,139
the development of a smart portfolio

179
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,209
around it.

180
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,010
Third,

181
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,390
educators

182
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,219
and accelerators that attempt to

183
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,080
accompany budding entrepreneurs

184
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,230
can use this business tool

185
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,280
to clearly lay out

186
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,230
all the major considerations

187
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,880
of this important process

188
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,670
and to enrich the toolbox

189
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,790
of their trainees.

190
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,770
To summarize,

191
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,570
identifying,

192
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,770
evaluating

193
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,350
and exploiting new market
opportunities

194
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,119
is core to creating significant

195
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,579
value for anyone who

196
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,990
is dealing with commercializing
innovations.

197
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,809
The navigator can therefore be
applied

198
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,420
by different types of users

199
