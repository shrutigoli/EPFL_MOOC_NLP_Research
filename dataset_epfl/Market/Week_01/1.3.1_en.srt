1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,279
Hello and welcome back in this video

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,389
we're going to show you the market
between

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:09,270
navigator

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:09,930
in a nutshell.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:10,960
Yes.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,089
The market opportunity navigator is

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,190
designed to help you master

8
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,900
your market opportunity choice.

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,990
It offers three steps for
discovering

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,609
and strategizing your most valuable

11
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,290
market opportunities.

12
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,740
So what are the three steps?

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,779
First, you search broadly in order

14
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,609
to understand which market
opportunities exist

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,469
for you, the outcome will be your
Market

16
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,820
Opportunity Set.

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,020
Second,

18
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,579
you assess deeply to understand

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,979
which market opportunities are most

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,149
attractive for you,

21
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,239
the outcome will be your
Attractiveness

22
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:41,970
Map.

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,910
And third, you're going to
strategize smartly

24
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,219
in order to understand which market
opportunity to

25
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,850
focus on,

26
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,120
the outcome will be your Agile Focus

27
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:50,670
Dartboard.

28
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,790
Based on these three steps we have

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,810
designed three dedicated worksheets

30
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,610
that lead to three important

31
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,270
outcomes.

32
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,069
You can then depict these outcomes

33
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,109
in a visual manner so the choice

34
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,369
becomes more apparent.

35
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,859
So let's briefly go over these

36
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,150
three steps of the market
opportunity navigator.

37
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,960
First, the Market Opportunity Set.

38
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,919
Exactly. This is the set of
potential

39
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,899
market opportunities that you can
address

40
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,279
with your core resources

41
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,690
and abilities.

42
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,450
It can be related to different needs

43
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,280
for different types of customers.

44
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,390
Why is this important?

45
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,459
Well, market opportunities can

46
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,830
vastly differ in their
attractiveness.

47
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,230
Having a set of options

48
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,720
can help you choose the most
promising

49
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,470
opportunity

50
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,299
and also provide the basis for plan

51
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,249
B or for unlocking your growth

52
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,260
opportunities in the future.

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,040
Exactly.

54
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,649
Worksheet 1 will guide you through
this

55
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,609
process. It starts

56
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,560
with a delinking step

57
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,119
to examine your own resources

58
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,580
and capabilities in a more fungible
way

59
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,919
detached from the products that you
may have

60
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,880
already envisioned.

61
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,919
This is then followed by a relinking

62
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,380
process where you try to combine
your

63
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,480
core abilities in different ways

64
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,330
in order to discover different
applications

65
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,780
for different sets of customers.

66
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,180
So it's delinking

67
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,110
and relinking.

68
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,269
And the outcome is your market

69
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,249
opportunity set which can

70
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,199
be depicted on the Navigator

71
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,300
using sticky notes to represent

72
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,520
each opportunity.

73
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,880
The second step is the
Attractiveness Map.

74
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,520
So what is an attractive market
opportunity?

75
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,280
It's one that has high potential

76
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,629
and a little challenge of course,

77
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,729
you know so with this tool you're
going to

78
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,379
depict each individual market
opportunity

79
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,000
under Matrix

80
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,920
and try to visually understand

81
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,600
the upsides and downsides

82
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,850
and then be able to compare their

83
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,200
overall nature.

84
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,210
So why is this so important?

85
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,580
Because marketing is different in
their potential.

86
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,349
You want to make an informed

87
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,329
decision about this very important

88
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,580
choice that you're engaging in a

89
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,800
venture creation or the innovation
process.

90
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,890
So intimately

91
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,710
you rely less on intuition

92
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,260
and suffer less from your own
biases.

93
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,499
To evaluate each market opportunity

94
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,000
in a structured

95
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,810
and clear manner,

96
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,819
we have designed worksheet 2 that

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,650
will guide you through this process.

98
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,869
The left column guides you how

99
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,929
to estimate the potential of a

100
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,990
market opportunity.

101
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,939
It is comprised of three different
factors

102
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,760
that can then be combined to an
overall

103
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,500
potential rating.

104
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,740
The right column of worksheet 2

105
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,819
guide to how to evaluate the

106
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,410
challenge they mention

107
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,509
once again it is comprised of

108
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,070
three different factors

109
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,529
which you can then combine to

110
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,990
an overall challenge

111
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,680
rating.

112
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,741
Once you assess the attractiveness
map

113
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,420
market opportunities

114
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,710
and create each option based on its
potential

115
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,839
and its challenge you can then look
at

116
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,219
them on the attractiveness

117
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,749
map here in the middle,

118
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,880
this is the outcome of step

119
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,180
two.

120
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,089
The third step is your Agile Focus

121
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,070
Dartboard.

122
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,010
Yes.

123
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,430
The dartboard depicts your Agile

124
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,640
Focus Strategy.

125
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,109
It clearly defines the opportunities

126
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,180
that you will pursue now

127
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,340
and those that you will keep open

128
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,320
as back up or future options.

129
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,820
So why is this important?

130
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,640
Well, the agile focused strategy

131
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,710
allows you to mitigate your risk

132
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,179
and increase your value without

133
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,800
losing your focus

134
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,869
and that's how you

135
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,450
can avoid a potentially fatal

136
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,240
locking.

137
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,229
So finally worksheet 3 three

138
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,730
helps you to design your agile focus

139
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,629
strategy,

140
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,969
specifically once you choose your
primary

141
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,219
market opportunity it will assist

142
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,740
you in finding the best backup
options

143
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,620
and growth options based on their
attractiveness

144
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,230
and their relatedness to your
primary opportunity.

145
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,200
You will then need to decide how
much effort

146
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,750
you want to invest in these options.

147
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,070
Will you pursue them now

148
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,529
in parallel to your primary
opportunity,

149
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,510
keep them open

150
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,549
or simply place them in storage

151
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,300
for potential future use.

152
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,539
The result of this process is

153
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,520
your Agile Focus Strategy

154
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,740
which can then be depicted on the

155
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,360
Agile Focus Dartboard.

156
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,759
Overall you can think of this as
being a white

157
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,739
land strategy that has significant
implications

158
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,209
for how you build your resources

159
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,380
and capabilities

160
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,390
and also for how you design your
venture.

161
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,600
So whenever you need to think about
your strategy

162
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,040
either for the first time

163
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,900
or when navigating your pivot

164
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,030
or your growth move applies

165
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,220
to navigate or to set your strategy.

166
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,499
Ultimately it will help you to make

167
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,420
sure that you're running in the
right direction

168
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,610
and remain agile while doing so.

169
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,339
As a final note Don't forget

170
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,350
that this is a learning process

171
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,330
and the navigator is actually

172
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,560
your learning companion.

173
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,290
It helps you to ask the most
important questions

174
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,750
before making such a profound
decision.

175
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,540
So appreciate the process

176
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,540
and not just the outcome.

177
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,130
Test your assumptions

178
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,899
and turn them into knowledge as you
evaluate

179
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,700
your market opportunities.

180
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,150
Make the process as attractive as
possible.

181
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,120
And debate

182
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,170
with your peers

183
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,059
and your stakeholders as much as you

184
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,979
can. So ultimately make the Market

185
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,050
Opportunity Navigator a habit

186
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,029
to reap the greatest benefits from
your

187
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,380
commercialization efforts.

188
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,940
Good luck.
