00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:04,630
Hello 

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,969
and welcome to our MOOC which

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,430
market to play in a tool for
entrepreneurs

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,270
and innovators.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,170
I'm Sharon

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,400
and I'm Marc

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,470
and will be our guides for this

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:16,344
course. In this course we

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,499
wish to help entrepreneurs

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,869
and innovators in making one of the
most

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,330
profound decisions for the venture

12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,310
that is which markets to

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,790
play in.

14
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,090
For this purpose

15
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,909
we will present to you an easy to
apply

16
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,410
business tool called the market
opportunity

17
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,319
navigator that offers a

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,690
structured framework for making this
complex

19
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,640
and many would say most important

20
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,170
decision in your venturing

21
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,250
or innovation process.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,319
But before we go into the details

23
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:44,320
let us briefly introduce ourselves.

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,640
So I'm Marc Gruber

25
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,730
I'm vice President for Innovation of
EPFL

26
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,870
which is the École Polytechnique

27
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,549
fédérale de Lausanne the Swiss
Federal Institute

28
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,709
of Technology in Lausanne in
Switzerland

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,420
that beautiful Lake of Geneva so

30
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,150
we cannot complain about on
location.

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,459
I'm professor for entrepreneurship

32
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,970
and technology commercialization at
my school

33
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,139
and in this capacity after lots of

34
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,940
research lots of teaching on
technology commercialization

35
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:09,880
amongst others

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,559
you know on this idea of market

37
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,680
opportunity identification that we
will talk about

38
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,470
in this book

39
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,080
and I'm Sharon Tal the

40
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,010
co-founder

41
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:19,960
and former executive director

42
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,360
of the entrepreneurship center at
the Technion

43
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,590
Israel Institute of Technology.

44
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,919
I also teach marketing for many

45
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,500
years now both for films

46
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,329
and start ups using my

47
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,919
vast experience as a marketing

48
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,710
manager and as a strategic
consultant.

49
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,319
So over the last years we've done
lots of

50
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,150
research projects we basically

51
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,069
investigated hundreds if not
thousands

52
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,690
of start ups in

53
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,059
technology to understand this very

54
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,800
critical early states decision

55
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,680
of what type of market you can
identify

56
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,420
and focus on.

57
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,889
We actually learned many

58
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,780
things from these studies

59
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,489
but probably the most important

60
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,040
thing that we understood was

61
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,479
that there was no structured

62
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,180
framework for entrepreneur

63
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,799
and innovators when they strive

64
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,200
to make this profound decision.

65
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,470
This actually turned to be the basis

66
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,110
for the market opportunity
Navigator.

67
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,050
And together we wrote this book here

68
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,700
that takes you by the hand

69
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,559
and guides use of the three steps of
the

70
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,390
market opportunity navigator.

71
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,820
The book is filled

72
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:24,579
and the book is filled

73
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,439
with lots of interesting examples
case

74
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,480
studies from many countries around
the world.

75
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,090
This book will be your companion for

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,460
this MOOC.

77
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,709
So to begin with let's look at the
market opportunity

78
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,390
choice in firms.

79
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,129
This is a very profound decision for

80
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,570
two main reasons.

81
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,209
First your choice of market

82
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,219
opportunity will influence your

83
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,810
chances for success.

84
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,669
It will influence how you get
traction

85
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,310
in the market how you gain profits

86
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,289
and how you create value for your
films.

87
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:54,540
So in a way it's like finding
fertile ground

88
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,430
and growing your tree on the fertile

89
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,150
ground.

90
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,640
But second it also imprints your
venture

91
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,530
or your innovation process in the
sense that

92
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,449
the decision that you make in terms

93
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,400
of your focus market

94
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,109
will then shape other decisions

95
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,880
that you will take over time

96
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,950
and that then puts you in a

97
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,050
certain trend channel

98
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,840
or path.

99
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,210
And this will actually be very

100
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,039
difficult to undo if

101
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,840
you need to change direction.

102
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,639
Exactly and that's why this is such

103
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,050
a profound decision.

104
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,479
However this is a very

105
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,430
difficult decision to make.

106
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,049
As David Roth the co-founder

107
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,900
and CEO of Opfers wrote

108
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,000
in an interesting article on Forbes

109
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,189
understanding where to focus is

110
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,920
a real dilemma for entrepreneurs

111
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,309
and he also mentions in that article

112
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,439
that firms rarely fail because

113
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,330
their teams don't work hard enough

114
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,309
but they fail because their teams
actually

115
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,810
work on the wrong things.

116
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,450
So why is this such a difficult

117
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,680
situation or decision?

118
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,020
Well first there is

119
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,400
always uncertainty.

120
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,130
Uncertainty is actually inherent

121
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,870
to the innovative process.

122
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,330
There will always be known unknowns

123
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,220
and also unknown unknowns

124
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,160
that will make this decision

125
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,090
difficult for you.

126
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,129
And then there are always trade-offs
you know think

127
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,869
about some markets being large
growing

128
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,519
quickly other markets being small

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,559
but well protected et cetera

130
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,690
et cetera. So it's a

131
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,700
decision with many variables to
decide on.

132
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,039
And in addition markets

133
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,140
are constantly changing

134
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,540
and what seems to be promising today

135
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,669
might turn out to be less

136
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,740
promising in the future.

137
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,159
Making the right market opportunity
choice is

138
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,699
definitely key for creating
significant

139
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,590
value and success.

140
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,749
But as we saw from our studies there
are several

141
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,844
possible mistakes that entrepreneurs
might

142
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,310
make as they go through this
process.

143
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,649
So let's see what can go wrong as
you make your market

144
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:44,970
opportunity choice.

145
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,219
First start ups may simply

146
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,409
choose to focus on the wrong

147
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,050
market opportunity that is

148
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,180
an opportunity that does not bear

149
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,550
real potential for value creation.

150
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,469
In fact many well-known

151
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,449
firms started by focusing

152
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,760
on the wrong market opportunity.

153
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,860
Just take a look at all these

154
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,299
well known companies beyond

155
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:09,030
us what they all have in common

156
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,580
is starting with the wrong market
opportunity.

157
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,859
Luckily for us they managed to
change

158
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,330
their strategy

159
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,980
and find a promising

160
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,840
opportunity at the end.

161
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,104
And this is not only anecdotal
evidence actually

162
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:23,129
there's lots of research out there
that looks at

163
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,479
this question why firms fail

164
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,999
and there is one study for

165
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,370
instance by CBN search that looked
at 100

166
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,449
more than 100 startups

167
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,519
and they found that 42

168
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,649
percent of these startups actually
fail because

169
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,420
there was a lack of market need

170
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,819
so there's clearly something to be
learned from

171
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,020
that insight as well.

172
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,569
So before you start

173
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,000
running fast make sure

174
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,340
that you're running in the right
direction

175
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,280
but choosing smartly

176
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,169
doesn't end in finding the most

177
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,179
promising market opportunity to
focus

178
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,279
on you must also

179
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,980
take into account how to focus

180
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,990
without losing your agility.

181
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,879
In fact an improper

182
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,889
balance between focus

183
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,959
and flexibility is actually

184
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,329
the second mistake when

185
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,129
startups choose their market
opportunity

186
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,300
strategy.

187
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,310
Why would this happen?

188
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,250
Well on one hand startups must focus
sharply

189
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,959
or else they won't be able to
survive

190
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,420
and the reason for this advice is
fairly clear.

191
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,189
More ventures as costs on resources

192
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,439
and thus they must not spread their
efforts totally

193
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,809
but that is a

194
00:06:27,975 --> 00:06:29,549
big BUT on the other hand Startups

195
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,389
must stay flexible

196
00:06:30,885 --> 00:06:32,970
and agile to be able to adapt
quickly

197
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,919
because unforeseeable things may

198
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,420
happen along the way

199
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,460
and typically do happen.

200
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,670
So if you choose one market
opportunity

201
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,570
and completely ignore all other
options

202
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,669
you might be in trouble down the

203
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,120
road.

204
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,120
In order not to lose your focus

205
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,799
but also not to get trapped you

206
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,380
need to keep some market
opportunities

207
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,100
open.

208
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,860
This will help you to develop your
resources

209
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,140
and capabilities in a wider manner

210
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,390
and keep your cognitive flexibility
up.

211
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,789
So here is a quote by Stephen Kaufer
who was one

212
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,619
of the founders of TripAdvisor

213
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,839
the well-known firm he says if you
are a lightning

214
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,910
focused on just one thing

215
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,950
and aren't willing to consider
others

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,230
you probably don't have the
flexibility

217
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,179
to make it when things don't go
according

218
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,080
to plan.

219
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,299
So that's one truism;

220
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,610
things won't go according

221
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,150
to plan.

222
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,880
So as you start running

223
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,250
make sure not to lock yourself

224
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,959
into one specific direction.

225
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:30,060

losing your focus.
