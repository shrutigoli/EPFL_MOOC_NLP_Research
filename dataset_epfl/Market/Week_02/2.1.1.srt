00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello welcome back. This is week two of the market opportunity navigator

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
during this week we're going to learn how to generate your market opportunity set.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is actually quite an important week. Why? Because the market opportunity set that you will

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
generate is actually providing you with the strategic choice that you will have

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in Venture creation or a new innovation project. That also means that

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
opportunity that you don't see at this stage are not in your

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
set. And you can pursue them. Or put differently. You know, if you have

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
a valuable set of tents identify a valuable set during this process. Then

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
there's this can be a true asset to your commercialization effort. So

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
there are a couple of conceptual issues that I want to point out to you and one key issue

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
that I want to discuss with you first is the issue of technological

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
fungibility. This means that technologies are flexible

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we'll see some examples later on. But it essentially means you, you have your

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
technology and it can be cross applied to different customer sets and

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that's what we call technological fungibility. Why is this the case. You can break down your

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
technologies into different elements. Some might be more generic. Some might be more

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
specific. We will talk about this later on in in some depth as well.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But in essence it means you have technological components and you can say okay these three

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
technological components by themselves create a certain functionality

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and then you have other technological components that you could actually make think about

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
adding smartness to your existing technology, computing power

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
software whatnot. So you can ultimately and this is

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
depicted here with these legal stones you can

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
add a new type of technological competence to your existing set of technologies and that

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
provides additional opportunities for creating the functionality for

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
existing customers and new customer sets. Okay. So over all this

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
is a process where I want you to think about your technology something that is up

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
for design. Break it down into components you can

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
reconfigure your technologies. You can also add new types of

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
technological elements to the mix. So when you think about your technology as

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
being fungible this means also that it can address different

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
customer sets out there. And when you think about this more

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
generally these customers sets represent market opportunities so we define a

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
market opportunity as an application of your technology for a specific set of

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
customers. So in some ways we draw on all of this

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
together. You can say OK your technology or the set of abilities that are

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
behind your technologies can generate multiple market opportunities. And what's interesting

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
is that this does not only hold for general purpose technology but also for conceptualist technology

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
as I will show you in a minute. It also holds for high technology as well as low technology.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So let's think about a concrete example of a general purpose technology tactile sensing

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
technology. This is actually a technology that can be applied in a number

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
of different domains from surgical tools gaming and virtual reality

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
rehabilitation monitoring, smart sports, gear robotic, tactile feedback, health

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
monitoring, variables et cetera et cetera. More

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
contextualized life type of technology was developed by

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Fujifilm. They have great competences in photographic

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
imaging et cetera. And as you all know there was a move to

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
digital cameras digital photography in the 1990s

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that actually made many of the companies in that space

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
obsolete because these companies could not reinvent themselves. Fujifilm was one of the

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
very few that could reinvent themselves because they realize that there are technologies that they have developed

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
For, the film industry that their technologies could actually be

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
cross applied in other domains. You know these technologies are fungible. What

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
does this mean for Fujifilm that could move into cosmetics and this is shown here.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They could address the environment or technologies factor as markets as well.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But based on the fundamental understanding that technologies are not there only

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to serve one purpose but they can be repurposed in that sense. Or here's an

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
example of low technology. This is filters and filters.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Evidentially can be used in many, many different applications here just a few from water

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Purification, oil refineries, food industries, heating and

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ventilation, the automotive industry and the marine industry. Of course the filters

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
will look a bit different here and there. Some might even have smartness added to them, know because of when

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
it comes to monitoring. For instance water quality. So if

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
you think about these examples that really gives you the idea that OK technologies are

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
fungible they can be cross applied. Now it's important to understand what are these components that

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
comprise the technology. So ultimately it doesn't really matter

67
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
what your core abilities are you can always try to think of them as being

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
more general to generate multiple market opportunities. So in the following video

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
we actually explain to you why this is so important.
