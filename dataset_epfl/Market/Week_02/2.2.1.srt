1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So how do you actually generate this all important market opportunities step. There are two 

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
key steps that are necessary to accomplish this first important goal.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The first step is called de-linking. The second step is called re-linking the de-linking

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
step is one where you look at your technologies your abilities in their own right.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That means independent of any product that you may or have

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
already envisioned in depend of any market that you may already have seen so really try to

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
understand your technologies in their own right as if there is no

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
application to a certain market domain intended for them.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Second you would then say OK we have this technological, these

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
technological elements and we try to relate them to different markets domains. So

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
it's de-linking and rethinking. We have

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
decided a website that actually walks you through this important process. And let me first

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
explain to you in some detail how this worksheet is set up before we then go deeper into the

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
de-linking step. So this is the worksheet that was already shown to you.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is the worksheet 1 for the generation of market opportunities which should ultimately then

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
lead to your market opportunity set it is structured in a fairly straightforward manner. You see

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
on the upper part the abilities your technological elements

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
that you possess or where you want to develop in the future and below you

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
have the identification of market opportunity step where you actually try to

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
understand which applications you can offer with your core abilities who may need them et cetera.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So looking just at the upper part, there

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
is a step where you say okay I try to understand technology your

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
abilities in the own right. This is a step that is actually

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
quite an interesting one when we work with inventors.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a step where they, they realize actually the power of what they have

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
developed in a more broader encompassing sense. So what we want

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you to do is to list the venturous core abilities or technological elements on the

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
top of this worksheet. And when we talk about abilities and

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
technologies we mean a set of resources and capabilities that you currently have. And what's

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
important also those that you're currently developing or planning to

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
develop. So concretely and we will by the way see an example of how this is

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
applied. But concretely you would put technological elements the building blocks

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
of what you have assembled up here in this upper part

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of your work sheet. We have listed four different technological

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
elements here on this upper part of the work sheet. But

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
essentially you say okay maybe I only have two core elements and I might add

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
a third one smartness, computing power software to it which would

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
occupy the third space on the worksheet. Or you might even have four or five.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
In that sense you know you know if you have a fifth one that you identify you would at

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
this fifth element to the worksheet as well. So this upper

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
part of the worksheet is really about your abilities about your competencies about your

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
technology and you're trying to understand those elements in the

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
right meaning decoupled from any application that you already had in mind.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So to get a good understanding of what you can potentially do with your abilities

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
competencies etc. you will need to think about them in their own right meaning

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You imagine them in a more general way that is decoupled from the specific product

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
idea or a customer need that you may have originally had in mind.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
For instance your unique ability can be an important. Know how that you are processing

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
about a specific process. A rare resource that you have developed or a special capability

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
in manufacturing that you have developed over time as well.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
These technologies that you have at hand want to develop. They can be

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
broken down into core elements based on their unique functionality such

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
as pattern recognition for instance, or based on their structure design

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
such as nano sized, such as in an Access camera. So think about

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
your technology in all practical terms as it's being comprised of building blocks

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
with certain functionalities. Not these building blocks up here. Here are these examples that I

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
just mentioned. Try to understand and this is now in the blue box, try to

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
understand the main properties as well as functions that these technological elements

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
can perform. So you would write the name of the technological element

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
give it a name and then below it you write the function of all the

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
properties that describe this technological element. So this

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
exercise is extremely important not just because it helps you

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
understand what you have a tense but also helps you in developing what we

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
call cognitive flexibility. You see your technology you

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
abilities with new eyes. So let me give you an example that illustrates

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
more concretely how you feel in that first part of the worksheet.

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
These friendly folks here are Saar and Gaul. These are two good friends who always wanted to found

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Estrada, you know like many people out there. One day back in 2011 Gaul was a

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
software engineer back then was sent to India by his employer to diagnose a machine

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
that didn't work properly. He had to fly thousands of miles for that. But as he

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
entered the room he simply heard with a clear sound that the problem was not the

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
software but rather a mechanical malfunction. It wasn't at this moment

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
that an idea came into his mind. Why can't we simply develop

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
something that listens to machines to diagnose the problems.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
A quick technological investigation revealed that developing this technology would be difficult

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
yet doable. But as they started working on this project Saar and Gaul

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
quickly realized that machines are literally all around us all the way from

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
complicated manufacturing lines to simple home appliance so

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
how can they know what type of machines they should listen to and which

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
market opportunities should they focus on.

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So as we progress along the three steps of the market opportunity and navigator we

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
will revisit the example of Saar in Gaul and the firm agree to make it

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
more intuitive for you to apply the market opportunity navigator and to

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
understand what actually Mark Saar and Gaul chose as their initial opportunity and

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
what else was in store for them. So a glories technology is really about

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
this idea of we listened to machines.

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Their slogan says machines talk we listen as you see on the slide

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and their tagline is we are bringing predictive maintenance to new markets by

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
listening to a machine we can tell if it is working properly has a malfunction

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and even predict future failures.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So if you think about this type of value proposition that they are putting out there

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
it already tells you a lot about they have vast opportunity space that is in front of them

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
because they have lots and lots of different machines in working out there. And

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
they could basically listen to all types of machines and different very different types of settings.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
So let's fill in all Worksheet 1 for Saar and Gaul. You know,

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
by the way I explained it already you can already take guesses of what type of

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
technological elements they have. Now let's look at this a bit more detail.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In order to listen to a machine what do you need to do you have to have some hard to get device that

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
has some, some listening power. Well you have to have some device some

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
smartness built into some algorithm that is actually able to detect what's

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
going on. And you have to have a user interface that allows you

102
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
to communicate with the technology with the hardware to understand

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
what is actually going on there to understand ultimately what type of machine

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
failure could be out there and try to understand what type of maintenance programs

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
etc. can be launched based on that technology.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But think about it in a more systematic manner. We can say this

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
technology that they have developed has three main components it's listening hardware

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
it has a number of features and abilities, it can record vibrations and

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ultrasound, it can it's fairly small, it is portable, it is a high

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
sampling rate. The second part the second technological element is actually

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the algorithm, it detects changes and it allows real

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
time analysis. It's designed for big data. A lot of data points that are collected.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's based on machine learning. And actually it's a kind of a cool feature built a

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
malfunction dictionary over time. The third key element that Saar and

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Gaul developed is the user interface. It should be

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
easy intuitive. It should fit the iPhone as well as Android phones.

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It generates tailored reports and statistics and it has an online management platform.

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So if you think about Saar and Gaul glorious court technological

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
elements there are three and they have different features. And this is all

120
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you need to do to fill in this upper part. It sounds

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
kind of simple how I portrayed it and it's actually a

122
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
straightforward process but only if you are able to do delink yourself from

123
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a certain market to me.

124
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Another interesting sample is biotia, and this sample is actually quite different to the

125
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
first example from Saar and Gaul that we looked at which was mostly based on technological elements

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but also is based on the country or know how that is embedded within one person

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Neefe O’Howrah and she's the resent Ph.D. graduate it in the whole field of genomics. So let

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
me show you what her know how it is about and how that can be partitioned into certain

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
components. So the first component needs sampling abilities so

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Neefe is really, really good in understanding complex natural systems that are

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
widely spread not evenly distributed. She's also quite good at experimental design to

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
understand the full experimental process and finally she has a certain strong

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
ability in pathogen monitoring that involves all types of pathogens. She can

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
do a real time analysis of large data sets. And she's also really good with pathogen

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
monitoring and understanding the next generation sequencing models. And based on

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
these three types of unique abilities and know how she decided to create a startup that can offer

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
environmental surveillance solutions using the power of genomics.

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
A third and very interesting examples actually flicker. You all know this company it's today a photo

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
sharing community site that is very popular.

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But they didn't start off like this. They started off, in fact in 2002 by developing a multiplayer

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
online game with real time interaction through instant messaging and one feature of this

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
game was a chat environment with photo sharing which quickly became valuable in

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
its own right and surpassed. The game itself in popularity leading the firm to put

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Actually the game on hold and to focus on developing a new photo sharing community site. So if you think

145
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
about flick a flicker and this upper part of the worksheet the photo

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
sharing ability which has been one of the technological elements that they

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
could have put in there. And based on that we then can develop multiple

148
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
applications as we explain in the next segment to you.

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So in some of these examples and what I explained before. Tell one

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
clear message try to think about your technologies

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
in their own right now in the most gentle manner possible. Because only

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
then you will understand the flexibility inherent in your technology

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
and that there are many other opportunities out there that you can potentially cater to.
