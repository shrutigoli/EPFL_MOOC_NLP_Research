1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So you may wonder why is it important to create an opportunity set. You know why not

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
only identify one opportunity and exploit that one.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We call the segment look before you leap because we want to exactly point out to you why this is

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so important. So if you think about opportunities markets that you want to

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
enter. If you identify only one market opportunity you're basically

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
stuck with the kind of features this market offers to you if you

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
identify a set of opportunities you actually have a strategic choice set of market

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
opportunities. What does this mean? This means very concretely that markets come in

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
different sizes and different growth trajectory et

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
cetera et cetera, some are very contested some are less contested.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So some of these markets out there just provide more fertile ground for your venture to

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
growing. You know it's like planting a little seed into the soil, you don't do

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this. You don't plant the seed in any type of soil. Know you want to plant it in a type of soil

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
that allows to nourish the plant and exactly that mindset should be present with an

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
entrepreneur as well. You know why should you go into the harshly contested are, while


16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
there's more forthcoming types of areas

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that you could create your benches in them. And the second important reason might be less

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
obvious. You know the second important reason is that this early decision in which

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
area you create your own, your venture in actually imprints your venture in a very

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
fundamental way. Why is this the case? This is because the type of market you're going to

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
choose has a lot of implications for other set of

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
decisions within your bench. Just think about the type of brand name that you're going to see.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Just think about the type of resources you're going to develop the types of

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
relationship with outside players and also the employees you're going to hire. These

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
employees have are interested in your firm because you are

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
working in a particular area. So if you have a firm that is actually active in

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the household good industry think about refrigerators. This type of

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
forum is a very different nature than a firm that would cater for instance to

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the aerospace industry. So ultimately this choice of market

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
opportunity has this fundamental effect on imprinting the type of organization you're

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
going to create when you put both reasons together. The first reason

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
that the market actually provides less than more or less fertile ground to you.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And the second reason that you know you have the strong imprinting effect of this

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
is that this is one decision when you combine those Linnets, I think it's

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
clear that this early states decision in entrepreneurship and in innovation

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
management is actually a decision that is quite far reaching. But if you look at the

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
textbooks out there typically these textbooks assume that you have already identified a

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
good opportunity until you very well how are you going to exploit that opportunity without

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
really questioning whether there might be more important better import or better

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
opportunities out there. This activity of identifying market opportunity is actually not a

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
trivial one. And the history of technological progress is

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
full of examples where innovators had a hard time identifying

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the best opportunities out there and it took sometimes decades to see the best application now.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So why not try to, to shorten the time and be really good. And seeing these

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
applications from the outside so that you can pick the best market opportunity for

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
yourself. Based on what I just said I think it's

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
almost becomes obvious now why the generation of a market

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
opportunity set is so important. Let me just point this out to you. First it's of

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
course about choosing the most attractive option, not all market opportunities are

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Alike, that's a lot of heterogeneity and you want to be smart entrepreneur and enter

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
an area where you have the best chances for growing your ventures over time. But the

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
second option might again be less obvious. And

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
to think about it when you see multiple opportunities what does this do to your venture. What does this

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
do to you in your head. It says OK I have seen multiple opportunities

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
some of these opportunities might be for better options. You know so I

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
might enter this market but opportunity two and three they are Plan B and Plan C

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
for me. So I have this fallback option these fallback options

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
plans. Or you could say if the first market should work out, I have these

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
other markets that I can enter as future growth options but

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
about having this broader perspective on firm growth this is allowing you

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
to create a venture that is more agile that it's more flexible

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
over time actually to get into these other domains. Again think about the brand name which is

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
like the one of the most obvious or

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
interesting sumps on this front. The brand that you're going to choose can be focused

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
very much on this one market. Do you see where it can be chosen so that it

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
could fit the other market domains so that once you create your venture

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you can more nimbly more in a more edgy way move into these other domains

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
and don't have to rebrand your company because these other domains actually fit the overall print.

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A similar example can be made with the technology that you are developing. You can develop that technology

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
more in a more Modula fashion, meaning that you are able to reconfigure it

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
for quicker and more efficient entry into these other elements. The

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
bottom line is that you are creating a company that is much more agile. If

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
you have that type of foresight. These insights are partly based on research I've

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
been doing together with two colleagues from the Wharton School of the University of

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Pennsylvania. You see pictured here to the left in McMillon and in the center

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
it's my colleague Tommy Thompson and we, we did a study on 80

77
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Technology Ventures and we called the study look before you leap market opportunity

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
edification in technology ventures. We found two interesting

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
insights that led to some of the findings

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that are based. The book is based on this move is based on, number one what we

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000 
have seen this that serial entrepreneurs those who have done it. Done

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
entrepreneurship repeatedly created firms not only once but multiple times

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
they actually assemble an opportunity set while the novice once the people who are doing

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the first venture typically jump at the first opportunity. We have seen

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
another interesting insight in this study. Let those who

86
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
create an opportunity set those who look at multiple opportunities. Those entrepreneurs can derive

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
significant performance benefits from this activity. Why is this the case.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This relates back to what I just explained. This is because these people can choose

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
a better option. More fertile ground. And these people, these entrepreneurs can

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
actually create companies that are more agile that can maneuver between different

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
opportunities in a more nimble and flexible way. So some big

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
picture don't fall too quickly in love with your idea.

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look what's out there. That might be better opportunities that allow you to grow your venture in a

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
much more ambitious compelling way. So look

95
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
before you leap and I'm going to show you the next few segments how you can actually do 


96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,000
this.
