1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So this week it's really about the market opportunity set. And I have

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
three main learning that I want to get across during this week. It's first

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
about the description of your core abilities. You need to understand what your

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
abilities are in their own right. Independent of any product

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that you may have already envisioned. Second I want to show you how to

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
identify possible options that you can derive from these abilities.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The core technology that you may have, you know what type of market opportunities are out there

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that you could cater to. And thirdly I want to show you how to assemble a compelling market

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
opportunity set based on the options that you identify.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you look at this type of set of questions that I've just outlined.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This all relates to this very first step of the Navigator. The market opportunity set that is depicted

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
here on the left side in the form of this briefcase because it's really

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
a place where you say OK I have my market opportunities and I have my set that

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to evaluate in a second step and then I strictures about the set in a third step.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is this market opportunity set. It's the set of the potential market opportunities

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
which you can address with your core resources and capabilities. These can be

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
varied options related to different types of needs for different types of customers.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But the word varied is quite important to you because I said to you that the

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
choice you have really depends on how heterogeneous how varied these options

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
are that you identify you we could say have one market domain which is the

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
refrigerator's the other one is aerospace as we already have. And the third one might be

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
motorcycle's. This is a very varied set of options. You know you can have a much

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
narrower set where you say only the automotive industries and some subdomains

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
within it. Why is this so important. We have talked about this briefly as well for two main

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
reasons. Just to recap number one because not all opportunities are like some

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
are presenting more fertile ground than others. And number two it provides you with the agility

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It provides it with foresight of seeing this might be a Plan B if the first option should not

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
work out and it provides me with a growth option. Should the first option work

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
out. So this provides you with important vision and

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
agility as well. How is it done? Know you start with assessing your generic

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
functionality of your core abilities your technology, then you try to understand what other

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
applications are feasible for you and for different types of customers

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
in order to guide you through this process. We have created this worksheet that you see here

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it's intuitively understandable you have the abilities that you're going to note on the

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
top and you have the applications and customers set that you noting

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
on the bottom part of this worksheet and I will walk you in this week through this worksheet

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
try to explain how it's filled in with some very into a terrific

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
sample. So this is actually a very straightforward easy process and one that is actually

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
lots of fun to fill in because you get to know your venture or your potential venture

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in a much more, in a much deeper way. So the main

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
takeaways from this week, from this stage are the following.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
First we want you to really enhance your cognitive flexibility and alongside the

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
flexibility of your venture because once you have seen multiple opportunities you are more

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
alert to these other opportunities as well and not only focused only

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
on one. Second, having options at 10 gives you the power of

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
choosing among different options. And we talked about how important this is

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
for performance effect and for agility. Third you are able to leave

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
behind some long held assumptions as this is already the best market

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
for us here that actually often entrepreneurs say oh this is the best

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
market but they in fact they have not looked at others so how can you know. And if you

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
think about the profoundness the importance of this decision it's

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
a bit of a pity that you haven't looked at other sets of markets because there might be better

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
options out there and you're just foregoing these better options because you have never.

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Spent any effort on identifying them or evaluating them. And finally there's an

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
interesting intellectual challenge associated with this which makes it fun as well. It's

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
it's this activity of exploring the options that are in store for you. So it's about the


57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
design of your venture, no one there's no rule that tells you that a venture has

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to be designed in a certain way, something you can decide you know. So if you want to pick

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
up or see a better opportunity that's actually some, some very nice

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
reward that goes along with it also intellectually because you have been able to design your

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
venture in a smarter way. So in this week it's really about this first

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
step the assembling the opportunity set. And I'm going to explain to you next

63
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
how you do this with the help of Worksheet 1.
