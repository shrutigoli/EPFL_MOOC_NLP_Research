1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
That we just discussed the deal linking step in market opportunity and defecation. This is a

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
critical first step. We are trying to understand the technological components in their own

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
right. You know your abilities, your unique abilities in the right decoupled from any

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
product application in the re-linking step. You will then re-link


5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
these technological components to these market applications that you will identify

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and that's the second step that are going to going to explain to you right now.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So let's go back to work She learn that helps you to generate your market opportunities set


8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
we know focus on the lower part the upper part as I remember was to

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
describe your core abilities or technological elements, the lower part is

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
dedicated to identifying your market opportunities. And this is a straightforward for what

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
process you see here, applications on the one hand and customers

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
on the other hand, and the market opportunity is basically any combination of

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
application and customer. In order to understand what's in store for you in terms of

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
market opportunities both are actually vital elements to be considered

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and we encourage you to think broadly about applications and the customers that

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
could use them.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The link between the application and the customer is actually the need and also a

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
certain application has a functionality and this functionality should serve a certain

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
purpose create value with your customer assets. So this

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
discovery process is actually a very fun activity. It's one of the few instances

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the design of your venture of your innovation project. We can think out of

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
the box, truly out of the box and we want you to think truly out of the box and also

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
think broadly think unconstrained think with all your creativity

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and enjoy that moment you know because this is, this is a fundamental moment as we discussed

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in the life of your venture in your innovation project. Make sure that

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that you unconstrained and really reach out and try to understand what's in store for you in

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
terms of market opportunity. I will come back to that and give you some hints and tips of how you can enrich your

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
creativity and think broadly. And I also will share with you what we learned from research on

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
which type of opportunities people can typically see.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But this is in essence an activity where say hey I have a

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
design element in my hands. This is the market opportunity that I discovered the

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
market opportunities that I will discover. And let's

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
enjoy this moment. So the lower part of the worksheet is divided into

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
an application part and a customer part. The application part

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
designates a specific usage a function which you can create with your core

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
technologies and abilities. So it's really linking the upper part of

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
abilities with some functionality that is embedded in these

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
technological elements or your abilities. It can be it

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
based on one of these technological abilities that you identified above or

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
more than one, you know so this can be a combination or can be a single

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
technological function. Think about this flicker example that we discussed in the private sector. You know there

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
was only one functional element in the whole set of technological elements that

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
flicker has detents.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So from one of the previous segments you also remember that you could add technological

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
elements to the mix that will increase the scope of functionality that

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
arises from a technology. Think about the example of adding smartness based on hardware and

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
software components to the turned current technological elements. In

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
turn this gives rise to lots of new functionalities and notes of new applications.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The final element in your work sheet one is the identification of possible

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
customers. We designate this with these icons showing

51
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
individuals. It could also be companies B2C B2B markets. But

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
this box down there that links to the application box

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
is focused on your customers. So as you uncover potential

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
applications you should also consider who may have the need for those applications.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And this will create your possible sets of customers. Remember at that point the

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
market opportunity is any combination of application of customers and I will come back

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
to this in a minute. So as an illustration of the re-linking step. Let's now

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
turn back to Saar in Gaul. The founders of Augury you remember that they had the

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
slogan machines talk. We listen so they can have all kinds of interesting

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
applications in the predictive maintenance market domains.

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's look again at their worksheet1 so they had identified

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
three main technological components. First listening hardware with a couple of features

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that are listed below the algorithm that is behind their whole technology

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
with a couple of features and then the user interface. And when they think about

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
applications they identify a whole range and very different

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
application domain. So it was for commercial machines for consumer appliances and for

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
medical purposes. So all three domains are

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
have some need for predictive maintenance and associated with all three

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
domains. Are certain sets of customers which are in effect as we will see fairly

70
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
different and create a wonderful opportunity set for Augury. The

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
associated customer segments actually show you another level of breath

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
in terms of market opportunities that will arise from this bottom part of the

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
worksheet 1 here they identified on a top level commercial

74
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
buildings factories and freight firms all in the predictive maintenance for commercial

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
machines area. And if you just start looking at the left side the

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
commercial buildings market can actually be subdivided into HVAC


77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
heating ventilation, air conditioning domain and the elevator

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
domain. Just think about predictive maintenance for these types of spending.

79
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You know everyone who has been stuck in an elevator knows exactly what I'm talking about right now. That

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
second element here are the fecker factories. This is quite an

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
interesting domain as well. The flourless sub-segment this

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
fecker domain engine, manufacturing machines and infrastructure equipment. Again, if you

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
can have predictive maintenance for this machine this means less downtime.

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You can send in you keep send a team there before the machine actually

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
is out of service. So there's a lot of cost savings associated with this as well. And then freight

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
firms similar story cooling containers, refrigerated trucks at some

87
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sub-segments. The second big domain that they focus on is predictive

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
maintenance for consumer appliances and the divide between the climate effect trust

89
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
and the sub-segments cars and motorcycles and household tools with the sub-segments white

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
appliances heating and cooling. And again predictive maintenance in all of these domains

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
could help a lot in terms of saving costs.

92
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
increase reliability et cetera. You know so lots of value created

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
potentially created as well. And finally they also saw

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
applications in the medical domain artery diagnostic, Lunda Nasik

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
which is in fact, very different to the two other domains for predictive maintenance of

96
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
commercial machines and consumer appliances. But overall if you look at this opportunity

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
set that is beginning to emerge at the lower part of this worksheet, and this is truly amazing.

98
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is giving you a rich, rich set of growth options for Plan

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
B et cetera. So having this at your disposal is already a

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
fascinating element. The next step will be of course to understand which markets will

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
be more important than others. We will come back to that in week 3


102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But before we go down that path I want to show you another

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
example and what we have just seen with a Augury in the lower part of work sheet One is

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that the customer segments the factories can be further

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sub-divided into sub-segments. And there's one

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
tip that we can give you and how to identify even more segments is that you mentally say OK

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
we have a swimming in and swimming out process that is associated with opportunity and

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
deification and let's look at this again with another example. This is the example of Nova. This

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is a company that actually develops visual scanning software that mimics human

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
behavior and reads content like pricing images descriptions and ratings.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So one of the technological applications is deep web search

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and in that domain they can say OK we have B2B customers business to business customers

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and B2C customers business to consumers relationships. So

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you can further segment this and say we're B2B business to business


115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
linkage means e-commerce or classified sites. Then you can further segment the

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
classified sites into retail. On the one hand or travel. And then you can

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
go further down the tree and say travel can be further subdivided

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
into hotels and flights. So beyond this zooming

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
in and assuming all process that can jumpstart your imagination.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There are a few other tips that we want to give you to identify an appealing and exciting

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
customer of set market opportunities that ultimately just as appealing as the one from a

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Augury that we have just seen. So in terms of boosting your discovery skills, one

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
first tip that we have for you is mining your own knowledge. Why is this so important.

124
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What we know from our own research is that people tend to identify those opportunities that are

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
related to the prior knowledge of customer needs of certain market segments

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
et cetera. So this means you are

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
predisposed to identify opportunities that are related to your prior knowledge. What

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
is important to remember in line in association with your prior

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
knowledge corridor is that not all the knowledge that you have is of course on the top of your mind. And

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
also you need to mind your knowledge in a way trying to understand what type of

131
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
customer needs I came across in the past that are related to the functionalities

132
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
embedded in my technological elements. So really mind your knowledge, take your time

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
lean back try to understand the types of customer sets types of industries et

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
cetera that you came across during your life so far that might provide

135
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
a hunch or an idea of where your technology can provide. So is

136
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
this concept that I just explained the prior knowledge corridor concept also means that

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
we are blind to many things out there now. And by implication, this also means by

138
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
turning to other people we can actually enrich

139
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
our market opportunity set significantly because they will know about market

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
opportunities customer needs that you may not even have heard about. And also

141
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in that sense we encourage you to really go out there talk to people try to solicit

142
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
information about customer needs that they might know about

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
based on new technological functionality that you would have never thought of. So

144
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
accessing external sources is a key element in order to help your creativity.

145
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It is also useful to go through a systematic list of industries or markets, you know there are

146
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
tons of those on the Internet, just Google them and try to see you know

147
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
systematically in these lists where your

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
technology can be applied. You know these are industry lists. You go through them and say hey maybe we can

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
apply our technology in this domain we just never thought of it or about it. Let's get in touch with

150
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
some folks in those domains and try to understand that customer need that we

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
assume exists there actually exists. And finally what is

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
also interesting is that you can look at patents that are related to your technological

153
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
element and see what type of application areas are named in there. These are just

154
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
for tips but there are many other ways of enhancing your creativity. I

155
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
think the bottom line and what we urge you to do is take your time for this


156
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
step. So this discovery process is highly important as it shapes

157
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
what you can do and what the type of value is that you're going to extract from your

158
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
venture from your innovation project. So be open and be imaginative, be

159
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
creative and identify as many and as varied opportunities as you possibly

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
can. When I say as varied think really about for instance what Augury has

161
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
done to look at very different industries because this creates strategic

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
choice this creates variety for your venture. And these markets might have

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
very different levels of attractiveness and we will come back to that later on. And so typically

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
having three to five market opportunities is there's a good rule of thumb that I've seen actually

165
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
teams that were able to push that much, much beyond that number up to 60 different market

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
opportunities and that's it. So if you're on a creative

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
roller coaster try identify lots of opportunities lots of varied once

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
enjoyed that moment because this really is the opportunity set that is at your

169
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
fingertips for venture creation. So please take your time. This is a very

170
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
important step forward for your project next week. I cannot share with you some

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
ways to create an opportunity set based on what we have discovered

172
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and how to place this actually in the market opportunity navigator.
