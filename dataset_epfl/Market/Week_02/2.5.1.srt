1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So when Sharon and me worked with startups established firms inventors etc.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
and apply to market opportunity navigate a process with them a couple of questions

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
have repeatedly come up in this first step of generating the market opportunity set.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And we want to share all these questions and some answers with you. You know the first main question

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that. Frequently is why do some technologies pose a bigger

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
challenge than others when searching for different market opportunities. And this is a question that not only

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
came up during our work with different types of start ups

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
etc. but it's also a question that we look more deeply into in one of my research

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
projects that I've done with a former Ph.D. student of Marianna till we looked

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
at more than two dozens of different technologies coming out of the EPFL and

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
what we tried to understand is why is it more difficult for some technologies

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to identify multiple applications than for others. And one core feature of one core element

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that we repeatedly saw is that technologies that address the human senses

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
that you can see, that you can feel and that are loosely coupled with the

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
application context are much easier to cross apply. While there were challenges if

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you have an abstract technology think about an algorithm think about a formula

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that isn't particularly tightly coupled to the application context. There were some

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
more challenges than you typically have to involve a person that has strong, a strong technological

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
competence to help you with these types of technologies and help you

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
understand what they can do in their own right. So there are in fact

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
differences in terms of technologies but overall we saw that that all teams

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that worked on these technologies could actually identify multiple applications. It's just a bit harder for

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
some technologies than for others. The second question that

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
typically comes up is when should I stop searching. The search

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
process is an exciting one an interesting one but you cannot search forever.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh it's a process that has to end at some point. And as I mentioned

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
before in another segment we had teams that identified up to 60 different

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
applications. They also said we don't want to stop you prematurely if you are on the roll

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and see more opportunities and can find different particularly different

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
applications in very different continents and different broader market segments.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But as a rule of thumb, three to five is a good number to strive for

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
three to five after this initial screening process where you weed out those obvious

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
opportunities that maybe do not make sense that arise due to brainstorming

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and going a bit too wide with the opportunities. OK. The third

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
question that often arises is what happens if I identify opportunities down

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the road as I move along. What shall I do with them? The

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
simple and straightforward answers. Add them to the mix. You know if they pass

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
this initial screening of course you know if you think that this is an opportunity that is worthwhile to be

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
considered you can cater to this market based on your

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
abilities etc.. Add them to the mix and

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
just see how that further that idea that opportunity progresses further

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
through the market opportunity navigator. So it's now your turn.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Apply worksheet 1 and generate your market opportunity set. And don't forget to

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
enjoy. This is a truly exciting and fun activity.
