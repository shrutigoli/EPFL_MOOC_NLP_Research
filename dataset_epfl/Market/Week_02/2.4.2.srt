1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So how do you summarize the learnings that you got from worksheet1 on the market opportunity 

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
navigator dashboard. So the idea is to fill in the market

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
opportunity set on your left with post-its, you know designating the different market opportunities that you

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
have identified. In this example a firm has identified four different market

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
opportunities for you for their technological abilities. So the question is

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What do you actually put in there. You know you have seen the Augury’s example that there was a lot and

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
a lot of different opportunities and some might be more valuable than others. Some might be

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
just nonsense. You know we ask you to be very creative but over time you might say maybe we were a bit

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
too creative but that's completely fine. You know so. So don't be worried about this. This is now

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
the step of weeding out those obvious candidates where I say

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
we do not have a possibility to ever pursue this purpose, perhaps we don't have the abilities

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
perhaps we the market potential is not there. The goal. Let me remind you this

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
is to have Post-It notes in the first box that designate your market

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
opportunities. So again the varied set is an

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
important asset to your firm. It provides you with the growth options that you have. It provides

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
you with plan B. And also make sure to fill your market opportunities that with

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
with truly interesting options. What does this mean in terms of key questions that you can

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
ask for an initial screening. Weeding out those opportunities that may or may not

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
be lucrative interesting to pursue. First you

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
can say does the customer need exist?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A few phone calls might do the trick. Try to understand.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well does this particular market segment to the customers in this particular market segment

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
actually have. Second can we really satisfies the customer need using

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
our unique abilities and in particular an existing solution. This can

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
be done mostly with desktop research trying to understand what other

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
options are out there. And are there several areas severe restrictions that would hinder us from

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
executing on this market opportunity essentially saying well you know maybe there are

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
legal issues. Maybe there are other issues in terms of costs that we can never

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
shoulder in order to get to that market. And finally and this is also

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
important for you to remember. You know you want to do something that aligns

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
with your moral values with your passion with what you're in for and also

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
check those opportunities out of the mix that would be in conflict with any of

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the core values. And once you've gone through this exercise you have already a good idea

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
of what type of opportunities you will be able to place in the market opportunity

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
set. And again as I mentioned before

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
having like three or five market opportunities in the set should be the rule of thumb

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
should be the goal that you strive for. We depicted here for on these blue

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
posted notes. So in order to depict each market opportunity your market opportunity

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
set it's important to label each market opportunity with a name.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
These are very important options for you. So they deserve to have their own name

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
and this will by the way also help you in the team to refer to this market

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
opportunity in a clear and concise manner. You write these names on a sticky note and then you post it

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
in the first part of the market opportunity navigator, your opportunity set.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So as an illustration look again at Saar and Gaul from Augury. They have

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
identified a fantastic number of opportunities. So

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
how do they move from worksheet1 to the market opportunity set. You know

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
this is what their worksheet1 looks like. You remember that slide.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They picked a couple of opportunities for their market opportunities set

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
down here and they picked HVAC, manufacturing machines, cooling

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Containers, white appliances and cars. What is important to remember is

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that they actually pick these opportunities that were on the same level of abstraction. You remember

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
this continents and countries question these are different countries that they pick so that they can actually

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
compare these different market opportunities where are well known

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in their back in their briefcase. They now have these five different market opportunities.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
HVAC for commercial buildings, manufacturing machines, cooling containers,

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
white appliances car manufacturers. OK. So this is an exciting set of

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
market opportunities that are forming this set right now.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So in some this discovery process is a highly, highly important step in your market

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
opportunity navigate process. Why? Because these opportunities that you see ultimately

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
shape what you can do with your over time of course you might add

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
new opportunities, you might discard opportunities that you deem not to be useful

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
or interesting. So this is also a dynamic process over time. But what the starting point

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
of what you see is actually a critical starting point. So take your time and

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
engage in this process with pleasure.
