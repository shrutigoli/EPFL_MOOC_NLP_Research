1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So the question is now how to move from the bottom part of worksheet1 with all the market opportunities that we have


2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
identified. Remember the Augury sample which presents actually a very broad range of market

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
opportunities and different sub-segments and how you move from the bottom part

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to the market opportunity navigator. And that's only one issue to keep in mind and we call this issue the

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
continents and countries question. So you remember that every

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
application of your abilities for a specific set of customers is one

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
market opportunity of your firm. So when you think about the example from

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Saar And Gaul Augury. And the work they have filled in they have a lot of

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
potential market opportunities that they can move into this first part of them navigate a

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
process into this briefcase. The market opportunity set as it's picked it up here

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
on the site. And as you remember also from the Augury example these can

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
be varied options. Some are very broad. Some are sub-segments

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and you might already have a hunch of what my continents and countries issue

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
will be like that I'm going to address in a minute. But we create

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
that give you the tip to say can we zoom in and zoom out to identify even more opportunities

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
zooming in, meaning you are identified based on a broad opportunity sub-segments

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
or zooming out meaning you actually use sub-segments and then try to

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
understand what broader market could be above them.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This creates these tree structures. But these tree structures also

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
bed within themselves. Different levels of analysis. And I think that's

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
where the trick comes in you know in order to ultimately be able to evaluate different market

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
opportunities with each other and compare these market opportunities. You will have to have

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
market opportunities on the same level of analysis. This is the continents and countries

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
question a continent in that sense is a broad market domain or a vertical in the continent

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
you know content several countries you know all market segments. So in order to

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
arrive at a consistent market opportunity set you will have to have market opportunities

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
at your fingertips that are at the same level of stretch. Otherwise this would be almost

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
impossible to compare. Two broad is not good because think about it a broad

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
market segment means that there are some segments below there no country continent

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
has different cuts of countries. They might have very different types of

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
feature characteristics some might be very attractive some might be less attractive.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So it's really difficult to understand which is if you look at the continent level

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
which type of segments are attractive and which type of segments are not attractive.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Some provide just more fertile ground than others. Too narrow is also often not

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
good as you want to address a market segment that has a certain size to make your effort

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
worthwhile. An interesting illustration of this continent versus country

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
that can provide both agree you remember the day I identified a truly exciting opportunity

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
set on very different continents. They had

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the machine applications and they had the human body application. This is very, very

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
different. These are truly different continents. And when you think about this Augury example Saar and Gaul


41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
really have to make a decision before they commit to a certain market domain.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Which area they want to go. Should they go into the human body

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
applications or should they go into the area of machine

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
predictive maintenance. So to make this major decision Gaul and Saar

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
had to understand first the different possible market segment which is within

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
each continent then had to evaluate the overall potential and challenges in each continent.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Over all they discovered that their offering could be disruptive in machine maintenance.

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
While many big payoffs already attempt to offer predictive health care products in the medical

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
domain hence they considered the potential in the machine

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
domain to be much higher and the overall challenge is to be lower cost

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
medical devices require a heavy regulation. For instance, the South Augury is founders

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
chose to focus on predictive maintenance for machine and put aside the

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
medical market. So while we urge you to generate

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
as many varied options market opportunities as possible. Make

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
sure when you create your market opportunity set, that you pick options at the same level

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
of analysis. Otherwise you do not end up with a

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
consistent market opportunity set, pick the same level of analysis.
