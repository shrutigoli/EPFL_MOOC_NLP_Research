00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hi there! As we wrap up this week we would like to go

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
back to Flyability and show you how they generated their market

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
opportunity set. As presented in the previous

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
week Flyability build safe drones for operating in

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
doors, in complex and confined spaces and in contact with people.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This drone which they call Elliotts can be applied to perform

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
different jobs for different types of customers. Let's go back to my

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Qandil Flyability marketing manager to see how they are

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
de-link and re-link their technology to identify a set

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
of market opportunities.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So Flyability has one product which is a drone which

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is unique on the market because it has a surrounding protective

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
frame which actually protect the drone from the surrounding environment.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So basically the drone can hit an obstacle and

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
keep a city in the air and not crash but it also is

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
a very unique feature because human can interact with the drone

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
without risk of injuries. The drone can be piloted remotely from

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
from a safe place. In this way the operator doesn't need to

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
enter a dangerous space which is actually the place where

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
we want to send a drone for gathering images and

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
content about the environment. So with this live stream that the

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
drone is sending to the operator you can literally

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
do a remote inspection of a place.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
To begin with, let's describe Flyability's core technology on the

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
upper part of Worksheet1. First and foremost the

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
drone that they planned to develop has unique accessibility.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It is taller on two collisions due to the cathode and light protection

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
cage that surrounds, it can fly or roll on any

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
surface and it will actually be able to operate in a range of

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
temperatures and pressures. Second the drone has

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
unique aviation abilities. It will be piloted manually with an on

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
site video screen even in very dark smoke or dusty

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
environments but only for a limited duration due to

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
battery limitations. Lastly it carries an

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
automated fully adjustable imagery system with HD and

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
thermal recordings that are life stream to the control screen and

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
recorded for a later analysis. Breaking the technology

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
into its core elements decoupled from any specific usage

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
helps us to think broadly about the possible applications of these drones.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So that when we're looking at the market the opportunities

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
we saw initially we thought about natural

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Disaster, emergency response and disaster

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
recovery. And we started there. We quickly went

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to other opportunities because we see there is a huge demand

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for inspection and providing better means

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
of performing inspection when it comes to

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
assessing the integrity of industry or other assets. So each

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
industry has specific assets it can be a building, it can be a

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
production tool, and these assets need to

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
be checked in regular faces and

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
and it's part of the maintenance operation and part of it is visual

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
inspection to simply assess the integrity to make sure that everything is fine. And

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
depending on the results take different actions. So this is really one of the

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
initial market that we're that we foresee there is other

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
applications that that were also on the map. If you think of

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
everything that is outside like a bridge, a dam. So these are

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
let's say a very different environment because they are open there.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But it seems that the specificities

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
of educe makes it very comfortable when it comes to flying indoors. So

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
this will be we kind of move further into

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
assets that are covered that are closed because it's easier with radios.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There is another market or so that is, that is very interesting

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
with radios. Is all the operation that

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
that have to do with security. So if you think of police forces or

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
special operation that need to access a building where there is for example hostages

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it's very practical to be able to send a drone in the place

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
get visual information to assess the situation and stay in a very safe

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
place while doing that.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Now let's apply this information to the bottom part of Worksheet 1

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
as Mark mentioned the team identified several promising applications

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
at its early stage that could bring real value from the start

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
inspection of complex industry machineries, inspection

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Of difficult to maintain infrastructures and also security

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
or rescue applications. Each of these applications can address

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the need of different types of customers. For example

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
industrial inspection can be applied in the oil and gas industries to

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
inspect storage tanks or pressure vessels. It can be applied to

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
different types of power plants and even to the maritime industry

79
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
infrastructure inspection can be relevant for indoor facilities

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
such as sewers and also for outdoor facilities that as

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
bridges security and rescue applications can be

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
used for intelligence gathering by militaries or police

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
forces or by rescue forces such as firefighters

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
after an initial rough screening flyer booty's team

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
decided to further examine those market opportunities. It seems to be

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
reachable and especially those that mainly require indoor

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
navigation to suit the expected initial imitations of the drone.

88
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Their market opportunity set included five options.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Among them the market that we had selected there was five market

90
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
opportunity that were really, really interesting. The

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
first one was boiler's the inspection of boilers in thermal electric

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
plants. The second one was the inspection of

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
meriting vessels. The third one was oil and gas

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
storage tanks so big things where you store liquid in bulk.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There was also the nuclear power plant. So inspecting all of the surrounding

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
environment around the nuclear reactor. And the last one

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
was the support of special operation with the police forces.

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This learning process can now be concluded and depicted in the

100
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
market opportunity set of the navigator using sticky notes to

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
represent each market opportunity. At the end of next week

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
we will see how flight ability evaluated the attractiveness of each of these

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
opportunities to understand which one is most valuable for them.
