00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello my name is Francois Ave and I will show you in this MOOC, the different information

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you can get using scanning electron microscopy characterization of the

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
microstructure of semanticist material.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We first need to understand how a microscope works and what happens when electrons are sent to

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
assemble and heat the surface of the material.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the first question we could ask is Why do we use electrons rather than visible light.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The first approach for observing the macro structure is to use an optical microscope, using

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
light as the source of emissions. However the resurrection of

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
light microscope is limited by the wavelength of visible light between 400 to 800

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
nanometers. The wavelength of electrons is actually much smaller

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
around 1 to 10 Pico meters. It is to observe much smaller objects

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and to get a much better resolution in the case of electron microscopy the

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
resolution is actually not limited by the wavelength of electrons but by the

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
aberrations inside of microscope which are kinds of physical deviations

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
caused by the microscope lenses. The most common type of microscopy to observe the

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
microstructure of semanticist materials is the scanning electron microscope which is

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
actually more accessible and easier to use when transmission electron microscopic

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
in a scanning electron microscope, electrons are emitted from

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the different source the best for a series of lenses which focus them

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and then the electrons reach the surface of the sample.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And they go a series of elastic inelastic collisions with

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the atoms of the simple, different

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
signals can be collected from these collisions. When we talk about the scanning

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
electron microscope it means that actually the face of a simple would be analyze

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
point by point and the final image is actually

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the assemblage of the information from all this point.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
An insolent electron as you can see here, faces a series of interactions

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
before its energy is fully dissipated. Thus all these

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
interactions from this incident electron and the elections of the sample

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
does not occur exactly the entering point of the electrons

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but occur in a more global volume which is called the interaction volume

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
these interactions can be either elastic we've no energy loss or

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Inelastic, the first kind of interaction which can occur between the

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
electron and the atoms of a simple is if an incident

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
electron, as one here, collides with an electron

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Of the atom of the sample, from this collision the incident

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
electron deviated like this, and bound electron is ejected

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
this ejected electron is called a secondary electron or also called SE

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
the energy of the secondary electrons is typically lower than 50 electon volt

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
which is actually very small, verse if electrons

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
want to be collected by a detector. They have to be formed very close to the samples surface

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
even deeper in a sample then electrons would face some interaction

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
before reaching a simple surface that would be absorbed in the sample due to very low

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
energy and they would not be collected by a secondary electron detector.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So verse the contrast we can obtain will be secondary electrons is a

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
typography contrast as you can see here. Here is shown three

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
points where incident electrons are sent

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and you can see that actually this volume here is a volume where secondary direction can

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
escape and then be then detected. And you can see that at the edges

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
more electrons can escape the surface. And this verse can be collected.

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This means that on the image on these specific points

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
we get more signal and we have a brighter contrast.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is called the edge effect. Another kind of interaction which can occur

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
is when an incident electron feels the Coolum

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
interactions with a nucleus of an atom of assemble this incident

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
electron is deviated because of this Coolum interaction.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If this division leads to higher angle diffusion, then the

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
electron can leave the surface and it can be

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
collected by the backscattered electron detector. So this electrons which is

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
scattered back is called backscatter the electrons or BSE

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
this interaction is almost elastic. There is almost no energy transfer

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
which means that the energy of the back scattered electrons is very similar to the energy

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
of the incident beam, so which information can be obtained with

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
backscatter electrons?

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, the Coolum false, we have a nucleus increases with the

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
atomic number that, indeed with increase of the atomic

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Number, the number of positive charges of the atom increases, thus the incidence

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
electron has a higher likelihood to be deviated if more electrons are

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
deviated more will also be collected, thus the contrast will be brighter

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
at the image for a higher set of the atom. This graph here shows

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
you that brightness increases with the atomic

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
number which is even best character coefficient which is related to the intensity of the signal

73
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
as a function of the atomic number and you can see that if you have a material

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
with a higher average said inside, then you see that actually you will see something

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
brighter on your image because you will collect more backscatter electrons.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The third kind of interaction which is very useful for the characterization of a microstructure

77
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
of semanticist materials is the formation of characteristic X-rays

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
after the ignition of a secondary electron shown here.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
An electron is missing in the layer of

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the atom. This atom is ionized.

81
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If this missing electron originates from an inner electron shell of the atom

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
this atom is energetically unstable. In order to reach a

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
more favorable energetic level, energy form falls

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
from an outer shell with a higher energy to

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
fill the vacancy, these release of energy during this

86
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
relaxation phenomenon leads to the formation of an X-ray.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And what is important is that the energy of the X-ray is related to the

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
energy difference of the two shell levels here.

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thus the energy of these x rays is characteristic of the atom they come

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
From. Every element these x rays come from can first be

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
identify and the atom content can be quantified for a selected

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
spot of microstructure. This image shows you

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
how the chamber of a microscope looks like. So you have here the end of a column, So

94
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
this is the incident beam coming here, leading from the hall to the

95
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Chamber. So the sample holder is right below here. So you sent elections to the

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
sample you will have all these interactions which will be corrected by different defectors

97
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We have here the secondary electron defector which is green on top

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the Golden plate here is this BSC detector and the EDA detector is that it

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is right at the back of it hidden. So we can collect all of its information in

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
one microscope. These three types of interactions are very useful to

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
characterize the microstructure of semanticist materials, even next session you

102
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
will see how to set a nice image and some applications of these three types of

103
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
interactions for semanticist materials. The first application

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
for secondary electrons is the study of the mythology of

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
particles. You can see here. You have two very nice

106
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
images showing you of a mythology here of killing night  particles to an

107
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
anhydrous material. And here for the growth of CSH. So we choose

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
hydration product at a very early age of hydration.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
These secondary entrance are used because of its topography contrast which permit to really see

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Nicely the morphology of a particles. This analysis is only

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
qualitative. We can't get any quantitative analysis from this study. But still.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It permit to really have a look the

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
different mythologies we can find in some indigenous materials. So after talking about.

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Secondary electrons, we can now focus on backscatter electrons.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
To do so, It's always better to prepare

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Simple as a polished cross-section. As you saw

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
before in the Sample preparation, of course.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So the sample is put in a sample holder like this we just Clip it.

119
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And then we will install it Inside a microscope. So the chamber of a

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
microscope is always in the vacuum to avoid any contamination.

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And first vacuum was broken using nitrogen gas. And then the sample

122
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
is gently put on the sample stage. We

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
use a small giraffe, just check the height of a simple to make sure that we're not too far

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
from the good focus and then we close the chamber and we apply a vacuum

125
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
again. So now the sample is inside of a

126
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
microscope and we just waited for a good vacuum to be done to make sure that

127
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
we won't have any contamination. Moreover it's very important to have a good vacuum

128
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
otherwise the electrons which are sent to a sample could

129
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
interact with air molecules inside of a chamber. So it's very important to remove as much as possible

130
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
air molecule present inside the chamber. When the

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
vacuum is good enough we can start applying a voltage which

132
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
will lead to an emission of a current, emission of electrons sent

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
to a simple you just click HV here, And we will see an

134
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
image appearing on the screen. We start collecting

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Backscattered electrons and this is the contrast. You can see there. We have some really great

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Contrast showing the backscattered electrons collected and

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So the different phases we've seen some semanticist material. As you can

138
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
see the image is a big blur.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because we're not exactly in focus. So first we need to set the focus to make

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
sure that we have the best resolution possible. So to change our focus. We

141
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Simply adjust the z position of the stage to make sure that the symbol is a

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
good height, and the working distance. So we can see

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
here the typical microstructure of a plane Portland cement sample

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
for which the hydration was stopped at 20 days, so

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
different areas can be clearly distinguished. We can first observe

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
bright gray areas.

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
These bright areas correspond to anhydrous Clinker grains

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
between these anhydrous grains a metrics of hydration products

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
fills the space, fill with porosity with time

150
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
so in these bright grains we can clearly identify (12:29) with this angular

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
shape of grains which can also see that for some grains we

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
have not only one great contrast but civil at the same time which means

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
that actually Clinker grains are polyphased and not all monophased

154
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
so I put on this screen some faces which are likely to be

155
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There, with b c you cannot directly know what is what. But we can

156
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
demonstrate it we can prove it later.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Doing and EDX on these phases. Concerning the

158
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
hydration products you can first easily identify bottom diets or

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
calcium hydroxide or C.H. Is this kind of uniform microstructure you can see

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
here. Uniform Greeneville

161
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
which is actually brighter than the other hydrate, otherwise the

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
main phase filling the rest of porosity is this CSH phase as you can

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
see everywhere we can see either outer CSH.

164
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Also inners CSH which grew inside the initial boundary

165
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
of clinker grains

166
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Intricate can also be absurd.

167
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This kind of needles Yeah.

168
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And the rest which is black is the

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
porosity which is dark is the porosity. Why is the porosity

170
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
dark? simply because we are sending electrons to response and we do

171
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
not collect anything back which is why the contrast is darkening this.

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
another question we could ask is why is the contrast of anhydrous phases brighter?

173
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
because hydrated phases contain water.

174
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Which significantly decreased the average age coefficient of the phrase.

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Or less dense which makes them look darker on the

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
image. So we can have a look at plane PC systems but also that

177
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
means the rest of using it seems to look at over type of balance. Here is an

178
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
example of limestone calcined clay cement or LC3 at one day of hydration.

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
In this system the clay used is not a pure calcined clay of pure

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
matter counting but it's a clay with only 50 percent of

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
of kaolinite calcined inside. So the microstructure

182
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
shows some differences. Compared to the plane cement of 74.

183
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
First we can observe limestone particles here, here, here,

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
also there. We've got a regular shape with a small rim of

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
CSH green and the surface.

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
In LC3 in limestone calcined clay cement.

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Also of course observe calcined clay particles. And what you can see with these

188
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Calcined clay particles like here, here, here, also there, there also

189
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
is that the grille all is not uniform everywhere.

190
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why so it means that we have actually impurities in calcined clay, as I said

191
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
before this clay here contains only 50 percent of gelignite which means that the rest

192
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
is impurities. For instance this particle here on the top

193
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
of this image shows a much brighter area on the right side.

194
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And this indicates that there is likely to have

195
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
elements with higher atomic number or higher Z  in this area

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
which is likely to be actually a narrow any impurity in the calcined clay

197
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
so we have best scattered electron imaging we can have very

198
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
nice information on the repetition of the

199
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
phases in the microstructure. But for the identification of phases

200
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
we do not have any evidence, any clinical evidence of a phases.

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let just try now to carry out immediate analysis on this macro structure to

202
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
identify several phases that we assumed to be present before

203
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
on this video is shown the quantification of A-light phase

204
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
we spots several points of

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
A-light in these grain here and we're going to start.

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
With the EDX analysis to get the chemical composition of a phase

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
as you can see the quantification is very fast. And now we can have a look at the

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
results for EDX there are some tricks

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
to be aware of. First it is impossible to quantify hydrogen

210
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as we saw before. To form an X-ray we need to

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
have an negatron fall from an upper player of the atom, for hydrogen

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
is impossible because there is only one electron. So we cannot quantify hydrogen.

213
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
EDX another thing is that the quantification of oxygen

214
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
and other light elements is not extremely reliable.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Because of the extremely low energy you need to ionized

216
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
oxygen and the other light elements. So it's not very

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
accurate. Thus it is better actually to

218
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
use atomic ratios from the chemical analyzes than

219
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
direct values collected on the software.

220
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
For instance fossil ferrous here instead of looking at the absolute value of things

221
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we can have a look at the calcium to silicon ratio. We know that in a light

222
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
we should have calcium  to silicon ratio close to three not to make calcium to silicon ratio close to three

223
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
which is the case here. So

224
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
this evidence is the presence of C3S in this grain

225
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
we can do so for all of the other phases and hydrous or hydrates to evidence their

226
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
presence in the microstructure.

227
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The main issue for EDX analyzes is the

228
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
interaction volume we talked about at the beginning of this talk

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When a specifics sport is pointed actually the information which we

230
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
collect does not come from this point only but comes from the

231
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
interaction volume related to this point which is a few microns. Right.

232
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So if we are pointing just at the border between two phases it is very likely to have information

233
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
from both phase.

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is an issue of a determination of a C(-A)-S-H

235
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
composition so CSH and C(-A)-S-H are roughly the

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
same thing. It's just that when very the significant incorporation of aluminum in

237
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
this CSH we call it a C(-A)-S-H, in the case of LC3

238
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
For instance we call it C(-A)-S-H. So when we point the CSH

239
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Here, it is extremely likely to have information on other phases

240
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
at the same time. Thus the

241
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
idea to get an accurate composition of a CSH is to use

242
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
2D scatter plots to deal with intermixing problem.

243
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
How does it work? The best way of doing it is to plot's the aluminum

244
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
to calcium ratio here, the atomic composition aluminum to calcium ratio as a function of a

245
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Silicon to Calcium ratio. Why do we do that?

246
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Because the intermixing which can occur with Portlandite or calcium hydroxide

247
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
can be directly observed. These phases I

248
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
just mention are present on the left axes here because they didn't contain any

249
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
silicon this way we can isolate the points which

250
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
are really CSH from points which are coming with a bit

251
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
of information of these pure phases here. But on that engaging

252
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
in and if you do that. So this is for

253
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,000
a new PC system at 20 days of hydration and 93 system of 20 day of hydration.

254
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We can collect approximately 200 points per system

255
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and we get these kind of clouds of data

256
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
so if we have to look closer to the PC system for instance we have a cloud of

257
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
data around this composition here. And we have some point deviating and

258
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
going for instance here towards spot on that if we take for instance this point

259
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
here which is roughly in the middle between CH and this cloud of

260
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
SH it means that for this point we have information

261
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:39,000
approximately about half of from C.H. from part on that and the from this CSH.

262
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now how to find the exact CSH composition

263
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
you have a cloud of data here. The more you are on the left

264
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
side of his cloud the more you are in damage with other phases

265
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
which means that's the rights correct CCH composition

266
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
is at the right age of a cloud.

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So you can use these tine lines from Compton

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
from these phases we've fixed stricken metrical composition to help you

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
to find the re-composition the intersection of these lines from pothlandite, atrogite

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and A.F.M phases should give you a very good CSH composition

271
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
and what you can see when you can apply it to different systems which is the case here.

272
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
So we have OPC and this is the system and what we can see is that we have really strong

273
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
differences in terms of CSH composition within the system. We have a strong

274
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
silicon and aluminum incorporation in the CSH. This is a kind of

275
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
valuable information you can get from EDX analysis

276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
another thing which you can do with EDX which is more global I'd

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
say is to get a phase distribution not only on some

278
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
points but on the whole map in your system which is an example is

279
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
shown here for an OPC system.

280
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So you simply select the elements you want aluminum, silicon, calcium, magnesium,

281
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Iron, oxygen, potassium, sodium, sulfur and you can

282
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
actually acquire and ADX but not on a couple of points but on

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
each point of your map so of course this takes more time.

284
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
But this also gives us some valuable indication on the phase distribution inside your

285
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
microstructure. So that's a very nice example

286
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
of how we can use microscope for semanticist materials.

287
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
There are many other applications which can be

288
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
studied with a scanning electron microscope for instance

289
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
we serve a porosity scan of dark area and the microstructure

290
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This porosity which is of course a kind of curve porosity like Kosovan

291
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
approximately one micron can be quantified using image

292
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
analyzes and we can get a rough estimation on the porosity of a system

293
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
the size distribution of particles can also be determined. It's qualitative

294
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
busted. It can be. It can give us an idea about the distribution of

295
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
of a particle size. Another thing we can do with

296
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
them is to look at the Grealy whole sense of know see

297
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
what you can see here that is just microstructure for instance with temperature

298
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
we can see that we know that the density of its porosity changes and depending on the

299
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
agreeable intensity we can't celebrate it and know how much it changes

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
with temperature. Finally mapping can also

301
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
be very useful to characterize the damage. For instance or actually see care reaction.

302
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It is extremely useful to follow the direction of a song

303
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and to know where the damage is and what really happens then we to better understand

304
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
mechanisms of these interactions. To sum up what is so

305
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
stunning electron microscopy is one of the most powerful technique for a study of

306
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
semanticist materials. We can do really many different

307
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
things with scanning electron microscope from Topographic imaging to

308
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Basket electron imaging from chemical analysis. And there are really many

309
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
applications for which scanning electron microscope pretty pennies to better

310
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
understand what's going on in a semanticist is material.

311
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thank you for watching.
