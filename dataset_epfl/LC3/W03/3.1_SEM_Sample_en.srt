Hi. I am Aurélie Favier and this tutorial will explain how to stop hydration by solvent

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
exchange and how to prepare polish section for scanning electron microscopy.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
After preparation of a sample of cement paste, mortar, concretes you want to test it at specific

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
times 1 day 3 days 28 days. Today I will show you how to stop

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
hydration on a sample of cement based, first the sample may be strong enough to be so.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's a simple it's not strong enough. Then you will definitely stop the hydration using freeze

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
drying or filtration under isopropanol. Once the slid is good

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It must be emerge in a sufficient amount of isopropyl with a 99 percent accurate.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It would be necessary to renew the solution regularly the first 24 hours and then every

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
24 hours for 4 to 7 days maximum the disk will run

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
dry in the scuttle for 48 hours. You solvent is finally ready to be put in

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
prison and polished it would first be polish with 1200 grain size sand

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
paper and still a flat shiny interface is obtain you can get a small piece

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and residual must be blown. The sample is then placed in the mold to be resin

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
coated. The mold ear made silicon commodes but commercial mode can be

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
used. In order to avoid air bubbles. The sample are kept under vacuum

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
during the introduction of a resin or weather. You can also prove a resin first and then

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
vacuum it to remove any air bubbles. We are going to prepare a resin to  a mixture

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of 80 percent resin with 20 percent our dinner. This resin is well-mixed and

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
smoke a pipe to fill the molds. The amount of resin can be so that

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
our simple Avocet act. And all them some minute and or vacuum again.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The resin hardens within 24 hours and then it is possible to do the samples.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I will now show you how to polish the samples. First of all we will slightly

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
discover a simple with a 1200 sandpaper. A few seconds of polishing to

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
remove a thin layer of resin at 150 RPM. The trace

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
of a mold must be no longer observe and continuous line must not be observed between the samples.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And the resin I did is present on the right picture then the polishing is carried out

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
using a spray containing particles of diamonds and a lubricant petroleum. There are

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
actually three steps corresponding to a diamond particle size. We always start with the biggest

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
one nine microns and then the finest one, one microns, in this

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
slide I'll show you some indicative time of each step depending on the simple types mortar

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
based concrete. Of course we must adapt to your samples and simple age

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it is recommend to not rush and control regularly the first time at least one drop

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
every two recipient of lubricant is needed. And the diamond particles must be renewed every

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
45 minutes. Samples should be cleaned with an ultrasonic bath in

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
isopropanol between each step. It is recommend to have one polishing disk size.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Finally you sample after cleaning maybe store 48 hours invidia sector to remove any trace

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
of solvent that can contaminate the electron microscope before to be used for

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
microscopy. We need to have a conductive layer typically for Polish exposure of cement.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We caught with carbon we put a piece of carbon free then we are just out of a sample to

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
get a carbon layer approximately 10 to 15 nanometers. Finally we put and

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a vacuum simple and we can apply Eichhorn to polarize the Carbon on the simple surface.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your sample is finally ready.
