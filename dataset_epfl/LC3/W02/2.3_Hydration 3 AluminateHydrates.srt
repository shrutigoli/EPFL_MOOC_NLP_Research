00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
OK. so welcome back and welcome to this module on the illuminate for 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hydrates. In the last slides we saw about

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
these hydrates that formed from the hydration of the calcium silicates spaces that's to

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
say C3S mainly and C2S later on. And in

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
this module we're going to look at the hydrates that formed from the

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Illuminates, that’s to say the C3A face and the ferrite face usually called

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
C4AF if these faces are not as prevalent as the ones from the

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
calcium silicate faces but nevertheless quite significant. So in this slide

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we see the faces that are formed from a typical ordinary Portland

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
cement. And while the face is from the calcium silicates that's to say calcium

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
hydroxide and CSH are making up about 65 percent of

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the volume of the final paste the hydrates coming from the

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
C3S and C4AF that’s to say this AFM and AFT are still

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
accounting for about 25 percent by volume. So this is a quite

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
significant amount of the final volume of the paste. Now these

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
illuminator hydrate sprawly come in three families. First we have these

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
routes which are called austenite. Now the formula of austenite is

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as written here as to say for each molecule of C3A we have

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
three molecules across him sulfate and then a lot of water.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And in what we're going to see in a lot of these hydrates we can have a

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
replacement of the aluminum ions by ion ions. These are very similar

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
elements from a chemical point of view and because of that as well

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
as the term austenite which means perform with Aluminum and we also

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
have this term AFT, so A and F means the

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
possibility for having either Illumina or iron oxide and

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
T is the other anions. That's to say in

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
this case the calcium sulfate. And here we have three calcium sulfates. So

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
three gives us the word tri. Now the second family

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
has many more variants depending on the different anions that we find.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And for this reason we tend to use more often the generic word

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A F M standing for Aluminate ferrite Maula face.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And finally we don't usually have very much of it in common cement

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
pace. We have the hydrocarbons and in the next slides we're going to look at each of

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
these families in turn and see in more detail about their crystal structure

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
and the possibilities of solid solution. Austenite was first found

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
in the town of Austyn hence the name and in nature it conforms these

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
very big crystals so if we look at this picture here we can see we can get these really

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
huge crystals which have this hexagonal cross-section

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
and we can see the crystal structure is like this. So we have

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
columns and in these columns we have Illumina and we have the calcium

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
surrounded by lots of hydroxide ions and then in between the columns

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
we have these sulfate molecules. More generally the formula

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is like this, so we have three calcium’s either aluminum or

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
iron and then these hydroxide groups and the water molecules

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and then the X3. This can be a divergent A9, in this

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
case we're talking about here. It's sulfate. But another possibility

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
is carbonate. So Eshun guide forms early on in cement

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
pace and some may later transform into the AFM phases that we're

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
going to see later depending on the amount of sulfate and carbonate we have in the

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
paste. So in most cement pace and indeed most

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
blended cements there's not much variation in fact in the

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Composition, the composition we find is pretty close to the story here

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
metric austenite. So even though we know we can have this solid

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
solubility between aluminum and ion in actual cement pace

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
because of the high alkalinity of the poor solution not much of the iron actually

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
goes into the austenite phase is pretty much just the pure aluminum form.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have some salt solution as I've mentioned between carbonate ion and

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
sulfate and this can be stabilized at low

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
temperature so at low temperatures we tend to get more carbonate going into the

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
AFT phase and the other important aspects about austenite

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
of it has this high water content as we've seen. And because of this it actually has

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
quite a low density. Okay, and because it has low density this means fills up a lot of

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
space. So in terms of filling space it makes a very positive

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
contribution to strength development and other properties.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now in terms of stability the stability of austenite thermal terms is

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
very very similar to that of the CSH. Here we see the thermal

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
decomposition curves by DTA for entering CSH. And we

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
can see that the peak for the two is in a very very similar position at

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
120 140 around that kind of temperature. Now

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
as we move to the second group AFM phase. These are part of a much

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
larger group of hot hydrates called layered double hydroxide. Some of you may have

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
heard of lead double hydroxide because they're really research quite a

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
lot nowadays for the interesting electronic properties. And in this layer

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
double hydroxide. We have layers of

75
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
M2 and M3 ions and then between the layers we have

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
these anions and the fact you can put in a lot of different anions leads to what's

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
called parley typist. So in this larger a family of layer double

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
hydroxide is quite a large number of groups have been

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
defined purrfect age groups with this what's called hydro

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
tower site supper in the super groups So this hydro tower sites where you have

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
three to one divalent to trivalent ions the queen ion

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
group where we have two to one divalent to trivalent so on. And

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
finally we come to the Hydra catamite group which is what interests us where these

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
divalent ions are calcium and the trivalent ions are

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Aluminum and they exist in the ratio of two to one.

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So this is the AFM face is this is the kind of layer we

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
have in those AFM phases is a distorted layer similar to what we have

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
in bruce sites with two calcium to one Alumina. And then

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
the add on that can go in between. That gives us the AFM faces

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
most commonly. Well I mean the first one that gave its name to this group

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
are the Maula sulfates where the line is sulfate. But probably in fact

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
more common today is where we have carbonate ions as

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in mono carbonate and we can also have hydroxide ions as is high at titrate calamite

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
we can have chloride ions as infidel's salt and even

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
complex aluminum silicate ions as instructing

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
as we will see. Now one of the key questions in understanding

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
these faces and particularly how much of forms and what is their

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
contribution to space filling We need to know what is the

99
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
extent of solid solution. So if we take the three most

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
common or if we take that the most common

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
substitution which is between sulfate and carbonate we have

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
these three phases we have mono sulfate we see at the top we have the carbonate

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we see at the bottom on the right and the Hemy carbonate which we see at the

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
bottom on the left. Now because of the different anions

105
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
in the interlayer you can see that the interlayer

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
spacing for these crystal faces is

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
quite different. 8.9 for the mono sulfate. 7.8 for the

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
carbonate an 8.2 for the Hemi carbonate. So these may

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
not seem that big but they are big enough such as in fact

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
we find that these differences mean that we get really no

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
solid solution between these different faces and the transformation

112
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
from one to another really occurs by dissolution and the

113
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
precipitation of the new faces. And if we look more

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
broadly also in cruising the hydroxide phases the hydro

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
calamite face down here. This shows us that really

116
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the only regions of solid solution we have are on this axis between

117
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the Hydro calamite and the and the sulfate form

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
where we can have some solid solution. Otherwise there's really very little solid

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Solution, as I said classically when

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
people are thinking about cement hydration they think about austenite   forming.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then most of the textbooks say yes there is more a sulfate forming

122
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and this is what we can see happens in cement without

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
limestone here you can see that on one day and seven days

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
austenite is dominating but by the time we get to one year we clearly

125
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
have a lot more sulfate faces. Now most cements made

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
today do in fact contain a small amount of limestone 3 or

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
4 percent is typical because this amount of limestone has been shown to

128
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
improve properties at the same time gives us a slight reduction in

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
the net CO2 emissions. And when we have those cements with

130
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
limestone then we can see the picture changes quite dramatically. And

131
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
instead of the more sulfate phase here we have instead forming

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
First of all Hemy carbonate at about 7 for about seven days. And

133
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
later on Mono carbonate, and this is what is one

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
reason why we get improved performance with this small amount of limestone

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
because small amounts of limestone can react with the calcium illuminates from

136
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
the cement forming these extra phases and this means we have more

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
space filling and more strength. Ok so finally in this AFM

138
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
group we're just going to have a quick look at this phase called Strectlinghyde eyes and

139
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
this phase call strectlinghyde  has this very complex alumina

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
silicate groups in the interlayer. You can see now that this has

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
increased quite dramatically the spacing of these interlayers from

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
about seven or eight we had in the mono sulfate molar carbonate cases

143
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
to this value of 12.6 And this can be quite an

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
important phase where we have very high contents of

145
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
alumina and silica reacting in blended cements and (11:49)

146
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it only forms once all the Portland diets being consumed.

147
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But in reality we can often find stretching. Well we still have small amounts of

148
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Portland diets presence. So finally in this module we're going to look

149
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
at the hydro garnets and the classic

150
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
formula for hydro garnets this formula C3AF6

151
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
which is also known as the mineral catalite. And more

152
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
generically what we see. Again we can have solid solution between

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
alumina and iron but now we can have a solid solution between

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
one silicate group and two water groups. So this is why they call

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
hydro garnets, because if all the water was replaced by silicate this would

156
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
be the garnet's structure, and in reality we always have quite a bit of

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
water. And in this case this is actually the

158
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
phase where most of the iron goes to in Portland cement pace. So I said that

159
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the iron because of its low mobility in high alkaline solutions didn't

160
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
go much into the austenite, doesn't go much into the AFM phase but it does

161
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
form the salacious hydro Garnett's which that ends up being quite a lot of. But it's

162
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
rather poorly crystalline. So not often well tested by xrd.

163
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now other important aspects about this phase is it's got a low water content

164
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
and because it got low water content it has a high density and this means that

165
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
it's less space filling. So what if we had a lot of hydro garnets as we would get if we

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Cure's high temperature this also contributes to the

167
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
relatively poor strength and high temperatures because this phase occupies less

168
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
space. So here are some other pictures of the crystal structures of

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the hydro garnets we have in the it's a sort of three

170
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
dimensional structure in which four fold four cores native

171
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
silicon connects the six coordinates of the Alumina

172
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is predicted to form quite a lot in blended cement. But as I said really

173
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
not  much except for the ion

174
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So if we summarize this module what we see in this module is that if the

175
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
illuminator contain hydrates are a very important part of this hydrate face assemblage

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
they make up about typically about 25 percent of the volume and mature pace

177
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
they do contribute to space filling and therefore the contribution strength development very

178
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
much in the same way as CSH in pace as long as we have a

179
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
continuous CSH phase with austenite and

180
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Mono Sulfate finally buried in it then they are contributing in

181
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
same way to strength development. Austenite can be formed

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
with different substitutes. But in most Portland cement paste most  blended cement pace

183
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
it's really very close to the  stoichiometry formula in AFM phases

184
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
on the other hand Solid solution is much more important and limestone as we

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
find almost ubiquitously present in molten cements that favors the

186
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
formation of carbon illuminates rather than Mono sulfate faces as you've

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
properly learnt in the past. Final type hydro garnets

188
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
forms only at long ages or at high temperatures. OK. So thank you very

189
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
much.
