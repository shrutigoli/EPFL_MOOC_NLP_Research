1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So welcome back. In this module, we'll be talking 

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
about the hydration reactions. And this is clearly the fundamental

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
aspect which is responsible for the behavior of cementations materials.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
In this first module I'm going to give you an overview of what hydration is

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the different phases we have present and how they

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
contribute to this hydration process, in later

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
videos. We're going to look in more detail at these individual hydrate phases and

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
then the mechanisms of hydration. So before we go on we have a

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
question of nomenclature, now cement chemists are a little bit lazy

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and because we're generally dealing with oxides we have a

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
shorthand to shorten the chemical formula. Now you need to know

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
this but it is really quite simple. Basically, calcium

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
oxide or lime which is rationed Ca0 in full

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
chemical notation becomes simply C.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Similarly, silicon dioxide or silica which is as SIO2

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
the form location becomes S, aluminum

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
oxide or alumina AL2O3 becomes A

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
iron oxide becomes F, sulfate becomes

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
S or S dollar or dollar sign and water

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
becomes H. So could you give some examples or you can see how

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the formula was shorted or shortened. So if we talk about the main

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
phase that is reacting important cement, this is called tri calcium

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
silicate or a light. And in the full chemical formula this

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
has to be mentioned as Ca3SIO5. is quite

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
long but this can be simply shortened by the chemical. The cement

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
chemist notation C3S and it's often also known

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
by this name C3S. if we look at

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
another re-active mineral that we may find in Calcium sulfate or Illuminati's

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
cements. This is called Yellow miters the mineral name and the full chemical

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
formula is even more complex Ca4 Al6 SO16

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and this can simply be shortened to C4A3S

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and that is often known by that phrase. C4A3S but

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
still a bit of a mouthful but not as bad as this one over here.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If we now go on to the hydrates notably calcium silicate hydrate

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
which is making up the majority of sematiouse micro structures

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we have a further complication that the stoichiometry of this

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
phase is not fixed, this varies quite widely as we'll talk about

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
subsequently in the full chemical formula. I've represented that

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
variability by the X’s and y’s but on the right here

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
we see the way it's usually written by cement chemists that we use

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
hyphens here to denote that the ratios between these different

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
elements are not fixed and we normally call this phase C S H.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So this is very important to remember this terminology.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
OK. So let's go back to the schematics. We saw these in the earlier

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
lecture to give a very basic idea of how cement

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
works and I really want to stress that it's all to do with volumes. So

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
when we mix the gray powder with water what we have is these gray cement

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
grains floating about in water and then the cement

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
grains are dissolving in the water. This is exaggerated in the next picture

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
here where you see the grains get smaller. So the ions that

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
are in the cement grains are passing into the water and then they're making

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
new combinations and those combinations are precipitating

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
as the hydrates which we've seen here in red. So now

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we see the basic idea that these red hydrates are now

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
joining the cement grains together and by joining the cement grains

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
together you get a rigid solid which has strength but you will still have

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
some areas where there's no material may contain water, may contain air.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And these are known as porous. So it's very important to

59
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
keep this basic idea of hydration as this change in

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
solid volumes in your head. We can look at it another

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
way. First of all in a real microstructure. So this is a picture of a

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
real cement grains. And what you can see in the cement

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
grains is that they've got different levels of gray which means they've

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
got different chemical compositions. And typically in cement we can

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
identify four main phases. So we see this phase

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
here which is called a light or C3S. This is the

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
majority phase and we will make up between 40 and 70

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
percent of the cement. Then we see some other grains like

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
this one down here, a more rounded and this grain is made

70
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of what we called B light or C2S. So this is another calcium silicate face

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
but has somewhat less calcium than the C3S, this also means it's

72
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
less reactive. And then in addition

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
to these A light to B light we can see this darker phase which is the illuminate

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
phase. Or C3S and this very

75
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
bright face. It's very bright because this is the face which contains the ion which

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
is called ferrite. And this is usually written as C4AF

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
although you should be aware that the ratio of aluminum to iron

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
is not fixed at 1 to 1. So these are the four faces that

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
make up our Portland cement. So then what we see

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
here is the different reactivity of these different faces we

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
can see that the compressive strength coming from C3S is by far the

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
highest. And this is why generally we tend to try to maximize the amount of

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
C3S in our port in our Portland cement clinker

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
to us is very very much slower. And as we saw in the

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
one of the earlier modules, this is why really it doesn't make any sense

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
to make cement with high content and B light from an environmental

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
perspective. It may make sense from a point of view of having low heat cements

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The illuminate faces and the ion faces. We need some calcium sulfates

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is why we have the gypsum juried grinding has been mentioned before.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
These tend to react quite fast but they don't give such high strength as the C3S

91
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
So now off the hydration

92
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
there's great clink clinker grains transform to

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
give us the microstructure of the hardened cement paste.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can still see cement grains which haven't reacted. These are the bright

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
areas here. But now in between these grains we can see the

96
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
hydrates and we can identify in particular two

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
different types of hydrates we can identify these areas

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
here which are lighter gray than the rest of the hydrates but still darker

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
than the anhydrous. And these regions here are what calcium

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hydroxide, calcium hydroxide as a very simple and simple formula

101
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
of 1CHOH2. And

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
this is one of the main faces formed from the calcium silicates

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and then apart from the calcium hydroxide the rest of the hydrates have this

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
kind of dark gray levels. We can still see that they're lighter

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
than the pools which we can see in black such as here. And

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
this other hydrates we can say it's

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
majority CSH around the cement grains we can see

108
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
these nice rims. We call these rims have formed in the place of the

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
cement grain which is reactive. And this is caught in a CSH

110
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Whereas now between the grains we have what we call out to

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
hydrates and this is a very fine mixture of CSH of

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
AFM and of AFT faces which we can't distinguish from each

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
other at this level of resolution here.

114
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
As I said before it's really these volume changes at its critical, the

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
ratio between cement and water are usually expressed by weight. But we're

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
interested in the volume ratio. So typically our

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
water to cement ratio in weight terms would be said to be

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,000
0.5

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And this means for each gram of cement present we add 0.5 grams of

120
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Water, but the development of properties is controlled by the filling

121
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
of space which is related to the volumes. So I think it's a nice little

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
exercise if you can translate that water cement ratio by

123
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
ways of 0.5 into volume. And I think you can switch off the

124
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
video here. You can make this calculation for yourself. I'll tell you that the

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
relative density of the cement is around three. I hope you know that the relative density of

126
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
water is one and then you should be able to make a nice simple calculation

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
to calculate the relative volumes of cement and water just after mixing.

128
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
So I hope you manage to work that out. But when we have a water to cement ratio

129
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
of 0.5 by weight this means that the relative volumes of cement

130
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and water at the beginning we have about 40 percent cement and about

131
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
60 percent water. So you see we actually have more water by

132
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
volume than we have cement and we need that amount of water by

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
volume to give us the fluidity. You know if any of you have made a

134
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
cake that you have the grains of flour and you need to add a

135
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
certain amount of liquid to make a floatable cake mixture

136
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
and make a cement paste is really exactly like that you have this gray powder which is the

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
cement. You have to add a certain amount of water to fill the spaces

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
between those cement grains and give you this floatable  cement paste

139
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
so we can go. Nowadays we can go to somewhat low water cement ratios

140
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
particularly if we use admixtures like super plasticizers will come back to

141
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that in another module.

142
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But if we don't have any super plasticizers then we

143
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
would typically use this more cement ratio of 0.5

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So that's the ratio between the solid and the liquid

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
at the start. What then happens is we have this hydration

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
reaction and during this hydration We action. We have roughly

147
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
a doubling of the solid volume so that this 40 percent

148
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
here this becomes now 80 percent

149
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and the rest that doesn't get filled by these hydrates will

150
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
still remain as poor.

151
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And this is then why these hydrates occupy a higher volume.

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They can then bridge the cement grains together. They can give us this rigid poor

153
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
solid that has strength. So please I really cannot

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
emphasize enough just how important it is to think in terms

155
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
of volumes. Now if we look a little bit more detail

156
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
at the different phases. What comes from what? what we have here

157
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
on the left is we have the approximate compositions of a typical

158
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Portland cement 70 percent C3S or A light

159
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
16 percent C2S or B light, 8 percent C3A

160
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and 7 percent ferrite face.

161
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then roughly speaking the C3S reacts to give us

162
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
this phase CSH and calcium hydroxide. We also get these

163
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
two phases from the C2S while

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
the illuminate face and the ferrite face react to give us these

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
faces we call AFT and AFM faces, and

166
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
in subsequent videos we're going to see what is the chemical

167
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
composition the crystal structure of all these different hydrate faces.

168
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But what's really important to see is that CSH is

169
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
really the most important in a typical cement paste, mature cement paste. This

170
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
makes up nearly half of the solid material. Now

171
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
this kind of one to one correspondence is what's

172
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
usually written down but in fact all of these

173
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hydrates, all formed what's called flu solution. So first of all

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
as we saw in the schematic, the cement faces dissolve. They

175
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
form these different ions which go into the solution

176
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
phase and you see in the solution we then get these ion of

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
calcium of silicate of alumina hydroxide sulfate et cetera

178
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
and then these ions combine in the different proportions

179
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to give us these hydrate faces which then precipitate from the

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Solution, another way we can look at these

181
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
hydrates is in this term tree diagram where we plot the different

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
hydrates in this triangle here of calcium

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
oxide or in the hydrated form calcium hydroxide (14:45)

184
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the ALOH3 illuminant hydrated illuminant gel and up here

185
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
hydrated silica gel, and again here we can

186
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
see that we have a very important phase of CSH

187
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
CSH. Well we have quite a wide range of chemical compositions will discuss in the

188
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
next video CSH. We can also contain quite significant

189
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
amounts of aluminum and then down here

190
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
we have the various illuminate hydrates. Now if we look at the composition

191
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
of Portland cement which is shown by this blue area here we can

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
see that this composition of the Portland cement lies in this triangle

193
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
bounded by CSH here by Portlander to calcium hydroxide

194
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
here and by the illuminator hydrate faces here.

195
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Here we come back to the kinetics of the reaction we've already mentioned this but in the

196
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
context this is a very important aspect of Portland cement because this

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
really determines their technological use. So we

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
look at the kinetics of reaction we generally measuring the amount of heat evolved

199
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and we see initially we get this very short burst of heat but then the

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
heat evolution is quite low during a period of several hours

201
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
and this period of low heat evolution means that we have the time to mix our

202
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
cement or concrete and to transport it to the building site put it in

203
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
place to build our walls et cetera. And then after

204
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
three hours or so the rate of reaction starts to increase rapidly

205
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and we get this main reaction which occurs during the

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
first day and in subsequent videos we're going to be looking

207
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
at what are the mechanisms determine these different stages of the reaction.

208
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So to finish this video and just to summarize what we're

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
seeing here is hydration reaction involves the reaction of cement with water.

210
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And the critical aspect to this is the increase in solid volume which reduces the

211
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
space between grains forming a rigid solid. So the calcium

212
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
silicates C3S and C3S generally form calcium hydroxide in CSH

213
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
while the illuminated ferrite faces lead to the formation

214
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
of these faces we call AFT and AFM. So in the next few modules

215
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
we're going to look at the structure of these hydrates in detail and the mechanisms control the

216
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
kinetics So we'll hope you'll come back to listen to those.
