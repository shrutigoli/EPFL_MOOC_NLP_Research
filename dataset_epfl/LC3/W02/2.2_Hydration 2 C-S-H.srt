1
00:00:04,15 --> 00:00:07,83
So welcome to the second video 
in the hydration module

2
00:00:08,18 --> 00:00:12,60
and in this module, this section 
we're going to talk about the C.S.H. phase

3
00:00:12,61 --> 00:00:17,11
which as we've seen in the overview is the most 
important hydration product. 


00:00:17,91 --> 00:00:21,70
so just as a reminder, what we saw in

4
00:00:21,87 --> 00:00:29,70
the overview was that when we have the trial 
some silicate faces hydrating that's to say C3S

5
00:00:29,71 --> 00:00:32,33
and C2S, We form two hydrates. 


00:00:33,20 --> 00:00:38,33
we have calcium hydroxide, has lots of 
different names. Often referred to as

6
00:00:38,58 --> 00:00:40,78
Portlandite or as CH.

7
00:00:41,32 --> 00:00:46,04
and This form is about ten to 
twenty percent of the hydrated paste.

8
00:00:46,57 --> 00:00:54,44
and then we have this phase calcium silicate hydrate, 
which is written in this numenclature C-S_H.

9
00:00:54,70 --> 00:01:00,83
Which is a rather complex but even though 
it's complex we have to understand it

10
00:01:01,10 --> 00:01:10,07
and this is making up as we've seen more than 
half of the cement paste. So what we're going to talk about in this video

11
00:01:10,11 --> 00:01:13,95
we're going to talk first of all 
about the atomic structure of the composition

12
00:01:14,40 --> 00:01:19,42
and then we're going to talk about the Mesa structure 
and then we're going to talk about the microstructure.

13
00:01:20,44 --> 00:01:24,64
Now the first point I really want to emphasize is the C.S.H.

14
00:01:24,65 --> 00:01:28,39
Truly is a definite phase 
with the reproducible behavior

15
00:01:28,93 --> 00:01:35,48
when I came into the field more than 
thirty years ago, people often talk about C.S.H.

16
00:01:35,49 --> 00:01:43,69
Like it was this complete random unknown 
material. But what we didn't know before

17
00:01:43,77 --> 00:01:51,51
but what has been really clearly established 
that it is a phase with a reproducible thermodynamic behavior.

18
00:01:52,30 --> 00:01:59,96
And that's what I'm trying to illustrate on these two graphs here. 
On these two graphs you see the results of many many

19
00:01:59,97 --> 00:02:08,69
different experiments carried out over the last 
Eighty years or more on examining the C.S.H.

20
00:02:09,01 --> 00:02:17,48
and Always although there's a lot of scatter because 
of the experimental measurements always we see that we get the

21
00:02:17,49 --> 00:02:19,36
same behavior of C S H.

22
00:02:20,32 --> 00:02:28,97
And the other thing this very important home this slide 
is we see that we have this variation in the calcium to silicon

23
00:02:28,98 --> 00:02:30,73
ratio of the C.S.H.

24
00:02:31,00 --> 00:02:38,36
Depending on the composition of the solution. 
So this variation in the calcium silicon ratio of the C.S.H

25
00:02:38,37 --> 00:02:47,43
is shown by the green boxes on these graphs. On 
the left of the green box we have the C.S.H.

26
00:02:47,44 --> 00:02:49,73
Co-existing with silica gel

27
00:02:50,37 --> 00:02:56,91
and on the right of the box we have to CSH 
co-existing with Portlandite or calcium hydroxide.

28
00:02:57,28 --> 00:03:04,44
And the co-existence with Portlandite 
is of course the situation we are closer to

29
00:03:04,49 --> 00:03:12,79
when we're talking about cement pastee. 
Now what's important here is that people who have tried to.

30
00:03:14,72 --> 00:03:21,46
Produce calcium silicate hydrate in the laboratory, 
that's to say we often call that synthetic C.S.H.

31
00:03:22,13 --> 00:03:27,60
Mixing different solutions together, 
they really can make C.S.H.

32
00:03:27,64 --> 00:03:33,91
With calcium to silicon ratios of 1.7 
to about 1.5.

33
00:03:33,92 --> 00:03:38,97
However, when we go to cement paste, 
we can clearly see that in fact we have C.S.H.

34
00:03:38,98 --> 00:03:45,03
Of much higher counting to silicon ratio 
in the range of 1.7 to two

35
00:03:45,65 --> 00:03:54,51
and this is still somewhat of an open question today why 
we can get these much higher calcium to silicon ratios, we now

36
00:03:54,52 --> 00:04:00,12
think it's really connected to the 
difficulty of precipitation of calcium hydroxide.

37
00:04:00,67 --> 00:04:03,79
For a long time it's been
realised the C.S.H is related to the.

38
00:04:03,82 --> 00:04:05,33
Natural mineral tobermorite

39
00:04:05,89 --> 00:04:12,50
and Tobermorite is so called because it was found on the 
Toba Maury which is located off the coast of Scotland.

40
00:04:13,16 --> 00:04:21,54
And this is the crystal structure of Tobermorite. 
It has a calcium to silicon ratio of 0.83.

41
00:04:22,44 --> 00:04:30,82
And the main characteristics of this crystal structure 
of the following. First of all we have these layers of calcium

42
00:04:30,87 --> 00:04:37,77
and oxygen so this is what you see here 
you see the calcium atoms in this kind of turquoise color

43
00:04:38,05 --> 00:04:43,81
and the oxygen atoms in red. 
So this is the layers of calcium oxygen

44
00:04:44,37 --> 00:04:51,28
and in fact these layers are very similar to the layers 
you have in calcium hydroxide. It's probably not a coincidence.

45
00:04:52,13 --> 00:05:04,69
And then all of these layers what we see is these chains 
of silicate tetrahedra So the silicate atoms are at the center

46
00:05:04,73 --> 00:05:11,36
of those blue texture Hedron and at the 
corners of these tech we have oxygen atoms.

47
00:05:11,51 --> 00:05:20,14
And this tetrahedral organization of silicon is very 
common in nature it's what you have in cause, it's what you

48
00:05:20,15 --> 00:05:25,43
have in lose, so you know it's 
really how silica prefers to be

49
00:05:26,03 --> 00:05:30,58
But in this job a more right what 
you see is we form these long chains

50
00:05:30,97 --> 00:05:41,23
and these chains have a repeating pattern of three. So for the 
repeating pattern of three we use the word driketan which in German

51
00:05:41,24 --> 00:05:48,52
means three chain. And you see we have to atoms 
which are attached to this calcium auction layer

52
00:05:48,79 --> 00:05:54,10
and then we have one tetrahedra 
which is sticking out from that layer.

53
00:05:55,22 --> 00:06:03,79
Then the third element of this Tobermorite structure is what 
we call the interlayer, that's this region in here.

54
00:06:04,46 --> 00:06:12,81
And this region in here contains water molecules 
and also can contain calcium ions for example

55
00:06:13,07 --> 00:06:20,68
and in more complex cases there are other eye on such 
as alkali ions which can come into this space. So this is the

56
00:06:20,69 --> 00:06:29,14
structure of Tobermorite. We know the structure of the 
very high degree of confidence because we can make single

57
00:06:29,15 --> 00:06:32,93
crystals of Tobermorite and examine the by X.Ray diffraction.

58
00:06:33,46 --> 00:06:38,20
So the question then is how do we go from this tobermorite

59
00:06:38,21 --> 00:06:47,97
structure to the structure of C S H? 
And the main problem here is of course we see here we have a calcium

60
00:06:47,98 --> 00:06:54,22
silicon ratio of 0.83, 
but we know that in the C.S.H.

61
00:06:54,23 --> 00:07:00,89
We have in cement paste the calcium silicon ratio is 
generally much higher than that. In pace it can be up to 2.

62
00:07:01,98 --> 00:07:10,76
So what people have really looked at is the ways 
in which we can change the calcium to silicon ratio.

63
00:07:11,57 --> 00:07:18,05
And I'm going to try and illustrate that 
in the following slides. 

64
00:07:18,09 --> 00:07:29,58
Now the first and most simple way of varying the calcium 
silicon ratio is to emmit these bridging tetrahedra. 

65
00:07:29,59 --> 00:07:37,22
So we see these bridging tetrahedra here, if these are emitted 
So for example here you see this one is missing, then we start to

66
00:07:37,23 --> 00:07:41,99
change the calcium silicon ratio we have 
less silicon the same amount of calcium

67
00:07:42,32 --> 00:07:49,51
and as we go through this sequence you can see on the 
right here it's telling you the calcium to silicon ratio

68
00:07:49,66 --> 00:07:50,97
and you see it's going up. 


00:07:51,50 --> 00:07:59,22
So that's the first way we can introduce 
defects which increase the calcium to silicon ratio.

69
00:08:00,08 --> 00:08:03,79
But this is nowhere near enough 
to take us through the

70
00:08:04,34 --> 00:08:10,50
kind of calcium silicon ratios we know we 
have in cement paste. We need other mechanisms

71
00:08:11,04 --> 00:08:15,68
and the second mechanism we can 
have is that instead of these

72
00:08:16,72 --> 00:08:25,93
hydroxide ions terminating here, we can replace these 
two hydrogens here with a calcium atom. So calcium is a double

73
00:08:25,94 --> 00:08:33,91
charged ion, hydroxide is singularly charged, 
so we can go from two hydroxide ions to one calcium line.

74
00:08:34,26 --> 00:08:42,15
And this then because now we have more calcium to the amount 
of silicon again, the calcium to silicon ratio is increased

75
00:08:42,66 --> 00:08:51,18
And here we see by replacing all the hydroxide with calcium, 
we can get quite a significant increase in the calcium

76
00:08:51,19 --> 00:08:52,18
silica ratio.

77
00:08:53,36 --> 00:09:00,86
But what we see here with this version is that 
even though we've now emmitted all the bridging sites,

78
00:09:01,21 --> 00:09:08,68
and we've got calcium replaced in the hydroxide 
this is still not enough to get us through the calcium silicon ratios

79
00:09:08,81 --> 00:09:10,25
we see in C.S.H.

80
00:09:10,84 --> 00:09:15,18
So the next mechanism is 
to work on this into layer

81
00:09:15,54 --> 00:09:24,82
and you know to have calcium ions in this interlayer. 
So here we see various different versions with calcium in the interlayer

82
00:09:25,12 --> 00:09:34,20
and now we're starting to really approach the calcium 
silicon ratios we find. So this example here is a calcium silicon

83
00:09:34,21 --> 00:09:41,58
ratio of 1.5, which is round about 
the upper limit we find for C.S.H.

84
00:09:41,59 --> 00:09:44,44
Precipitation from solution in the laboratory.

85
00:09:46,52 --> 00:09:56,10
So just to summarize here, what we've seen is that 
there are three kinds of defects we can put in tobermorite.

86
00:09:56,11 --> 00:10:03,79
We can have missing regime tetrahedra. We can have calcium 
replacing terminating hydroxide and we can have calcium in

87
00:10:03,87 --> 00:10:05,28
the interlayer.

88
00:10:06,32 --> 00:10:13,35
And really what's important is that there's no unique 
way to get a specific outcome silicon ratio, we can have

89
00:10:13,36 --> 00:10:18,70
different combinations of these 
three kind of defect mechanisms.

90
00:10:19,13 --> 00:10:27,24
And what we think is that the structure probably
has a really random organization of these defects, 

91
00:10:27,25 --> 00:10:32,90
This could be one reason for the low crystaline
see the fact that we generally don't see C.S.H. By 

92
00:10:32,91 --> 00:10:42,64
X.Ray diffraction. Also the in tropic effect of having 
this random organization of different defects could probably be an

93
00:10:42,65 --> 00:10:46,32
important element in stabilizing the C.S.H. Structure.

94
00:10:47,97 --> 00:10:55,50
So here we show just some examples of the full unit 
cells of different calcium silicon ratios. 

95
00:10:55,93 --> 00:11:02,80
here we see this one here calcium silicon 1.4. 
Here we see calcium silicon 1.72

96
00:11:03,08 --> 00:11:10,19
and here we see calcium silicon 1.94. So this 
is right now coming to the upper limits. You see that we have

97
00:11:11,05 --> 00:11:16,88
most of the bridging sites disappeared we have mostly 
calcium ions terminating the tetrahedra

98
00:11:17,13 --> 00:11:19,36
and we have some calcium in the interlayer. 


00:11:20,30 --> 00:11:25,77
The other aspect which is important 
to talk about is the presence an allumium.

99
00:11:26,18 --> 00:11:29,64
So when we make micro 
analysis in the S.C.M.

100
00:11:29,65 --> 00:11:37,90
This is what is shown on the left here. Then we can 
quite clearly see that this cloud of points here which corresponds

101
00:11:37,91 --> 00:11:46,29
to the C.S.H. This cloud of points has a 
displacement along the Aluminuim into calcium axis. 

102
00:11:46,70 --> 00:11:55,37
So we can see that the intersection of 
these lines from ettringite to monosulfate is coming at it

103
00:11:55,38 --> 00:11:59,65
and now I'm into calcium ratio of about 0.05.

104
00:12:00,13 --> 00:12:03,79
And this corresponds to an aluminium into 
silicon ratio of roughly 0.1

105
00:12:03,82 --> 00:12:12,69
Which is to say about one in ten of the silicon atoms are 
replaced by aluminium. In other studies have

106
00:12:12,70 --> 00:12:13,82
shown that

107
00:12:14,04 --> 00:12:22,85
the aluminium tends to be located in these bridging sites, 
that is to say the tetrahedral positions which are facing out

108
00:12:23,05 --> 00:12:28,32
and not in the positions which are 
attached to the calcium oxide sheets.

109
00:12:29,28 --> 00:12:38,04
And this ratio of about one to ten which we find 
portland cement paste can go quite substantially higher

110
00:12:38,18 --> 00:12:44,72
when we have supplementary cementitious materials which 
contain a lot of aluminium such as for example MehtaKalen.

111
00:12:44,73 --> 00:12:50,38
Now I hope you have a fairly good idea of 
the atomic structure of composition

112
00:12:50,70 --> 00:12:52,84
and now we're going to 
look at the meso structure.

113
00:12:52,99 --> 00:12:59,88
And this area of Meso structure is probably 
the area where we have still quite a few open questions

114
00:13:00,10 --> 00:13:05,90
and need to advance our understanding. 
So why do we think that C.S.H.

115
00:13:05,91 --> 00:13:12,93
Has a particular meso structure? 
Well the experimental evidence for 
this goes back quite a long way. 

116
00:13:13,73 --> 00:13:23,40
First and foremost is the observation that we have no 
long range order. That's to say in normal cement paste, We

117
00:13:23,44 --> 00:13:28,79
don't see specific peaks from the 
calcium hydroxide by X.Ray diffraction

118
00:13:29,85 --> 00:13:39,33
The second thing which was pointed out already 
by powers back in the 1940's was that C.S.H.

119
00:13:39,34 --> 00:13:48,88
Has this intrinsic porosity. OK So what do I mean by 
intrinsic prosity? What I mean is that when you form the C.S.H.

120
00:13:49,62 --> 00:13:52,97
The same amount as you increase the amount of C.S.H.

121
00:13:52,98 --> 00:13:57,70
that is formed, you increase the 
amount of this particular type of prosity.

122
00:13:58,13 --> 00:14:03,23
and this particular type of prosity 
is often referred to as gel pores.

123
00:14:03,85 --> 00:14:06,67
And now in the last twenty or so years,

124
00:14:06,90 --> 00:14:13,41
we've had a lot of evidence from different scattering 
experiments from neutrons scattering, from small angle

125
00:14:13,45 --> 00:14:13,77
X.Ray 

126
00:14:13,78 --> 00:14:16,76
scattering and most recently from ProtonNMR,

127
00:14:16,80 --> 00:14:24,93
which indicates that this gel porosity has a 
characteristic size of about four to five nanometers.

128
00:14:25,48 --> 00:14:29,71
And if we look at the kind of 
spectra we have from proton

129
00:14:29,72 --> 00:14:33,17
and a more then we can see a specific peak. 


00:14:34,04 --> 00:14:39,83
OK, so now there are two schools of 
thought about the structure of C.S.H.

130
00:14:40,84 --> 00:14:49,26
So on the left here, we see the very widely 
cited model that originated with Jennings.

131
00:14:49,71 --> 00:14:57,36
And Jennings did a lot of work around 
this idea that you have this Cloyd role model of C S H. 

132
00:14:57,89 --> 00:15:03,97
So what do we mean by this Cloyd role model? 
we mean in this model the little areas of CSH

133
00:15:03,98 --> 00:15:18,22
are discrete nano particles, which are not linked together. 
And these discrete nano particles are

134
00:15:13,78 --> 00:15:18,22
made up of about four or 
five layers of the C.S.H.

135
00:15:19,80 --> 00:15:28,42
On the right here what we see is the what's often called 
the feldman sterada model. Although not all aspects that

136
00:15:28,43 --> 00:15:30,35
we're going to talk about here were

137
00:15:31,40 --> 00:15:33,85
explained like that by Feldman and Serada.

138
00:15:34,36 --> 00:15:41,18
And this Feldman and Serada model, we have 
nanocrystalline regions where the layers of C.S.H.

139
00:15:41,19 --> 00:15:42,40
Are quite well aligned

140
00:15:42,56 --> 00:15:48,06
and then those layers extend from one 
Nanocrystalline region to another crystalline region.

141
00:15:48,64 --> 00:15:59,30
And this kind of arrangement of the layers leaves pockets 
where we have higher amounts of porosity, which we could relate

142
00:15:59,44 --> 00:16:03,61
to the gel porosity. 
OK so this model on the left

143
00:16:03,85 --> 00:16:10,65
iss somewhat similar to what you have in Semi crystalline 
polymers for those of you who have made studies in

144
00:16:10,66 --> 00:16:13,12
polymers.

145
00:16:14,42 --> 00:16:18,30
Now we have to say well what's the evidence for one

146
00:16:18,31 --> 00:16:24,11
or the other of these model? 
Well for me seeing is always believing

147
00:16:24,37 --> 00:16:27,65
and I think the best evidence 
is really coming from

148
00:16:27,87 --> 00:16:37,51
and now from transmission electron microscopy. So these show 
you two transmission electro micrographs from cement pace.

149
00:16:38,87 --> 00:16:47,82
At this very fine level people are often distinguishing 
two types of morphology. The morphology we see on the left here

150
00:16:47,93 --> 00:16:54,21
with these kind of fibrils of C.S.H. and The 
morphology we see on the right which is

151
00:16:56,45 --> 00:16:58,47
said to be kind of like foils.

152
00:16:59,01 --> 00:17:06,45
But in neither of these cases even though we are quite 
high resolution here of two hundred microns, in either of these

153
00:17:06,46 --> 00:17:14,82
cases do we really see any evidence for these colloidal 
particles. of course we don't see the C.S.H.

154
00:17:14,83 --> 00:17:26,35
Layers either, so we don't yet have a full understanding 
of how this kind of microstructure a model at this level, might

155
00:17:26,36 --> 00:17:29,87
relate to this Feldman and serada model either.

156
00:17:30,32 --> 00:17:40,14
But nevertheless, my personal feeling is that we have much 
more similarity, much more chance that the real structural

157
00:17:40,15 --> 00:17:47,46
C.S.H. At that level is something like what we see in 
the Feldman and serada model than it is in the Cloyd own model.

158
00:17:48,65 --> 00:17:56,44
But at the end of the day, I think it's more important 
to focus on the similarities between these two schools of thought

159
00:17:56,70 --> 00:18:03,76
in contrast to the differences. 
So I've tried to show those similarities here that

160
00:18:03,86 --> 00:18:10,75
this is the colloidal model on the left where we 
have these Part Nanocrystalline regions which are not connected.

161
00:18:10,81 --> 00:18:17,23
This is the kind of alternative model on the right 
where we have nano crystalline regions which are

162
00:18:17,24 --> 00:18:17,92
connected

163
00:18:18,50 --> 00:18:27,66
and you know for many points of view it's probably not 
so important which one is correct in terms of mechanical

164
00:18:27,67 --> 00:18:35,21
behavior for example, we would expect to have quite 
high forces between these colloidal particles, which would be of the

165
00:18:35,22 --> 00:18:39,48
same order as breaking 
a few sheets on the left.

166
00:18:40,70 --> 00:18:48,30
So that's probably what we can say at this 
point in time for the meso structure of C.S.H

167
00:18:48,31 --> 00:18:54,37
So finally in this short video, 
we're going to look at the microstructure.

168
00:18:55,46 --> 00:18:58,36
Here we now I think have a very clear picture

169
00:18:58,72 --> 00:19:05,95
and our very clear picture really shows us that we 
have to microstructure a distinct forms of C.S.H.

170
00:19:06,60 --> 00:19:15,12
So this picture of the top on the left here, this is 
what is often shown this is this kind of needle like sea urchin

171
00:19:15,13 --> 00:19:23,02
morphology and this is the kind of C.S.H. That forms early 
on in the hydration process, is the kind of C.S.H.

172
00:19:23,03 --> 00:19:30,84
that nucleates on the surface of the cement grains and 
that's why we call the C.S.H. outter Product or early C.S.H. 

173
00:19:31,54 --> 00:19:40,17
And Then we're quite clear that at later times 
we get this C.S.H, this much more dense C.S.H.

174
00:19:40,18 --> 00:19:45,96
Which we can see in this bottom micrograph on the left. 
We can see this is the outer C.S.H.

175
00:19:45,97 --> 00:19:48,99
Here and underneath it's this more dense C.S.H.

176
00:19:49,66 --> 00:19:57,79
and It's more clear to see these two different forms 
in a cross section such as shown on the right, which is then

177
00:19:57,80 --> 00:20:02,40
imaged with backscatter the electron 
images in backscatter electrons. 

178
00:20:02,70 --> 00:20:04,21
So here we see


179
00:20:04,31 --> 00:20:12,31
an hydrated cement grain. You can see this dent thick layer 
of inner product. It is called in a product because it's formed

180
00:20:12,49 --> 00:20:14,19
in place of the cement grain

181
00:20:14,69 --> 00:20:21,57
and just on the surface of that you can see this fine 
outer early product. Now those of you who have looked in the

182
00:20:21,58 --> 00:20:26,85
literature somewhat may also have noticed 
that there are all these terms high density

183
00:20:26,86 --> 00:20:36,06
and low density. Of course from a simplistic point of view, 
we can say that the in a product is clearly high density

184
00:20:36,43 --> 00:20:41,92
and certainly in the initial stages 
the outer product is low density

185
00:20:42,11 --> 00:20:49,12
but there's still quite a bit of debate as 
to whether we can make a direct analogy between high density

186
00:20:49,13 --> 00:20:55,94
and low density and inner product and outter product. 
So that's still something under discussion.

187
00:20:56,24 --> 00:20:59,47
But these two different forms are quite clear. 


00:21:00,30
So if we now come to look at an 
overall microstructure of a typical

188
00:21:05,48 --> 00:21:14,64
cement paste, we can clearly identify the original cement 
grains, So for example here we have a cement grain, here we have

189
00:21:14,65 --> 00:21:16,00
a relational cement grain

190
00:21:16,35 --> 00:21:25,04
and in this paste dehydration is quite advanced, 
so we have a some some regions of an hydrated cement paste such as

191
00:21:25,05 --> 00:21:31,81
here and here and these are surrounded by 
quite dense regions of the innner C.S.H.

192
00:21:32,45 --> 00:21:40,75
And Then in the space between these large grains, 
we can identify this kind of well to C.S.H.

193
00:21:40,76 --> 00:21:48,17
but still we can see indications of this needle 
structure that formed very early in the beginning.

194
00:21:49,60 --> 00:21:55,74
So to summarize all that far, 
we've seen today, we've looked at the atomic level structure

195
00:21:55,97 --> 00:22:02,64
This is now really very were understood through 
contributions that have been made from Silicon enema 

196
00:22:04,75 --> 00:22:16,02
We've seen that this is based on these sheets of 
calcium oxygen with mainly dimas of silica

197
00:22:16,62 --> 00:22:17,94
tetrahedra attached

198
00:22:18,35 --> 00:22:22,62
And then we also may have aluminium 
substitution of the silicon in the bridging site. 

199
00:22:23,06 --> 00:22:28,07
The Meso structure, we still have some 
open questions we have either none of crystal lights

200
00:22:28,08 --> 00:22:34,18
or none of crystalline regions with the characteristic 
size of somewhere in the region of five microns.

201
00:22:34,50 --> 00:22:42,12
And finally in the microstructure we can clearly identify 
first of all what we call out a product which forms early for

202
00:22:42,13 --> 00:22:46,68
a solution and then in a 
product wish forms at later times. 


00:22:47,20
So I hope that given you 
some insight into the C.S.H. Hydrates

203
00:22:50,56 --> 00:22:56,20
In the next video we'll look at the illuminated hydrates. 
Thank you.
