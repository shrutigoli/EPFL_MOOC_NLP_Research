00:00:05,11 --> 00:00:06,30
Hello and welcome back 

2
00:00:06,40 --> 00:00:12,02
In this module, we're going to look at the longer 
term hydration. 
Previously we've looked at the induction

3
00:00:12,03 --> 00:00:16,28
period up to about three hours 
then we've looked at the main hydration peak

4
00:00:16,68 --> 00:00:19,39
and we've seen that this is controlled by nucleation and

5
00:00:19,40 --> 00:00:23,19
growth of CSH. 
Now we're going to look in the longer term.

6
00:00:23,47 --> 00:00:31,35
And this period is really not been studied as anywhere 
near in as much detail as has this induction period in the main

7
00:00:31,36 --> 00:00:39,72
hydration peak. Perhaps because it's rather difficult 
to study because in terms of what you can measure for example the

8
00:00:39,73 --> 00:00:43,70
heat evolution is shown here, 
there's not much going on.

9
00:00:44,79 --> 00:00:46,08
Or at least it seems so

10
00:00:46,28 --> 00:00:53,61
but that's very deceptive, because at this point here about 
one day the degree of hydration would typically be about

11
00:00:53,62 --> 00:00:54,77
fifty percent

12
00:00:55,38 --> 00:01:02,96
and the amount of strength would be maybe twenty, 
twenty five percent of the final strength. 
So there is an awful lot

13
00:01:02,97 --> 00:01:08,00
going on in this later period 
here beyond the first day.

14
00:01:09,26 --> 00:01:11,59
And in this module we're going to try

15
00:01:11,60 --> 00:01:19,89
and look at what some of these things might be. 
Although, I have to tell you now that we still 
don't really know that much.

16
00:01:20,78 --> 00:01:28,87
If instead of looking at Curves in the differential form, 
as we saw previously, if we now we look at the intricate

17
00:01:28,88 --> 00:01:36,59
curves, accumulative heat curve we can plot for example
the variation of the water cement ratio

18
00:01:37,60 --> 00:01:43,45
and we can plot different mixtures with 
different substitutes of course.

19
00:01:44,21 --> 00:01:52,92
And we can kind of identify three different regimes. 
We can identify this regime here which we've already looked at.

20
00:01:53,36 --> 00:01:56,36
We've called this preriods 
"periods one and two"

21
00:01:57,08 --> 00:02:04,49
and we can see that even though the details of this 
main hydration peak might vary a lot as we saw in the previous two

22
00:02:04,50 --> 00:02:07,83
modules, it's fairly similar.

23
00:02:08,86 --> 00:02:17,62
And then over here in the long term, 
we also see a very similar behavior 
for all the systems.

24
00:02:18,61 --> 00:02:21,48
And we'll come to that at the end of this module

25
00:02:21,92 --> 00:02:27,15
but at the minute we're calling this period
of the densification period for reasons I'll explain.

26
00:02:28,31 --> 00:02:36,17
And then in the middle here, we see that this is where 
we get the biggest variation for all these different systems

27
00:02:36,98 --> 00:02:45,28
and what we've really done in these different systems 
is vary the amount of space available for the hydrates to

28
00:02:45,29 --> 00:02:45,98
deposit in

29
00:02:46,65 --> 00:02:52,95
and this is why we call this middle regime, 
which are called 3A here, we call this a 
space controlled regime. 

30
00:02:53,37 --> 00:02:57,36
So basically what this means is that hydrates 
are continuing to form

31
00:02:58,40 --> 00:03:02,82
until they've used up all 
the easily available space.

32
00:03:04,63 --> 00:03:11,96
And this occurs amount about six days for a water cement 
ratio of 0.4. 
Now we get other very interesting

33
00:03:12,00 --> 00:03:21,96
insights only this regime if we use this technique 
called proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. 
So what we do with Proton

34
00:03:21,97 --> 00:03:28,93
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is we depend on the 
behavior of protons which are basically hydrogen atoms

35
00:03:29,58 --> 00:03:36,76
and by applying a magnetic field, 
we can align those little spins of these nuclei

36
00:03:37,30 --> 00:03:43,97
and then we can remove the magnetic field 
the spins relax they go back to the kind of 
random orientation they were in

37
00:03:43,98 --> 00:03:52,19
the first place and by looking at the timing of this relaxation, 
we can make various deductions about the poor sizes.

38
00:03:53,05 --> 00:04:00,55
And the real strength of this technique is that 
we don't have to dry the sample. 
So most techniques that been used

39
00:04:00,56 --> 00:04:07,45
classically microstructure you have to dry the sample
before you look at it in this case is exactly the opposite in

40
00:04:07,46 --> 00:04:11,20
fact the poor need to have 
water in them to get the signal.

41
00:04:11,75 --> 00:04:16,49
And what we can do we can do many different
measurements in situ from the same sample.

42
00:04:17,44 --> 00:04:24,46
And here we see a sort of little schematic of a poor 
structure and you see these big Pores and smaller pores

43
00:04:24,94 --> 00:04:30,79
and the essential aspect is that we have 
water molecules in these pores moving around

44
00:04:31,18 --> 00:04:40,06
and if they hit the surface then they relax very very quickly. 
So this means if we have water like you may have in a

45
00:04:40,27 --> 00:04:45,12
bottle of water this will have a 
relaxation time of about four seconds.

46
00:04:46,53 --> 00:04:54,33
In as we move to smaller pores then because the 
water will have a very high probability of 
hitting the surface before

47
00:04:54,34 --> 00:05:00,64
too long, we'll go to shorter relaxation times, 
small poor the shorter relaxation time still

48
00:05:00,95 --> 00:05:04,10
and the shortest relaxation times are for

49
00:05:04,20 --> 00:05:08,20
bound water which is found in the crystalline hydrates.

50
00:05:08,48 --> 00:05:16,35
And this is explained in a lot more detail in these references 
that were given here. 
These are results from the work of

51
00:05:16,55 --> 00:05:23,69
Ana Muller. 
And we can see how these 
spectra evolve over time.

52
00:05:24,82 --> 00:05:34,64
And what we can identify in the spectra is different 
populations. 
So we start with the shortest one with the shortest

53
00:05:34,65 --> 00:05:35,91
relaxation time.

54
00:05:36,37 --> 00:05:44,69
And by analogy with this diagram here the shortest 
relaxation time is expected to come with water that's firmly bound

55
00:05:44,70 --> 00:05:45,43
in crystals.

56
00:05:46,57 --> 00:05:54,48
And this we can show to be the case by quantifying 
the signal here, we can see that it corresponds to the water which is

57
00:05:54,49 --> 00:05:56,92
in Portlandite and in ettringite.

58
00:05:57,52 --> 00:06:05,38
And I should perhaps have said at the beginning here, 
that what's important in this series of experiments in the spectra

59
00:06:05,63 --> 00:06:14,59
is in fact we can quantitative measure all the water in the cement paste. 
So this is the found water. 
This has the

60
00:06:14,60 --> 00:06:24,51
shortest relaxation time and as you see here it matches
 really very very well with water in the calcium hydroxide

61
00:06:24,79 --> 00:06:25,71
and the ettringite.

62
00:06:26,83 --> 00:06:37,60
So logically the next shortish relaxation time 
has to be coming from the interlayer water in the C.S.H.

63
00:06:37,87 --> 00:06:40,42
So this is the interlayer water in the C.S.H.

64
00:06:40,75 --> 00:06:50,12
and from analyzing the signal, we can see that 
this is coming from dimensions of a round one nanometer, which

65
00:06:50,78 --> 00:06:56,52
is roughly what we'd expect to be the 
area for water in the interlayer the C.S.H.

66
00:06:57,55 --> 00:07:02,09
So this next clear population we can 
see here which starts a little bit bigger

67
00:07:02,10 --> 00:07:04,17
and then comes down to this defined size.

68
00:07:04,75 --> 00:07:09,07
Is in fact what we call the gel water.

69
00:07:09,55 --> 00:07:16,35
When we looked at CSH we talked about the gel porosity 
in those gel pores is the gel water,

70
00:07:16,69 --> 00:07:23,44
and we see this has a quite well defined characteristic 
size of about three to four nanometers.

71
00:07:24,26 --> 00:07:33,36
And finally, the rest of the water over here is now 
capillary waters. 
So going back to the beginning, we can see in the

72
00:07:33,37 --> 00:07:38,25
beginning we start with just capillary water, 
then we start to form C.S.H.

73
00:07:38,26 --> 00:07:41,20
And then finally the gel Pores

74
00:07:41,41 --> 00:07:49,64
and at the end in these experiments 
which are done with Seal pace, 
we have very little capillary water. 

75
00:07:50,53 --> 00:07:57,56
So we can look in more detail at how those 
populations evolve over time in terms of their amount

76
00:07:57,92 --> 00:08:06,33
and also in terms of their size. 
So if we look at the capillary water, 
what we see is over the first day of courses

77
00:08:06,34 --> 00:08:14,47
corresponding to this main heat evolution Peak 
we've been talking about, 
the amount of capillary water decreases very

78
00:08:14,58 --> 00:08:24,57
sharply and also it's size increases. 
So it starts off with the characteristic 
size of a round seventy three microns

79
00:08:24,82 --> 00:08:30,11
and here already after one day, 
it's gone down to about ten microns nanometers.

80
00:08:31,05 --> 00:08:39,25
And then all of to this point here at 
about two days, we see that the amount decreases

81
00:08:39,54 --> 00:08:46,44
but the sign is no longer decreases. 
The size really stays constant as a size 
of aboiut eight nanometers.

82
00:08:47,17 --> 00:08:55,56
And because of this consistency of size, 
we then decided to give a new name 
to this area we call this interhydrate pores.

83
00:08:55,95 --> 00:09:04,17
Now why do we call it interhydrate pores, 
because if you look in the T.M. and 
You see these needles of C S.H

84
00:09:04,74 --> 00:09:14,59
We talked about in the previous modules, 
you can see between these needles, 
we have spaces of about eight Nanometers.

85
00:09:14,91 --> 00:09:25,08
And we really feel now that this is making up 
most of the capillary pore space of a well 
cured mature cement paste

86
00:09:25,25 --> 00:09:30,70
is this very complex spaces between these C.S.H. Needles

87
00:09:31,20 --> 00:09:38,99
We can see a similar picture by using a very 
different technique which is mercury intrusion poor symmetry.

88
00:09:39,91 --> 00:09:47,30
And many of you have probably heard a lot of 
negative things about mercury in trees and poor symmetry but

89
00:09:47,42 --> 00:09:51,83
when we've compared Mercury intrusion pore symmetry to proton

90
00:09:51,84 --> 00:09:58,01
Nanoma, we actually have now a lot of evidence 
that mercury is giving Mercury intrusion pore symmetry is giving us a

91
00:09:58,02 --> 00:10:05,26
very good picture of what's happening in the poor space 
and so long as you dry your samples correctly

92
00:10:05,31 --> 00:10:11,51
and I really need to stress this point, 
because if you dry your samples by putting them in the oven,

93
00:10:11,52 --> 00:10:16,53
you form a lot of cracks, 
you get any or kind of thing by M.I.P

94
00:10:16,92 --> 00:10:23,54
If you do it by this technique we use which is called 
solvent exchange, where you dry your samples in 

95
00:10:23,55 --> 00:10:26,98
then you can get really nice reproducible results.

96
00:10:28,09 --> 00:10:31,97
And what you see is that this breakthrough diameter here

97
00:10:32,06 --> 00:10:40,32
when the mercury really starts to penetrate into the sample, 
this is going down quite rapidly during the first few days

98
00:10:40,44 --> 00:10:43,06
but by the time 
we're at about three days or

99
00:10:43,10 --> 00:10:52,06
or fourteen days then after that point it doesn't go down anymore. 
So it goes down to a certain critical pore

100
00:10:52,07 --> 00:10:53,15
entry size

101
00:10:53,41 --> 00:11:01,65
and then it doesn't go down more even though the overall amount 
of the capillary porosity is continuing to decrease. 
So we

102
00:11:01,66 --> 00:11:11,77
think this fixed Critical pore entry size here, 
is the same as the interhydrate space we saw here.

103
00:11:12,90 --> 00:11:20,86
Now if we look at what's happening in the hydrates, 
we can now look at the Interlayer water. 
So the interlayer water is

104
00:11:20,87 --> 00:11:23,10
between these sheets of C.S.H.

105
00:11:23,74 --> 00:11:30,59
Shown in red here. And unsurprisingly during 
the main hydration this is going up quite fast

106
00:11:30,88 --> 00:11:40,20
and then subsequently it's going up more slowly. 
We add the gel water as we see here

107
00:11:40,77 --> 00:11:47,96
and at the beginning in the acceleration 
in the main hydration peak the gel water 
is going up in parallel

108
00:11:49,00 --> 00:11:53,29
in the same ratio as the amount of insulin water

109
00:11:53,70 --> 00:12:01,26
but from this point at 2.2 days in this case of 
this white cement we see that the gel water is really

110
00:12:01,27 --> 00:12:01,95
patterning.

111
00:12:02,50 --> 00:12:12,72
And a very long ages it maybe even goes down a little bit. 
So the amount of gel space, Gel pores is not a constant

112
00:12:13,05 --> 00:12:16,34
amount in a world C.S.H.

113
00:12:16,81 --> 00:12:22,00
The amount of gel porosity varies if formed 
we form a lot of the beginning

114
00:12:22,27 --> 00:12:33,41
and then really no more after a certain time. 
Very probably, this is related to formation of outer C.S.H.

115
00:12:33,82 --> 00:12:40,36
Those needles we've been talking about quite a lot 
and then afterwards when we get the in a C.S.H.

116
00:12:40,57 --> 00:12:43,91
We really see that this doesn't contain gel porosity.

117
00:12:45,19 --> 00:12:54,87
And from all these measurements, we can get now 
quite a lot of more detail about what's happening in our C.S.H.

118
00:12:55,26 --> 00:12:57,82
We can look for example at the density

119
00:12:57,83 --> 00:13:04,70
and we can look at the density of this kind of solid part, 
these of these nano crystalline regions we talked about

120
00:13:05,27 --> 00:13:13,23
quite a few lectures ago and we can look at the amount 
that's forming in the bulk as we see with the gel porosity here.

121
00:13:14,32 --> 00:13:22,70
And the solid has quite a constant density over time of 
about just below 2.7, 2.8. Whereas

122
00:13:22,71 --> 00:13:23,89
the bulk

123
00:13:25,07 --> 00:13:33,72
the average density is increasing because the proportion of gel pores 
is decreasing. 
So at the beginning we have quite a

124
00:13:33,73 --> 00:13:36,57
low density below one point eight.

125
00:13:36,88 --> 00:13:42,84
And by the time we're getting to a high degree of hydration, 
we're seeing that this is going to have the density of

126
00:13:42,85 --> 00:13:50,83
about 2 to 2.1. which is very much in line with the kind 
of densities that have been estimated from other techniques.

127
00:13:51,76 --> 00:13:56,98
We can look also at the amount of water contained in the C.S.H.

128
00:13:57,52 --> 00:14:07,23
So again for the solid nano crystalline regions, 
the amount of water content is around 2 for each solid chain

129
00:14:07,24 --> 00:14:17,00
unit, whereas for the bulk the amount of water on average 
is decreasing because we have less water proportionally in the gel pores.

130
00:14:17,99 --> 00:14:25,70
So from all this, we need to really make an update of 
the repetition of the solid volume over time, so this

131
00:14:25,71 --> 00:14:33,31
was done already about sixty years ago by powers. 
And he measured the proportions along times

132
00:14:33,32 --> 00:14:38,54
and then said 
"Well OK I'm just going to draw straight lines 
as a function of the degree of hydration".

133
00:14:39,41 --> 00:14:48,28
And we find very good agreement between our repetition of 
the volumes along ages here with what powers found except

134
00:14:48,29 --> 00:14:56,55
that now we can differentiate the solid that he just 
measured as one single hydrate into C.S.H.

135
00:14:56,59 --> 00:14:57,05
Here

136
00:14:57,39 --> 00:15:07,04
and calcium hydroxide and ettringite here. 
The main difference we see is the amount of 
gel water is not a linear function

137
00:15:07,26 --> 00:15:15,11
of the degree of hydration. 
But it increases very rapidly at the beginning 
and then stays constant there after.

138
00:15:16,31 --> 00:15:25,98
So let's go back to cummulative heat curves, 
to these different stages. 
We've looks in this middle zone zone three A

139
00:15:25,99 --> 00:15:30,85
here and we see that this is controlled 
by the amount of space available

140
00:15:31,68 --> 00:15:36,62
but what's happening in this very long term? 
Well again we can analyze the slope of

141
00:15:36,65 --> 00:15:37,49
these curves

142
00:15:37,99 --> 00:15:44,45
and we really don't see any indication that it 
fits with the kind of kinetics we would expect from diffusion.

143
00:15:45,67 --> 00:15:54,01
What we could hypothesise the station, I stress this is very very 
tense to versa as an idea for a mechanism is that what

144
00:15:54,02 --> 00:15:57,55
perhaps we have we have initially C.S.H.

145
00:15:57,56 --> 00:16:01,85
Like this, 
where we have there are none across lime regions gel pores

146
00:16:02,19 --> 00:16:08,31
and then a very long ages those gel pores are 
getting filled there by extra layers of C.S.H.

147
00:16:08,72 --> 00:16:14,28
So the amount of extra hydration between 
here and here is really very very small

148
00:16:14,76 --> 00:16:18,49
but it's contributing to this densification

149
00:16:18,80 --> 00:16:26,54
and to some gain in mechanical properties. 
So I stress this is still quite a tentative idea here

150
00:16:26,91 --> 00:16:33,43
but needs to be worked on more in the long term. 
So to summarize what we've seen in this lecture we've looked at what's

151
00:16:33,89 --> 00:16:36,17
some ideas of what's happening in the long term.

152
00:16:36,69 --> 00:16:44,30
And what really seems to be important certainly 
in the first few days, is is the amount of space available for the

153
00:16:44,31 --> 00:16:49,17
hydrate form which a term determining the rate of reaction.

154
00:16:49,79 --> 00:16:58,52
and after about few days, say about six days, 
this is a typical Wall to cement ratio of 0.4, We only

155
00:16:58,53 --> 00:17:09,01
have pores below quite a small size which are left. 
And the small size does not allow the growth of hydrates in the

156
00:17:09,02 --> 00:17:14,76
classic way that we've talked about previously. 
And this kind of

157
00:17:16,02 --> 00:17:23,62
Slowing down of the reaction then means we transit 
to a regime in which we have really more densification of the

158
00:17:23,63 --> 00:17:24,51
C.S.H.

159
00:17:24,58 --> 00:17:28,85
And that's really highlighted by the 
studies we've done on Proton

160
00:17:28,89 --> 00:17:35,84
NMR, 
which also indicate that we need to 
refine the powers model, because the

161
00:17:36,65 --> 00:17:41,93
amount of the capillary and gel porosity 
are not linear functions of the degree of reaction.

162
00:17:43,02 --> 00:17:49,69
So after these few days we get this very slow reaction, 
which the mechanisms are still unclear

163
00:17:49,70 --> 00:17:58,33
and still are subject of ongoing work. 
So now we've really seen the mechanisms, 
we've been concentrating most of all on

164
00:17:58,34 --> 00:17:59,66
the silicate phases

165
00:17:59,96 --> 00:18:06,21
and what remains now is to look at 
the reactions of the alluminates phases, 
how this fit in this will be in the next

166
00:18:06,22 --> 00:18:06,77
module.

167
00:18:07,07 --> 00:18:15,76
and then finally we'll bring this all together 
to look at how the microstructure can be visualized in the scanning

168
00:18:15,77 --> 00:18:20,14
electron microscope for example. 
So thank you and see you next time.
