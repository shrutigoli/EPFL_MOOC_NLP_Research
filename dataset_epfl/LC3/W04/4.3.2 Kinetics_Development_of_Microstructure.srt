1
00:00:04,11 --> 00:00:10,28
So welcome this is the last module 
in the sequence about hydration reactions

2
00:00:10,67 --> 00:00:18,60
and in this one we bring together everything 
we've seen in the previous modules to 
look at how this results in the

3
00:00:18,61 --> 00:00:28,20
microstructure we have in hardened cement pace. 
Now we're not going to talk about 
here is of course properly regulated

4
00:00:28,21 --> 00:00:30,70
cements enough soluble calcium sulphate

5
00:00:30,71 --> 00:00:39,21
added, And as we saw in the last module 
This means that the illuminated, main aluminum reactions occurs of the

6
00:00:39,22 --> 00:00:42,91
silicate reaction. 
And it therefore means of hydration

7
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:51,54
and structure development is really dominated by 
the reaction of C3S4A light. 
Now this is the

8
00:00:52,69 --> 00:01:00,55
Calorimetry heat evolution curve, we've seen several 
times before, we talked about the mechanisms that control the

9
00:01:00,56 --> 00:01:09,98
reactions throughout this. First of all the the 
induction period controlled by the buildup of iodine solution, 
then

10
00:01:09,99 --> 00:01:14,31
acceleration deceleration controlled by
the growth of the C.S.H.

11
00:01:14,32 --> 00:01:18,97
Needles on the surface and 
finally the slow ongoing reaction.

12
00:01:19,64 --> 00:01:28,21
And just to relate that to the physical properties, the setting 
of the cement is usually occurring at middle to beginning

13
00:01:28,26 --> 00:01:37,68
of the acceleration period. Now let's look at 
how this heat evolution curve is linked to 
what we see Micro structurally.

14
00:01:38,67 --> 00:01:48,73
So if we first consider the case for the silicates, 
what we see at the end of the induction period 
is we get this 

15
00:01:48,78 --> 00:01:56,60
first formation of C.S.H. Starting to grow 
on the surface of the grades. 
And then that C.S.H.

16
00:01:56,61 --> 00:02:03,77
Develops rather very rapidly as these needles 
so by ten hours we see these long needles 
from the surface.

17
00:02:03,80 --> 00:02:07,48
And then the hydration goes on

18
00:02:07,49 --> 00:02:14,64
and finally we end up with the microstructure like this, 
where we have the cement grains which are embedded in this

19
00:02:14,65 --> 00:02:18,25
matrix mainly of C.S.H. and.

20
00:02:19,29 --> 00:02:21,44
Atrinite, which is all this stuff here,

21
00:02:21,83 --> 00:02:30,01
and then some calcium hydroxide 
which is this stuff here. 
Now if we now add in the Aluminite, So we have portland

22
00:02:30,02 --> 00:02:36,48
cement rather than alite during 
the very early reaction of the alite we can form some.

23
00:02:37,65 --> 00:02:39,86
Very small etronite needles

24
00:02:40,01 --> 00:02:46,40
but this again I'd like to stress that it's not 
those very small needles that are inhibiting 
the reaction, its the

25
00:02:46,41 --> 00:02:49,37
absorption of sulphate ions 
on the surface.

26
00:02:50,02 --> 00:02:57,15
And this absorption of sulphate ions on the illuminates 
suppresses the eliminate reaction so that it allows the

27
00:02:57,16 --> 00:03:02,92
silicates to react, 
so here we see the silicates 
reacting as before and then

28
00:03:02,99 --> 00:03:13,29
when we come to the shoulder peak here we see 
very clearly the second growth of etronite 
we see these long, etronite needles which

29
00:03:13,30 --> 00:03:20,01
are formed during that shoulder peak. 
And then as we go on we may not always see it

30
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:24,60
but in this case 
we've got a small hydration hump here

31
00:03:25,07 --> 00:03:34,93
and this is associated with the formation of the monosulfate. 
Now another aspect I want to mention is this formation

32
00:03:34,94 --> 00:03:43,49
of so-called Hadley grains. Now Hadley was a student 
working in the 70s who noticed that sometimes you could see

33
00:03:43,50 --> 00:03:47,44
that you had these kind of 
shells which appeared empty.

34
00:03:47,72 --> 00:03:55,34
And in fact we see that generally if we look at 
these transmission electron micrographs, 
we can see even from very early

35
00:03:55,35 --> 00:04:03,77
ages even as early as five hours, 
we can see we get the small separation 
of the shell and the reacting grain.

36
00:04:04,21 --> 00:04:10,23
So what happens is we seem 
to form this Layer of hydrates here.

37
00:04:11,27 --> 00:04:15,69
And then they and 
Hydra scraping goes on reacting

38
00:04:15,91 --> 00:04:25,12
but the products are deposited outside, 
probably because we have this preferential 
growth of the C.S.H.

39
00:04:25,13 --> 00:04:28,39
Needles that we 
discussed a few modules back.

40
00:04:29,36 --> 00:04:38,48
And this is just another micrograph this time 
taken with best electrons, where you can see just how generalized these

41
00:04:39,40 --> 00:04:46,59
gaps are around the hydrous grace. 
Now we don't really know exactly

42
00:04:47,84 --> 00:04:53,13
why these form like this, 
but we can say that it's very much

43
00:04:54,31 --> 00:05:00,37
amplified by the presence of illuminates. 
We get a small separation in the case of pure C3S

44
00:05:00,73 --> 00:05:04,38
but it's very much more apparent 
when we have a Portland cement

45
00:05:04,67 --> 00:05:08,53
when we have the city case 
illuminates reacting together.

46
00:05:09,74 --> 00:05:18,81
And here are some other ones pictures again by 
transmission electron microscope. 
We can see that if we now have a

47
00:05:18,82 --> 00:05:26,58
very careful specimen preparation. 
We can see this very kind of fragile looking share of hydrates

48
00:05:26,77 --> 00:05:32,47
but in fact the space in between, its not 
completely empty. It seems to be filled with a very

49
00:05:33,91 --> 00:05:40,41
dispersed diffuse product. 
And another interesting aspect is this

50
00:05:40,73 --> 00:05:48,26
and hardest grain here is not reacting evenly 
on the surface that's actually quite deep, 
itching along certain

51
00:05:48,43 --> 00:05:53,21
Crysler graphic directions. 
So what happens to these

52
00:05:54,29 --> 00:06:01,96
separated shells, all these have the grains over time really 
depends on the size of the grains. 
If we have very small

53
00:06:01,97 --> 00:06:02,72
grains,

54
00:06:03,80 --> 00:06:10,19
Five microbes or less then these will 
very quickly react during the main hydration peak

55
00:06:10,48 --> 00:06:15,72
and there leave this kind of shell of hydrates 
which persists in definitely.

56
00:06:16,79 --> 00:06:26,87
If the grain is a bit bigger, so in the second case 
here we have a grain maybe about ten to fifteen 
microbes then after

57
00:06:26,88 --> 00:06:32,16
the main heat evolution peak, this 
hydrous material will continue to react

58
00:06:32,54 --> 00:06:36,68
but it may leave a small 
shell hole in the middle.

59
00:06:37,37 --> 00:06:46,51
And finally if we have large grains greater than 
say about fifteen to twenty microns, 
then during the later hydration

60
00:06:46,99 --> 00:06:54,73
this separation between the shell and the enhydrous 
grain completely fills in and disappears.

61
00:06:55,37 --> 00:07:04,19
And we can see those in this micrograph here, if you look 
carefully at this micrograph you can see many little hollow

62
00:07:04,20 --> 00:07:12,20
shells which the small grains which completely reacted. 
So we've got this one here for example, we've got one down here

63
00:07:12,21 --> 00:07:19,96
was just right larger and therefore
we've got a slightly thicker shell, 
we've got another one here

64
00:07:20,21 --> 00:07:25,53
and the more you look you can really see 
that these little hollow shells everywhere.

65
00:07:26,31 --> 00:07:34,20
But for the lower to grains notably this one in 
the middle here, this separation has completely filled then

66
00:07:34,47 --> 00:07:44,29
and we get this thick rim of in a product. 
We can still see though that the surface 
of the reacting enhydrous grain

67
00:07:44,58 --> 00:07:52,88
is still quite rough. 
This roughness that emerged really quite early 
on is persisting because it seems we can have

68
00:07:53,24 --> 00:08:03,77
probably defects along Crystal graphic directions, 
which make that the more soluble..... 
Of course in

69
00:08:03,83 --> 00:08:13,67
this micrograph we can also see that of course we got 
the reaction of the alite here we've got the interstitial faces

70
00:08:13,68 --> 00:08:19,78
the ferrite and the illuminated. 
Now close to the surface the alluminate 
has all disappeared,

71
00:08:20,11 --> 00:08:28,74
but here where it embedded in the ferrite, 
we can still see small regions of illuminated phases 
that have not reacted yet.

72
00:08:29,56 --> 00:08:38,82
These aspects are brought together in this drawing, 
I made quite some years ago now, which really summarized the micro

73
00:08:38,83 --> 00:08:47,36
structural development around one grain of cement. 
Another aspect which is important to talk about is to look at the

74
00:08:47,37 --> 00:08:55,82
different phases, so really we very much emphasize 
the reactions of c3S And then of Aluminite because these are

75
00:08:55,83 --> 00:09:05,47
the ones that react most. So in this graph here you see greater 
from the literature for the form A phases so we have 

76
00:09:05,48 --> 00:09:11,63
alite Here, we have aluminate here, Belite here and ferrite here

77
00:09:12,05 --> 00:09:21,39
and then we have very similar data for four different 
cements which were started in the Ph D. Of the Knesset Kocaba.

78
00:09:21,86 --> 00:09:29,70
Now what's very important is you can see that 
the Alite is reacting most early on, that's to say

79
00:09:29,71 --> 00:09:37,55
one day we have degrees of reaction between 
forty percent and seventy percent. Really very very high.

80
00:09:38,06 --> 00:09:43,97
And then that's increasing at say about 
twenty eight days to about eighty percent

81
00:09:44,21 --> 00:09:50,14
and as we go on to ninety one hundred days, 
it's approaching one hundred percent.

82
00:09:51,44 --> 00:09:59,94
The illuminate reaction, also very fast. 
You see we have high degrees of reaction one 
day, again between forty

83
00:10:00,16 --> 00:10:01,50
and eighty percent

84
00:10:01,97 --> 00:10:12,04
and in some cases it's very quickly going up to 
one hundred percent in just a few days. 
In other cases where

85
00:10:12,08 --> 00:10:18,25
it's more imbedded in ferrite for example 
then it may take somewhat longer.

86
00:10:20,40 --> 00:10:25,00
So now we come to the other two 
phases we haven't discussed at all

87
00:10:25,60 --> 00:10:31,57
and we see in general the reaction of these 
two is much slower. Notably the Belite.

88
00:10:31,61 --> 00:10:39,39
And this is very important. Like I said several times 
before that it doesn't make any sense to produce high Blite

89
00:10:39,40 --> 00:10:42,25
cements because of the slow reactivity of the Belite

90
00:10:42,26 --> 00:10:49,85
But we all must see that there really 
is this interaction between Alite and Belite.

91
00:10:49,89 --> 00:10:57,65
That that's to say that while we have just fast reaction of 
Alite as we see here, the reaction to be light is hardly 
happening at all.

92
00:10:59,36 --> 00:11:07,53
So Alite reaction actually suppresses the Blite reaction. 
And it's really only after ten days

93
00:11:07,54 --> 00:11:10,47
and more that when the daylight is more

94
00:11:10,48 --> 00:11:16,62
or less all reacted that the Blite reaction 
is starting to have any impact at all.

95
00:11:18,30 --> 00:11:26,67
Fairly, it is a kind of intermediate case in fact 
we see the one day the degrees of reaction may be quite high about

96
00:11:26,68 --> 00:11:32,15
forty percent, that's similar to the illuminates 
but then it really slows down.

97
00:11:32,80 --> 00:11:41,18
And the reason for this is that this low solubility of ion in alkaline 
solution so that offer a bit of the ferrite

98
00:11:41,19 --> 00:11:50,67
faces acted you kind of clogged up the surface with first 
of all amorphous high hydroxide, which really stops the

99
00:11:50,68 --> 00:11:57,04
rest of the Phase reacting. That's just summarized 
here that we have little reaction before ten days

100
00:11:57,05 --> 00:12:05,31
and that's actually thermodynamics control, 
because of the reaction of the Alite phase, 
it suppresses the dissolution of the Belite phase.

101
00:12:04,65 --> 00:12:12,22
The Alluminates is fast, but it can be slowed 
down by the presence of ferrite grey cements.

102
00:12:12,79 --> 00:12:18,69
And the ferrite is slow but it can't 
quite be significant even at one day.

103
00:12:20,11 --> 00:12:28,97
Now if we look at the reaction of these phases in the microstructure, 
the Belite often gives us this very interesting

104
00:12:29,43 --> 00:12:37,93
pattern of reaction we can see with the certain
strayations have reacted, while others have not reacted.

105
00:12:38,63 --> 00:12:45,70
And the reason for this is you general cooling of Belite, 
you get these multiple phase transformations,

106
00:12:46,04 --> 00:12:54,77
which often occur by twinning 
and then so you tend to accumulate 
in some twins and not in others

107
00:12:54,78 --> 00:12:59,83
and it's the generally the parts which have 
the high solute content, which are more reactive

108
00:13:00,14 --> 00:13:05,94
and can react. 
So you see that the depth the reaction 
here is about is several microns

109
00:13:06,45 --> 00:13:10,36
but then we store water kernel 
in the middle which is on reacted.

110
00:13:11,53 --> 00:13:21,49
And this you can see even in very whole cement, 
this micrograph here on the right comes from 
a piece of concrete that's

111
00:13:21,50 --> 00:13:30,48
about thirty years old and you can see these large 
clinker grain, it was a cluster of belite, this is quite typical

112
00:13:30,49 --> 00:13:36,61
and cements. 
You want to minimize these grains 
but they do occur and you see in this cluster of

113
00:13:36,62 --> 00:13:42,58
Belite that quite a bit of the Belite 
still hasn't reacted even after thirty years.

114
00:13:43,82 --> 00:13:49,68
Now in that micrograph, 
his is like a zoom out of the one before.

115
00:13:50,71 --> 00:13:58,20
Now the only unreactive phases we see in this 
thirty year old concrete, are really belite

116
00:13:58,40 --> 00:14:07,33
and of course the ferrite phase. This is the ferrite phase, 
these bright areas here. 
in three look at this Best gas electron

117
00:14:07,37 --> 00:14:13,29
image which is what we see in the previous slide, 
it appears that the ferret hasn't reacted even though

118
00:14:13,30 --> 00:14:18,72
when we go to the X. Ray diffraction, it shows us 
that with a ferrite phase has disappeared. 

119
00:14:19,28 --> 00:14:27,74
And what Happens is a the alluminated calcium 
components kind of leach out, 
they disappear and form the normal hydrates

120
00:14:28,37 --> 00:14:33,34
and even this relic of 
ferritic siliceous hydrogarnent.

121
00:14:33,63 --> 00:14:40,41
And this is what has been seen in quite old pace 
even after a few months or so,

122
00:14:40,71 --> 00:14:45,76
but the dominant phase from the 
ferrite is this siliceous hydrogarnet.

123
00:14:46,96 --> 00:14:52,59
Now coming back to the overall microstructure, 
we've shown this micrograph several times

124
00:14:52,97 --> 00:15:00,62
and what I want to do here is to remind you that this 
hydrate phase that's between the grains everything that isn't

125
00:15:00,63 --> 00:15:10,42
calcium hydroxide is really a very fine mixture of C.S.H. 
With ettringite, with more L.F.M.

126
00:15:10,43 --> 00:15:18,36
phases, monocarbonate, monosulfate, really mixed 
at this very fine scale below one micron.

127
00:15:19,33 --> 00:15:27,91
and we can see further evidence of this by looking 
at these microanalysis, if we make microanalysis

128
00:15:27,92 --> 00:15:34,42
and then we plot them on these graphs of alumina calcium 
versus silica to calcium

129
00:15:34,51 --> 00:15:43,92
or so for to calcium versus alluminate to calcium, we can see 
that what we have here, we have this cluster of points, we see

130
00:15:43,93 --> 00:15:44,38
here

131
00:15:44,86 --> 00:15:53,10
and we see here which is C S H, But the fact we get points 
extending along these lines is really showing us that we have

132
00:15:53,11 --> 00:15:59,39
mixtures either of calcium hydroxide with 
Portlandite with calcium had rock side along this line

133
00:15:59,64 --> 00:16:04,07
or with C S H with ettringite 
or monosulfate

134
00:16:04,80 --> 00:16:12,93
and we can see more clearly in this graph down here 
that we can differentiate much more easily between whether we have

135
00:16:12,94 --> 00:16:19,95
mixtures with ettringite and monosulfate. So here 
this is at twenty eight days, we see we still got

136
00:16:20,26 --> 00:16:24,50
quite a lot of ettringite intermixed with the C.S.H.

137
00:16:25,18 --> 00:16:30,37
A little bit of monosulfate and 
as we go on first to one year

138
00:16:30,45 --> 00:16:34,76
and then to three years, 
we still see this very gradual shift

139
00:16:35,07 --> 00:16:42,30
and as further ferrite probably reacts to now getting 
much more points along the monosulfate line,

140
00:16:42,74 --> 00:16:49,11
but we always see this persistence of 
this the spread this cluster C.S.H.

141
00:16:49,12 --> 00:16:57,78
Point due to the intermixing and you know I want 
to emphasize that what we analyze here in the S.C.M.

142
00:16:57,85 --> 00:17:07,04
We're always analyzing a volume of one to two microns in dimension, 
which is why we see together these

143
00:17:07,05 --> 00:17:15,10
several different Phases. 
So just summarize this microstructure part, 
what we saw at the beginning was the same as what we

144
00:17:15,11 --> 00:17:22,08
saw in the reaction of the alluminate part that the presence 
of sulphate modifies the reaction we get a smaller

145
00:17:22,25 --> 00:17:25,86
initial reaction and then this 
in the long induction period.

146
00:17:26,29 --> 00:17:31,37
When the sulphate in solution is exhausted, 
we get the second burst of aluminate formation.

147
00:17:31,85 --> 00:17:36,45
And then finally in the monosulfate 
monocarbonate formation.

148
00:17:37,60 --> 00:17:43,41
And what we also saw in this model, we talked a little bit 
about hadley grain formation where we get these

149
00:17:43,42 --> 00:17:49,13
separated shells we talked about 
the rates of reaction of the different phases

150
00:17:49,14 --> 00:17:55,87
and really emphasize that the belite reaction is very 
slow only significant health for about ten days because this

151
00:17:55,88 --> 00:17:57,26
inhibited by alite.

152
00:17:58,30 --> 00:18:04,96
Talked about the ferrite, seems to be on reactiveness 
certainly not move much it stays in the same place

153
00:18:05,25 --> 00:18:10,81
but in fact seems to react to form this 
poorly crystalline for this siliceous hydrogarnet.

154
00:18:11,47 --> 00:18:17,35
And then at the end we emphasize the 
fact with the aluminated phases where the ettringite or A.F.M.

155
00:18:17,36 --> 00:18:21,66
phases are mainly find 
dispersed within the C.S.H.

156
00:18:22,44 --> 00:18:29,87
So that's the last one in this series about hydration. 
I hope you found something interesting

157
00:18:30,27 --> 00:18:36,30
and enjoy the rest of the course on 
characterization methods. 
Thank you very much.
