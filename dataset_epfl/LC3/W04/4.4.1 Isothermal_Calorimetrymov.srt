00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,090
Hi. My name is Zhangli Hu.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:14,000
In previous session, you have a knowledge about cement hydration
including phases assemblage and the microstructure evolution.

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,090
In this section, I will give you a bit more detailed
information about the Heat release of cement hydration.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:31,060
Most specifically in a practical point of view,
we will have a closer look at the placation of isothermal
calorimetry in Cement field.

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,430
To make goal of this module is to introduce two DAB lows

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:43,680
and two etchs focusing on bridging the isothermal
calorimetry resides with the hydration
characteristics of cement.

7
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,870
Two Dablows are; those are what is Isothermal Calorimetry
and why do we use it in cement field.

8
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,460
Two etch represent;
how do we perform a calorimetry test

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,240
and how do we treat the data in
order to get the information we want?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,140
Calorimetry is the measurement of
heat and heat production rate.

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,700
There are several different kinds of
calorimetry are commonly used in cement field,
Isothermal Calorimetry is one of them.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,900
Besides this one,
which we will mainly focus on today,

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,800
techniques such as Adiabatic
and semiadiabatic calorimetry,

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,410
solution calorimetry and
differential scanning calorimetry.
techniques such as Adiabatic
and semiadiabatic calorimetry,

15
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:28,420
solution calorimetry and
differential scanning calorimetry.

16
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,200
All can be seeing in the
applications in cement field.

17
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,750
The first of two types or three kinds of Calorimetres are
the most frequently used calorimetic methods.
All can be seeing in the
applications in cement field.

18
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,780
The first of two types or three kinds of Calorimetres are
the most frequently used calorimetic methods.

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,470
Both of them are quantifying the hydration kinetics
and the way for realizing it is different

20
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:56,000
In Isothermal Calorimetre, The heat
production rate is directly measured.

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,480
That's why it is also
called heat conduction calorimetry.

22
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,690
While the semiadiabatic
calorimetry for example

23
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,530
is isolated and temperature is
the signal which is being recorded

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,830
and later transformed
to the right of him to release.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,340
The advantage adiabatic calorimetry is
sized isolation as the same in semiadiabatic.

26
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,540
The calorimeter is also
surrounded by other adiabatic shop

27
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,760
and the flow of heat from
the specimen is prevented.

28
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:37,880
The easiest way to distinguish them are the
different time, temperature trajectories and sample sizes.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,170
As indicated in the figure shown here,
temperature is controlled to be constant
in isothermal calorimetry

30
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,400
While in other kinds of calorimeters, the temperature is evolving.

31
00:02:51,230 --> 00:03:03,830
Small samples such as cement pastes are commonly used in
isothermal calorimetry,
while in others examples like mortars and concrete are often used.

32
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:09,700
Let's have a look at the
instruments for isothermal calorimetry.

33
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,770
There are several commercial instrument brands.

34
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,730
We will use ten air, produced by TA instruments
company in your house as an example.

35
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,040
If you order an isothermal calorimetry,
it basically looks like a sealed box.

36
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:35,000
It is composed of a body of channels for samples
and operating temperature control panel

37
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,860
If you inside, then we can see
different parts of the instruments.

38
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:46,120
These three of these are more used
for getting our thermal state of environment.

39
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:55,120
Principly the most important part of the calorimetry
is the heat collector place where we circle with a red ring.

40
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:05,220
If we zoom in on this part, we can see samples and references
are placed in a heat flow sensor and both are on top of a heat sinc.

41
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,620
The heat is produced by the sample will be collected
by the censor as heat is conducted through the heat sink.

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,300
Placed in a thermal environment

43
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,780
And this moment we can start to ask ourselves
why do we want to use these instrument?

44
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:28,880
Calorimetry is a heat mattering machining,
it is actually a Generactic way of studying processes.

45
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,890
All processes, physical, chemical and biological
are generally related to enthalpy change.

46
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:47,140
In addition, Cement hydration is an exothermic reaction which
are associated with hydration of different main clinker phases with water.

47
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:55,300
The pictures on the right side are typical
curves we can obtain from calorimetry measurements.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,800
In cement field, isothermal calorimety is often
used on these purposes
such as following hydration processes, adjusting gypsum

49
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,220
content of checking the pozzolanic reaction
of the supplementary cementitious materials.

50
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:17,220
From now on we will go through all the
steps for performing a calorimetry test.

51
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,470
In order to give a vivid explanation,
some videos have been inserted in the module.

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,190
Before we can perform a test, making sure that
the instrument is in a good condition is very important.

53
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,640
This can be done by calibration.

54
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:43,300
Isothermal calorimetry is actually a very stable instrument
but proper calibration will help to significantly reduce noise.
This can be done by calibration.

55
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,010
This can be done by calibration.

56
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,290
Based on heat flow matchment principle,
the thermal P is proportional to the voltage
signal from the sensor U.
This can be done by calibration.

57
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:52,320
Based on heat flow matchment principle,
the thermal P is proportional to the voltage
signal from the sensor U.

58
00:05:52,910 --> 00:06:01,600
As indicated in the equation, to establish their
relationship, two parameters near to be determined.

59
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,800
By their calibration coefficient
baseline, and baseline for the U0.

60
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:17,930
Baseline is measured by electrical calibration.
usually we do these every three months with the software.

61
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,880
U zero is a signal with no heat
produced in the sample but a referencing side.

62
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,600
The calibration should be done when we
change the temperature, the file or samples.

63
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,680
There is another calibration called time constant,
which is typically one hundred to one thousand seconds.
The calibration should be done when we
change the temperature, the file or samples.

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,960
There is another calibration called time constant,
which is typically one hundred to one thousand seconds.

65
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:48,700
This calibration is not necessary for cement hydration
since the timescale of cement hydration is much
longer than this time constant.

66
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,600
Complete isothermal calorimetry measurement
is composed of two main steps.

67
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:06,120
First step is preparing the reference and performing
a baseline.
The second a step is casting the specimens and starting the experiments.

68
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,610
There are basically two ways
for prepare in the specimen.

69
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,080
So-called ex-situ and in-situ.

70
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:24,300
As the name implies, in the case of ex-situ,
specimens are cast externally and being poured inside of
the glass amper.

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,120
In the case of the insitu, the specimens are mixed with
the L-shaped mixer inside of the amper placed in the channel holes.

72
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,960
In order to get good reproducibility,
ex-situ your preparation will be shown in this section.

73
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,600
First thing we need to do now is
to select a reference and prepare it.

74
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,900
The principle for choosing a reference is that the reference
should have no heat production during temperature change.

75
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,420
Commonly used references are
water and quartz samples.

76
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,900
please remember to not use old hydrated cement samples,

77
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:10,390
since the hydration of cement even when
it is mattered will not be ended completely

78
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,440
To ensure a stable baseline and reduce background noise,

79
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,820
the sample

80
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:27,080
and reference amp polls show to have the same thorough no response.
This is the draw for calculating the mass of the reference.

81
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:36,550
Here is an example of calculating a reference for ten grams of
cement paste with water cement ratio of 0.4

82
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:45,160
By knowing the specific heat capacity of water and
cement powder the mass of the reference can be calculated.

83
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,650
References for different starters systems should be

84
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,630
calculated based on the components
and mass of the whole samples.

85
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,620
So you're sure use different reference
water for different systems.

86
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,610
I'm supporting the reference water in the ample,
when your interests well as you can see on the slide.
So you're sure use different reference
water for different systems.

87
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,830
I'm supporting the reference water in the ample,
when your interests well as you can see on the slide.

88
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,490
Then we place it into the referenced side
of each channel in the instrument.

89
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,620
That's what all the diagram altogether,
which shows this process.

90
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:25,390
Different brands may have different design in turn
Iowa there are different number of channels for different uses.

91
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:35,790
We use in this demo, is a channel ten instrument.
Each channel has sample size and
reference side marked as A

92
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,610
and they respectively.

93
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,120
First

94
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:46,760
of all we open the plastic black lead use
a steel hook to hand the heat sink plug out.

95
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:54,670
Then we put the referencing, make sure it is going
to the bottom sitting right on top of the sensor.

96
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,640
After all these we can place the plug back and close the lead.

97
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,790
To start the initial baseline, we will need to create a new experiment.
In the case of ten IR

98
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,270
software being used is called Temp I R assistant.
You can see this icon on the slide.

99
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:21,810
Double click to open the software and at home page,
you can click on experiment in new menu

100
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,140
or click the green Icon on the top let.
After put in the name of the sample

101
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,480
and operators now the experiment
all these are will be activated.

00:10:34,03 --> 00:10:
It will guide you through a number of steps such as

102
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:45,740
selecting calorimeter and Channeled.
In next window, you will be reminded to put
the reference watering side.

103
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,670
And also you need to put Baseline
duration and signal stability condition.

104
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,780
Different conditions tell the ant of the baseline
when different conditions are met.

105
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,060
Usually at twenty degree the boys line
with this condition takes around thirty

106
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:03,440
minutes.

107
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,710
If temperature difference between the
reference water and the instrument is higher,

108
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:15,090
Then this tie ofcourse will be longer.
In the end you can see a window shows the

109
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:23,600
recorded baseline, until the baseline recording is finalized,
you will be instructed to put the samples into their

110
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,320
calorimeter.

111
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,500
Now is the time to prepare our samples.

112
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,830
In order to get reasonable results for Calorimetry,
really presented raw materials is critical.

113
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,440
We need to avoid the phases change
due to cabonation or humidity.

114
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:47,130
Briefly, three suggestions can be used
for getting good raw materials materials.

115
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,880
Keep raw materials sealed,
use on the recent batches,

116
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:58,710
and sample the amount you plan to use from a
big container to avoid always opening the container.

117
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,090
In this section, we are going to cast
the cement paste to with water to cement ratio of 0.4.
and sample the amount you plan to use from a
big container to avoid always opening the container.

118
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,650
In this section, we are going to cast
the cement paste to with water to cement ratio of 0.4.

119
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,290
For one ample, Usually we use approximately
ten gram of cement paste.

120
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:19,080
This amount will be changed with different types of materials.
One principle is to have high enough signal in order to

121
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:25,340
lower the error to signal ratio.
Here we weighted thirty two gram of water

122
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:34,890
and eighteen gram of cement powders. Two hundred fifty millimeter
plastic container.
In our case we only have cement

123
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:43,740
powder by you you have several different kinds of components of materials,
to get homogeneous examples, it is better

124
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,990
to first dry mix them.

125
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,440
We can chose Dry hand mixing or
machine mixing before casting.

126
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,410
For mixing the sample, it is not mandatory
to use one specific type of mixer

127
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,690
but the most important thing is
to keep using the same mixing spades and duration time.

128
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:12,660
To figure shows the difference for using
different speeds because of differential rates as mixing

129
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,300
energy.

130
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:24,560
Samples which makes do with higher mixing
spares shows higher heat flow.
Before casting, we need to prepare a mixer,

131
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,120
a suitable postering powder all for
different sample sizes and a stopwatch.

132
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:38,750
In our protocol, we use mixing speed of 1600 R.P.M.
and The mixing time is two minutes.

133
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,210
Here is another demo, shows how we can
make the sample for calorimetry test.

134
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:54,400
First of all we need to adjust to the position of the paddle
to make sure you have a good mixing efficiency.

135
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,220
We put the water into the simmer

136
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,790
and quickly put the 250mm plastic
container under the mixer.

137
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,800
While mixing, we need to move up and down or left and
right to make sure the sample is homogenized.

138
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,780
Don't forget to write down
the time you pour the water inside.

139
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:23,720
After the cement paste is ready, we will need to put
a certain amount of pacing side of the ample.

140
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:30,240
The weight of the pacing ample is important in order
to a later normalize the total heat rays.

141
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,920
In this step, we will need to prepare
a glass ample, a key pad and a balance.

142
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,930
We have another demo showing how we usually do for the step.
For Ike city of preparation, the sample

143
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:51,240
need to be Fluid enough otherwise,
You have a some difficulty to put it inside of them sample.

144
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,710
We cut and bath the puppet and place the ample on the

145
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,930
balance and tailor balance.

146
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:06,050
Exam pays to with the people that claim their outside with a tissue blowy plies the people inside of

147
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,390
the ample of the just the position

148
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,960
and screws the paid up people doing this until you reach the mass you need drag down the exact months after we finish

149
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,700
waiting we slightly top the sample

150
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:29,340
and learn suit low sample with a laid by using our kept pointing to all then we can lower their ample in the sample

151
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:36,690
side of the channel with the same way as we did for the reference water here we have some good

152
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:45,280
and bad examples for the sample preparation since the sensor is on the bottom of the AM posting it is a battle to put

153
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:52,590
the sample to the botton to make sure that the hay the generated is completely collected by the sensor now all

154
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,050
experiment is going on we can use the experiment always add to check how the experiment is going.

155
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:07,440
When the experiment finished we need to do the final baseline prissily it is the same as the initial baseline

156
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:15,460
and there is another reason we are guided you for the steps just remember before you do the baseline union to take out

157
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,000
of the sample ballot if the referencing site.

158
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,960
To explore the data you need to select which experiment you want to have the data

159
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:33,780
and click export ing file money obviously acting information which you want to have you can access father data as

160
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,550
C.S.V.

161
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:41,470
Vile or Excel file in this file you can have the time for the experiment on it for all

162
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:47,800
and cumulative here to release him a legit hate release is obtained by calculating the integrate.

163
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:56,360
Of the hateful don't forget to at the time join the sample perpetration Slide twenty six the last part of the section

164
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,720
we will have a look together at the huge flaw resound of a normal Portland cement.

165
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,970
Conventionally the whole heat flow curve Gulf to four

166
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:16,610
or five stages of cement hydration during each of them there are different mechanics science behind it therefore it

167
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:23,260
will help us to understand the hydration properties of cement the first two stages are called is a low shin paired

168
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:31,000
and induction period these two stage SAS are associated to the dissolution of the arms from Sully's the dissolution

169
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,730
rate controls the kinetics and the dissolution is higher

170
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,800
when the I am concentration in the solution is a lot more obvious some time

171
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,440
when I am concentrating goes higher the dissolution

172
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,820
or loss than factors such as the furnace of the body go density of critical defrags temperature

173
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:56,840
and I am a sturgeon well all in for one's the duration of this tooth stage after the first two stage const of very

174
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:02,690
important stage called acceleration period this is the May pig of c three as hydration

175
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,890
and the rate of acceleration can chose by the precipitation annual Asian of C.

176
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,970
As age sis age precipitates

177
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:18,120
when the degree of supersets ration reached their maximum value this is the period which are affected by the mixing

178
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,690
right finalists of the party goes temperature

179
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:30,170
and the amount of a separate month recent issues materials the fourth stage is scored at the exaggeration period in

180
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:37,800
this period hit for our age that to decrease we can see a shudder we should present the Sergant reaction of eliminate

181
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,180
this one can be used for the judge just saying the amount of chips

182
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:47,750
or the march of some we put inside the later shows still dominate.

183
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,420
Pick the antis people combine the fourth stage

184
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:59,160
and fifth stage together since during these days the hits for all are always decreasing as the summary will listed side

185
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:07,110
advantage than disadvantages of these ice of another color matter Mashonaland one thing you may need to pay attention

186
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,930
is that these measurements is still very repeatable.

187
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:21,730
But after several days because of the low signal their test is not very reliable That's all for this model Thank you.
