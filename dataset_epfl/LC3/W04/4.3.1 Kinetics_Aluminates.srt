1
00:00:04,12 --> 00:00:05,87
OK So hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06,38 --> 00:00:14,20
So far we've talked mainly about hydration of the calcium silicate systems. 
In this module we're

3
00:00:14,21 --> 00:00:21,96
going to talk about what happens with the aLuminate systems. 
Many of you probably already know that if you just take 

4
00:00:21,97 --> 00:00:23,33
tricalcium Aluminite

5
00:00:23,59 --> 00:00:31,41
and you add water, then what you get is a very very 
violent reaction. 
You get these large platy hydrate

6
00:00:31,77 --> 00:00:36,91
and the result of that is that we 
have what's called very rapid stiffening or flash set.

7
00:00:37,75 --> 00:00:44,87
Now this shows some actual pictures of the reaction of C3A.
You can see either by the transmission

8
00:00:44,88 --> 00:00:50,68
micrograph here or in this scanning electron microscope 
you can see these platy hydrates.

9
00:00:51,01 --> 00:01:01,15
and these precis hydrates are normally 
described as C4AH10 or C2AH8. 
These are a metastable AFM

10
00:01:01,16 --> 00:01:09,06
phases and over time they will transform to the hydrogarnet phase. 
So that's what happens without sulphate

11
00:01:09,10 --> 00:01:18,17
but that's not really what we're interested in 
for the purposes of cement. 
Because of course in cement we have gypsum

12
00:01:18,28 --> 00:01:26,45
and the reason for adding this gypsum is to control 
this reaction of the alluminate phase. 
So here we see the pattern of

13
00:01:26,46 --> 00:01:36,62
reaction with sulphate. This is an experiment 
where there was 40% of sulphate, 400% C3A

14
00:01:37,16 --> 00:01:39,10
And that's roughly

15
00:01:39,21 --> 00:01:47,75
or even a bit lower, the same as the sulphate C3A ratio 
you would have in cement because typical Portland Cement

16
00:01:47,76 --> 00:01:53,03
contain around six to eight percent C4A 
and around five percent gypsum.

17
00:01:53,94 --> 00:02:01,19
And here we can see that we have a pattern of reaction 
where we have the last initial peak.

18
00:02:01,60 --> 00:02:03,69
And then we have this very long period,

19
00:02:03,72 --> 00:02:08,36
Aired more than a day in which 
there's almost nothing happening

20
00:02:09,04 --> 00:02:17,80
and then we have this second peak here. 
OK so this period in which there's nothing 
happening is extremely important

21
00:02:17,84 --> 00:02:25,58
because we need to have this period of long 
period of induction to allow the silicate to react.

22
00:02:26,87 --> 00:02:36,24
Now most textbooks say that the reason for this 
long induction period is because we have the 
formation of ettringite.

00:02:37,15 --> 00:02:43,15
Now we do have the formation of ettringite, 
we can see in this picture here, 
these little rods, these ettringite,

24
00:02:43,88 --> 00:02:50,29
but these are not forming a barrier, 
you know it would be like trying to block water with

25
00:02:50,30 --> 00:02:59,57
or a dam of suigetit. 
The water can infiltrate through the spaces between the rod. 
So this is not the reason why the

26
00:02:59,58 --> 00:03:07,51
reaction slows down and in fact other experiments have shown 
that the real reason is because we have sulfate ions

27
00:03:07,52 --> 00:03:15,53
absorbing directly on the surface of the C3A, 
which slow down the dissolution of the of the C3A.

28
00:03:17,23 --> 00:03:22,84
Then in this case after about two days, 
we get the second reaction

29
00:03:23,08 --> 00:03:29,18
and during the second reaction,
we get the formation of this phase 
calciummonosulphure alluminate.

30
00:03:30,28 --> 00:03:38,60
Now if we look at the chemical equations of these reactions, 
the formation of extreme right is usually written like this

31
00:03:38,61 --> 00:03:41,10
we have C3A with the gypsum

32
00:03:41,30 --> 00:03:48,52
and water which forms this complicated formula here of ettringite, 
we discussed a few modules back,

33
00:03:49,09 --> 00:03:55,91
but in fact we should always remember that like all hydration 
reactions in cement, the reactions really going through a

34
00:03:55,92 --> 00:04:02,07
solution. 
We have calcium and alluminate ions sulfate ions and

35
00:04:02,26 --> 00:04:07,61
and hydroxide ions which all come 
together to form this mineral ettringite.

36
00:04:08,14 --> 00:04:16,54
And in fact these calcium ions here don't necessarily 
come from the alluminate phase, 
they could come from the C3S

37
00:04:16,55 --> 00:04:17,39
For example.

38
00:04:18,65 --> 00:04:27,46
And I really want to stress that again a common myth 
in many textbooks is this idea you can get top of chemical

39
00:04:27,47 --> 00:04:28,84
formation of ettringite

40
00:04:29,42 --> 00:04:37,31
and this is really absolute nonsense because the crystal structure 
of this phase is so completely different from what

41
00:04:37,32 --> 00:04:41,90
you have in the enhydrous materials. 
There is absolutely no way this is possible.

42
00:04:43,09 --> 00:04:51,49
And then the second reaction here, can be described as a reaction of C3A
with some of the ettringite already

43
00:04:51,50 --> 00:05:01,81
formed, to give us this calcium monosulphur aluminate. 
So we see that for the reaction of C3A to continue, 

44
00:05:01,82 --> 00:05:09,65
some of the ettringite gets used up to form monosulfate. 
But not all the ettringite disappears.

45
00:05:09,06 --> 00:05:16,88
So this micrograph that here clearly shows that 
we still got a lot of ettringite in this space out.

46
00:05:16,99 --> 00:05:25,80
Here whereas inside this hydrate shell 
we've got see these plates of monosulphur aluminates. 
So it's not all the

47
00:05:25,81 --> 00:05:27,02
ettringite that disappears.

48
00:05:27,65 --> 00:05:36,31
As we talked about in the previous module, 
Nowadays we have usually small additions of limestone in the cement

49
00:05:36,93 --> 00:05:40,82
and the small additions of limestone means that instead of forming 

50
00:05:40,83 --> 00:05:49,20
monosulfate which we see here in the cement without limestone, 
what we actually form is now Hemi or monocarbon aluminate.

51
00:05:49,21 --> 00:05:52,46
So generally 

52
00:05:52,47 --> 00:06:01,50
Hemi and monocarbon aluminates are replacing 
monosulfate in most cements you see today. 
You won't really be able to

53
00:06:01,62 --> 00:06:09,32
see any difference in terms of the micro graphs here, 
because the morphology of hemimonocarbon aluminate is very

54
00:06:09,33 --> 00:06:15,15
similar to what we have with monosulfate. 
We describe the differences between these A.F.M.

55
00:06:15,16 --> 00:06:22,61
phases in the previous model on the aluminate hydrates. 
That's not the end of the story because

56
00:06:23,15 --> 00:06:34,06
when you put the alite and the C3A together, 
you get quite a lot of complex interactions. 
So this blue curve here

57
00:06:34,35 --> 00:06:43,89
shows the heat evolution we get from a synthesized clinker, 
which composed of alite and C3A but no ferrite

58
00:06:44,33 --> 00:06:49,32
And the pure C3A and gypsum on its own.

59
00:06:50,24 --> 00:06:58,05
And what we see in the mixture, we can actually identify three peaks 
which are related to the reaction of the aluminate phases.

60
00:06:59,04 --> 00:07:06,15
We can see this kind of shoulder peak which we call A1, 
then we can see this quite pronounced peak A2,

61
00:07:06,93 --> 00:07:16,91
And finally this is rather small in defined peak, 
which we call A3. 
Now this a one peak

62
00:07:17,13 --> 00:07:25,01
has often been said to be the formation of monosulphate 
but that's actually not correct as we're going to see.

63
00:07:26,09 --> 00:07:35,32
So before we go into that in more detail, 
the important point to emphasize is the need to 
have enough gypsum in your

64
00:07:35,33 --> 00:07:45,42
mixture, in order to make sure that the aluminate reactions 
or the main Aluminite reactions are occurring after the silicate reactions.

65
00:07:46,27 --> 00:07:56,67
So here we see these same mixtures with progressively 
larger amounts of gypsum, and as we add more

66
00:07:56,68 --> 00:08:05,45
and more gypsum, you see this very strong peak here 
shifts later in a different time. 
Now if we have very low or too low

67
00:08:05,46 --> 00:08:11,99
amounts of gypsum, then you see this big 
aluminate peak occurs before the silicate peak.

68
00:08:12,46 --> 00:08:22,76
And as a consequence, that silicate peak which was 
here in the properly sulfated once it gets 
shifted to much later ages

69
00:08:22,93 --> 00:08:30,91
and it's much lower. 
So this violent reaction of the aLuminate 
really inhibits the reaction of the silicate phases

70
00:08:31,27 --> 00:08:39,05
and will be very damaging in terms of strength development. 
So this is very very important that we need a proper amount

71
00:08:39,06 --> 00:08:48,09
of sulfate to make sure that this main Aluminite peak 
is well of the silicate peak. 
In this case here, it would be

72
00:08:48,10 --> 00:08:56,64
preferable to go for this system here where 
which is four point one percent gypsum, 
where you see the large peak is

73
00:08:56,65 --> 00:09:05,46
occurring really well after the silicate peak. 
If we went for this one here we would have a a risk that we could

74
00:09:05,47 --> 00:09:10,98
destabilize this sulfation when 
we have any admixtures in the system.

75
00:09:11,65 --> 00:09:16,96
And this is a very common problem 
particularly in North America where people.

76
00:09:17,51 --> 00:09:24,74
Adding not only admixtures but often 
supplementary cementitious materials like fly ash 

77
00:09:24,80 --> 00:09:33,75
at the concrete stage, and when you have all these 
things coming together, you can quite easily destabilize the reactions

78
00:09:33,76 --> 00:09:43,66
and have this aluminate reaction occurring too early, 
with the consequence of really impeding the reaction of the silicate.

79
00:09:44,98 --> 00:09:48,35
So let's come back now to this peak A1.

80
00:09:49,08 --> 00:09:55,67
And here we see the calorimetry output, 
we can see this show repeat just here this A1 peak

81
00:09:55,92 --> 00:10:04,71
and then this A2 peak here. 
Now it's really quite complex what's happening. 
If we look at the soul of gypsum which is

82
00:10:04,72 --> 00:10:10,14
this green line here, we can see 
that the solid gypsum is more

83
00:10:10,15 --> 00:10:18,33
or less to exhausted just at the point where 
we start to help the onset of this A1 shoulder peak.

84
00:10:19,92 --> 00:10:30,61
But, even though the solar gypsum seems to been exhausted, 
we can see that during this a one peak here, the main solid

85
00:10:30,62 --> 00:10:34,37
phase that's forming is in fact still ettringite.

86
00:10:34,81 --> 00:10:40,13
And see here on this yellow curve, 
the amount of ettringite is continuing to go up.

87
00:10:40,99 --> 00:10:51,51
And it's not really till somewhat later we can see 
significant formation of the monosulfate, more associated with
this A2 peak.

88
00:10:52,40 --> 00:10:59,62
So how can this be? How can it be that even though 
the solid gypsum has been exhausted, we can still go

89
00:10:59,63 --> 00:11:10,29
on forming ettringite? 
Well the reason is this that sulfate can be 
absorbed on the calcium silicate hydrate. 

90
00:11:11,16 --> 00:11:21,65
So during the acceleration part of the curve, 
the silicate is reacting. It's forming C.S.H. 
and As it's forming C.S.H,

91
00:11:21,66 --> 00:11:29,24
because the Sulphate in solution is quite high, 
quite a lot of it gets absorbed on the C.S.H. 

92
00:11:29,83 --> 00:11:38,70
Here you can see Measurements taken in the 
SEM of the ratios between sulphate and calcium in the C.S.H.

93
00:11:39,32 --> 00:11:42,09
So we can see here on the sulfate on the C.S.H.

94
00:11:42,10 --> 00:11:43,08
Is quite high

95
00:11:43,51 --> 00:11:52,44
and then as we come through this A1 peak you can 
see it's really dropping. 
So this is the extra source of sulphate

96
00:11:52,71 --> 00:12:02,45
that we needed to keep forming ettringite as 
we're seeing in the previous slide here. 
Let's come back to this peak here.

97
00:12:02,77 --> 00:12:08,12
We can now really confirm that this 
is A1 peak is the formation of ettringite

98
00:12:08,52 --> 00:12:12,77
and this a to peak is the formation of monosulfate.

99
00:12:13,55 --> 00:12:21,54
And it's also important to observe that 
this impact of sulfate being absorbed on the C.S.H.

100
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:32,31
Also changes the time of this A2 peak, compared to a 
pure system. 
So here we see what was happening in a binary

101
00:12:32,32 --> 00:12:40,26
mixture of C3A And forty percent gypsum. 
We had this model so fate peak at about fifty hours

102
00:12:40,81 --> 00:12:48,94
and now in this mixture, Where we've got the equivalent 
of more than sixty percent of gypsum compared to the C3A

103
00:12:49,45 --> 00:12:53,57
This is A2 peak is only 
about twenty five thirty hours.

104
00:12:54,18 --> 00:13:02,65
And the reason for that it's come moved up here is 
that a lot of the sulfate is lost to the system because it

105
00:13:02,66 --> 00:13:04,88
gets absorbed on the C.S.H.

106
00:13:05,51 --> 00:13:12,50
So we've got quite a lot of complex interactions and 
you may have noticed I haven't yet said anything about the P.K.3

107
00:13:12,51 --> 00:13:17,46
because we still don't 
really know why we have this Peak here,

108
00:13:17,69 --> 00:13:24,41
it's not really been possible to associate that with any of this reaction. 
So what are we seeing in this

109
00:13:24,42 --> 00:13:32,70
module is known very important that the sulfate present 
from the addition of gypsum, more drastically modifies the

110
00:13:32,71 --> 00:13:35,47
reaction of the aluminate and the ferrite phases.

111
00:13:36,15 --> 00:13:41,12
Get a small initial reaction during which 
sulfate ions are absorbed on the surface of the

112
00:13:41,13 --> 00:13:43,87
illuminate and then induction period

113
00:13:43,88 --> 00:13:50,57
and what's important is that this induction period 
must be long enough to allow the silicate to react. 
If it's not long

114
00:13:50,58 --> 00:13:55,84
enough, you'll inhibit the silicate reaction and 
get very big problems of strength development.

115
00:13:56,94 --> 00:14:01,82
And then the solid gypsum is slowly reacting and

116
00:14:01,83 --> 00:14:07,28
when the sulfate in solution is exhausted, 
you get a second burst of the aluminate reaction

117
00:14:07,84 --> 00:14:14,18
but you still forming a tree night with sulfate that 
was previously absorbed on the C.S.H.

118
00:14:14,96 --> 00:14:22,18
And then later typically after a few days, 
we form calcium aluminate, monosulfate or more typically 

119
00:14:22,19 --> 00:14:23,74
Hemimonocarbonate aLuminate

120
00:14:23,84 --> 00:14:31,77
when we have small amounts of limestone in the cements. 
So that was the last module on the reaction kinetics

121
00:14:32,11 --> 00:14:38,58
and then the final one in this group are hydration, 
We'll talk about bringing all this together to look at the

122
00:14:38,59 --> 00:14:40,80
microstructure formation. 
Thank you.
