1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:13,440
So OK Welcome back. Now we're going to look at the main hydration peak.
So in the last module, we

2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:21,090
looked at the induction period, how that this is not related
to protective membranes is just related to under saturation

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,360
and dissolution theory.

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:31,070
And now in this more show we're going to look at
this main hydration peak,
That's to say the period between about three

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,910
hours and twenty four hours in which we have first
this very strong acceleration in the race of reaction

6
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,050
and then this deceleration.
And the main question that's really posed in this

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,480
Period is why do we go from this acceleration.
Why is it just continue accelerating to the
decceleration because the

8
00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:01,110
amount of reaction at the peak here is still relatively modest.
So in terms of what's happening in acceleration I think

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,690
the situation is quite clear that here we're looking at
the nucleation and then the growth of C.S.H.

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:18,640
So on these slides, we can quite see at about two hours,
we can see these little tiny nuclei all the C.S.H.

11
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,410
Which are forming and then those nuclei grow over time.

12
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:31,810
And as they grow over time they grow in this
what we often call a kind of needle morphology,
Where this looks a little

13
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,550
bit like a sea urchin.
Now I'm going to use the term needles

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:45,180
but depending on the different conditions, sometimes they
can look more like furs also even here we can imagine

15
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:53,800
those needles are actually tapered foil,
so you know don't worry too much about
those those differences we can find

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,000
quite a lot of variation

17
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:03,070
but it's all this kind of out good growth.
People have been studying nucleation
growth for a long time. These

18
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:03,820
images

19
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,950
here summarize the theory of Avrami

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,920
and Avrami was one of the first people to really quantify
these processes.
I was wrong he was doing he was studying

21
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,110
solidifying methods and in solidifying method you have a liquid

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,890
and then these nuclei represented in here grow a form and then they grow

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,740
and the rate of growth is proportional to their surface.
So as first of all they get bigger the growth rate goes up

24
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,170
and then as these nuclei grow into each other
you can see the surface available for growth goes down so you get

25
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,110
this deceleration.
So he analyzed this process in quite some detail,
came up with some very powerful equations

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
and this just shows a couple of his equations.

27
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:59,270
And because this kind of form of reaction where
we have this peak this looks rather similar to what we've got in

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,250
cement paste.

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:09,310
For about fifty odd years, people have been trying to say
well can we apply this quantitative analysis to cement paste

30
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,890
and indeed because it's such a simple shape,
you can quite easily fit this to cement hydration.

31
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,780
but the problem is that then you come up with
parameters that have no physical meaning

32
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:32,670
and vary enormously from one cement to another.
So this really underlines the fact that to really understand the right

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,560
mechanism,
you have to do a very wide range of experiments

34
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:45,560
and you have to analyze those quantitative.
Now in terms of doing the quantitative analysis,
it's very useful to be able

35
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,780
to rely on computer models.

36
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:56,190
And one aspect which we need to well capture in computer models
is the fact that we have a very wide range of particle

37
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,350
sizes.
We have some cement particles that are about sixty microns
in size, some are less than a micron size

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,740
and this means that in a typical.

39
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:09,630
Well so this would be a typical box of one hundred microns,
we may have many millions of particles.

40
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,780
And this short here shows the more we call Mike.
Mike is this a model developed a G.P.S.

41
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,880
Fell by shushing Bishnoi and it has this cute little logo,
it's written like this

42
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:32,800
but that's because it's Mike for microstructure.
OK so we can use this modeling platform to test
different hypothesis.

43
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:40,620
The first hypothesis we tested was this classical
idea sometimes called Boundary nucleation

44
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,860
and growth, where we have our surface
which is alite,
we have the C.S.H.

45
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,970
Growing on the surface and the growth rate is proportional to the surface of the C.S.H.

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,130
So that eventually growth will slow down

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:02,960
when material from one grain impinges with the other.
If we look at the results from this

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,770
and what's quite important in these results
I'm going to show you, is that we tested this

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:18,600
or no range of particle sizes from the same alite.
So these numbers here, tells you the average particle size of the

50
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:25,490
different alite, but in fact we had the whole particle
size distribution wish we could simulate in the model.

51
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:33,220
And what you can see here is that in this morning
we can capture very well this accelerator a period

52
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,170
but after the peak we get a very poor
correspondence between the more the model shows

53
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:45,400
and what the experimental result says.
Basically we don't get the deceleration

54
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,220
and if we look at the screenshot of the model

55
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:57,590
and the peak,
You can see here there's a very small amount of product,
so it's support not surprising we're not getting

56
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,820
much impingement between the product.
So what can be an alternative?
Well classically,

57
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:11,560
many researchers have proposed that what happens at the peak
is that we switch the mechanism, we go from a

58
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:17,810
nucleation growth control mechanism,
to the fusion control mechanism.

59
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:26,360
And the idea is that we have our cement grain here,
we have our solution out here,
we have a product in between

60
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:33,680
and that either the water has to diffuse in,
all the products have to diffuse out properly both

61
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,770
but we don't know which one is rate limiting.

62
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:47,130
So that's again seems quite a nice hypothesis.
It's a hypothesis that fits very well in a number of other reaction

63
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:54,630
studies. And we can use our modeling platform
to look at that and here we see the results.

64
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:04,070
And our first glance this looks OK because you see the model
now fits fairly well with the experimental results

65
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,360
but and this is a very important

66
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,260
but, because we did the simulations all know this wide range of different particle sizes.

67
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:22,800
And we see if you get them all to fit,
we've got to vary all the fusion coefficientby ten times,
now this makes

68
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,960
absolutely no sense what so ever because this is
exactly the same alite with forming exactly the same C.S.H.

69
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,090
And there is absolutely no reason that
this diffusion question all that C.S.H.

70
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:45,900
Should change by an order of magnitude.
Clearly what this shows is you know
you can make a lot of mechanisms fit

71
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,970
but you have to go further to really see what can be the right theory.
So we really have to.

72
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,250
Abandon this idea of diffusion

73
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:03,080
and there are a number of other reasons why we should do this.
So here we have the first reason I showed in the last

74
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,820
slide that there

75
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:08,190
no reason why this diffusion coefficient should change by an order of magnitude

76
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:16,380
but also those of you who have perhaps looked at different ways
of calculation maturity will be familiar with the idea

77
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,940
that we can use a single activation energy
throughout that main hydration peak

78
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:27,990
and we wouldn't expect that if we had a transition in mechanism.
So if we went from a mechanism which is like

79
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,600
nucleation

80
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:37,230
and growth,
which is to do with bone breaking and making,
this would have a typical activation energy around forty k/j

81
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:44,460
per mole, which is typically have the same all of what we
find in cement pastes, well as transport control processes

82
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:52,160
such as diffusion, how much lower activation energy is less
than around twenty kilo joules per mole.
So there's no

83
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,450
evidence from this activation.

84
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:04,210
And thirdly, if we look at a micrograph, this is a taken one day,
so we know we're well past the the heat peak here.

85
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,190
And what we can see this is alite grain on the right here,
this is our C.S.H.

86
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,600
Form and we have got this kind of shell here

87
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,950
but we really cannot in any way defend that
the shell is acting as a diffusion barrier,
because if the shell was acting

88
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:28,110
as a diffusion barrier we'd know it now expect to
see this region of low density behind the shell,
we would expect this

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:38,170
to be right in contact with alite grain.
So this many reasons really are evidence
that diffusion is not becoming the

90
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:49,160
rate determining mechanism at this stage of the reaction.
Then with the work of Bishnoi, we really look at this formation

91
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:49,980
of product

92
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,590
and this formation of product you can see,
it's not really all that uniform
that's to say that the kind of an average

93
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,820
density out here is quite a bit less than
the density close to the particles.

94
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:09,560
And so we put forward a new hypothesis that C.S.H.

95
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,570
Was for first forming in a low density way

96
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,690
and then subsequently densifying.
Now because it's got this low density,
then it can occupy more space

97
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:27,130
and you can imagine to have impingement between the hydrates
much earlier than you would otherwise expect.

98
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,460
And this theory was developed quite rigorously and quantitatively

99
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,750
and we see from these results here that it really appears
to work very well and in 2009

100
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,080
we published this paper, where we put forward those nice hypothesis.

101
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:54,600
Unfortunately, as is often the case in science,
we then come to a counterexample
which really shows that this new theory

102
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,780
was not right either.
The critical experiment is this one which we did with Amalie Bazzoni

103
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,250
but has also been done by a number of other people,
where you can see we have a very different
water to cement ratio, so

104
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:17,510
here we have hydration with water to cement ratio 0.4, 0.8 point.
According to this densifying growth theory, we

105
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,950
would expect for the water cement ratio

106
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,870
0.8 that to be a lot more space and
therefore to have a lot more hydration before this downturn.

107
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:34,830
But in fact we don't see this we face a just a little bit more
hydration before we get this downturn so unfortunately

108
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:45,520
we have to abandon this new hypothesis.
Also in the thesis of Bazzoni,
But certainly we had another source of alite

109
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:49,570
which gave us a different a different perspective on this question.

110
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:56,130
And this was really where we had a lights
which on the one hand contained small amounts of zinc.

111
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:03,820
And on the other hand small amounts of magnesium
so we had the pure system magnesium and zinc.
And what you can see.

112
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:13,550
We in the calorimetry curves here that the presence of
lower amounts of the zinc,
gives you this first increase in the

113
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,480
amount of hydration that's occurring in this first heat evolution peak.
So there must be something different

114
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:28,900
that's occurring with the zinc dope sample, which is
telling us about what's controlling this main Heat

115
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,700
evolution peak.
So when we made them

116
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:40,240
or these health investigation by transmission electron microscopy,
what in fact we see here we see these needles that

117
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,870
are growing out from the C3S

118
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,060
Surface much longer in the case of zinc than
in the case of magnesium and the pure case.

119
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:57,210
And we could quantify that. So here we see the quantification
of the needles length you know don't know exactly the

120
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,010
mechanism

121
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:05,270
but we could see that the zinc is really incorporated
into the CSH stage, whereas the magnesium is not really being

122
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:14,490
incorporated to all, it's just occurring as these
little isolated crystals.
So this gave us a new hypothesis, yet

123
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:21,710
another new hypothesis that the idea is we get this C.S.H.
Growth in needles on the surface of the grain.

124
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,180
By the time you get to the peak the
surface is covered so no more needles can grow

125
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,860
and there's no more needles can
grow the rate of hydration starts slowing down

126
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,580
and you get the formation of inner product.

127
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,800
But as I've already said, the critical test of any hypothesis
is whether it works quantitatively.

128
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:51,110
And for this we're now working on a new model, which is called
the needle model which is being worked on by Alexandra

129
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,960
Musea in our lavinda minute.

130
00:13:53,530 --> 00:14:02,100
And this hypothesis is we have CSH growth is Needles.
What's very very important is that all the parameters can

131
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,820
now come to experiment.
There's no fitting.

132
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:09,440
And what I'm going to show you here.
And because it's an algorithmic more or rather than a

133
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:20,740
Computer model, a model that works in terms of having a real
microstructure, we can also calculate much more difficult

134
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,930
complex form for the grains and
take account of the consumption of the small grains.

135
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:31,130
And when we do that you can see now in these different simulations.

136
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,030
This really works beautifully throughout the whole
range of different variations we've already seen.
It can really well

137
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,590
capture this water cement ratio variation

138
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:50,400
and it can really well capture the effect of the zinc in the open.
So hopefully, this is now the hypothesis which can be

139
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:58,790
validated.
Of course we're not at the end of the road because
there are important open questions. So if this mechanism is

140
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,740
controlled by these needles that grow
and then stop what's controlling this?
Unfortunately day we can't that question

141
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:14,130
but with work we have underway looking
at the much more atomistic level,
I think pretty confident we'll be able to

142
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,370
answer this in a year or so as time.
So let's come to the summary on this main peak the first

143
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:29,070
and foremost thing is that just because you can do occur
fitting that doesn't mean the hypothesis is right.
You can take

144
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,400
many many equations they had 'this simple form of peak

145
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:43,580
and you can they look right. If you go on to differentiate
between these different hypothesis you need to look at

146
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:50,660
hydration with a wide range of variables. You need to work
very water cement ratio/ particle size distribution look at

147
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:57,170
the door opens, all these different things a really
really important to give you the range to test your hypothesis.

148
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,820
And ideally you need to have physically measurable
parameters because if you can do that and if you can avoid.

149
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:09,460
The thinking step then you can really be much
more confident that your hypothesis is working.

150
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:18,760
And having followed that process over the last few years
we're now fairly confident that we can explain this by this

151
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,290
growth the needles to a critical length,
as me in the best hypothesis for this main hydration peak.
