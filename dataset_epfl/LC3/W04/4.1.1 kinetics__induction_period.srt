1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:12,050
So hello again.
Having looked at the different hydrates that forms
Calcium hydroxide, Calcium silicate hydrates, these

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:20,820
phases that come from the illuminates; now we're going to
look at how these different hydrates form in time the kinetics
of the hydration reaction.

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,470
Here we're going to look first of all at the
hydration of the calcium silicate phases.

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:35,210
And this shows the typical hydration curve
from Tri calcium silicate.
What you see is that initially we get a very

5
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,790
high rate of heat evolution and
then very quickly the rate of heat evolution

6
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:49,130
let's say the rate of reaction falls away and
we get this period of very slow reaction during a few hours

7
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:56,010
and this is usually called the induction period.
Now from a practical point of view this is very
important because this

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:04,630
induction period gives us the time to mix our cement or
concrete to move it on to site to place it in the forms

9
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,450
and produce the kind of concrete element
we want to have in our buildings.

10
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:18,040
And then after typically something like three hours
the reaction takes off again.
We have what's called the acceleration

11
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:24,640
period after about ten hours then it starts to slow
down again and what we call the deceleration period

12
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,670
and after the first day

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:35,940
or so, the rate of heat reaction is really quite low,
even though a twenty four hours we may only have formed about

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,410
twenty five percent of the

15
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:43,770
or less of the final strength of our concrete.
So there's quite a lot happening off the first day

16
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:51,460
but it's happening much more slowly, so it's more difficult
to follow from the point of this heatevolution.

17
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,920
And in particular in terms of these kinetics,
there are two questions that have occupied the researchers.
First of all this

18
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,340
initial slowdown.
why do we get this initial slowing down.

19
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:08,150
Then why did we get this second
slowing down for the deceleration period.

20
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:17,350
And in these modules we're going to look individually at
three separate periods.
We're going to look at this first period

21
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,660
of the initial heat evolution

22
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,730
and the induction period, then we're going to
look at this main heat volution peak here.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,400
And then we're going to look at the slow ongoing reaction.
There is quite a lot happening in this final period.

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,970
In fact a lot of the strength is developing during this time

25
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:45,320
but it's quite difficult to see because it's quite difficult
to measure what's happening due to the very low rate of heat evolution.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:52,720
Right so in this first one on the kinetics,
we're going to look at this induction period.
It seems kind of

27
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,860
old that the reaction should start
Fast and then slow down

28
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:07,470
and to explain this what is classically being advanced
has been this idea that we have this protective membrane forming

29
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,680
around the grains.

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,450
And many people over the years have advanced this kind
of hypothesis, then there's been all kinds of different theories

31
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,030
as to why they slash or suddenly disappear

32
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:29,540
and this is why fact one of the main weaknesses of this theory,
that nobody really has come up with a coherent idea of

33
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,220
why the membrane forms and then
suddenly disappears after some time.

34
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:43,310
But nowadays it's more important to realize that there is
really no evidence for this protective layer.
Back in the sixty's

35
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,740
when people first came up with this idea.

36
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,280
The fact we couldn't see it
wasn't really too much of a problem

37
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,970
but nowadays where we have very advanced characterization tools,
this is really a big issue.
I mean it's like the

38
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,720
emperor's new clothes.
Here we see a picture which I think is

39
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:15,120
Particularly important was lent to me by Luc Nicoleau
and what we see this was made in a cryo S.C.M.
So in a cryo S.C.M.

40
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:23,780
What happens? You take a cement paste you freeze it,
you break it, you put the broken frozen sample into the microscope

41
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,370
and then sublime the water. So it's a kind of gentle way of drying

42
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:37,970
but you do have to eventually remove the water because electrons
can't penetrate through water, so you have to remove the water first.

43
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,190
And what we can see here, we can see this
isn't alite grain here which is being fractured.
Along the

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,670
surface of this alite grain we see the hydrates.
So here is C S H here.

45
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:59,430
We don't really see much calcium hydroxide here,
we see a little bit of ettringite for
example down here a little bit

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:09,040
up here.
But very clearly these hydrates don't give a
continuous membrane on top of this cement grain.

47
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:16,060
And in fact we can see these pits, we're going to
come back to these pits they're very very important.

48
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,070
And particularly on these pits we can see
there's no indication of any kind of covering.

49
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:32,300
And this micro office of quite a high resolution the
bar here tells you about one hundred nanometers scale so you know

50
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,360
even if there was a layer only a few know made to
stick we would expect to see some indication of it.

51
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:48,180
So really this theory of the protective membrane
that most people have been promulgating for a number of years now

52
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,440
really just doesn't hold up to examination.

53
00:05:52,190 --> 00:06:02,520
And here's another sequence where we can see in this case
what's happening under water.
So this sequence was taken in

54
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,720
the Wet cell of

55
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,610
atomic force microscope.

56
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:14,570
And as we run the sequence as we do here here,
here to run the sequence we can see that we get this rough area

57
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,280
forming here and then after a while we start to see the steps.
OK the steps here

58
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:27,240
and the steps are moving as we
have the dissolution at those steps.

59
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:33,700
Those are the particular important things to observe here,
first of all a rough area forming

60
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:43,640
and then moving to this steps which retreat.
Now another observation which completely

61
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:54,690
to my mind refutes the protective layer theory
as this experiment we did about annealing.
So we took alite

62
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:01,330
and one part of the Alite was then heated up
to anneal it, to remove the effects

63
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,590
and you can see here this dramatic effect the annealing
has on the hydration kinetics.
It really extends this induction

64
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,160
period,

65
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:17,840
but almost to this induction period,
then the hydration seems pretty much the same
as it was for the unannealed sample.

66
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
And over here we see the first peak

67
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,070
and we see for the anneal sample the initial Heeat evolution
is much lower then from the normally anneal sample.

68
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,950
Now how could this be explained
by a protective layer theory.

69
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:41,170
If we were going to say well maybe the layer is thicker in
the case in the anneal sample, that doesn't correlate with

70
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,270
what we see from the
first evolution peak.

71
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:51,260
And you know if we had a different kind of layer forming,
why should we expect the hydration to be the same afterwards.

72
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:57,620
This is just one example of experimental results
that cannot be explained by this theory

73
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:04,480
and more results are discussed in the paper by ......
which can be found in the references.

74
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:13,160
So the alternative theory is really just to say
well we have nucleation and growth and nucleation

75
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:22,280
and growth is a Well known phenomenal in many reactions,
in metals, in acqeous solutions, many many chemical

76
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:26,600
processes,
we can make a simple model of nucleation

77
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,820
and growth as is shown on the left here
where we have these little islands
which ar represented in the

78
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,360
nuclei of C.S.H.

79
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:42,180
and As they grow, they give this acceleration peak.
So in terms of the acceleration peak as we'll see in the next module,

80
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,670
This can be very well explained by nucleation and growth

81
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,850
but what we're missing here is any explanation of why
we have to slow down from the first dissolution.
So to understand

82
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:04,800
the slowdown better, I think we need to go through the work
that has been done in geochemistry.
Now here I want to introduce

83
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,020
this idea of dissolution being a negative form of growth.

84
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:17,870
And the little diagrams over on the left here will
probably be familiar to those of you who started
classical metalogy

85
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,220
and material science

86
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:27,320
and have looked at the solidification of metals.
So it's well known in the solidification of
metals solidification of

87
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:36,760
just about anything in fact that we don't get the solid
forming exactly the melting temperature temperature of fusion

88
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,230
as indicated here.

89
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:42,560
And this is because we have super cooling

90
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,570
and we need this super cooling because we need to
go to this point here where there is

91
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:56,840
energy difference between the liquid and solace,
and that energy difference is sufficient to give the surface

92
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:03,720
and history to form the first nuclei.
So those of you are familiar with that just look at any

93
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:10,370
classical material science textbook
you'll find a more detailed explanation.

94
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,790
When we come to think about dissolution,

95
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:20,060
if we have dissolution from a smooth surface,
this is always also going to require energy
for forming the extra

96
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:26,460
surface, so here we have an imaginary surface
and here we have a little bit of dissolution going on

97
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,040
and you see dissolution means that
we have to get this extra surface that is show there.

98
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:41,950
And then in this case, this extra surface energy
needs to come from the under saturation of the solution.
That's to say

99
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:51,830
if the solution contains less ions than it can do it
saturation, it has a higher energy it can be used can be used to

100
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,740
produce this extra surface.

101
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:01,640
So this analysis has been developed quite
rigorously in the theory of geo chemistry

102
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:12,030
and in the next slide we see two examples from
work published in this area.
So the first example shows pictures of the

103
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,910
different modes of different dissolution of course.
Standard quite high temperature,

104
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:25,310
and I really want to underline that because of this idea of
dissolution as being the negative of growth,
we see that the

105
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,200
under saturation is
increasing as we go to the left

106
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:36,720
and the dissolution rate is increasing as we go down.
So this is kind of the opposite to what we'd expect on a normal

107
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,770
axis system.

108
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:46,860
And then we see here for the course that a very high
degrees around saturation we've got a lot of excess energy due to

109
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,450
saturation so we can form a lot of
these very small piece these etch pits Vacancy islands.

110
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:03,720
As we move a little bit closer to saturation,
we see that these etch Pits tend to focus on dislocations

111
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,040
or other kind of defects we have in the crystal structure

112
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:16,560
and as we come close to saturation, we change radically
the mode dissolution and instead of forming pits, we form this

113
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,720
step retreat and remember that picture we saw in the A.F.M.

114
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:29,820
Of the zoning alite, how we saw that first of all we formed
a rough surface which is similar to the first

115
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,480
three pictures here and then we went to step retreat.

116
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:44,620
Now on the right here, we see how this translates quantitatively
in terms of the rate of dissolution as a function of

117
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,660
the Delta G.
Now the delta G

118
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,300
can just be derived from the difference
between the equilibrium saturation

119
00:12:52,460 --> 00:13:01,170
and the actual under saturation.
So what you see from the experimental points
here is we get this sudden transition

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,070
from a fast dissolution at high delta Gs
to a slow dissolution and this transition occurs

121
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,920
when we're still in fact quite far away from the
equilibrium saturation which is here.

122
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:23,070
And this step function cannot told be captured by
these other lines on here which shows what you would predict from a

123
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:31,120
classical transition state theory, as used in chemistry.
So this transition between forces solution

124
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:39,140
and slow dissolution is quite abrupt.
Now the question is this is being well proven for many minerals,

125
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,910
but doesn't it apply for cement minerals.
Well you know my first question is Well
why not you know if it applies for all

126
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,640
other minerals, Why should the minerals we form
have in cement clinker be any different.

127
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,690
And in fact we see that they're not any different
this is a classical experiment done by Patrick ....

128
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,470
a few years ago in my laboratory.
What we see in the middle here, we see

129
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:07,450
The alite which was freshly produced in the laboratory.

130
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,850
And then he took this fractured alite
and when he dipped it in pure water and

131
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,510
when we diffuse impure water as you see on the left hand side,
what we see is that very quickly we get this

132
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,380
very rough surface forming

133
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:30,430
With these etch pits because we've got a high under saturation
with the pure water.
We rapidly form these experts

134
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,750
and we can see the scope very strong Crystal graphic relationship,
because we've actually got to alite grains here

135
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,790
and we can see that one grain is being heavily attacked
whereas the other grain is remaining relatively unattacked

136
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:52,920
because it's probably in the wrong orientation.
Whereas on the right hand side here,
if we take exactly the same alite

137
00:14:52,930 --> 00:15:01,810
now put it in saturated lime solution, so saturated lime solution
is getting much closer but under saturated with

138
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,730
respect to a light, we see that now we no longer got
the energy required to give us these etch pits

139
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:16,080
and we've got really just smooth surface.
So there was really the refining experiment and then

140
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:24,960
when we made a theoretical analysis, we could see on
this left here from this classical paper of Julian et al in

141
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,570
2009,
we see that this is the under saturation

142
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,840
and the dissolution rate has this step function
which occurs around the level of saturation of Portlandite.

143
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:46,710
And then Luc Nicoleau and Andrei Norna really show
that we could have exactly the same behavior Experimentally.

144
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,640
So here, we have a theoretical treatment
here experimental treatment here,
And then Luc Nicoleau and Andrei Norna really show
that we could have exactly the same behavior Experimentally.

145
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,090
So here, we have a theoretical treatment
here experimental treatment here,

146
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:01,780
and quantitatively, they really match extremely well.
We could then take the same theoretical framework

147
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:11,350
but apply it in a completely different way,
so if we then take a model
where we're trying to fit for the calorimeter

148
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,390
curves,
we can find that we get the best fitting here

149
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:24,910
when we get values for this step function,
exactly the same as I showed you in the previous slide.
Coming to the summary here,

150
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:33,140
I think what's very important in this module is that
they most common theory you're fighting old textbooks really

151
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:41,170
is just not true.
I mean I'm sorry I know this is very destabilizing
for people trying to learn about cement chemistry,

152
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:50,560
but it's really very important you know.
It's not uncommon in science for one theory
to be proven for a long period

153
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,940
of time and then somebody to come along and
say that no it's not like that.

154
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:01,880
And those of you who study the history of science maybe
know about the fliginstan which was kind of a negative

155
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:09,320
oxygen,
which was believed to explain a lot of things in in metals.
You can go read about that in your spare time

156
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,960
but really I want you to come away.

157
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,630
From there to really understand that there is no protective layer forming,
there's no experimental evidence for it

158
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,130
and mails to the experimental
results cannot be explained by that.

159
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:31,940
That on the other hand we can explain this initial slowdown
by dissolution as a function of the under

160
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,450
saturation.

161
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:40,670
And this has a very sound theoretical framework from geochemistry.
This excellent agreement between theory experimental

162
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,300
measurements and what we can do with modeling

163
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,860
and really we can explain all the experimental observations.
So thank you and I hope that's been useful for you.
