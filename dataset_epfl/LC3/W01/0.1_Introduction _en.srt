00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,480
Hello I'm Aurelier Favier, project manager of this course
and I would like to welcome you to cement chemistry

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,610
and sustainable cementitious materials.
This course will introduce you the basic of cement integration

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,520
and out to develop

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,270
and characterize low carbon cement.
It is divided in two main parts.
The first part will enter do sustainability

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,060
and the chemistry of cementitious materials during four weeks.
The last two weeks will focus on the use of X.Ray diffraction

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,310
For the analysis of carbon cements.

7
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,810
During the first week, Professor Scrivener
introduce you to the challenge facing research

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,060
and development of cement. It will detail of a viable
solution to meet the ecological challenges

9
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:49,380
and growing demand for building materials. In week two,
we will begin the courses on the duration of cement. you will

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,910
learn of also those microstructure and the
consequence of the property is medium and long term.

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,960
To complete the course on the duration, a week free
will be devoted for tutorial for the use of scanning electron

12
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,030
microscopy on put a phase to
characterize a cement during the duration.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,610
First video will explain how
to stop the duration proper

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,160
and pretty simple for microscopy

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:17,920
Then the second tutorial will show you
SEM-DX to identify these phases and quantify them.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,860
The last week of the first part will
detail a different kinetics of cemented ration

17
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:30,120
and will be restricted with a tutorial on as a
general calorimetry to monitor the progressive reaction.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,210
Finally the two last week will focus
on the use of X.Ray diffraction

19
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,780
to characterize cement, hydrated phases
suplementary cementitious materials.

20
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,190
You will find different demonstration videos to
illustrate the data acquisition phases it into vacations

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,270
and quantification by rietveld method.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,430
For our discourse you will find quizzes,
exercises documents

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,310
and complimentary links,
as well as videos on the development of limestone crafts

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,080
and Clay cements else if it were.
The whole team thanks you for your participation and wish you a good time with us.
