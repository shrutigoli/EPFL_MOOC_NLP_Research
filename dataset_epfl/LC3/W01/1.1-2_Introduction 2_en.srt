1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,990
OK! So welcome back.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,600
In this second unit of this introductory module
I've called it why Portland cement.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:20,320
And what we're going to look at in this module is why
the composition of cement is as it is.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,220
Why Portland Cement? 99.99% of cement made today
is based on what we call Portland cement

5
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:34,210
or more precisely Portland Cement clinker.
So clinker is these nodules you see in the picture here

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,050
and that's the material that
comes out of the cement kiln.

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:46,880
And the name Portland this is purely a marketing name
this was chosen by Joseph Aspin who was the person who patented

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
the term Portland Cement in 1824

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:58,760
and what he wanted to do, he wanted to highlight the
appearance of his new material to Portland stone which was then

10
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:08,720
regarded as the best building material in England. So
don't worry about this word Portland it's purely a marketing term

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:17,170
So the dominance of this type of cement is really not by chance.
It's a direct consequence of the raw materials

12
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,200
which we have available on Earth.
So here on the left we see the composition of the earth's crust

13
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:29,910
and it's remarkable to see that we have just eight
elements that's to say oxygen, Silicon, Aluminium

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,950
iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium. These together
make up more of than 98% of the earth crust.

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,930
This is quite remarkable

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,540
but for those of you who may have done some astronomy
will realize that it's a direct consequence of the formation of

17
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:53,300
elements in stars.
And it also means that this is not just the composition of the earth

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,010
but we're really a similar composition for all
the rocky planets we can imagine in the universe.

19
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,740
What this means is that even elements we regard
as quite common like for example copper,

20
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:17,160
are very much less abundant than these eight
rock forming elements like for example silica.

21
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:25,880
And this relative abundance of one to a thousand
will translate in terms of the availability

22
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,240
and the cost of these materials.

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,000
So having seen in the last marginal how
very large amount of the cement that's

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:42,380
produced, clearly we can't think about making cement
out of the all the other elements that is in that remaining 2%

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:49,670
So now we can understand that the composition
of the earth which limits the practical chemistries

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,720
we can have the cementitious materials.

27
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,830
But looking on the bright side, it also means that
we can explore all possible options, it means that there's no kind of

28
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,460
breakthrough out there that
we haven't discovered there yet.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:13,000
And what we need to really know in a bit more detail is how cement
works to understand how these different elements can be used.

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,720
So this is what I've illustrated in the next few slides.
So this schematic here really tries to explain this.

31
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,340
When you mix grey cement powder with water,
what you have is grains just floating about

32
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:35,580
and that is very convenient because it means you have a
florable material, you can cast into molds you can make into

33
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:43,800
different shapes. And then we have a chemical process
whereby these gray cement grains are dissolving

34
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:53,600
and then the ions are reacting with the water to give us
this new solid wood shop called the hydrates. So in this image

35
00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:00,840
here, the red areas are the cement hydrates.
And these have a higher volume of solid

36
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,610
and therefore it holds the cement grains together.

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,280
Are creating a rigid solid.
So let's go back

38
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:14,760
and look at this composition of the earth.
Most of those elements are associated with oxygen as oxides

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,460
and look at whether these different oxides can react
to give us a cemetery material.

40
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,740
Now if we take the two
alkali oxide sodium and potassium,

41
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,440
the problem here is these produce very soluble salts.
So maybe in your chemistry lessons you've used
Now if we take the two
alkali oxide sodium and potassium,

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,110
the problem here is these produce very soluble salts.
So maybe in your chemistry lessons you've used

43
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,760
sodium hydroxide

44
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:41,920
and you'll know that you can have very strong sodium hydroxide
because a very high amount can go into solution without

45
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,720
precipitating. So clearly this is no good for producing solid
hydrates which hold the structure together.

46
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,450
On the other hand, if we look and iron oxide and magnesium oxide,

47
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,090
the problem here is that these oxide have fairly
low mobility in alkaline solutions which is the

48
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,160
solutions we have in cementitious materials.

49
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,800
So what we can see in this image
here this is just a piece of concrete taken

50
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,960
from a normal concrete wall and in this
image we have some very bright areas

51
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,930
and these very bright areas are
where all the site is located.

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:31,240
And in fact those bright areas are exactly the same as in the
original cement grains. During that whole thirty years

53
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,440
that in the cement grains has just stayed
in the same place. so it's not doing any harm

54
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,680
but basically it means it's not going out
into solution it's not precipitating new solids

55
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:50,980
and therefore making very little contribution
to the bonding and the development of strength.

56
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,010
It's a similar story for magnesium here in this picture
now we see a blended cement, we're going to talk about that in a

57
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,610
few modules time and in
this blended cement.

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,160
The darker grains such as in the center of the picture here
you see are now surrounded by a region of dark products

59
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:19,510
and these darker project products are because all the
magnesium that was in that slag grain is concentrated there in

60
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,100
that area.

61
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:28,790
And same situation this Magnesium has not moved into
the space between the grains it's not really contributed to

62
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,000
bridging the space between them.

63
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,260
So this means we end up with just three
oxides which are really the most useful
bridging the space between them.

64
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,490
So this means we end up with just three
oxides which are really the most useful

65
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:46,020
and of the essential component for the Portland cement
we have today. So this is really in no way a coincidence that

66
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:55,440
we've ended up with this composition because if we now
look at that Turnery system between calcium oxide silicon

67
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:01,110
dioxide and alumina, we see the
composition of Portland cement.

68
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:10,610
And in fact portland cement as we see it here this is
composed of calcium silicates there's really only one are the region

69
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,480
in this diagram where we have minerals that
will react with water in the way we previously saw

70
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,410
and give us cementitious materials

71
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,190
and that's this region here which is the
reason where we find calcium Aluminite cements

72
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:35,430
and calcium aluminate cements. Small amount of sulfur
is the sort of extra dimension which is not shown in this

73
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,330
diagram here.

74
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:47,150
So these other compositions calcium aluminum calcium sulfur
Aluminite, have a lot of advantage because they have less

75
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,730
calcium and you see their further away from that county oxide
corner, means they have less calcium oxide

76
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,130
and therefore there's less CO2 produced
chemically during the production of these phases.

77
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,530
so there are some. It's very good

78
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:13,130
but the problem is that it's not so easy to make
these because the raw materials we need a not so widely available.

79
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:22,210
And we have to ask the question, what sources are minerals
are there which contain much higher amounts of alumina to silica.

80
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:30,930
Most minerals have about the same ratio of silicon to
aluminum, as in Portland Cement about two to one to get a

81
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:39,150
composition down here in this alumina rich part of the
diagram we have to go to materials like bauxite.

82
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,050
Now bauxite is much more localized than
the materials used for making Portland cement.

83
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:52,020
It's estimated that only ten countries contain
about ninety percent of the reserves of bauxite

84
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,200
And of course book site is the
first real material for aluminium production

85
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,160
So the consequence of all this
means that it's rather expensive

86
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,990
and it means that you cannot produce
calcium aluminate cement

87
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,940
or calcium so for eliminate cement for the same cost
as producing Portland cement.

88
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,610
we can look at this
effect of chemical CO2

89
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,470
and how it's related to composition
in more detail on this slide here.

90
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,500
So the top we see the two
calcium silicate which

91
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,910
are present in Portland cement.
tricalciumsilicate C3S,

92
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,880
Dicalcium silicate or C2S.

93
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:46,650
And many people have proposed that what we should be
doing is making Portland cement with more C2S

94
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,460
As opposed to C3S

95
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:56,800
But the problem here is that the reduction in chemical CO2
is really very marginal. it's only around ten percent

96
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,580
and that's more than offset by the much slower
kinetics of C2S so the.

97
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,610
Strength development is much slower

98
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:12,450
and because the strength developed is much slower
This would mean that him practical situations where people need a

99
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,570
given strength at a given time
then they will use more cement

100
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:25,040
and that use the more cement will completely cancel out
this ten percent. so be like Rich thinkers really don't

101
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:35,900
contribute a tall to lowering CO2 emissions.
Down here we can see the figures for yellow might that's this complex

102
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,810
phase called C4s3s Bar

103
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:46,780
And as I said on the previous slide this has a good
reduction potential in terms of lowest chemical Co2.

104
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,370
But we have the problem of
the cost of the raw materials

105
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:59,860
and finally on this slide I want to point out this line here
because many people nowadays are proposing that we should

106
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:07,660
use magnesium based cements, there can be
context in which this might be possible not now

107
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,740
but if somebody can invent
a way of producing.

108
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:16,330
Magnesium based cements from magnesium
silicate rocks it might be interesting

109
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,530
but what's happening at the minute
Most people are using magnesium carbonate

110
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:29,750
and what you can see here very clearly is that the
chemical CO2 emissions from breakdown of magnesium carbonate all

111
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:39,250
way higher than they are from the calcium silicate phases
we have important cement. So here we come back to that

112
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,070
composition of the earth
we've discussed in detail

113
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,050
and we compare it with the composition
of a typical Portland cement.

114
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:54,530
And you can see the elements present are similar.
The big difference between the Portland cement

115
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:03,390
and the composition of the earth is the dominance
of this sector for cousine. And this is as we explained

116
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,100
In the last lecture where the
chemical CO2 is coming from

117
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:15,740
but from a practical point of view it's very easy to make
things with this composition because limestone which is

118
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,290
usually very pure Calcium carbonate is very
widely distributed across the globe

119
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:28,170
and it could mean that you can make these poor has cement
out of limestone the other elements are generally coming from

120
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,230
something like clay, but you can make
this almost everywhere in the world

121
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:42,960
and therefore transportation of the final product is minimise.
So the other important aspect is the passage of reaction

122
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,830
of the Portland cement

123
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:52,840
and this is shown in this diagram here which puts
the heat evolution, which is a signature of the rate of reaction.

124
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,130
And what we can see is if the beginning of the
reaction we have we have a burst of reaction

125
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:07,110
and then we have this period here where the reaction remains
slow for several hours. For a practical point of view this

126
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,390
is extremely important as it gives us time to
mix the cement and transported to the building site.

127
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:22,700
And then after about three hours the reaction takes off again.
Now this pattern of reaction means that it's very

128
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:31,100
very simple to use cementitious materials. Here we see
a picture from India where people are making concrete under

129
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,140
really quite rustic conditions.

130
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:41,380
But nevertheless because it's such a robust chemical reaction
it still works is still gives very good quality building materials.

131
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:49,010
Really well we're going to see that for all these
reasons I have explained to you here cement space on

132
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:56,390
Portland clinker will be the most important materials
for the forseeable future. They can be made from widely available

133
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,610
road materials. There's an incredible economy of
scale leading to very low cost and they're very.

134
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,970
Easy to use even by unskilled workers.

135
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:14,450
Given the composition of the earth, this composition
Portland Cement clinker really is the best option

136
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:22,500
but in the next lecture, What are we going to see
how by replacing part of this Portland cement we can lower

137
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,250
environmental impact.
So thank you very much.
