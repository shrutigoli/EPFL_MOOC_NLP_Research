1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:00,730
In 2012

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,650
four billion tons of cement were produced worldwide.
This makes concrete the product most consumed by humans.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,170
Compared to many other materials,
producing cement is very ecological

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:18,940
But with several billion often produced each year, the cement
industry become a major contributor to global CO2 emissions.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,000
To reduce its impact we constituted a part
of cement by supplementary cementitious materials.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,300
Our new course, cement chemistry and sustainable construction materials,

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,610
will introduce you using lecture
and tutorials about the cement hydration

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,220
and how to develop and
characterized the carbon cement.

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:42,240
This course will be divided into two major phases.
The cement chemistry during the first four weeks.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,740
Then the last two weeks will focus on the use of
X. Ray diffraction for the analysis of the carbon cements.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,410
Professor Scrivener and her team;
and Dr Snellings, researcher at VITO, hope to find all you there.
