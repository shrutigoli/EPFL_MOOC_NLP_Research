00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:11,170
So welcome to the third video in this introductory module series.
In this module, we're going to talk about how we

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:20,250
can know the environmental impact of cemetitious materials by
replacing part of the Portland cement clinker with other cementitious materials.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,890
So classically, cement has been clinke
which is ground with a small addition of calcium sulphate

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:36,590
normally referred to as gypsum to produce cement.
And this is what we call only Portland Cement O.P.C.

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,200
or Plain portland cement.

6
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,610
If the Years ago this made up
practically all the cement produced

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:54,260
but nowadays the vast majority of cement produced also contain
what are known as supplementary cementitious materials or SCMs

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:02,600
Now what are these SCMs?
Some examples are limestone which comes from the quarry.

9
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:12,060
Fly ash which comes from burning coal to produce electricity
slag which comes from blast furnaces where iron ore is

10
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:21,250
is reduced iron and natural porcelains which
are found in nature and finally calcine clays.

11
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,800
Now these are often bright
products a waste from other industry

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:35,890
and their availability well vary considerably from place to place.
If we look at the overall level of substitution of

13
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,530
S.C.M.

14
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,710
Since immense around the world, we can see in this graph
here that just three materials make up the overwhelming

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,830
majority of the substitutes.
Namely; limestone slag and fly ash

16
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:59,870
Secondly we can see that while a few years ago
the level of substitution was increasing, for the last five

17
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,010
or six years it's remained almost static.

18
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:10,820
Now before we look at the reasons for this let's
look at these different S.E.'s in a bit more detail.

19
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:20,390
So first we have limestone. This comes through from the
same quarry where limestone is excavated for produce in the clinker,

20
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:28,990
but the important thing here is passage doesn't pass through
the kiln it doesn't lose it CO2. It's typically into ground

21
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,900
where the cement during milling

22
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,330
and we find that if we have small levels of addition up
to about five percent it actually enhances the properties

23
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,540
and this is due to the fact that a small amount
of the limestone does react with the illuminated feigns

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,910
and also because the fine lines the particles, enhances
the nucleation of the C.S.H. and Give a denser microstructure.

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:59,640
Now we don't actually need to use high quality
limestone, although this is often required in standards.

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,790
The second material is blasphemy slag.
Schematic here shows that we have iron

27
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,810
which comes from the iron ore

28
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:20,240
and slag is the material which is used to help
the separation of the iron from the impurities in the iron ore.

29
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:27,000
This material is liquid during in
the blast furnace and then is poured off.

30
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:34,980
And depending on the cooling, we can either have
crystalline material which really can only be used as aggregate.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,720
Which is actual slag we can also make expand
this flag which can be used as lightweight aggregate

32
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:49,750
but what we're really interested in is when we
quench this slag which one is what is known as granulation,

33
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,040
and by this very fast cooling with water,
then we produce amorphous phases

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,640
and these amorphous phases can then
dissolve in water and react like the cement grains.

35
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:11,830
And here we see a picture of the slag, we can see these
angular grains. They're made up about 90% percent or more of them

36
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,110
or amorphous material.
And then this is ground

37
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:24,680
And the break up of this glass gives these sharp irregular
glassy materials. It has a very high calcium oxide

38
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:25,380
content

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:35,310
and produces what is called a latent hydraulic material.
Because of the high couse in content then we can replace very

40
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:43,310
high amounts of clinker in cement chipper called
replacement levels are in the range from 30-70% percent.

41
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:53,290
The problem with slag is that the growth in availability of
Slag has been not as fast as the growth in availability of cement.

42
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:01,710
So at present the annual production of Slag is only
around eight percent of the production of clinker

43
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,470
and this proportion is unlikely to increase
because we're producing more or more iron

44
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,720
and steel from recycled materials

45
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,100
and this means there's less
slag available from blast furnace.

46
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,000
Next we move to fly ash

47
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:26,270
and as I've said, this is the installable incombustible
material which is in the coal. What happens is during the

48
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:34,130
burning of the coal little droplets of water form,
these droplets then are carried in the flue gas

49
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:43,560
and subsequently recovered by electrostatic precipitation
to avoid their dispersion into the atmosphere.

50
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,300
Now because they are very small,
they cooled quite quickly

51
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,070
and this quick cooling again leads
to the formation of amorphous glassy material

52
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,780
So we have much lower proportion of amorphous
material. We typically find the that the core of these

53
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,810
grains is crystalline, because of this reason and the
chemical composition where it contains less cow C.M.

54
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,960
This is less reactive and slag

55
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,610
and the typical levels of addition we
can make up to around thirty percent.
Now the other problem with fly ash is that

56
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:24,730
it's a very heterogeneous material. In this micrographs
here we can see the different grade levels indicate the

57
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:32,410
different chemical composition and on the right
here we've made a chemical mapping of that fly ash

58
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,470
and the different colors indicate different chemical
compositions. So what you can really see is that the chemical

59
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:50,670
composition varies considerably from place to place and
this makes it quite tricky to determine how fly ash is react

60
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,510
and means of one fly ash can behave quite differently from another fly ash.

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
So in this series of slides, we can look at

62
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:07,570
the availability of these SCMs compared to Portland Cement.
So this red bar shows the amount of Portland cement produced

63
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,750
in the world today, just over four billion tonnes.

64
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:20,490
And if we look at these common replacement materials; slag
and fly ash, we see that there are the amounts available much

65
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,660
lower than the amount of Portland cement.

66
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,350
So we have about eight percent
compared to portland cement.

67
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:36,990
and the vast majority of this is already used either
blended with cement or idea of the concrete stage.

68
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:45,360
When we come to fly ash overall we have a somewhat higher
amount. Because of that variability, the amount that can be

69
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:47,840
used with cement
is quite a bit lower

70
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:56,350
and these two materials together make up only around fifteen
percent of the amount of Portland cement produced today.

71
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:03,710
Now people have looked for other materials
that can be blended in. The other material we have is.

72
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:10,900
Limestone we've talked about earlier and
there's effectively a limited amount of this material available.

73
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,900
But the problem is that we can't have very high
amounts without diluting the properties of the cement.

74
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,720
And generally if we have additions above
about ten percent or so then the strength

75
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:33,200
and other properties of the cement tends to decrease.
Now people have looked at other materials to uses S C M's which we

76
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,400
see now here on the top.
We see natural pozzolan land.

77
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,580
The amount used today are really quite small.
This could perhaps be increased,

78
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:52,050
but nevertheless geographically the
distribution of natural pozzolan is very uneven.

79
00:08:52,790 --> 00:09:01,570
People have considered vegetable ashes, so notably,
the ash produced by burning ash husks can be an active

80
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,180
addition cementitious materials.

81
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,230
But the amounts of available
are really quite small

82
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:17,000
and there are a lot of other problems with these vegetable
ashes such that they're only produced seasonally, they are

83
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:22,920
produced tend to be produced in rural areas where
the big demand for cement is in urban areas

84
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,270
and currently many of these.

85
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,800
Agricultural waste are used as fertilizers So if they're
taken off the land, they may lead to a problem of soil

86
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,560
fertility.

87
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,140
People have talked about waste glass, but really we see
that the amounts of this a very very small

88
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,880
and of course it's much much better to
recycle waste class into new bottles.

89
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:55,450
And finally of course silica few which is a very high
performance additive widely used to produce high performance

90
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,710
concrete but the amount available
are really very very small.

91
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,710
So what else can we have?
Now what we really.

92
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:10,140
The see is this is only one material that's
available in the kind of quantities we really need

93
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:18,390
and this is calcine clay. And the amounts of
calcine clay really are virtually unlimited.

94
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:28,650
So to summarize that, what we see is that there's
no magic solution. Blended cements with S C M's will be the best

95
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:34,650
solution for sustainable for cement for the forseeable future. The traditional S.C.M.S.

96
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,800
We have are only about fifteen percent
compared to the amount of cement we produce

97
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:46,390
and the only material available in viable
quantities apart from these is calcine clay.

98
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:55,370
And even more interesting, is the use of combination of calcine
clay with limestone which will talk about in another

99
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,680
video of this module.

100
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:05,510
So this material, this material with the combination of
calcine clay and limestone is what we call limestone calcine clay cement

101
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,810
or L C three.

102
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,300
So before summarizing this, I just want to say a short
word about Alkali activated materials or Geopolymers

103
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,300
The low availability of slag is the main reason
why alkaline activated materials will not contribute

104
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:30,330
significantly to lowering global CO2 emissions.
All the formulations of alkali activated materials

105
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,360
contained to today, contain mainly slag

106
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:42,040
And as we've seen the availability of slag is really very low.
So I slag is diverted from used in cement plants

107
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,140
and concrete and.

108
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,480
To be used in alkali activated materials, but we may be able
to say that these that these alkali activated materials have a

109
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,910
lower CO2 emissions, but globally the
emissions of other concrete will increase

110
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,680
and in fact what we need to consider is
also the CO2 emissions of the alkali activator.

111
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,670
And for these two reasons, the CO2
emissions may be increased at a global level.

112
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:18,820
And in fact there are very few countries which have
really abundant supplies a slag which would favor the use of alkali

113
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:27,410
activated materials, so one exception in this case is Japan.
OK So let's summarize what we've seen in this lecture.

114
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:34,080
In this lecture we've seen that supplementary seven
tissues materials are an effective way to reduce the amount of

115
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,160
clinker in cement or in concrete

116
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,380
and hence to reduce CO2 emissions. Over the past few
decades, the average level of substitution has increased to

117
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:49,910
around twenty percent and this is made
up mainly of slag, fly ash and limestone.

118
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:57,660
Further progress in this respect is mainly
limited by the availability of these SCMs

119
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:05,960
and this limited availability is also the main reason that
alkali activated materials cannot have really significant

120
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,490
impact on lowering overall emissions
from cementitious materials.

121
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,890
What we have seen is only other material
available in the kind of quantities we need

122
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,460
is clay which is active when Calcined
and this is particularly interesting

123
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:34,310
when used in combination of limestone. So in the next lecture
we're going to look in detail at the use of calcine clays for

124
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,890
cement and concrete.
So thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
