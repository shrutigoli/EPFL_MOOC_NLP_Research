In 2012 four billion tons of cement were produced worldwide.
This makes concrete the product most consumed by humans.
Compared to many other materials, producing cement is very ecological
But with several billion often produced each year, the cement industry become a major contributor to global CO2 emissions.
To reduce its impact we constituted a part of cement by supplementary cementitious materials.
Our new course, cement chemistry and sustainable construction materials, will introduce you using lecture and tutorials about the cement hydration and how to develop and characterized the carbon cement.
This course will be divided into two major phases.
The cement chemistry during the first four weeks.
Then the last two weeks will focus on the use of
X. Ray diffraction for the analysis of the carbon cements.
Professor Scrivener and her team; and Dr Snellings, researcher at VITO, hope to find all you there.
