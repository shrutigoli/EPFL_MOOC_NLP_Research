1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:12,440
So welcome to video number four in this introductory module.
And in this video we're going to talk about LC3

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:19,000
or limestone calcine clay cement.
So what is limestone calcine cement?

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:32,230
This is a family of cements and often we talk of LC-350 or LC-365.
The figure in this case refers to the clinker content.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:42,490
So here we see on the left, we see the composition of
ordinary portland cement where we have about 95% clinker,

5
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,790
or 5% of calcium suphate or gypsum.

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:58,680
When we have typical portland pozzolanic cements as shown here,
we will have about 70% clinker and about 30% pozzolan,

7
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,450
which can be typically something like
fly ash but can also be calcine clay.

8
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:15,980
And usually because of the reactivity of these pozzolanic additions,
30% is the highest level of addition we find in practice.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,500
However, what is very special about the LC3 family,
is now instead of adding calcine clay on it's own,

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,800
we add calcine clay
together with limestone.

11
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:38,110
And what we find is that we can add an extra 15% of limestone,
we can remove 15% more of the clinker,

12
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,540
and we can get the same performance
as in the pozzolanic case here.

13
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:57,430
So on the right here we see some strengthened results for LC350. You see that
one day the strenght is somewhat lower and it was for the ordinary portland cement,

14
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:07,090
But already by only 7 days, the strenght of the LC-350
system has surpassed that of the ordinary portland cement

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,170
and it is still higher at 28 days.

16
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:19,840
So this quite remarkable because it means that
for only 50% of the clinker, we have the same performance.

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,730
This also means we have about 30% less CO2.
We get just as I said similar strenght.

18
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:37,790
And in some respect, we have quite a big improvement in the properties,
particularly in respect to chloride penetration and Alkali siica reaction.

19
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,120
So in this module, what we are going to
talk about is what types of clays can be used

20
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,200
how they can be calcined

21
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,130
and where we can find the kind of
suitable clays in the world today.

22
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,420
So what we see in this slide here are
the crystal structure of the basic clay types.

23
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,020
They are all clays' layer structures so here we see
the layers and these layers are alluminosilicate layers.

24
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:14,130
So we see the orange dots represent the silicon
atoms which are found in little tetrahedra.

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:25,400
So in a little cage of oxygens. And the green atoms
represent aluminium, which are found in octahedral cages of oxygen.

26
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:35,830
Now two materials on the left here, the
Illites and the montmorillonite are called 2-1 clays.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,870
What these means is that we have two silicate layers here,
and here we have sandwiched the aliminium layer in the middle.

28
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:52,700
And the diference between Illites and the montmorillonite,
is in terms of the irons that are found between the layers

29
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:00,560
and the montmorillonite usually has
alkali ions and more water between the layers.

30
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:10,630
And finally on the right here, we have the kaolinite structure,
and the kaolinitic clays are what is called 1:1 clays

31
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,580
And this means in the layers we have on
layer of silicate and one layer of aluminate.

32
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,470
In this slide here, what we see is the thermal
decomposition of the different clay types.

33
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,370
And that these have a thermal
decomposition in different ranges.

34
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,620
And what these peaks represent? They represent the amount of
heat that is absorbed by the material as it is heated up

35
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,590
And this heat is absorbed due to the loss of hydroxide
from the structure which is called dehydroxilation.

36
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,900
And we can see that these different clay types
have dehydroxilation in different temperature range.

37
00:04:50,700 --> 00:05:01,480
The clearest dehydroxilation is this one here for the
kaolinite which occurs between about 450 and 650 degrees.

38
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:13,580
And this signature provides a very good way of determining
how many kaolinite we have in any clay we have to investigate.

39
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,070
All you do is to make this
kind of thermal decomposition

40
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,500
You can simply quite do it by heating
your material in two different ovens

41
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,960
one of the ovens is
400 and the other 700

42
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,500
looking at the weight loss
between these two temperatures.

43
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:38,970
Of course as you can see there will be a small
interference if you also have some highlight in the example.

44
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:47,430
But these kinds of effects can be determined
by looking at something like a Xray difraction diagram.

45
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,440
If we look at the electromicrograph,
we can see this layered clay structure,

46
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:01,290
we can see that the clay are made up of little platelets.
Here we see the raw clay before dehydroxilation,

47
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:11,900
here we see the clay after dehydroxilation, basically this level in the SCM
you dont see any change in the morphology, it appears to be very similar.

48
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,230
We have to use other techniques to really see
what's happening within the crystal structure.

49
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,710
and particularly useful in
this regard is solid state NMR

50
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:30,080
when we study 27 aluminium ion.
So nuclear magnetic resonance or N.M.R.

51
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:37,300
Is a technique that can be used to look at the
local environment of a particular species.

52
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,560
So we see for the two two to one clays, Illite to
montmorillonite that as we heat these materials, we get a

53
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:55,210
transition of the aluminium from the octahedral coordination
in the wall clay. Octahedron has six a pair apexes

54
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:04,740
So this is also called a six coordination to a
tetrahedral coordination or a four fold coordination.

55
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:14,500
What is quite clearly different in the Kaolinitic Clays
is that as well as the shift from octahedral coordination to

56
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:24,840
tetrahedral coordination, we see quite clearly the emergence
of this five fold coordinated site. and this five fold

57
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,500
coordinated site is the
indicative of a disordered

58
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,450
or semi amorphous sight, which is what
means that it's easier for it for react.

59
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,250
so this is a very important difference between
that happens in thermal decomposition between the two to one clays

60
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,790
and the one to one kaolinitic clays.
The one to one

61
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,070
kaolinitic Clays had this disordered
Aluminium which is then the

62
00:07:52,330 --> 00:08:00,190
atoms that can go on and react without cementitious materials.
Here we see the appearance of these

63
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:07,470
calcined clays depending on the other materials
that are present in the clay, the color of the clay can change over the whole

64
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:14,600
spectrum from white to reddish
If there's a lot of iron oxides present.

65
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,430
You can actually control the color of
that comes out in the end by the

66
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:28,900
conditions of oxidation reduction in the kiln.
OK in this slide here, what we see is the pozzolanic reaction all of

67
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:38,130
these different clay types in cement. So the
pozzolanic reaction basically involves the reaction of the pozzolan

68
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,020
and the calcine clay in this case with
calcium hydroxide that comes from the cement.

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,030
And these different this code here,
K stands for Kaolinitic, I stands for Illitic,

70
00:08:51,230 --> 00:09:00,500
M for montmorillonite clays. And as references
we've got the plain O.P.C. and The plain O.P.C.

71
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,050
With us than in the filler
which in this case was course.

72
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:14,290
So we can see how the different clays react by looking at
their consumption of calcium hydroxide relative to the amount.

73
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,720
of the cement, the
clinker based cement O.P.C.So we can see how the different clays 
react by looking at their consumption of calcium hydroxide relative to the amount.

74
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:27,390
And in most cases, we see that the amount of calcined
hydroxide produced is actually somewhat higher than the reference

75
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,730
which is this curve in black,
which is the plain importance cement.

76
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:39,990
And the amount of calcium hydroxide is somewhat higher
purely due to a filler effect as in this gray curve here, where

77
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:47,900
the fact that you have a dilution of the cement by
the clay gives a bit more room for the cement to react so it

78
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,040
produces a bit more calcium hydroxide.

79
00:09:51,450 --> 00:10:00,210
In sharp contrast, we see the kaolinitic clays here
we have much lower cousine hydroxide contents this cast some

80
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,120
hydroxide content becomes lower
with time and this is a typical

81
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,960
signature of the pozzolanic
reaction of the calcined clay.

82
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:20,970
Even in very early ages we can see the calcium hydroxide
content is very much reduced compared to the Portland cement reference.

83
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:30,650
Finally we perhaps want to look at this montmorillonite
clay here wish does seem to show some reaction at later ages.

84
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:39,980
What should be the optimum temperature for the calcination.
In this graph, here we see for a particular clay

85
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:50,830
that has been calcined at different temperatures
how the strength there is over time. So the different temperatures

86
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:59,340
we've used are the plain raw Clay with
no calcination at all. 600,700,750,800

87
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,880
850

88
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:10,260
And the raw clay, it's just reacting as a filler
So you see the strength development is really quite poor. The calcined

89
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:18,870
clays even from three days are giving a very significant
increase which is indicative of their reaction.

90
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:28,020
And we see by seven days that for this particular clay
which contained about forty percent kaolinite

91
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:37,020
If for the optimum calcination temperatures,
this strength is supporting that of the Portland cement. We see the

92
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:44,360
strength is increasing from six hundred to seven
hundred to seven fifty. Eight hundred is about the same

93
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,980
and by the time we get to eight fifty then we see in
this particular case the strength is going down.

94
00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:00,760
And this is what we have observed in most cases that
the optimum calcination temperature is in this range seven fifty

95
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:08,160
to eight hundred. It may be somewhat lower
if you have small content of calcite in the Clay.

96
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,810
Instead of having to do
this series of strength tests,

97
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,120
What we see on the right is the results of a
reactivity test which we'll talk about later in the

98
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:29,980
series and here we can use much smaller amounts of
clay and study the heat evolution in what's called a calorimeter

99
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:40,680
but we can see the same trend, we can see the raw
material has no reactivity, at six hundred we get modest reaction

100
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,800
this increases through

101
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Seven hundred, seven fifty, eight hundred

102
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,390
and then by eight fifty there's a clear decrease in reactivity.
Now why do we have this decrease in reactivity? we can

103
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:04,010
see that in this series here, this is the clay calcined to
six hundred. We can see these are grown roots of these tiny

104
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:11,560
clay platelets.
Again we can see these are
glommerates at eight hundred and now

105
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:18,980
when we go to higher temperatures in this case
we've gone right up to 925, we now can see that we

106
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,350
no longer see the individual
platelets but we see these kind of.

107
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,600
glassy looking glass grains

108
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:35,250
and what's happened is we've had a small amount of liquid phase
forming which actually syntax these clay particles together

109
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:42,470
And if we have this happening, then we'll
get a very strong decrease in reactivity.

110
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:52,080
So the critical question now is what grade of clay do
we need to be able to make these L.C. Three materials?

111
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:02,680
So at EPFL here, we've started a wide range of clays from
around the world. These clays had different origins, some came from

112
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:11,380
Latin America some from India or other parts of
Asia except for even from Europe and the finest of this clay

113
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:20,320
by the production method of the clay the different the
minor phases that were present in addition to clay, all of these

114
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,880
very quite widely between the different materials.

115
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,750
But we have calcined all of these
if they weren't calcined, we'll calcine these clays

116
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:39,420
and then we use them in the LC350 system and
measure their strength in the European mortar walk test.

117
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:50,370
And what we see quite clearly here is that we get a very
clear correlation between the calcined kaolinite content that's

118
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:58,090
the amount of Kaoline which was in the original clay
that had been broken down during the calcination, between the

119
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,060
calcined kaolinite content.

120
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:07,940
And the compressive strength development, so we have different
curves here for the different ages for one day for seven

121
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:13,860
days three days, for seven days
twenty eight days, ninety days.

122
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:23,580
And in addition to this strong correlation with the
calcined kaolinite content, we've indicated here by this dotted line,

123
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:32,330
we've indicated the reference strength of the prime
Portland cement. So you can see the three days if you have a

124
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:42,370
kaolinite content of over eighty percent, you can meet the
same strength as your ordinary portland cement. Whereas if you're prepared

125
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,490
to wait a bit longer to about seven days then if
you have a kaolinite content of between forty

126
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,280
and fifty percent, you will get a similar
strength to your ordinary Portland cement.

127
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,610
So this is very important
because it means for this LC3

128
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:08,190
system, we don't need to use very high purity clays.
High purity clays notably used to produce Mehtakaoline have to

129
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,550
have very strong requirements for
color for purity except.

130
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:19,160
Which makes them very expensive where is these kind of clays
which contain much lower amounts of kaolinite only

131
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:26,070
say forty fifty percent are generally waste
materials which are consequently much cheaper.

132
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:33,590
So the kind of clays we want to use are very
widely distributed around the Earth.

133
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:43,160
And this is a Soil Map which gives an indication of
what kind of clays you're likely to find below the surface

134
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,160
and it's a rather simplistic.

135
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,510
Representation

136
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,570
but we can be quite sure that in all the regions where
we have this yellow color or this pink color there we will

137
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,260
certainly have abundance in clays

138
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:07,450
and we see that this is really very very widely available
in the central equitorial subtropical region going through

139
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:12,200
China Southeast Asia, India, Africa and Latin America

140
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:21,480
And in fact we've seen in India where we've might made
much more detailed studies that suitable clays are not confined

141
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,620
only to these yellow and pink regions

142
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:31,590
but we actually have very large amounts of suitable
clays for example in this region of India in Gujarat chain

143
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,600
registers on which on this soil map will appear

144
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:44,940
or not to be so suitable. So What's the main message
here, they say kind of clays we need are incredibly abundant

145
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:52,170
throughout the world the reserves are virtually unlimited.
These are just the countries in the equitorial subtropical

146
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,480
regions where the growth and
demand for cement is strongest.

147
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:04,680
And in many of these countries, what we can find is that
the suitable clothes are currently stockpiled as waste.

148
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,500
So this picture comes from a quarry in India.
This is a quarry where there extracting high purity clay for

149
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,920
producing Metakaoline which is then used
for ceramics or in the paper industry

150
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:27,160
and this huge mountain here is just waste. This is material
which has too low quality for exploitation at the present

151
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:34,630
time, but this waste here is a very suitable quality for blending with cement.

152
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:43,100
And we've taken those kind of waste materials,
we've made full scale trial productions. This just shows a couple of

153
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:51,140
houses produced from these productions. This one in Cuba
here. This one in India all the materials the

154
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:59,960
Concrete blocks, the render here the roof tiles etc,
These are all produced with LC3 material

155
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:07,080
and they were actually produced they could be produced by
totally unskilled workers in the same factories with those

156
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,310
special training, just purely with a
one to one replacement, taking one back of the

157
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,310
Cement that was used before either O.P.C.

158
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,930
or Pozzolanic cement with fly ash
and replacing that with LC3.

159
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,960
And in this case in India we made a more
detailed calculation of the CO2 savings

160
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,690
and we could calculate that about seven tons of CO2
were saved just in this one single house by using LC3

161
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,370
materials compared to the existing materials.
So let's look at what we've seen in this module.

162
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:50,970
What we've seen is how we can use a combination of
calcined clay with limestones to go to much higher levels of

163
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,970
substitution than is typical iin pozzolanic cements.
We've seen that it's really the kaolinitic which have

164
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,850
the potential to give these high pozzolanic
activity after calcination.

165
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,550
And this high positronic activity results from their
one to one structure which means we get poorly

166
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,640
Organized alumina after calcination.

167
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,830
The optimum temperature for calculation is in this range
seven fifty eight fifty. If we go to higher temperatures then

168
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:32,490
we may get centering a loss of surface and reactivity.
If we look at the performance in

169
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,240
Mortars

170
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:41,960
and concretes we see that if we've got more than about
forty percent Kaoline this can be very suitable for use in LC3

171
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,860
blends, even in our mix system you can
get a similar strength after about seven days

172
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:54,760
and we're sure you could get even better
earlier strength by optimizing the grinding parameters.

173
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,990
These kind of clays with forty percent

174
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,720
or more kaolinite are very widely available around the
world particularly in the regions where the growth in the

175
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:10,410
demand cement is highest.
And we've made trial productions of L.C.

176
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,180
Three in both Cuba and India.

177
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,730
So that this short video completes the introductory model.
I hope that you will be interested to come back

178
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,430
and listen to the module on hydration which follows this.
