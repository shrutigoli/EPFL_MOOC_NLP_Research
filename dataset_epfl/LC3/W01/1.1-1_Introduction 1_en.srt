00:00:04,10 --> 00:00:09,53
So hello and welcome to this series on cement 
chemistry for sustainable cementitious materials

2
00:00:10,45 --> 00:00:11,95
In this series of Modules, we're

3
00:00:11,96 --> 00:00:14,53
going to look at the cement chemistry

4
00:00:14,54 --> 00:00:20,26
and how this helps us to understand the 
sustainability of these very important to materials. 

5
00:00:21,07 --> 00:00:28,77
Most of the modules should be really understandable to 
anybody with a fairly basic knowledge of high school chemistry.

6
00:00:29,94 --> 00:00:36,23
In the first module, we're going 
o look at the overall context.

7
00:00:37,30 --> 00:00:45,71
We're going to look at the role of cementitious material 
in the world today and what are the origins of their CO2 footprint.

8
00:00:46,38 --> 00:00:53,70
Now in this first slide, 
we can see the overwhelming dominance of cementitious materials

9
00:00:54,25 --> 00:01:00,48
They make up between thirty to fifty 
percent of everything we produce. Probably about fifty percent

10
00:01:00,49 --> 00:01:05,46
of solid materials and thirty percent 
if we include things like fossil fuels.

11
00:01:05,95 --> 00:01:13,45
And in the light of that the fact that they're responsible 
for CO2 emissions of around five to ten percent is a

12
00:01:13,46 --> 00:01:14,21
very good

13
00:01:15,39 --> 00:01:16,16
Ratio.

14
00:01:16,94 --> 00:01:27,09
But more importantly, we can really see that this just 
would no way be possible to replace cementitious materials

15
00:01:27,18 --> 00:01:35,05
with alternatives at any meaningful level. 
For example, if we look at the amount of wood produced worldwide, this is

16
00:01:35,06 --> 00:01:39,02
between ten and fifteen percent the 
amount of cementitious materials

17
00:01:39,49 --> 00:01:47,33
and already it's estimated that this amount of wood is beyond 
the limits of sustainability that's to say we're cutting

18
00:01:47,34 --> 00:01:52,90
down more trees than we're planting. 
So while this may be a nice option in Europe

19
00:01:52,91 --> 00:01:59,83
or North America, it's really not practical for the 
many people who need to be housed in countries like China, India,

20
00:01:59,87 --> 00:02:02,35
Africa and South America. 

21
00:02:03,50 --> 00:02:10,63
This slide here really shows how the 
environmental footprint of concrete is very low

22
00:02:10,64 --> 00:02:17,00
and we should talk about concrete because concrete 
is the final material we really use. Cement is the precursor

23
00:02:17,27 --> 00:02:20,64
and that's roughly about 
ten percent of cement in concrete. 


00:02:21,00 --> 00:02:25,68
On the right here I've 
normalised these figures compared to

24
00:02:25,75 --> 00:02:33,37
the highest which is Alluminium. You can 
see very vividly just how much energy

25
00:02:33,41 --> 00:02:36,59
and CO2 you can save 
by recycling alluminium

26
00:02:36,63 --> 00:02:40,25
and I hope after seeing this you don't 
throw your coke can in the bin anymore.

27
00:02:41,24 --> 00:02:47,59
But concrete is really extremely low, 
lower than almost all other materials. 


00:02:48,75 --> 00:02:49,50
Of course this is 
just on a weight

28
00:02:49,60 --> 00:02:55,88
basis. When you put this into a structure, it becomes 
more complicated. We're not going to go into that here.

29
00:02:56,05 --> 00:03:06,58
But generally, even in that situation concrete still 
comes out very strongly as an environmentally friendly material. 

30
00:03:06,81 --> 00:03:14,63
The amount of cement we're using has increased 
very very dramatically in the past few decades. 

31
00:03:14,64 --> 00:03:22,38
since 1950, the population has increased about three fold 
and at the same period the amount of cement we use has

32
00:03:22,39 --> 00:03:24,69
increased by about thirty four times. 


00:03:25,29 --> 00:03:30,36
In recent decades this is really being 
driven by the development in China

33
00:03:31,24 --> 00:03:37,98
and we should not view this negatively because, this development 
has lifted a lot of people out of poverty. It's provided

34
00:03:37,99 --> 00:03:43,73
them with decent homes, with roads, railways 
to get around and everything like that.

35
00:03:44,06 --> 00:03:51,63
But we certainly cannot imagine that this growth in 
demand for cement is going to slow down because there are many many

36
00:03:51,69 --> 00:03:56,35
other parts of the world where people still haven't have decent housing

37
00:03:56,39 --> 00:04:03,73
or transportation systems. 
Finally where we do with our lives and the CO2 produced

38
00:04:03,91 --> 00:04:05,57
is a question of choices.

39
00:04:06,22 --> 00:04:13,76
And here again if we decide to build a house, 
we make maybe a house for a family of three people, 

40
00:04:14,08 --> 00:04:17,31
This will typically take about
ten to twenty tons of cement

41
00:04:17,59 --> 00:04:25,38
and last for about fifty years. So we can calculate 
from that that the CO2 to do with your materials in your house

42
00:04:25,68 --> 00:04:27,87
is about twelve kilograms a month. 


00:04:28,67 --> 00:04:34,20
Now if you're driving a car which you 
almost certainly are that same family of three

43
00:04:34,42 --> 00:04:38,93
will probably drive at least 
ten thousand kilometers a year

44
00:04:39,24 --> 00:04:46,66
and then they'll be consuming fossil fuels which will 
be producing about ninety kilograms of CO2 per year.

45
00:04:46,67 --> 00:04:50,74
Seven or eight times more than 
the materials in their house.

46
00:04:51,01 --> 00:04:56,28
But we should also reflect on our other choices 
in life for example the food we eat.


00:04:56,59 --> 00:04:58,90
Here you can see for a very meat

47
00:04:59,09 --> 00:05:07,80
intensive diet the associated CO2 production would 
be around five to seven kilograms of CO2 per day.

48
00:05:08,07 --> 00:05:14,19
Whereas a vegetarian diet is much lower at around 
three to four kilograms the CO2 it per day

49
00:05:14,89 --> 00:05:22,26
And so if we calculate for the same imaginary 
family of three that they went from eating meat to being vegetarian,

50
00:05:22,53 --> 00:05:23,52
maybe for just two

51
00:05:23,53 --> 00:05:29,57
or three days a month, this would be equivalent to saving 
all the CO2 that they need to build their house. 

52
00:05:30,58 --> 00:05:37,22
So rather than just blaming the producers of these materials, 
we have to think about what we're doing in our lives

53
00:05:37,36 --> 00:05:40,41
and what we choose 
to do that produces CO2. 


00:05:41,18 --> 00:05:45,70
OK there's no reason for complacency 
because if we did nothing about the

54
00:05:46,71 --> 00:05:51,25
CO2 footprint of cementitious materials, 
we could end up in a situation like this. 


00:05:52,11 --> 00:05:55,47
here we see the blue line is the

55
00:05:55,56 --> 00:06:03,73
trajectory that has been estimated we 
should try to meet if we're to restrict global warming to.

56
00:06:04,18 --> 00:06:09,48
There's two degrees temperature rise. 
Whether we're going to do that or not is another question,

57
00:06:09,72 --> 00:06:14,56
but that the trajectory of overall global 
emissions if we're going to do that.

58
00:06:15,68 --> 00:06:22,99
If we achieve that blue line and we did nothing about cement, 
then the emissions from the production of cement

59
00:06:23,00 --> 00:06:25,92
and some tissues materials 
will form of the red line.

60
00:06:26,45 --> 00:06:33,81
And we see the by 2050 we would end up in a situation
where cementitious materials would be responsible for

61
00:06:33,82 --> 00:06:39,13
something like thirty percent of world C O two emissions, 
which is clearly unacceptable. 


00:06:39,70 --> 00:06:42,78
So where is the consumption 
of cement taking place?

62
00:06:43,37 --> 00:06:48,13
What we see here is the distribution 
of cement we use around the world.

63
00:06:48,64 --> 00:06:53,92
And only about ten percent of cement 
used is taking place in O.E.C.D.

64
00:06:53,93 --> 00:06:54,64
Countries

65
00:06:55,09 --> 00:07:02,75
And in these countries, it's forecast that demand will 
really stay pretty much constant. More than ninety percent of

66
00:07:02,76 --> 00:07:10,72
consumption is taking part in the developing world, particularly 
in China which has been very dominant over the past two

67
00:07:10,73 --> 00:07:17,92
decades. It's been estimated in the last three 
years China produced more concrete than was produced in the whole of

68
00:07:17,93 --> 00:07:19,98
North America in the twentieth century.

69
00:07:20,93 --> 00:07:29,61
And many other countries like India in particular, 
are looking to follow this development path to provide decent houses

70
00:07:29,77 --> 00:07:33,80
for their people, decent rail systems 
and decent road systems.

71
00:07:34,73 --> 00:07:42,34
And this will inevitably mean that the growth in use of 
cement is going to increase. So if we're going to meet this

72
00:07:42,35 --> 00:07:49,39
challenge of the growing demand for cement, we need 
solutions where first of all practical they can be used by

73
00:07:49,87 --> 00:07:51,09
unskilled workers

74
00:07:51,10 --> 00:07:58,91
and this shows you the kind of typical situation 
you can have for mixing concrete examples from India

75
00:07:59,41 --> 00:08:03,73
and also economically. 
Now you know cement is an incredibly cheap

76
00:08:03,79 --> 00:08:10,48
in most of Europe, you can buy a ton of 
cement for less than one hundred euros for a whole ton.

77
00:08:11,81 --> 00:08:19,16
In many developing countries though the prices are 
actually higher even though the incomes are lower so it's a very

78
00:08:19,17 --> 00:08:26,86
important that we have solutions which are really economically 
viable for these countries where there's this huge need

79
00:08:27,03 --> 00:08:28,91
for building infrastructure and housing etc.

80
00:08:29,03 --> 00:08:37,05
So let's look at where the CO2 emissions are coming from. 
Unlike most other industrial processes,

81
00:08:37,09 --> 00:08:43,89
only a minority of the C O two emissions are coming 
from the energy consumption. Producing cement is the high

82
00:08:43,90 --> 00:08:52,37
temperature process, going up to temperatures of 
fourty or fifty and this does take energy

83
00:08:52,64 --> 00:08:54,89
but it's still the minor amount. 


00:08:55,82 --> 00:09:03,47
A cement kiln as we see here looks like a 
fairly unsophisticated type of instrument.

84
00:09:03,55 --> 00:09:11,30
But this is in fact not true because in the past few 
decades there's been very dramatic improvement in the amount of

85
00:09:11,34 --> 00:09:14,38
energy needed to produce cement

86
00:09:14,76 --> 00:09:22,90
And it really state of the art equipment now, the 
production process is highly optimized to nearly eighty percent of the

87
00:09:22,91 --> 00:09:26,27
thermodynamic limit, which is those 
of you who will study thermodynamics

88
00:09:26,28 --> 00:09:34,41
will know is very close to the maximum you can achieve. 
Another factor which is important is that rather

89
00:09:34,42 --> 00:09:44,10
than using fossil fuels which used to be the dominant 
means in the past, nowadays we can use a wide variety of waste

90
00:09:44,11 --> 00:09:48,23
fuels. 
So for example of cuts from producing furniture,

91
00:09:49,54 --> 00:09:55,98
Old car tires, many many different kind 
of ways can be burnt in a cement kiln

92
00:09:56,30 --> 00:10:03,21
and in many parts of Europe, plants are 
using more than eighty percent of waste fuels.

93
00:10:03,76 --> 00:10:09,07
So this is a very efficient 
tool for valorising waste materials. 



00:10:09,72 --> 00:10:12,00
So if we're going to make improvements we need to

94
00:10:12,08 --> 00:10:16,31
turn to the other side to this sixty percent of the equation

95
00:10:16,70 --> 00:10:24,65
and this sixty percent This comes from the 
breakdown of calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and co2.

96
00:10:24,83 --> 00:10:33,97
Calcium carbonate, this is in fact limestone which is 
eighty percent of the raw material used to make cement.

97
00:10:34,58 --> 00:10:43,31
Now the fact we have this chemical CO2 means that if we're 
going to reduce this, then we're going to have this has

98
00:10:43,32 --> 00:10:45,39
implications for the chemistry of the cement

99
00:10:45,43 --> 00:10:53,93
and that means it has implications for the whole way it 
behaves in use etc which of course is a bit challenging.

100
00:10:54,20 --> 00:11:00,57
So what are we seeing in this lecture? Well we've 
seen how important cementitious materials are, how they make up

101
00:11:00,80 --> 00:11:05,46
by far the overwhelming majority of all the materials we used

102
00:11:05,50 --> 00:11:11,58
and therefore cannot be replaced by other materials. 
We've seen that in fact the environmental footprint from these

103
00:11:11,59 --> 00:11:18,04
materials is in fact quite low and we've looked 
at where the CO2 emissions come from

104
00:11:18,22 --> 00:11:24,21
and we've seen that most of the C O two emissions 
come from the chemical breakdown of limestone that's calcium

105
00:11:24,22 --> 00:11:25,04
carbonate

106
00:11:25,29 --> 00:11:33,57
and therefore we can't really imagine to do much about 
CO2 emissions by for example looking at alternative energies

107
00:11:34,14 --> 00:11:40,78
So in the next lecture we're going to go into more 
detail about why the chemistry of cement is as it is, 

108
00:11:40,79 --> 00:11:42,48
So I look forward to 
seeing you next time

109
00:11:42,68 --> 00:11:50,88
and I hope you've enjoyed this first module. If 
you want to find out more, then this publication Eco-efficient cements

110
00:11:50,89 --> 00:12:00,06
which we published in November 2016, gives 
you a very good background to all the aspects I will tackle

111
00:12:00,20 --> 00:12:01,88
in this first module.
