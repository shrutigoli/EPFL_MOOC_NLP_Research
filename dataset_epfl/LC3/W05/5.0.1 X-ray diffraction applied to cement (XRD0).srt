Hi, my name is Rueben Snellings and I have a background in applied mineralogy

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in particular I have spend more than 10 years using X-ray diffraction to study semanticiuos  

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Materials, in this lecture series. My fellow team members and me

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
want to introduce you into the basics of X-ray diffraction also called XRD


5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and how you can make use of this powerful technique to study the chemistry of cement, the use

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of x ray diffraction as material characterization technique goes back a long time

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
major scientific progress was made by applying x-rays and crystals to study

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
how atoms are organized in crystalline materials, in short

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
x-ray diffraction studies have had an enormous impact on our understanding of

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
how nature works. Just by resolving the crystal structure from anything

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
like simple rock salt to very complex molecules such as

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
DNA, penicillin or insulin. Similarly 


13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
X-ray diffraction was applied to study the main phases present in cement such as C3S

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
C2S, C3A and C4F, it unable to

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
describe differences in atomic arrangements that underlie large changes

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in chemical reactivity. One of the most striking examples of this

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
is C2S that changes from very reactive in the alpha form to largely

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
unreactive in the Gamma form of large spectacle impact is that X-ray

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
diffraction data can be used to quantify the composition of complex materials

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
such a cement. This capability has led to widespread

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
application of the power diffraction technique in research labs. Even more so

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
its ease of application has led to its introduction as a quality control system in

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
clinical production plants. This course aims to show you how X-ray

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
diffraction really works. How you can properly carry out the measurements and

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
then how you should read interpret and then analyse the collected data.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
To obtain your desired results. This course is aimed at

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the level of mases students, graduate students or professionals that are planning

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to embark on x-ray diffraction studies to study cement.


29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Preferably, the student has followed introductory courses in chemistry

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
and materials science. Having followed the basic cause and crystallography is helpful

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
as well. This lecture series consists of two main parts in part

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
one the basics of X-ray diffraction are introduced and it is shown how part of the 

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
diffraction patterns are collected and how one should read and interpret

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the data. In part two more advanced data analysis methods are

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
explained and demonstrated. In particular it is shown how

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
X-ray diffraction can be used to quantify the cement phase composition. In

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
part one X-ray diffraction basics and measurements. This part

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
consists of four sections. First a brief history of X-ray

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
diffraction gives an overview of the underlying principles

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
next. The basic features of the diffraction pattern are described

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and it is shown how these features can be related to material properties.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then the third section explains and demonstrates how a laboratory

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
effect on water works and how to best prepare samples. This will be

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
illustrated with demonstration videos. Finally the principle

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
is of quality that if X and D data analysis or face

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
identification explains and example videos are

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
shown how to do this in practice. Part 2 advanced data

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
analysis and applications to cement consists of four sections as well. In the first

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
section the principles of quantitative phase analysis by read folk method are

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
described in a straightforward demonstration of data fitting scheme

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
in a second section we apply discrete felt method to analyze the face

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
composition of Portland cement, then even increasing the

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
level of complexity. In the third section we are going to look at how we can cope with some

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
present contain X-ray amorphous materials such as blast furnace slag or

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
calcium silicate hydrates. This way we can analyze 


56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
blended cements and even hydrate its limits. Several approaches are introduced and

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
practical advantages and disadvantages are discussed, concrete

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
examples on real samples will be given.

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Finally in the last section collects and summarize its practical guidelines for data analysis.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This will enable you to develop the appropriate measurement and data treatment strategy

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
for your problem as a wrap up of this introduction. We would like to give you a clear

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
view of what are the main advantages and limitations of X-ray diffraction to study cement.


63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
On the one hand XRD has become a standard not a trivial characterization tool


64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
because one can characterize the phase assemblage in detail.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
For instance, one can quantify what happens to individual phases during cement

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hydration. Further, soample preparation is

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
straightforward and measurement times are short. Making the collection of data

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
inexpensive and accessible and in fact most material science

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
departments or universities have XRD equipment available.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Finally significant progress in software development has made data

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
treatment less tedious and in some case semi-automatic routines can be

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
easily implement. On the other hand. One should be aware that there are

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
limitations as well. First of all the accuracy in terms of face quantification is limited

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to about two to three weigh percent for major phases and around one to three


75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
percent for minor phase. Also one should realize that for non-routine types of

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
analysis considerable expertise and understanding of the underlying theory

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
is needed. This cause really aims to get you started in

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the measurements and also to transfer many practical tips and

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
tricks that usually do not find their way through to the specialized scientific

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
literature. Or handbooks on this subject.
