1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this session, we will have a closer look on what information is contained

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in the powder diffraction pattern. We will look at the properties of the diffraction peak

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
or Bragg reflections that make up the defector of room. In brief we

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
will introduce what material properties determine the position

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
intensity and width of the peaks in the pattern. We will need this

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
as background knowledge to help us make the right decisions in data analysis and

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
interpretation later. Now let's have a look at the x-ray

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
the powder diffraction pattern of a substance vibrio known in cements.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This is part of diffraction pattern of Alight for instance. In this part of the

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
friction pattern we can see the appearance of a lot of peaks

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and these peaks appear at a certain position and all a feature of these

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
peaks is OK they don't only have a position. They also have a height

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
and intensity. But that's also important to know as a characteristic

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
in what can peak differ as well. That is actually on the on width of

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
the peak. These are the three main properties of

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
one peak but also of sets of peaks that actually contain the

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
information that enables you to extract for instance crystallography

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Information but also phase compositional information

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
yet. Now let's have a closer look at what

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
determines peak positions, peak positions are determined

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
by the size and the symmetry

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
of the lattice or the units cell. The unit cell is the basic

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
building units of your crystal. It has three dimensions

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
typically called A, B and C if they are different in size

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and these between these three

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
dimensions we have angles, alpha beta and gamma depending on the

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
symmetry. What are your lattice. For instance cubic. Or

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
whether it's true clinic, one or more of these

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
parameters can be identical. The other important part you know

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is OK one Konev and this is usually introduced in the

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Crystallography course. It's what relates the distance between two

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
planes in your crystal and the appearance of a certain reflection.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
HKL. HKL plane with a certain interplay and a

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Distance D will diffract given

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
a certain wave like Lambda at a certain diffraction angle as is

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
established in Bragg’s law that says the wavelength equals

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
two times the independent distance times the sign of the diffraction angle

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
as seen in the previous section.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Knowing for certain plane HKL plane

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is the

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
distance. One can actually derive what is the units cell

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
parameter of for instance a cubic lattice using the formula

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
shown here. One can also derive the

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
lattice parameters of much more complicated

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Symmetries, for instance trick symmetry in which we have A, B

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
C, alpha, beta and gamma which are all different values.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And then one would need to use this kind of formula. Of course there is gets to be

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
a system of equations where for a whole set of HKL

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
planes and their distances and diffraction angles connected and

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
one can actually computationally easily solve these kinds of equations

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
once one knows whether the crystal

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
investigation is of Cubic triclinic or other

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Symmetry, that about peak positions. Now let's have a look at

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
peak intensities, peak intensities is determined by the positions of the atom and the units cell, so

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
this is really where your crystal structure information is used

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
for crystalline phase in a multiphase power sample for

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Instance, one can actually have this kind of intensity equation

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
for each HGL reflection of that is this intensity quotient

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
consists of different factors most of which are not related to the

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sample crystal structure but rather to

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
set up of your instruments or decomposition of your

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
sample or for instance whether there is some preferred

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
orientation of particles in your sample or not. So there is a

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
general scale factor, I mentioned this there was a Lawrence

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
polarizations lecture which mostly depends of how the diffraction takes

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
place in your instrument. There is the absorption factor which takes into account how

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
much of the incoming radiation is absorbed by the sample.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And there is a preferred orientation factor that takes into account whether some

69
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
HGL reflections are over or under represented because of the effect that

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
for instance some crystallite that have a non-uniform

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
dimension for instance platelets or needles. They can actually be

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
solicited more than other kind of reflections.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Finally and most importantly there is the structure factor

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
looking a bit closer into the structure factor we see where actually all

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the structural information is situated. So as seen in the

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
previous formula the intensity of a certain reflection is proportional

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
to the square of the structure factor. Structure factor itself for a certain age

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
scale reflection is actually the sum over all atoms and in a unit cell

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and it takes into account for each atomic site for each

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
atom in the unit cell, the atomic cell factor, the

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
occupation of the sites by that atom, for

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
instance it can vary between 0 and 1. Let's say if you have a solid solution

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
series where you have 50 percent of the time ion and 50 percent of the time

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
aluminum and that size then the occupation site

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
number can actually distinguish between for instance the scattering between

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
of aluminum and that of ion. Important is the

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
interference term this term takes into account the atomic coordinate.

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
So where are these atoms located in your units cell? And finally

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
there is a D by wall effector or the atomic displacement factor that

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
takes into account thermal displacements of your atoms that can

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
actually kind of reduce the intensities of your structure factor.

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Looking at the first of the parameters that is in the intensity equation

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
we have the X-ray for factors that actually reflect the nature of the

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
atom itself. X-rays in fact intersect with the atomic

95
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
electron cloud. The higher the number of electrons in this

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
cloud or the higher the atomic number z, the higher the

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
X-ray form factor will be. This is why this reflected

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
in the slides on the right hand side where you can see the periodic table

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and in the periodic table the size of the spheres actually

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Reflects the value of the atomic form factor.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So it also means that phases, minerals that contain

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
atoms with a higher atomic number will reflect

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
x-rays more efficiently or light phases will

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
typically have lower x-ray

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Intensities, then phases that are typically

106
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
heavier. The x-ray form factor does not only depend on the nature of

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the atom but also on the diffraction angle. This can be clearly seen on the right

108
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
hand side of the slides, where have a comparison between the form factors

109
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ion, oxygen, carbon and hydrogen as a function

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
of the diffraction angle, here normalize by the wave length to give

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
a more general treatment of the matter. One can directly

112
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
see that these form factors really

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
decrease sharply with diffraction angles this in

114
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
effect also explains why when we look at diffraction patterns for

115
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
X-rays intensities tend to be higher at the

116
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
low angle site than the high angle site. This is simply because

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the atoms will reflect the

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
x-rays more efficiently at the lower diffraction angles, the other

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
part of the intensity equation is basically governed by the interference term

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
this interference term is actually reflecting the

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
position of the atoms in the units cell. One can see

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the positions of the atoms reflected in this first formula. Now we see the

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
fractional coordinates X, Y and Z appearing.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
These are the fractional coordinates of the atom in the unit cell

125
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
this interference term does reflects the underlying atomic structure

126
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
in the unit cell. Also called the motive. In fact the

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
interference term is the factor dot product between the position of the atom

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and R M as one can see here and the

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
scattering vector Q HKL in which HKL is

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
a reflection plane. It is important to realize that this

131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
interference term is not a smooth function of 20 and thus

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
reflections with similar D spacings may really have larger

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
or similar interference terms. This really depends on the

134
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
positions of the atoms in the units cell

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
and the interference with the scattering vector.

136
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Most of the information effect that is used to calculate

137
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the diffraction pattern of a certain mineral or phase

138
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
is written down in databases. And saved for

139
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
instance under a form like a  crystallography information files

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
one can see an example of this at the bottom sides of this slide.

141
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
These files, they contain lots of parameters such as

142
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
cell lengths A, B, C or cell angles alpha beta and gamma

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
they contain symmetry groups spays groups

144
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and they contain also for each atomic sites, the

145
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
type of atom which is positioned at that sites for instance calcium

146
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
diffraction coordinates X, Y, Z and the

147
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
atomic sites of occupancy, for the calcium sites there is always

148
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
calcium atom sitting in that position. For instance for other

149
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
sites, for instance the ion aluminum one position they

150
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
occupied have the same atomic coordinates. However

151
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
85 percent of the time this side is occupied by ion and only

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
50 percent of the time is occupied by aluminum. All this

153
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
information is needed to calculate on this site

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the position of the reflections and usually more on that side. The

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
intensity of the reflections, when we want to do a proper

156
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
fitting of a diffraction pattern. It is very important

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that we have close reliable sorting models. Take for

158
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
instance we have a bad starting model, then the calculation

159
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
routine the fitting routine will have a very hard time in finding

160
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
the correct refines fitted parameters

161
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
in your x-ray diffraction experiments. The last parameter

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
in intensity creation onto Debye-Waller factors also called the atomic

163
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
displacement factors. This factor effect, reflects the

164
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
thermal vibrations of the atoms in their positions.

165
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
They are not frozen, they vibrate around the position which makes it

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
actually the size of the atoms, time and space ever which

167
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
is larger than they actually are. This actually leads to

168
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
destructive interference when your x-rays are being

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
deflected. And thus leads to a reduction of the peak intensities

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
expressions for this effect can be found here, one

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
of which uses the Debye-Waller factors as such, but other expressions exist as

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
well. For instance one which is more directly related to the mean

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
square atomic displacement and B which is often

174
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
preferred since it has values around is 1 and is thus easier to judge.

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Typically when looking at atoms and that term of vibrations the general rule

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
is that the lighter of the atom is the larger displacement

177
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
displacement would be. Heavy atoms like Iran will barely move

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
smaller atoms like hydrogen will move a lot and spread out

179
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
their electron density or electron cloud.

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
this again adds up with the fact for instance that for hydrogen we have a very

181
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
low atomic form factor together with a

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
lot of thermal displacement, thermal vibration

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
it makes it very hard for X-ray diffraction experiments to actually see

184
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
hydrogen atoms, the impacts on the diffraction pattern will be

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
very low. The last property that we need to look at is the peak

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
width the peak width actually tells you more about the microstructure

187
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
of your sample not the crystal structure, the microstructure. Typically

188
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The size of the crystalized that are defecting or the to string

189
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
these crystallize can be extracted from a analysis of

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
peak width, peak with and peak shape really depends

191
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
on the source of your X-rays, the instrument

192
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the optics of your instrument you're using and also your sample itself.

193
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The classical way of treating peak shapes and calculating and fitting

194
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
powdered deflection files are used are by using

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
analytical functions. Typically Gaussian and

196
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Laurentian are mixed pseudo Voigt functions

197
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
and are used to model the peak shape.

198
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So this did not really represent well

199
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
symmetric properties of x-ray diffraction

200
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
peak shapes. There are extended versions like with TCHZ on

201
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
a piece and seven that can take into account some measure of symmetry of the peak

202
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
on the right hand side we can see for instance what is the difference between a typical Gaussian` and a

203
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
typical Laurentian. A Gaussian actually has very

204
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
short tails while Laurentian has typically quite

205
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
long tails to both sides from the maximum. Mixing

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
those can give you a good representation of your peak shape

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
by X-ray diffraction. Actually peaks it shapes also really depend

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
on the diffraction angle. Typically they get wider the higher the

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
deflection angle is. So for both Gaussian and

210
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Laurentian peak shape functions one needs to include a dependence

211
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
on the diffraction angle. The classical approach to this was made or

212
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
developed by Galeotti in 1958. And he

213
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
used for instance for the Gaussian dependence three parameters that can be fitted

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
U, V and W for the Laurentian he used two

215
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
factors X and Y and fitting those to the experimental

216
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
data. Unable to obtain a good fit between the full width of half

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
maximum at lower angles and that higher angles as well.

218
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Using analytical functions is one way of coping with the problem of fitting and

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
modeling experimental diffraction data. Another way is the

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
fundamental parameters approach. Here, one

221
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
actually starts from the assumption that yes we can separate the instrumental,

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
the source and the sample contributions from each other

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
to do this one needs to know what is the source profile and what is the instrument

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
profile. The instrument profile can be calculated from

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
optical parameters. And they are actually established by typical

226
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
physical equations. Source profile is also usually known for

227
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
commercial sources. So one can easily fix those and then

228
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
just retain the contribution by the sample, the sample broadening.

229
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So if we can separate contributions from the source the instruments

230
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and that of the sample in the fundamental parameters approach. one can actually analyze a

231
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
sample texture, one can obtain information on what is the chrysalis

232
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
size and what is the strain on the lettuce for certain areas. This

233
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
can be very important for instance in deformation studies of metals, scientists can be

234
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
assessed through to share a formula. This formula uses the dependence

235
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
of the full width half maximum with the peak as a function of

236
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the deflection angle and enables you to extract a volume weighted

237
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
mean crystallite size. And other formula can be used to extract

238
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
information on stream. In this respect the full width

239
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
half maximum as the tangents dependence on the deflection angle

240
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
having a look at how both vary over a wide range and diffraction angles

241
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
can enable one to separate strain and size contributions to the

242
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
broadening of your peaks. However this is only possible for

243
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Pure or very simple

244
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Metals, for instance or powders. When we look at complex mix mixtures of

245
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
powder such as a Portland cement typically the separation between size and strain

246
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
becomes impossible for a certain phase and we usually use as an

247
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
apparent crystallite size to muddle the broadening as a

248
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
function of 20. peak intensities and peak width

249
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
these are the main properties that can be used or looked at in part of diffraction

250
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
patterns to retrieve information on materials.

251
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Peak positions relates to the unit cell dimensions and symmetry

252
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
peak intensities relate back to what type of atoms are contained in your unit

253
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
cell and what their positions really are.

254
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and peak width goes back to what is the microstructure the micro

255
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
texture of your sample, how large are actually these crystallite

256
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
in your sample or what is defamation. The relationship between these

257
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
analytical properties of your diffraction pattern and the material

258
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
properties have been used in a very wide array of

259
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Applications. In the next session we will actually look at how we can best

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
measure and X-ray diffraction pattern and then specifically applied to

261
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Segments. We will look at the diffraction geometry, the

262
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
instruments. And then we will look at what are the best

263
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
settings of your instruments to measure A Portland cement sample for instance.

264
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Also we will look at what is the best sample procreation procedure

265
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
for your problem.
