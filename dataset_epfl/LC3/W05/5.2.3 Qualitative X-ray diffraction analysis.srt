00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now that you know how to prepare and measure your sample, it is time to have a look at the analysis

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
of the resulting data. The first step in this analysis is to

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
find out which phrases are present in your sample. This lecture will

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
give you a brief overview on how we identify phases

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so-called qualitative phase analysis on your X-ray powdered diffraction data.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The qualitative phase analysis is based on a comparison of the peaks in

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
a measured XRD pattern to a large database containing Peak patterns

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
of many known phases usually a

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
database such as the powdered diffraction file database the PDF database published

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
by the ICDD. It's used. And this database

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
allows searching and matching in combination with chemical or categorical

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
filters to restrict the number of candidates that can match

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
your Pattern. Also open source databases exist such

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
as the COD database and the American mineralogist

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
database. As a general in help in phase

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
identification we have supplied you with a list of common phases in

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
funding cement. And this is also giving us a supplementary material to discuss.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This list can be used to build a custom database for cement phases for your

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
system and it can be used in combination with your specific

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
available such match software. Alternatively

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
there's also the classical way of doing such matching by rapid manual

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
identification by comparison for instance between a list of

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
XAD peaks of certain phases and peaks in your

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
pattern. We have also supplied such search match table

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
as a supplemental material to discus, and you can use it to

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
find difficult phases such as minor phases which have very low

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
peaks for instance. In the graph on the left side you

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
can see that there's the main problem of identification

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
which is peak overlap. If you look for instance at the overlap

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
between the C3S and the beater C2S Patten's

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
then you can see that the major peaks are actually completely overlapping which makes it very

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
difficult for any automatic face identification software

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
to find for instance better C2S in the system.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This way we also need to rely on other information such as

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
microscopic observations or knowledge of the poke sample

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
chemistry or just knowing what kind of phases can be present in your material

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
specifically for Portland cement and then hydrous Portland cements. It is very

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
useful to do some selective dissolution to identify minor phases. Having looked

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
at the example in this figure you can see that's for anhydrous Portland

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
cement. We have done two extractions through selective dissolutions that

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
either concentrate the calcium silicate. This happens with

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
a potassium hydroxide per sugar extraction in the green curve

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
or we did an extraction of this solution with salicylic

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
acid and methanol in which we have a residue, a solids residue that is

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
concentrated in the aluminates ferrites and alkali sulfates phases.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
For instance when comparing the poke sample in purple

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
below with the SAM extracted sample, you can see that there is a

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
very large increase in the peaks of ferrites and of alkali sulfate phases

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
for instance ferrite around 12 degrees and alkali sulfate phases in the

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
range of twenty to twenty five degrees C theater. As

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, this selective dissolution method can be used to

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
identify whether there's any polymorphs in your sample. For instance what might, one may

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
really look at any polymorphs of C2S or there’s autonomic or

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
cubic C3A in the Portland cement. Finally the

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
XRD pattern fitting procedures in quantitative phase analysis often

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
indicate a presence in the difference or residual curves of minor

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
retrace phrases that were previously hidden by extensive peak overlap

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
with major phases.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Therefore an alliterative procedure that goes back and forth between

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
phase identification and phase quantification is very common

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and very useful in obtaining a complete analysis.

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
From this session on we will show you how do analysis using exactly data.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Here are the files we are going to use for the demo. You can find the templates

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
as well as that Commercial file and the Mac Cagney excel files

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
all of the cemented  data structures are available in zip files in this

66
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Folder. The demo will be shown step by step. Part one

67
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is the identification, part two use simple retroviral analysis

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Part three where these are Wang’s quantitative phase analysis.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The samples used for demo videos are simple binary Mixer made

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
of calcites and corks, anhydrous Portland cement

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
typical Sims including flowers and snack and fernery hydrated

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Cement. Them demo are mainly based on the software called

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
HighScore plus from panalytical, a quick demo on how to use the open source

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
software quite X-2 for identification. And this has2

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
for quantification we are also be covered to enable your own practice in case

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
there there's no access to HighScore plus. Let's get started with a

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
quantitative analysis. Simple demo using Coushatta and course

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mixture. open the HighScore plus software.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then create a new file now inset the file. Now

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Inset the data. You can change the scale of the y axis to any near

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
square root or a LOG scale to check the details of the peaks, more

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
details such as the configuration of the diffractometer in the skin

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
can be found in the optic inspector, to do the identification.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
There are three steps. First determine the back ground of the pattern

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
second search the peaks in the pattern. You can see the peaks on top of the

86
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Pattern, the black v marks means that the peaks

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
are a lot identified. Then the search match. There are a lot of cards in

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
the database. It is better to know some background information for the sample, such as

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
the category of the sample. For example inorganic or organic

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
chemical compositions, crystallography information and the potential phases in the mixture

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
those restrictions can be very helpful to improve the search match.

92
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We wish you all these functions in the coming demo. Here we just

93
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
search high quality cards using star  and indexed after

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Search match the candidates are sure in the candidates nest, the score

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
indicates how good the candidates and matches the experiment pattern.

96
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can check the details of this card by double clicking the sneaked cards.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We accept the first proposed candidate the calcites. The remarks are

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
removed for all order matched peaks with calcites. After taking the

99
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
next candidate's corpse most of the peaks are identified for each phase

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we peaked. It is recommended to take a relative's transmit by I focusing

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
on the three strongest peaks the remaining tiny peaks are from the keep it all resito

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The demo on quite X-2 for

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
identification. Import a diffraction data.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Then go to search to search match the candidates from the candidates nest and just

105
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
accept them matched phases similar to a HighScore plus were being applied

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
to Tick's matches of the peak, mixture or most of the peaks

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
are matched. MOR, flash and snacked

108
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
for this 2 demo, we wish you the typical pattern is for our amorphous humps

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and the Samples are Mainer amorphous with a small amount of questioning phases. And it is more challenging to

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
make the decision of the final candidates since there are samples. If there is no

111
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
information about this samples. For such kind of samples, the

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
identification must be done with special care by taking as much information as possible

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
such as the chemical composition. For Flash, there are a

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
lot of amorphous content which gave us a hemp here. Will this case the

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Back run function which should be modified to follow the hump and just keep

116
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the peaks by changing pattern metres. The back run function should just follow

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
the trend of lowest points on the pattern but should not goes into the peaks

118
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
it starts peaks then search match. We can always peaks the star

119
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and index cards in the identification Weser search match the best

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
matches was the moonlight falling by course. We accept these two

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
candidates for the match by dragging the candidate into the accepted

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Area. However there is still some tiny peaks which is not matched.

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
For example the peaker on circling the race by taking the rest of the candidates and

124
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
another pornimorph of silicon oxide. Namely those states were right matches the peaks

125
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
now all the peaks are identified. For slack

126
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
we also see the amorphous hump. The strategy for the band wand is similar to the one

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
for Flash, follow the lowest point of the pattern but never

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
go into the peaks. You've researched peak quickening and there are only

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
three peaks in the pattern. We are applying the search match without any restriction.

130
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Most of the candidates are quite stringent as the elements of those for sure that

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
they in the sample. This is mainly because of the relative no concentration of the

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Crystal phasing in this sample. It's put some restrictions to

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
the search match. For example the search file minimal related carts, refine the

134
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
search match and then we got courts and on the top least

135
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
when taking the chemical comparison of the sample. We know that there are small amount of silicon

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
oxide in the sample. So the president of course is reasonable.

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Then there are some other strange candidates such as the ice and some rare earth

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
elements compound the possible candidates. Would that be the calcium

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
calcium carbonate, namely the calcites.

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
According to the chemical compilation from XRF

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A demo on Portland cement, for Portland cement the challenge for

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
authentication is from the complexity on the cemenality  of the pattern for C3S and C2S

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
a lot of peaks are overlapped which makes the situation more

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
difficult. We do the same steps for the data of Portland cement in search of scan

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
determine the backgroung and then search of peaks. As we load the cement so there

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
is a mixing of cement and hydration product is

147
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
applied. The first candidate is the solid

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
solution for C3S with magnesium and aluminum. The second why in C3

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
is both give similar match score while the C3S matches better

150
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
when taking the peaks and around 15 degrees. Right

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
click to accept the candidate. Following the anhydrate. Then use

152
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the C4F. Namely in the Braam interrupts. If you take a quick look into the

153
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
details of the cart for the rest of the faces you can get help from the

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
different types of restrictions to not create. For instance

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
there might be some Free nan left in the cement, if the centuries is not build on

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
really that restricts in based on elements can be used. We Peak's the

157
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
calcium and oxygen in this sample, there is only very small amount of free

158
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Nyree. For Portland cement, there must be some C2S as we

159
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
know a mineral name of the beater C2S is called larite. Let's try those

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
restricting using streams before we use a lot of restriction

161
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
premise one must be cleared. Indeed if we

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
apply the restrict base standard mineral name, it would be easier to

163
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
locate the exact phase, you free just use the

164
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
elements or restrictions for the same chemical composition, there are some polymorph

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
which needs to be distinguished and to allow most of the peaks are

166
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
identified. There is no C3A found in the candidates neast.

167
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We put some elements restrictions to find the C3A. There is a C3A we need

168
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
all the peaks and matches a pattern, and them

169
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
all hydrate to cement. Now we take a look of the hydrate cement, you can see

170
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
clear his ham forces H around certain degrees with copper radiation.

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So the bad ones should be treated similarly to the flours and snacks. Following are

172
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
trained of the patterns as we know it is cement hydrates. So we apply

173
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
subfiles restriction with cement anhydrate. In this statical matches are

174
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Alight. Here it appears as a solid solution of the C3S with

175
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
some magnesium and aluminum. Then the Portlandite which is the main

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
hydrate for cement. Then you can find the ettringite nature which appears

177
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
as calcium aluminate sulfate hydroxide hydrate. Also checks a peaks

178
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
in the pattern.  The complicity of the

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
hydrogen cement. Sometimes the software can not find out the potential candidate.

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Easing. Then the restrictions can be used to simplify the search match Persia

181
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
neuron a C4F rags snony during the hydration process. It's located

182
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
this phase with the mineral name of remunerate. Same routine can be used for the

183
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
C2S Namely lelouch. Up to now all the Crystal phases in the hydro

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
cement space was identified and surprisingly we cannot find

185
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the candidates for CSH in the database. It is nano Crystalline with

186
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
present it or hump instead of a set of peaks. The closest

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
crystal structure to CSH are the 11 hamstrung and 48 hamstrung top or more right structure

188
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
which is the most used Starling's factor for more though the CSH structure.
