1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
X ray diffraction methods measure the interference pattern produced by the current 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
scattering of an incoming monochromatic X-ray by a three dimensional

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
periodic created material, here the crystal lattice for a

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
specific crystal lattice constructive interference. Peaks of scattered

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
X rays and the diffraction pattern takes place only at angles defined by the

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
specific distances on the letters as seen in the previous

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
lecture Braque’s law defines this relationship. X ray diffraction

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
experiments can be conducted on single crystals but also on powder's

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
powder diffraction has the advantage that mixtures of phases can be investigated

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
relatively easily and know relatively rare well formed

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
crystals unnecessary, instead in powder diffraction.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The original material is ground very finely and mounted on a sample

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
holder, the powder amount consist ideally of crystalline

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
particles in completely random orientation. If the organization is truly

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
random then for each characteristic repeat distance d

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There are many particles that satisfy the Braque law. Flat

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Powder amount are usually measured in reflection or so-called Braque

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Brentano per focusing geometry

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in this geometry, the incident beam from the line focus of the x

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
ray tube diverges until it is reflected by the sample, the

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
defective beam then converts from the sample as and is focused at the point

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
of focusing circle and the gun you meter circle intersect, here our

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
receiving slits positions to filter out any unfocussed radiation

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
secondary monochrometer can be used to ensure that only elastically scatter the radiation.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is radiation that has the same wavelength as the source is allowed to enter the

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
detector device. The letter measures considerably

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
improve the angular resolution. This will make peaks

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
become narrower this showing less overlap with a reflection peaks. Various

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Bragg Ventana configurations exist in the theta thither system, both the

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
X-ray source and the detector system rotates simultaneously along the goniometer

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
circle, the sample stage in the center of the goniometer circle is fixed.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thus if the angle between the surface normal and the incidence being

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
has changed by 0 in fact the angle between the incident and

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the diffracted beam has changed by 20 the peak to

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
background intensity and the peak resolution of the

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
most important parameters to assess the quality of a diffraction scan

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
increasing the peak to background ratio can be done by increasing measurement times

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
increasing X-ray source intensity or decreasing background scattering intensity

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to improve the quality of the X and D data. Several so-called

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
optical devices are used to focus collimate and filter the

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
X-ray beam. Solo slits, diversion slits,

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And the scatter slits and or receiving slits are all used to

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
condition the beam and remove background noise. Increasing the peak

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
resolution often involves cutting a part of the incoming and reflected intensity that

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
leads to big problem and this reduces overall peak intensities.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thus in practice, a compromise needs to be found among different data

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
quality measures. Also taking into account practical considerations such as the available

48
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
time for measuring and the acceptable sample exposure time.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Finally in practice if you look at the X-ray powder the effect meter, it looks a lot

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
like in the pictures on the left side you can recognize the x rays

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
source on the tube. In the middle, the sample stage and on the

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
right hand side you see the detector. In between source and sample and

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
sample and detector optical devices are positioned, the x ray

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
tube requires cooling and is usually connected to an external cooling

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
circuit. The high voltage generator for the X-ray tube is usually positioned

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
underneath during the experiments the x rays are shielded off

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
by Leaded casing or lead glass to protect the operator

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
before you start data collection. It's important to check if the fact of that system is well

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
aligned and that a suitable measurement configuration is chosen in case of a

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
flat plate reflection geometry correct combination of optic elements and

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
sample size sheets and sure that media sample of transparency not beam

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
overflow at low angles occur. Data collection strategies

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
aimed at collecting a maximum of useful information from the sample. Therefore

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the data collection range for Portland cements is usually chosen to be within let's say

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
5 to 70 degrees 20 for capercailzie for radiation. But it can be wider or

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
more restrictive depending on the problem. The 5 to 70 degrees

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
range provide ski information on hydrates face reflections at low angles

68
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and covers the most intense reflections of both anhydrous and hydrous phases.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For most in-house diffractometers a step size of about 0.0 or

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
two degree city that is used. And the counting time per step is usually a

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
compromise between the optimal signal to noise ratio and

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
practical considerations such as the available time for measurements or acceptable

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
sample exposure. The development of high performance X-ray

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
detector systems in the last decades has allowed to actually drastically

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
reduce measurement times and thus to minimize exposure times of hydrated samples to

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
a couple of minutes. It is advisable also to spin

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
your sample in the horizontal plane to improve the particle statistics of the measurements when

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
doing powder diffraction. This figure give us an example of the

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
dependence of data quality on the type of radiation that you use

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
here a comparison is made between the diffraction patterns of two different Portland cement one measured

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
by a lab defectometer and the other by a synchrotron next.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The main advantage of using a synchrotron is the much higher

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
monochromatisity and the intensity of the X-ray radiation. This greatly

84
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
improved speak resolution enables much shorter data collects and

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
times and this is useful for instance for early age cement hydration

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
experiments where you want to have very short experiments measurements

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
for instance a couple of minutes you can discover the insides of a real lap defectometer

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
in this demonstration video, the video will also show you the

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
operation of the machine during an X-ray about infection measurement. So please

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
have a look at the demo.

91
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hello I am Dr. Reunee

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And as you’ve been introduced, I will do the demo video. So here it

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
is our XRD diffractometer the X-ray

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
was generated by X-ray tube. Here we are going to use

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
use the characteristic reduces scene from copper the X-ray tube is

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Cool, we use cooling water as the power of the X-ray.

97
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
defractometer was determined by the power of the tube and the processing

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
of the detector. Ideally the more powerful the better. Typical

99
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
a bold 3 X-ray tube is working at 45 kilowatt and 40 million M-B.

100
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Unfortunately the age of the tube is limited because of the decay of the

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
intensity. Typically 10 percent per year. X3

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
passed through our set of opticals onto the samples then was

103
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
collected by that detector. the K.B. at the filter

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
namely that Neco filter is used to remove the key better radiation. The

105
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
set of metal plates called the soller slirt removed the

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
most diverging X-rays and leaving more parallel  X-ray to

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
pass. Our mosque is used to control the lens of the

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
extreme beams which is related to the size of the sample holder.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Rather important slirt called that divergences slirt is used to control the

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
viets of the beam which is related to the angular resolution of the

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Pattern. The smaller the divergences the slirt we used, the higher

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
angular resolution. However the intensity of the diffracted

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
X-rays will be decreased when smaller divergences slirt was applied.

114
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Sometimes the beam live just on top of the samples will be applied

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to remove the scattering of the X-rays at more angles which is

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
important to the sample presenting peaks at lower angles.

117
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Some of them post-state are equipped with the Sample spinner. Which rotates a

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
sample during that data acquisition. Whenever the spinner is available, It

119
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
is recommended to spin the sample to improve the statistics of the particles.

120
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The configuration of the XRD are mainly to optimize the extreme beam to give the

121
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
highest intensity and the required angular resolution.

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
At the same time the beam over flow and the scattering at no angle

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
should be awarded. A range of 7 to 17 degree of two seater

124
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
using copper reducing for the data is usually enough to cover most

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
of the peaks for some cement related samples and scan speed can be wired from

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
lab to lab depend on the power of the XRD. Typically certain

127
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
minutes of scan within a range of 7 to 17 degrees is

128
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
good enough to perform the retail analysis. Well for

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
frist disks. The scan should be acquire within 15 minutes to (10:34)

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
drying and the combination of the free samples for some

131
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
specific cases such as a comparison of polymorphous tricalcium

132
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
syndicate enhanced angularity resolutions and peak intensity

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
for sneaked it's range of the pattern can be more used for instead of the four

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,000
pattern.
