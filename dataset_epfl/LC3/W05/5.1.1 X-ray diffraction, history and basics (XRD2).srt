1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The aim of this session is to give a first introduction on the application of X-ray diffraction

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and to explain some of the basics underlying the diffraction of x rays on crystalline

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
materials. First we will illustrate how we can use X-rays

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to study cement. And also we show what are the main challenges to be met

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
when applying this technique on Semanticist  materials on the left side of the slide.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can see a typical example of pods of an x ray diffraction pattern of

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Portland cement on the x axis. You can see the angle of diffraction and on the

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
y axis the intensity of the elastically scatted x-rays, the diffraction

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
pattern itself looks a bit like an intricate landscape of peaks and valleys

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
as will be explained in more detail later in the course characteristic series of

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
peaks can be related to individual crystalline phases. Intensity

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
of these sets of peaks scales with the concentration

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
of the corresponding phases. The main phases present in the cement

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
sample are Alight given in blue, Belight

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
shown in purple 0A or Aluminate in green and

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
ferrite as shown in red here. Fitting of the

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
intensity of these sets of peaks. Unable to extract the relative

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
concentration of the different phases this and this

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
example is done using a method called the reach out method and this method will

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
be introduced later in this course as well. The results of the

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
face quantification are shown on the right hand side

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and looking at the sets of peaks and how they overlap it is very striking to

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
see that there is really very much overlapping and this is a

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
problem when we are treating the data and especially when looking at

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Cements, this kind of problem of Peko overlapping is one of the

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
main challenges to obtain good quantification data

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
performing this type of analysis on a time series of measurements enables you to study

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
reaction kinetics and mechanisms in multi-phase mixtures such as hydrating

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Cement. For instance the graph on the right side illustrates how Clinking

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
phases such as A-light and B-light get consumed over time during the

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
hydration of the cement. And how at the same time cement hydrates such as

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Portlandite or calcium hydroxide or veterangite form

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
this type of information can for instance be used to unravel reaction mechanisms or to

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
serve as an input for hydration models for better understanding hydration of

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Cement, not only changing concentration of solids phases can be measured

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
also Crystal structural saneness can be tracked and related to

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
external parameters such as changes in relative humidity or

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
differences in temperature. So the Often the live is unique data compared to

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
other common characterization techniques such as calorimetric, seminal

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
analysis or electron microscopy. These complementary

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
data can be used to unravel reaction mechanisms and

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
put all together analyze the kinetics of hydration or the

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
kinetics of Clinking. Let's take a step back and have a historical look at the

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
development of X-ray diffraction size. X-rays were first discovered by

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wilhelm Redken in 1895 doing electrical

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
discharge experiments with cathodes vacuum tubes. He noticed fluorescence

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
occurring on a barium Plotinus cyanide, even when the tubes were

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
completely obscured by cardboard. This new type of

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
electromagnetic radiation called by Redken himself. X-rays

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
as wavelengths that was significantly shorter than visible light typically

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
of the order of angstroms or a tenth of a nanometer

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
this discovery was first useful medical purposes, for instance radiology.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It was only later in 1912 that Max law in Munich

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
got the idea of positioning crystals in the X-ray beam in order to observe diffraction

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
phenomena. The idea was quickly picked up by Father and Son Bragg

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
to using the diffraction patterns to study crystal structures.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
All of these pioneers were actually awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
contributions making a leap in time to 1969

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ugur reach folks in the Netherlands developed a method to really calculate

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
neutron balder diffraction patterns. His

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
calculation method is based on fundamental crystal structural parameters

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
that in the calculation process can be adjusted or

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
as commonly called refined to come to an optimal fit with an

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
experimentally measured pattern in the beginning this method to us.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Computation is quite expensive and it was also specifically

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
developed for a special kind of diffraction, neutron diffraction. So it took

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
some time before the part of the method was realized by others in the fields and

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that it was adapted to x-rays which are the more common type of lab defectormeters 

69
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
even then after this extension was made

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
it took more than 10 years before the method was adapted by Howard to

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
enable measuring of mass based fractions insults.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Indeed it was the last extension that opened up a whole new field of quantitative phase

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
analysis. It is well to have a look at a few examples of what major scientific

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
achievements were made using X-ray diffraction studies.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
One of the first chemists that mainly use X-ray diffraction to resolve the structure

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
of crystal was Linus Pauling through systematically studying the structures of

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
many minerals, he established a set of ground rules the following rules

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
that rationalized to how atoms organize into crystals 

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He then proposed concepts such as electro negativity as a

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
way to explain how outer shell like electrons of two given atoms would interact to

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
forming a chemical bond. Pauling then use these rules and concepts to

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
resolve ever more complex structures going from simple inorganic structures

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
to complex protein structures. This one so farther by

84
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
1952 Pauling was also engaged in the race to be first off the

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
structure of the carry of the human genome DNA. Unfortunately for him he came too

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
late. It was the rather obscure diffraction pattern of the complex DNA molecule made

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
by Rosalind Frank Franklin that formed an important part of the evidence that underpinned

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the double helix model that was first proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick the

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
same year. Simultaneous to these great accomplishments made in other

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
parts of material science. X-ray diffraction was also applied to study Cements

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and in particular as first the crystal structure of the phase is present in the cement. One of the

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
first studies on the matter was published in 1928 by Hansen Brown.

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Over the years the structures of most phases present in the cement were reported.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But even up to now the structure of some complex hydrate phases are not yet

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
fully solved in terms of studying the relative concentrations of these phrasing cement. It

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
was only until 1993 that Taylor and Aldrich first applied retired matter to

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
cement compared to previous methods for face quantification the retired  method.

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Consider the whole experimenter profile for fitting and thus unable to mitigate the

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
effects of peak Overlap. This really opened up X-ray diffraction

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
for cement science. Now let's have a look at some basic concepts of

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
X-ray the friction and scattering. X-ray diffraction is actually based on elastics scattering 

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
of incoming radiation by a scatter usually an atom

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
or a plane of atoms. In elastic scattering, it is important to

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
remember that wave energy is conserved. This means that the energy of

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The, or also called the wavelength of the incoming radiation is equal to that of the

106
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
skeptic radiation. So the scattering only changes the

107
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
direction of the wave. This change in direction or the scattering

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
angle. Is often expressed as Q, momentum transfer

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
while the scattering angle changes depending on the wavelength of the radiation.

110
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Q is actually independent of this and directly related to crystal structures. You

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
can also be used to compare experiments that were done by different

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
wavelengths. It is important to remember that for diffraction phenomena to occur. The

113
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
wavelength of the incoming wave needs to be of the same order of magnitude as the size of the grid.

114
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Similarly Crysis can be seen as three dimensional arrays of plates or a

115
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
lattice and this lattice can produce diffraction if a wave of the

116
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
appropriate wavelength is used. This was exactly what the Mexican law thought

117
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
of designing when he was designing his experiment in 1912.

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He correctly assumed that the x-rays produced by cathode tube would be of the

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
same order of magnitude as the interatomic distances increases and indeed

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
placing a crystal in the incoming X-ray beam. Clearly a diffraction

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
pattern appeared on the photographic plate placed behind the Crystal.

122
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This discovery was quickly picked up by Father and Son bragg that the mini immediately

123
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
applied this to the structure of crystals and common

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
minerals. The right side you can see an example of zinc blend

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
or the diffraction pattern of zinc blend. Further on some brag arrives a law that

126
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,000
stated the condition for constructive interference on a set of planes

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
having in it into plan or distance. Using simple geometry one

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
can be arrived in order for x-rays to be reflected on a set of planes. They need to

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
be in face. This means that the difference on the graph

130
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
on the lower side between ray AD and ray BC


131
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
are in effect the distance FG + GH


132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
should be an integer value of lambda, the wavelength.


133
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
With both FG and GH equal to the inter plane and the distance D


134
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
times the diffraction angle, then the Bragq condition really reduces down

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to n? = 2D sin 0. And this is

136
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
the famous Beckler. This relationship can be used to determine the geometry of a

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
crystal lattice and given some additional data such as the density of the

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
material and chemical composition it can be used to solve simple crisis structures

139
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
such as rock salt, zinc bland or diamonds. When doing x-ray diffraction

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
experiments on fine powders rather than on single Chrystal

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the spots originally seen on the screen become concentric rings. This is

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because the powder now consists of a very large number of randomly oriented

143
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
crystals that effectively diffract in all directions. As long of

144
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
course a bragg condition is obeyed. While we would not

145
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
take the camera image on the right hand side and recall the intensity of the

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
scatter radiation as a function of the distance from the center point or

147
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
equivalently as a function of the diffraction angle. Then we end up with the

148
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
conventional representation of x-ray Powder diffraction data as shown on the lower right.

149
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The next session we will have a closer look of how we can read and extract information

150
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
from these kind of diffraction data.
