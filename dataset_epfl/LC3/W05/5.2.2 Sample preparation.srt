1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Once you have set of the x-ray de facto motive for your experiment.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Selected the appropriate optics and chosen the suitable measurement program for

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
your experiment. It is time to prepare your sample for measurements.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This lecture will treat the preparation of samples for XRD analysis and emphasize

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
key factors that may influence your results, in order to obtain accurate and

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
precise results from XRD analysis, one needs to correctly prepared the

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
materials. X-ray diffraction is based on two basic assumptions

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Namely, first that the sample consists of an infinite number of crystallite

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and second that those crystallite are randomly oriented. For semanticists  

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
samples. We need to add a third important point. This is 

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that the sample mineralogy should be preserved

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Altogether this can be summarized as the Rule of Three. First the bugs should

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
be sufficiently fine to have a large number of crystallite able to deflect at any angle.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Second the sample should be mounted such that any other effects

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
are avoided such as preferred orientation. And third the sample

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
mineralogy should be preserved as much as possible. To do this it is often

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
necessary to solve the hydration or hydrate samples.


18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's have a closer look at these three rules.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So now looking at powder fineness in more detail it is obvious that not only

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you have to look at the represent, taking a representative sample but we also need

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
to make a powder whichever, which has a high number of particles that

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
can defect.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If we have a powder that has a large number of fine particles then you get a

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
representative of the measurements in which peaks can be repeatably

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
measurements. Basically this means that in practice

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
particle sizes of about 10 to 20 micrometers or less are required.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ideally even smaller, smaller than 1 to 5 micro meters

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in the graphs on the right side. You can see for instance the effect of material

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
fineness on the XRD patterns. On the

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
upper right, you can see 2 XRD scans of the same

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
material and Alight, synthetic Alight grind for two types.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
One was thirty seconds which resulted in a rod of course Alight with a medium

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
grain size about 36 micro meters. The other one was a long grinding

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
thing of about 20 minutes which resulted in Alight particles of about two tree

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
trimming. You can see that for the sample that has been ground for a

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
longer time. The peaks I read a little bit broader and they are actually, when

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
looking at it in a mathematical way, they are more regular. In fact

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
having two large particles gives something like a spiky pattern and results in

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Misfit's which then again results in larger amounts of

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
unknown or amorphous contents. This can for instance be seen in the

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
figure the lower right there

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
as a function of particle size of the powder, one shows one has

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
the, on the y axis the non-content or amorphous content analyzed by

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
real fact analysis. Here clearly one can see that if one

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
has two large particle size this one is actually measuring

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
a apparent or artificial amorphous content. This is

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
not true and this is actually related to sample misfit's or

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
XRD pattern misfits. So just grinding the sample to the

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
appropriate findings will enable to give you a much more

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
accurate assessment of the amorphous face level. However

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
one should be careful in grinding because extensive dry grinding in a dry medium

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
may lead to a more sization of sensitive soft phases.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So therefore for any phases that cannot be affected.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What grinding is preferable? This can be done on any

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
kind of clinker, Alights, Limestone anhydrous phases for instance by using grinding

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
media like as a propanol or ethanol. However

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
this is not possible for hydrated cements. Even this kind of treatment may

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
change the vulnerable hydrates assemblage, and therefore in those cases

59
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it may be preferable just to gently drying the material and measure it a search or


60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to actually cut a slice from a hydrated cement based and measure depth fresh


61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It should be mentioned as well that spinning this sample in

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the horizontal plane improves the statistics enormously by a factor of about

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
5. So this is definitely to be encouraged

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
or to be advised.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In your data collection strategies in Man-Thing the obtain

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
powders and slices onto the sample holders for quantity XRD following

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
X aspects should really be considered. In flat plate Blake reflection geometry

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
cas should be taken that the sample surface area and thickness are large enough to avoid

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
any beam overflow at low angles. Also too small

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
surface areas will lead to an underestimation of the peak

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
intensities at low angles and thus cause also some

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
diffraction peaks or increased background from the sample holder.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
In case smaller sample holders are used or are only

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
available then one can still say of defectormeter optics by for

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
instance choosing smaller divergent slit especially for

76
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
phrases that show high peaks in low angle regions such as

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
actingguides or AFM phases, this beam over flow problem will lead to an

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
underestimation of their content and quantity phase analysis.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Other requirements are that the mount surface to be flat without

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
roughness and not tilted.

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
In order to avoid peak displacement or broadening associated to do sample hide

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
differences or misalignments. For hydrated cements

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
where we use cut slices we should polish those slices to remove any

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
inhomogeneity at the surface. And also the slice surface

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
should be correct carefully positioned at the A-line sample height for the measurements. Otherwise

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
we will have shifts in peaks positions. It should be clear that the hydrate assemblage

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
of cement and then particularly hydrated cements

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
are sensitive to surface exposure as an example. This

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
figure shows it changes in mineralogy of a fresh slice that was measured

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
before and after a two hour exposure to air inside the defectometer

91
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
not only fresh samples but also samples of which the hydration was stopped are sensitive to air exposure.

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hydration stoppage does reduce the sensitivity so much that it cannot overcome these

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
effect. Most characterization techniques of hydrated cements need the

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
hydration of the cement to be stopped or the sample to be dried.

95
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Even if the hydration stoppage is not strictly necessary for XRD based studies

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
this is common practice mostly for practical reasons.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Arresting the hydration enables sample storage and the characterization of the same sample at the same

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
degree of hydration by different techniques. The primary aim of the

99
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
various available methods for hydration stoppage is that the properties of interest

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
of the hydrating cement, the face composition and case of XRD are preserved as

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
much as possible. To Stop the hydration of cement

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the unbound water present in the killpalary post needs to be removed

103
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
water present in smaller gel pores are chemically bound into the hydration products would

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
preferable to be retained as its removal may really

105
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
cause the alteration of the hydrates or even the decomposition and micro 


106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
structural changes. There are two main ways to remove the water

107
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
either by direct drying techniques such as oven drying, vacuum drying or

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
freezing drying. Or second group of measurements

109
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
by solvent exchange in which water is replaced by an organic solvent.

110
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mostly isopropanol which is then afterwards evaporated.

111
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The figure on the right shows a working principle of the different direct drying techniques

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
in oven drying, the temperature has increased at constant pressure until the phase

113
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
boundary the boiling point is reached and water starts evaporating.

114
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
To the contrary in freeze drying the sample is rapidly cooled by immersion in liquid nitrogen

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and then the frozen water is being removed by decreasing the pressure

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
and then heating the sample until reaching the phase boundary at which the water is removed

117
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
by sublimation. Then, in vacuum

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
drying.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Water is being removed by just reducing the pressure buy a vacuum

120
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
pump and evaporation at low vacuum conditions

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the results of a round robin test and hydration stoppage clearly show

122
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that none of the hydration stopwatch methods leave the hydrates assemblage entirely intact.

123
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
in particular ettringite and AFM phases

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
are affected by dry, oven drying, freeze drying and vacuum drying

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
results in the removal of structural water and thus the decomposition

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
of the ettringite in the AFM phases. Oven drying was observed to

127
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
be more destructive than vacuum drying. And it appears that all daring drying

128
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
methods result in the dehydration of cement hydrates

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
in case of crystalline products. This may lead to decomposition. And then the

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
under-estimation of the face come on the hydration stop samples

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
solvent exchange techniques represent a more gentle way of removing the water

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and that preserves better to microstructure and the hydrates of sample age. In the

133
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Figure, you can see that the ettringite peak can still be recognized quite

134
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
cleanly in the methods that have used solvent exchange.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
However when we look at the quantification results it is clear that also the ettringite

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
is lower in the solvent exchange samples compared to a fresh sample.

137
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
However Portlandite is much more resistant towards hydration surface and remains within the hour


138
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
preserved. The effective hydration stoppage by solvent exchange

139
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
when the hydrates assemblage is illustrated by XRD patterns and quantification results

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
for 28 days hydrated blend cement containing fly ash and limestone as

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
shown in the figures below. A comparison is made here between cuts

142
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
slices and crushed powders that are either measured fresh immediately after

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
cutting or crushing the sample or after hydration stoppage by

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
isopropanol exchange during one week, the cut slices were measured

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
with and without surface polishing to see the effect of this bullshit action.

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You can see that isopropanol exchange during one week resulted in a reduction

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
of the ettringite and Hemmy cub aluminates quantification results of about 50

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
percent. The monocub Illuminati in Portlandite phases appear

149
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
much more resistance to solvent exchange. Sample

150
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
crushing lead to a decrease in monocub aluminates peak intensities and quantities.

151
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And unpolished fresh slices were deficient in Portlandite and contained

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
about one half of percent of calcite more indicating that there was

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
some surface carbonation or decomposition of Portlandite


154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
during the cutting. It should be mentioned as

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
well. That procedure that involve a shorter solvent period

156
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
on finer powders may result in less Portlandite

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
decomposition. This slide really summarizes the advantages and disadvantages

158
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
of working with fresh or dried hydrated cement samples.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The major advantage of measuring on fresh slices is that the hydrate assemblage is practically

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
undisturbed. If one can measure us immediately and rapidly

161
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
this is not possible if that's how the measurements take time or if the machine is not

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
immediately available. On the other hand dried samples resist much more

163
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
a much better combination and offer more flexibility in terms of

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
timing of the measurement and storage of the samples.

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
However also there it is advisable to limit the time between stoppage

166
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and measurements as much as possible. Samples stored for more than

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
two weeks in a protected atmosphere start showing signs of combination on decomposition

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
already. The major downside is thus, that the ettringite and 


169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
AFM reflections are being reduced by any drying operation.

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
In this video we are going to show you how to prepare a sample for

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
XRD analysis the typical sample use are powders


172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
the findings of the powders should be at least in less than 20 micromes and nearly

173
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
one to five microme to ensure a particle statistics. If the

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
samples are not Powderly it, mortar and pestle can be used to communist's

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the sample. Wait Granny's preferred if you want to ground the

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
particles very fine. Another way

177
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
to improve the statistics of the Powder is to spin the sample for

178
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
dried hydrate cement the surface as well as the ages of the

179
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
sample should be removed because they can be carbonated during

180
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
that storage and sample preparation. ForNodine should be the most widely

181
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
used sample preparation method even though it is not the best because of the

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
simplicity of the sample Holder and the sample preparation. Take the

183
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
sample and distribute it into the cavity first parade and sample in

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the cavity with the aid of the sample live at the end playing

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
surface of the powders. Make sure the surface is the most and the powder is

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Packed. Back loading is recommended for powder sample.

187
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
potentials preferred orientation is the preferred

188
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
orientation will be an issue for RIT for analysis even if we can correct it

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Mathematically. It is better to our word during the sample preparation

190
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
clean the state fix the top part of the sample holder on those things

191
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
through the half of the cavity with the powder spread the powder and press

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
everything to make you pack them, then fill the rest space with more

193
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
powder. Further spread the sample in the cavity with the aid of the sample

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Live. At the end. Claim the surface of the powders and remove the

195
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
excess  part. And Mark the top piece and put back

196
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
snore part of the sample holder current over a sample holder

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
turnover the sample holder to get the resist state. Rotate the sample holder or about 10 degree

198
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and then remove it from the States. Clean the ages of the sample

199
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Holder, when there are not enough samples to fill the

200
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
cavity of the sample holder, The so called Zero back one sample holder

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
can be used to support the limited amount of sample. First fix a

202
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
zero mag 1 slice to the sample holder spread the tiny

203
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
amount of sample on disc, try to make a smooth surface if possible

204
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
specifically for hydrate cement paste. The card snipes can be

205
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
directly used for XRD analysis. The refrace 

206
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
flies was proved to be the best Sample stators for hydrate cement and

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
there is no damage for the hydrates that as ettringite. There

208
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
are free Snickers slice at specific ages is polish using a

209
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
number of hundred sandpaper to make sure the surface is flat and

210
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
what's new with distilled water or a piece of tissue is

211
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
immediately covered with slice to prevent the water

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
evaporation.

213
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Know the piece of sample in the sample holder and fix it. In the case of

214
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Fristics the data collection should be done as soon as possible to be Coney 

215
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
within 15 minutes. This is to award a drawing and the combination

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
of the samples.

217
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
However to work with cost slice is more demanding to the availability 

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
of the X-ray of.
