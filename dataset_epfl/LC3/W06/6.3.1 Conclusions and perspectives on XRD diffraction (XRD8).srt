1
00:00:04,11 --> 00:00:09,05
X.Ray diffraction has become a standard 
characterization tool in cement material science. 

3
00:00:09,92 --> 00:00:17,90
If you properly used a wealth of information and cement phase 
composition can be retrieved both qualitatively and quantitatively.

4
00:00:19,49 --> 00:00:25,06
The solace in cement can be quantitatively characterized 
and sample preparation is rather straightforward.

5
00:00:26,39 --> 00:00:31,04
Another advantage is that measurement times are quite short and that XRD materials

6
00:00:31,05 --> 00:00:39,10
is found in most material science labs. 
Even more so it has found application of quality control of

7
00:00:39,11 --> 00:00:42,83
cement production. 
However, one should realize that cement

8
00:00:42,84 --> 00:00:52,59
and hydrate cements are particularly complex  multicomponent materials. 
This leeds to inherent limitations such as an

9
00:00:52,63 --> 00:00:58,17
inaccuracy which is limited to about two to 
three weight percent for major feature such as alite

10
00:00:58,47 --> 00:01:04,13
and one to twenty percent for minor phases. 
Also as in many techniques

11
00:01:04,59 --> 00:01:11,10
when one is going beyond the state of the art or standard 
practice, it is necessary to develop to some extent some

12
00:01:11,14 --> 00:01:12,56
expert knowledge. 

13
00:01:13,57 --> 00:01:18,07
Definitely X. Ray diffraction analysis 
will find an even broader use

14
00:01:18,08 --> 00:01:24,77
and acceptance in the cement science community of the future 
as many more researchers will have access to the equipment

15
00:01:24,91 --> 00:01:30,50
and the supporting data analysis software will 
definitely become even more performant and user friendly.

16
00:01:31,69 --> 00:01:34,66
This will however not mean 
that the cement inherent challenges

17
00:01:34,67 --> 00:01:41,21
and practical problems will disappear. On the contrary, 
even more attention will need to be big through education

18
00:01:41,22 --> 00:01:46,86
and training to save guard the quality of the results
and to realize the full potential effect exactly. 

19
00:01:51,01 --> 00:01:53,33
As an outlook, 
Major changes in XRD analysis

20
00:01:53,34 --> 00:02:01,23
and cements of course difficult to anticipate. However 
the predictable future path of XRD data analysis well

21
00:02:01,41 --> 00:02:03,69
likely involve improvements of current.

22
00:02:03,72 --> 00:02:13,61
Methods and databases to facilitate applicability, 
more automatization and improved reliability, accuracy

23
00:02:13,62 --> 00:02:14,95
and precision of the methods.

24
00:02:16,67 --> 00:02:21,79
In this respect, it's also new a further 
improved crystal structure that will be introduced.

25
00:02:21,98 --> 00:02:27,55
And this were unable to further enhance the accuracy of 
the results and widen the scope of samples

26
00:02:27,56 --> 00:02:28,93
and problems that can be addressed.

27
00:02:30,38 --> 00:02:38,34
It is also to be expected that cross checks the 
XRD results, with other independent techniques become implemented, it

28
00:02:38,35 --> 00:02:44,01
will become used more and more and automized 
in the analysis software packages.

29
00:02:45,18 --> 00:02:50,39
On a more methodological level and Rietvield 
quantification methods such as PONKCS are read for them

30
00:02:50,40 --> 00:02:54,21
but in summation that as a combined 
will be developed further

31
00:02:54,75 --> 00:03:00,52
and adopted to confront the most challenging systems 
that remain today out of reach of the phase analysis by Xray diffraction.

32
00:03:01,03 --> 00:03:06,40
It is clear that the extent the analysis 
of cement still has not reached its full potential

33
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:10,69
and that future developments and 
breakthroughs are still lying ahead.
