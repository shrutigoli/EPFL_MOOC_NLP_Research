00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,260
This lecture concludes the course by

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,600
diving into quantitative phase
analysis

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:09,550
of cement.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,429
First, the standard quantification

5
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,580
approach in the Reitveld method

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,880
is extended to what samples that

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,190
contain the amorphous material.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,799
This we need because many

9
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,479
cements contain and then the
crystalline

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,440
phase

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,970
or an amorphous phase,

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,759
then we give a number of examples

13
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,430
that involve an hydrazine hydrating

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,389
cements along

15
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,610
with some practical guidelines in
the end.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,700
It is very helpful to also have a
look

17
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,980
at a separate demonstration videos

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
in which you can follow such
analysis

19
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,090
step by step.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,609
Let's go back to the intensity
question for

21
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,460
powdered diffraction experiments.

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,779
The scale factor is obtained in the
refinement,

23
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,264
scale linearly

24
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,280
with the phase volume fraction.

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,809
So if you assume that

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,579
the sum of crystalline phases is 100

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,709
percent then the phase weight

28
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,719
fraction can be calculated by
normalizing

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,919
the product of the scale factor

30
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:04,470
with Z the

31
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,579
number of formula units per unit

32
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,740
cell and the mass

33
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,730
per formula unit

34
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,010
and V the unit cell volume,

35
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,620
over all the sum of these products
over

36
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,200
all crystalline phases.

37
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,530
It should be noted that only

38
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,279
relative proportions of weight

39
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,019
fractions can be obtained if the
sample

40
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,790
contains amorphous phases,

41
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,649
or of any additional crystalline
phases

42
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,200
were not included into the Rietveld
refinements.

43
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,319
This approximation is often used in
quantitative

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,260
phase analysis of Portland cement

45
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,280
or Clinker,

46
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,030
one would expect only

47
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:40,039
small or negligible levels

48
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,540
of amorphous face.

49
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,420
However,

50
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,210
this assumption is not valid for

51
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,890
cements containing

52
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,480
SCMs which are mostly amorphous,

53
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,030
for instance as you can see on the

54
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,170
right hand side.

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,990
Different methods were developed

56
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,760
to take into account the presence of

57
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,130
nano crystalline or amorphous
phases,

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,890
presence of these amorphous phases
can be quite

59
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,840
easily seen in the figure on the
right

60
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,310
where you can see the broad amp.

61
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,499
which is indicative for

62
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,000
amorphous phase.

63
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,649
There are several ways to deal

64
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,150
with amorphous content,

65
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,099
here we will consider three
different

66
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,120
approaches.

67
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,429
The first one is to add a known

68
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,469
amount of internal standard into

69
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,419
the sample, this is called the

70
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,830
internal standard approach.

71
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,219
The second one is the external of
standard

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,029
approach in which the quantification

73
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,150
results are rescaled

74
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,049
based on a comparison to a
separately

75
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,669
measured monitor sample,

76
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,520
the external standard.

77
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,619
And then finally, the third method
that will be

78
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,270
introduce is the PONKCS method,

79
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,820
which stands for partially

80
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,650
or non known crystal structure

81
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,250
method.

82
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,559
This method requires separate
calibration

83
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,140
of the amorphous phase,

84
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,970
but on the other hand it enables

85
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,280
the quantification of different

86
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,070
amorphous phases more than one

87
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,810
in the same sample.

88
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,929
The most common approach is the
internal

89
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,220
standard approach.

90
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,329
In fact, in this method it is

91
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,060
required to do spike

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,529
the sample with a known weight
fraction,

93
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,109
known amount of a crystalline

94
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:12,710
standards.

95
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,780
Given expression

96
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,759
shown here on the top can be

97
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,679
used to calculate the absolute phase

98
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,900
weight fractions from

99
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,949
the scale factors. The

100
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,670
index s here identifies

101
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,710
standards,

102
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,510
Ws corresponds

103
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,680
to the Crystallinity

104
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,479
or the purity of internal standard
itself,

105
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,000
and fs to do

106
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,830
weight fraction of the standard that
was

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,390
added to the sample.

108
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,649
Alternatively, the weight fractions

109
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,140
can be calculated using the equation

110
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,800
below,

111
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,230
where the apparent weight

112
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,119
fraction of the internal standard
can

113
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,040
then be for instance

114
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,179
higher than the weight of the
amount,

115
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,979
for instance let's say 25 percent

116
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,560
when we added 20 percent

117
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,080
of Rutile,

118
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,370
and this indicates the presence of

119
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,590
amorphous or unidentified

120
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,069
crystalline material.

121
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,229
Or the second case

122
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,459
is that it can be equal,

123
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,800
so 20 percent for 20 percent

124
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,749
to the weighted amount,

125
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,769
and this indicates that there is no

126
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:14,840
or very little

127
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,149
amorphous or unidentified materials.

128
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,819
And then finding of the third case
is that there is

129
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,469
a lower amount

130
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,990
of standard quantified

131
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,219
than the amount that was weighted,

132
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:26,720
and this is of course

133
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,479
an indication that there was some
problem

134
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,710
in the experiment

135
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,790
or in the data analysis procedure.

136
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,750
The total weight fraction of all
amorphous

137
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,760
and or

138
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,519
unidentified components can

139
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,349
be calculated as a difference
between

140
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,179
the sum of all the crystalline

141
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,470
components

142
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,430
and one. So the

143
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,100
sum of all the crystalline
components

144
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,820
and the difference

145
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,790
with 100 percent is the

146
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,960
amorphous phase friction.

147
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,479
The internal standard method
requires appropriate

148
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,250
sample preparation.

149
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,710
For instance,

150
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,630
it is very important to
homogeneously

151
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,809
mix the standard into the sample.

152
00:05:03,035 --> 00:05:04,354
If the sample

153
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,539
and standard are grounded together,

154
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:07,910
then one should take care

155
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,610
that there is no over-grinding of
the sample

156
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,449
by co grinding

157
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,470
with a harder standard material.

158
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,690
Over-grinding for instance

159
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,910
would lead to pig broadening,

160
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,560
pot broadening and partial

161
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,410
amorphisation creation of amorphous
content

162
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,390
by destroying softer phases

163
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
by the harder ones.

164
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,219
Especially hydrated phase in the
cement

165
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,319
base are vulnerable to this kind

166
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,430
of decomposition.

167
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,610
Not only by grinding

168
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,980
but also by dehydration in
combination

169
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,470
one make would really change

170
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,050
the hydrate assemblage

171
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,220
and one would not measure the
original

172
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,530
content of the hydrated sample.

173
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,190
Another property

174
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,140
is that the internal standard

175
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,050
should be of known crysallinity.

176
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,339
This actually means that this
amorphous content

177
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,390
should be known

178
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,000
and should not be present in the
sample.

179
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,680
Preferably,

180
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,419
standard materials should have a
high crystal

181
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,680
structure symmetry

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,325
and at peak should not overlap

183
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,589
with the main reflection peaks

184
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,480
and the phases present in the
material.

185
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,520
And in addition,

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,769
it's also good if there is no micro

187
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,780
absorption problems that

188
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,910
would occur, for instance if there's
a large

189
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,830
X-ray absorption contrast between

190
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,419
the phases in your sample

191
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:21,917
and the standard.

192
00:06:23,394 --> 00:06:25,049
If this would

193
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,660
be the case the micro absorption

194
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,430
problems may occur

195
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,410
and one would have a falsified

196
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,930
or a biased quantification.

197
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,670
The obtainable accuracy

198
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,319
of the quantification of the
amorphous

199
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,780
and unknown phases strongly depends

200
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,280
on the amount of internal standard
addict.

201
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,259
Small quantities

202
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,509
of amorphous phase of a few percent
are

203
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,790
therefore very difficult to quantify

204
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:49,900
precisely,

205
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:52,670
while higher levels

206
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,059
can be quantified

207
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,680
with greater accuracy.

208
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,010
For hydrating cements

209
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,169
that may contain between about

210
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,660
30 and 60 percent of amorphous

211
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,290
and then a crystalline phases,

212
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,820
a good compromise between accuracy

213
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,890
on both amorphous

214
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,749
and crystalline phases would

215
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,119
be to use additions

216
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
of internal standard of around 28

217
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,090
percent.

218
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,090
And it has been demonstrated that
the presence

219
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,189
of a significant amount of internal

220
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,259
standard inside a hydrating

221
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,414
base itself changes

222
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,269
the kinetics of the hydration by a
filler

223
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,630
effect, it is therefore best

224
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,550
not to include the standard

225
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,720
in the sample,

226
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,960
and instead to include a sample

227
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,849
or add the sample after stopping the

228
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,510
hydration.

229
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,670
And mixing the sample into the
hydrated

230
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,130
material,

231
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,339
you should be very careful

232
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,989
not to alter the hydration products

233
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,969
and therefore the mixing operations

234
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,380
should be thorough

235
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,820
but gentle,

236
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,189
and sample exposure to air should be

237
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,590
as limited as much as possible.

238
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,679
Since this can be quite tedious

239
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,360
to do in practice,

240
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,809
perhaps the less labor

241
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,000
intensive external standard method

242
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,580
is preferable for routine

243
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,360
analysis.

244
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,969
In the external standard approach
phase quantification

245
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,490
is carried out through the
comparison

246
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,544
of the phase scale factors of a

247
00:08:20,742 --> 00:08:22,320
sample through the scale factor

248
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,640
of a well-characterized standard
material

249
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,160
measured under identical

250
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,900
diffractometer measuring conditions.

251
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,970
In this procedure also the different
mass

252
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,658
absorption coefficients of the
sample

253
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:36,260
µm and the standard µs

254
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,189
need to be taken into account.

255
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,499
As can be seen in the expression
given

256
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:41,550
here,

257
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,530
the Ws

258
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,419
the weight fraction of the standard
phase in the external

259
00:08:46,615 --> 00:08:48,370
cement material is also

260
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,240
to be known.

261
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,044
Although the obvious advantage of

262
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,730
the method to this external

263
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,379
standard method is that the sample
does not

264
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,820
need to be intermixed

265
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,790
with an internal standard

266
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,060
and it does avoid

267
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,709
some preparation

268
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,080
and homogenization problems.

269
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,690
This approach needs to

270
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,349
does demand the

271
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:11,380
MACs subscript coefficient

272
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,760
of the sample to be known.

273
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,249
In the most practical of ways

274
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,440
it is obtained by calculating the

275
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,560
MACs subscript coefficient for the

276
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,100
use X-ray wavelengths

277
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,870
or the chemical composition.

278
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,600
This can be seen for instance in the
table

279
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,180
here where for each oxides

280
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,560
from the chemical composition

281
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,754
one has the MAC the

282
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:33,700
MACs of subscript coefficient given

283
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,160
for copper k alpha

284
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,210
radiation.

285
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,230
The linear combination of the mass
subscript

286
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,890
coefficients with the mass fractions

287
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,200
will enable you to measure the

288
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,939
mass absorption coefficient of that
sample.

289
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
In the table

290
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,110
one can see the

291
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,300
calculation done for a white cement

292
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,560
which was not hydrated,

293
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,640
which comes from MAC of about 101.5

294
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,470
square centimeters program

295
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,454
one can also see how it's calculated

296
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,100
for a slag,

297
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,450
as the slag contains less calcium

298
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,670
which is a x-ray absorbing

299
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,040
compound because it's heavier

300
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,900
than, for instance the silicon.

301
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,780
One can see up here the

302
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,240
total mass absorption coefficient

303
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,430
is lower in the slag than

304
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,229
for the white

305
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,910
cement. For a hydrated white cement,

306
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,160
for instance on showing in the last
column

307
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,409
one can see that this next to the
cements

308
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,050
content there's also water

309
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,770
in there.

310
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,230
So, calculating the mass

311
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,330
absorption coefficient of the total
mix

312
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,279
will show that the for

313
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,760
hydrated mix the mass absorption
coefficient

314
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,690
is quite a lot lower.

315
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,469
A promising development is a
so-called

316
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,820
PONKCS method,

317
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,619
which stands for 'Partial Or No

318
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,930
Known Crystal Structure approach.

319
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,899
This methods takes into account the

320
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,669
contribution of a phase that has no

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,780
or no known

322
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,770
crystal structure by calibration of
a phase constant,

323
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,050
which is shown

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,620
below.

325
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,849
This phase constant can then be used

326
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,859
in combination with the refined
skill factor

327
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,139
to calculate the phase weight

328
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,840
fraction and on mixes.

329
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,129
This method was recently applied to
the quantification

330
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,020
of the grief reaction of the
metalkeline of

331
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,300
the activated systems,

332
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,430
but also to the quantification of

333
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,496
CSH by SID

334
00:11:23,773 --> 00:11:25,810
in the early hydration of Alite.

335
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:27,980
The precision

336
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,170
and accuracy of the PONKCS methods

337
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,269
was that by making

338
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,390
muddled mixes of cement

339
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,329
and SCMs,

340
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,909
as for instance shown in

341
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,660
this graph.

342
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,420
You then mix of 40 percent

343
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,039
Portland cement and 60 percent

344
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,029
slag is shown,

345
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,890
one can clearly see

346
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,019
the crystalline phases in green from

347
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,920
the cement

348
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,320
and the slag contribution

349
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,089
in black in the x

350
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:53,959
ray diffraction pattern.

351
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,510
The weighed in

352
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
amount here is 60 percent,

353
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,030
by calibrating separately the slag

354
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,549
and calibrating the phase constant
for

355
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,230
the slag and using it in

356
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,779
a PONKCS method approach,

357
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,310
one can actually measure

358
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,970
directly the amount of

359
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,940
slag in the sample.

360
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,710
As you can see on the right hand
side

361
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,939
the results were very good,

362
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,159
we measured using the PONKCS

363
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:21,999
method at about 58.2%

364
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,530
of slag, while we weighed

365
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,150
in about 59 percent.

366
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,240
So in general for mixes

367
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,670
in which the SCMs were the

368
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,040
only unknown amorphous component

369
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,720
next to a number of

370
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,589
crystalline phases,

371
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,870
and excellent precision

372
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,849
is obtained of around

373
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,620
1 weight percent

374
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,719
and the accuracy over a large

375
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,759
number of samples was about 2

376
00:12:49,055 --> 00:12:49,900
- 3 weight percent.

377
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,570
In more complex mixes the arrows

378
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,399
and detection limits are expected to

379
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,420
be larger.

380
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,089
A particular difficulty in
decomposing

381
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,580
hydrated systems is

382
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,019
acquiring a suitable

383
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,180
model for the CSH phase,

384
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,499
the figure shown here

385
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,199
you can see a white Portland

386
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,450
cement hydrated for seven years,

387
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,169
that was mixed

388
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,919
with a known amount of metalkline.

389
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,800
You can see

390
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,629
you can recognize some of the
crystalline

391
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,230
phases present in the hydrated

392
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,950
Portland cement such as

393
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,759
Ettringite or Portlandite,

394
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,670
and you can see also in green

395
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,890
contribution by the CSH phase

396
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,750
and in yellow contribution

397
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,020
by metalkline.

398
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,000
Again when we did the analysis

399
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,580
by PONKCS it curiously

400
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,699
and precision were very good,

401
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,740
this was mainly because

402
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,020
the CSH was the only

403
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,700
amorphous phase in the hydrating
cement

404
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,880
and we could construct a

405
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,359
CSH peak module that fitted

406
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
nicely

407
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,389
and could be used to decompose

408
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:54,300
also modeling mixes,

409
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,779
so meaning the hydrated

410
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,910
cement with a known amount of

411
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,800
slag or metalkaline

412
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,030
and so on and so forth.

413
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,260
However,

414
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,560
the situation unfortunately becomes
more complex

415
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,110
when we have different kinds of CSH

416
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,580
formed and blended cements

417
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,170
of different composition,

418
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,389
and therefore the peak profiles

419
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,206
such as chase

420
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:16,890
or there's the presence of

421
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,729
other amorphous phases that can

422
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,410
actually limit

423
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,510
or bias the quantification.

424
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,080
In blends

425
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:24,680
however,

426
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,140
synthetic bleds

427
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,059
the method can be used very well as
shown

428
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,350
in the figure here.

429
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,740
Method is an excellent correlation
of the

430
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,730
weighted amount of SCM

431
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,230
on the x axis

432
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,730
and the measured amount by

433
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,190
PONKCS analysis on the y axis.

434
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,309
This may be very useful for instance
in process

435
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,479
control, in the

436
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,769
production of tannery

437
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,810
or quaternary blended cements

438
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,120
where one needs to check whether

439
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,370
the mixing has been done

440
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,220
correctly.

441
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,752
Traditional XRD quantitative phase
analysis

442
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,589
method were based on

443
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,030
single peak heights

444
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:03,220
or on single peak

445
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,600
integrated heights

446
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,459
and one compared these heights

447
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,529
to the height of an internal
standard.

448
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,539
This has not been

449
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,179
very successful for cements,

450
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,439
why this has been introduced

451
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,460
before,

452
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,310
this is because there is a high
degree of overlap

453
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,590
between the main peaks of the major
phases,

454
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,764
and this gives significant

455
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,720
problems and significant error

456
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,730
when applying such simple methods.

457
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,429
There are a number of additional
problems such

458
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,869
as variability in composition

459
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,269
and crystal structure such as

460
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,129
the presence of polymorphs that
could

461
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,019
actually cause significant
variations

462
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,760
in peak positions

463
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,110
and also intensities.

464
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,450
For instance in the case of Portland
cements

465
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,449
one knows that there is a lot of
solid solution,

466
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:49,330
substitution of minor elements

467
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:49,754
such as alkalies

468
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,539
or magnesium or sulfate in

469
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,670
the major phases

470
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:55,810
and this is common

471
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,039
and it leads often to the
stabilization

472
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,499
of different polymorph which

473
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,660
is then difficult to relate

474
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,300
to a certain quantity.

475
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,969
Therefore, the development of hope

476
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,320
by the fitting methods

477
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,960
such as the Rietveld method

478
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,879
as enable to largely overcome most

479
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
of these peak overlap problems

480
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,329
and it has found such widespread

481
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,730
application.

482
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,419
Since the phase composition

483
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,550
such as the Alite content

484
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,769
can be related to properties such as

485
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,910
strength development

486
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,870
or durability,

487
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,660
these kind of XRD analysis

488
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,309
by the Rietveld method have found

489
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,439
really a lot of use in both

490
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,030
cement research

491
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,140
and production quality control.

492
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,950
For instance,

493
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,890
this figures shown here shows

494
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,470
a monitoring of Alite,

495
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,730
Belite and free lime contents

496
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,979
by XRD during a period of

497
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,539
Portland cement production of an
industrial

498
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,410
site.

499
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,989
And here you can clearly see that at
some point

500
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,180
there was some

501
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,520
for instance temperature lowering
the kill

502
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,169
and we can't see a drop in Alite
levels,

503
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,989
free lime coming

504
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,190
up and Belite increasing

505
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:04,730
as well.

506
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,279
As step by step demonstration

507
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:09,140
of phase quantification of

508
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,240
anhydrous cement will be shown

509
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,400
in one of the demonstration videos.

510
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,010
As we already did

511
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,750
identification of the cement,

512
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,769
now we need to import into the
structure

513
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,360
for each phases.

514
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,090
First,

515
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,399
import an inter phases for
refinement,

516
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,919
and put a structure for C3S

517
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,300
as seems in

518
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,030
name for each phase,

519
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,740
the scale factor,

520
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,559
units cell, and profile should

521
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,159
be refined. constreams

522
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,719
of one percentage of evaluation on
the unit

523
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:40,150
sell would be applied

524
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,930
to secure refinement.

525
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,053
Limit of 0.0001 to 0.2 to the
profile partly was applied.

526
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:51,700
The

527
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,580
application of constreams to

528
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,930
the refined parameters.

529
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,009
We will improve the stability of the
overall

530
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,734
refinements when

531
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:00,879
especially we are analyzing complex

532
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,690
samples such as the hydrated cement.

533
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,539
Do the same steps for the rest

534
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,000
phases, for example

535
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,630
the C2S, C3S

536
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,690
and C4F as well as some

537
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,760
other matter of phases.

538
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,390
And we keep the

539
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,930
two most common existed polymorphs

540
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,960
for C3A

541
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,340
namely that Kubic

542
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,129
and rhombic ones.

543
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:24,390
Alternatively,

544
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,770
if you already

545
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,019
have HPF file

546
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,540
with old phases you can

547
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,320
also copies the phases from one HPF

548
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,960
file to another.

549
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,940
Right click the phase,

550
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,889
copy to the new HPF file you need,

551
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,999
when we set

552
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,439
on the limits and the parameters

553
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,540
to be refined in the template,

554
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,490
in a template

555
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,079
with HPF file previously using

556
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,240
the same steps,

557
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,880
check all the parameters

558
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,654
for the phases. Secondly,

559
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:55,997
set a global parameters

560
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,520
as spaceman

561
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,070
displacement background function

562
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,320
are your need to find,

563
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,729
for the background functions the
polynomial

564
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,479
function with five point for
instance

565
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:10,389
were used.

566
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,730
We use manual mode for refinement

567
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,100
as ordinals of all parameters were
set

568
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,640
manually.

569
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,790
After all the parameters were set,

570
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,009
refinement can be easy created by
pressing

571
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,760
the refinement button here.

572
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:26,700
After the first rung,

573
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,739
you can see that there is no much
cubics

574
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,170
history here of cement.

575
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,970
Now we can kick it out for further
refinement,

576
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,209
as we have so many phases

577
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,049
in cement, it takes several ortho

578
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,910
to reach the global minimum for
refinement.

579
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,160
Open there additional graphics for

580
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,260
different plot to

581
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,380
uniquely check the fitting.

582
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,249
The most common mismatching is from
the

583
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,100
cloud or the peaks around 32
degrees.

584
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,289
In this range we have the main peaks

585
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,560
for C3S

586
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,439
and of course some other peaks which

587
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,210
were overlapped.

588
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,489
The mismatch is mainly because of
the preferred

589
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,560
orientation of C3S here,

590
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,779
we can find our direction by
pointing

591
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,039
the mouse down to the peak which is
not

592
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,900
well fitted.

593
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,719
Here is 60-6

594
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:14,779
plain for M3 Alite,

595
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:18,080
to set preferred

596
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,614
orientation you can check you

597
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,619
can click on C3S in the refinement

598
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,360
control then in the optic

599
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,020
inspector for C3S

600
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,970
you will find the item called

601
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:28,899
preferred orientation,

602
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:31,689
the much dollars module

603
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:32,790
is recommended.

604
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,659
Specify the direction H3F

605
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,939
HK Air of the

606
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,690
plain for the preferred orientation.

607
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,290
After setting the direction check
the

608
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,219
refinement for a much taller factor,

609
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,609
similar tools out of parameters,

610
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,440
we put

611
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,740
the limits for the refinement of

612
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,339
0.721 the value

613
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,210
1 means there is no preferred

614
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,100
orientation at all, the smaller

615
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,260
the more preferred orientation.

616
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,369
In most of the cases 0.07

617
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,180
should be low enough

618
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,160
if the value is too small

619
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,710
which means the sampling is not real
done

620
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,930
a reputation of the XRD pattern

621
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,640
connection

622
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,379
with more attention on reducing the
preferred

623
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,360
orientation in this case

624
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,560
is recommended.

625
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,929
By refining refitting of

626
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,129
this peak is much improved.

627
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,079
A lot of

628
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,094
phase can be easily preferred

629
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,330
orientated is the anhydride

630
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,270
do the same for the preferred
orientation

631
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,070
of anhydride for the

632
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,099
for the two 00 direction

633
00:21:35,705 --> 00:21:37,289
refinement, early some

634
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,540
improvement for the goodness of
fitting

635
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,330
and we did R profile.

636
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,439
The R W P value is

637
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,340
now 6.9467

638
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:47,969
showing the additional graphics.

639
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,840
By pressing the button

640
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,819
with percentage you have zero
quantitative

641
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,550
data or output in THT file

642
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,770
in the default high scores

643
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,990
high school folder.

644
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,099
Here we don't consider a morphs
content

645
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,209
in anhydride cement,

646
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,749
as it is the same

647
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,370
one which

648
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,150
with lower morphs which is essence
splendid.

649
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,470
If we spiken the flash

650
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,829
with a lower amount of standard,

651
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,649
we will be able to determine

652
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,260
the morphs content based on the
Spike

653
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,209
and the refined amount of

654
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,885
the standard. Here we mix 15%

655
00:22:24,818 --> 00:22:28,050
of Rutile

656
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,000
with opflag

657
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,370
open the skin then inserts

658
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,280
of phases we need namely the

659
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,770
molet,

660
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,590
codes in the flash

661
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:37,550
and a tool

662
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,860
and Rutile which is the standard

663
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,580
we mixed.

664
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,129
All the parameters need need to

665
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,170
be refined for the phases,

666
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,580
skill factor,

667
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,730
unit cell,

668
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,860
and the profile,

669
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,140
then a set of global variables,

670
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,689
specimen displacement.

671
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:55,174
For the background we

672
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,319
need to change the method to use

673
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,269
a bit of a background then

674
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,590
manually determine it.

675
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,740
Let's change the skill of the Y-axis

676
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,539
to north skew to see more

677
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,190
details on the background,

678
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,809
by adapting the granularity

679
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:10,399
of the blending factor,

680
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,790
we can get the background function
following

681
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:13,879
the train of same set of patterns.

682
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,850
Mixture at the background

683
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,910
should never go into the peaks.

684
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,150
When satisfied

685
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,150
with the background function we can

686
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:23,210
accept the background.

687
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,580
Now you execute the refinement.

688
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:28,020
The overall fitting is quite good

689
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,679
when checking in details,

690
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,490
we can see zero

691
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,199
sum peaks which is not real fitted,

692
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,090
for example the peak at

693
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,619
27.4 degrees

694
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,229
the main peak for

695
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:40,900
Rutile.

696
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,990
When placing the mouse onto the peak

697
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,919
it shows H K area of the
corresponding

698
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,900
peaks for the phase.

699
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,179
Here is the one one all blame

700
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,489
for Rutile, actually this is

701
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:53,955
a preferred orientation of the
Rutile.

702
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:58,310
When the preferred orientation is

703
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,200
sets much

704
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,030
dollase factor to refine.

705
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,730
Now the refinement is done with an

706
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,520
R W P value

707
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,149
or about 5.8 percentage,

708
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:10,650
which is very good.

709
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,639
To show the result in internal

710
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:14,150
standard,

711
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,339
go to customize fitting Rietveld

712
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,270
panel,

713
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,250
change the show to

714
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,130
which percentage tool has received.

715
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,599
Here we have three options;

716
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,290
normal refers to the default

717
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,470
route for output,

718
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,650
has received means being

719
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,304
normalized the internal standard

720
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,539
results. Finally,

721
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,120
the external low factor corrected

722
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,429
means the results based on internal

723
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,439
low standard. The last

724
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:41,630
step is to specify how much

725
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,150
internal standard we added

726
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,860
through the Rutile internal control,

727
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,339
locates general phase information,

728
00:24:48,205 --> 00:24:49,939
there are there we have

729
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,950
the item called standard weight

730
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,640
percentage.

731
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,070
Types of actual weight, amount,

732
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,064
here is 48.1 as

733
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,493
a crystalinity of the Rutile we

734
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,579
use is 196.2.

735
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,850
Now the final results

736
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,939
show means analyzed view window,

737
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,270
exported data are using the weak
percentage button,

738
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,909
or simply load it down.

739
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,070
The basic

740
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,789
for external standard is that

741
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,950
the K factor can be determined

742
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,090
using the external standard

743
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,600
measured under the same condition.

744
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,134
Then the absolute content of the
crystalline

745
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,949
phases can be calculated using

746
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,720
the K factor method.

747
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,089
For Ks of the external standard
method,

748
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:33,369
you will need to insert the
patterns,

749
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,170
one for the sample

750
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:36,610
and another for the standard.

751
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,220
And we also need to know the

752
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,590
chemical composition for the sample

753
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,339
to compute the mass absorption

754
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,494
coefficient, the mac value.

755
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,859
The calculation was

756
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,840
provided in the template file.

757
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:51,969
Step 1: Refine

758
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,690
the flyash pattern,

759
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,914
open a scheme for flyash, insert the
phases,

760
00:25:56,887 --> 00:25:58,580
name it Quartz

761
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,330
the moon light, change

762
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,260
the name of the phases.

763
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,169
Manually determine the background,

764
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:10,389
make sure the background is
following the

765
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,060
lowest point of the pattern

766
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,049
but it should not go into the peaks.

767
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,469
change the background

768
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,650
and function from polynomial to

769
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,610
use a variable.

770
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,250
For simpled Rietveld refinement

771
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,139
system with few phases,

772
00:26:23,725 --> 00:26:24,489
we can start

773
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,130
with the automatic Rietveld
refinements

774
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,110
by clicking on the default Rietveld.

775
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,442
Now, automatic Rietveld we will

776
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,560
refine the field,

777
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:33,969
units skill

778
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,900
and the profile step by step.

779
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,990
After several rounds of automatic
refinement

780
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,969
then change the refinement to manual

781
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,430
mode to further refine the pattern.

782
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,259
Take a look at a peak at 16.5

783
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,470
degrees, now feel the peak

784
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,599
is because of the preferred
orientation of

785
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,150
course at 10-1 plain.

786
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,120
Sets the direction of the preferred
orientation

787
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,710
and set for refinement.

788
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,929
Also at limit for the preferred

789
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,381
orientation, then execute the file,

790
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,420
saves

791
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,670
the HPF file.

792
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,980
Step 2: calculate

793
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,180
and the K factor used in the
standard scan,

794
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,610
create a new file name the inserts

795
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,500
without scan,

796
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,874
there is only one phase in the
Rutile

797
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,760
this sort of face.

798
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,540
The standard scan is quite a simple
scan

799
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,070
to refine so the automatic route

800
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,530
for refinement is enough.

801
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,899
Save for the rung in the default
root field

802
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,700
of refinement is recommended

803
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,560
to get a global minimum.

804
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,779
After refinement saves the HPF

805
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,820
file under the same folder

806
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,040
as a sample we analyzed.

807
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,929
You may notice that I didn't refine

808
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,300
the preferred orientation for the
Rutile,

809
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,250
the standard was pressed

810
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,160
on purpose. You have some preferred
orientation

811
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,109
to compensate the amorphous content
in

812
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,860
the standard.

813
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,884
The Rutile we used contain 3.8

814
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,420
percentage of morphines content

815
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,739
that deliberately introduced
preferred

816
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,870
orientation results in

817
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,710
a K factor which is 100 percentage

818
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,870
of crystalline Rutile.

819
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,770
To present the rutule external
standard results,

820
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,734
go to customize form one

821
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:09,769
settings,

822
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,549
fitting Rietveld panel,

823
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:13,099
then you have three

824
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,800
choices to choose a week percentage,

825
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,170
normal as received

826
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,570
or external k factor corrected.

827
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,909
Take the external k factor corrected

828
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:25,010
for the external standard method.

829
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,950
Here the three choices are

830
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,342
normal, referred to as default
Rietveld output by

831
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,594
normalizing all crystalline phases
to

832
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,660
100 percentage.

833
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,339
As received means,

834
00:28:37,505 --> 00:28:39,229
as we normalized into low standard

835
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,750
results by taking out the standard.

836
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,969
Finally, the external k factor

837
00:28:44,495 --> 00:28:46,460
corrected means the results

838
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,100
based on external standard.

839
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,010
Now we have an amorphous content
shown in an

840
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,829
analyze view window,

841
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,739
the value is

842
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,659
strange now, as the K factor is not

843
00:28:57,085 --> 00:28:57,509
updated yet.

844
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,510
We can check the K factors in
decustomised

845
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,180
default,

846
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,239
external low standard,

847
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,579
the K factor is a global parameters

848
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,530
for the high school plus,

849
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,379
which means we have to update it
whenever

850
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,720
the value is changed around the

851
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,519
place to find out the value of the K

852
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,590
factor is

853
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,490
here.

854
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,710
Click on the phase Rutile,

855
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,779
in Object inspector you

856
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,640
can find the derived data

857
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
where the K factor is located.

858
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:26,749
For this standard the K factor

859
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:27,739
is 791.28,

860
00:29:29,765 --> 00:29:29,815
right

861
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,110
click on the K factor

862
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,010
and then choose take current

863
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,400
K factor as standard.

864
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,880
Now you should see the 0

865
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,179
percent of the morphines for the
standard,

866
00:29:41,765 --> 00:29:43,424
which means that the k factor is

867
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:44,540
the right one.

868
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,220
Step three,

869
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,049
updates the Mac for the flyash,

870
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:50,389
after updating the K factor,

871
00:29:50,795 --> 00:29:52,099
go back to your flyash scan,

872
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:54,509
there is a value for the morphs

873
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,830
content as values

874
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,310
and is not valid.

875
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,400
because of MAC value here is not
updated

876
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:01,990
yet.

877
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,730
Click on the global variables

878
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:07,190
in the Object Inspector find

879
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,592
the custom mixture MAC under
agreement indices,

880
00:30:09,716 --> 00:30:10,839
change

881
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,920
the value to the calculate one using

882
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,380
SRF results.

883
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,584
Here is the Excel used to

884
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,170
calculate the Mac plus the cement
unit

885
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,080
materials.

886
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,239
You can also calculate the Mac using
the high

887
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,984
score plus Mac calculator in the

888
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,050
tools menu.

889
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,749
In the Mac calculator you can find
all

890
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:31,829
the Mac values you need,

891
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,290
the fundamental behen

892
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,980
is the same.

893
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,959
Update the Mac to 39.91

894
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,480
for the flyash,

895
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,430
now the amorphous content is
correct.

896
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,020
Next to analyzing

897
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,609
and anhydride cement of course also

898
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,619
times series of hydrating cements
can

899
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:46,949
be analyzed.

900
00:30:47,725 --> 00:30:49,260
Here the figure shows the 3D

901
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,300
stack of XRD measurements

902
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,590
of a hydrating zeolite

903
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:54,370
blended cements.

904
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,549
You can clearly see the formation

905
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:58,820
of cement hydrates such as

906
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,509
Ehtrengite and Portlandite,

907
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,289
while Clinker phases

908
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,419
and Clanotelite Zeolite are

909
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,530
being consumed.

910
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,620
Processing these data

911
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,330
and by rietveld analysis,

912
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,060
gives you quantitative results on
the consumption

913
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,860
and formation of the solid phases,

914
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,149
and these data can then be used on

915
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,310
its turn as input

916
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,930
for hydration models

917
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,360
or to establish reaction mechanisms.

918
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,140
The video demonstration will show
you

919
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,090
step-by-step face quantification of
a

920
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:28,579
hydrated cement.

921
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,299
Advice you have a look at this,

922
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,084
this will show you the

923
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,870
major difficulties

924
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,420
and the major steps to be taken

925
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,150
in the hydrate

926
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,360
cement. The hydrate cement is a much
more complex

927
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,420
compared to the anhydride cement.

928
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,844
The existence of lynon crystalline
sulphate,

929
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:46,907
the

930
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,560
main hydrate of cements

931
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,850
is a first challenge for the
quantity of

932
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,480
collapses.

933
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,020
In most of the hydrated cement

934
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,100
or Blinked cement,

935
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,929
there are some there are also some

936
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,550
minor phases

937
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,919
which bring more difficulties for

938
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,630
the reflector analysis.

939
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,839
As the existence of the amorphous
phases,

940
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:08,649
here's a nylon crystalline sachet in
the examples,

941
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,619
the quantification

942
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:13,989
the quantitative analysis of
hydrated

943
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,970
cements needs to be done

944
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,410
with a internal standard

945
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,780
or external standard method.

946
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,960
The Rietveld analysis for hydrates
is

947
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,559
based on the analyze of that hydrate

948
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,400
cement.

949
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,169
Open the analyzed HPF file for the
hydrate

950
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,654
cement, you remove the scan for the
hydrate

951
00:32:32,462 --> 00:32:32,512
cement,

952
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:35,262
then insert the scan for the
anhydride cement.

953
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,690
For the refinements,

954
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,060
the refined will be constrained

955
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,310
within the range of 7 degrees to

956
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:42,840
the end.

957
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,650
Go to analyzed menu, fittings, edit

958
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,400
excluded regions,

959
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,980
create a new exclude region

960
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,750
from 0 - 7 degrees.

961
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,069
In this file,

962
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,290
we already have all the thinker
phases

963
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,899
so we need new phases for

964
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,874
the hydrides namely the Portland,

965
00:33:01,912 --> 00:33:03,860
Ettringite etc..

966
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,829
We can import a phase directed

967
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,400
from the save files,

968
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,339
or we can copy the phases we

969
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,929
need from the templates

970
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,310
where we already have the phases.

971
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,139
The reason we use refined

972
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,269
phase from

973
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,370
the same cement is that

974
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,979
all the clinker phases will be
constrained

975
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,540
to use in the same cell parameters

976
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,780
and profile only the skill factor

977
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,570
will be refined in the hydrated

978
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,230
cement.

979
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,200
I apply such constraint

980
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,820
the refinement of the hydrated
cement

981
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,649
is more stable as a large

982
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,030
number of phases presented.

983
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,189
Specifically all the preferred

984
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:46,540
orientation of the Clinker phases
should be removed

985
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,340
and set to default one.

986
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,270
Removes the refined flak for the
outer

987
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,160
cklinker phases namely

988
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:53,989
the unit cell,

989
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,920
profile.

990
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,350
Now hydrate will be dissolved
quickly

991
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,190
within the first day,

992
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,119
so we also removed

993
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,720
it.

994
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,109
Right click any space in the
refinement

995
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,090
control, collapse Root Note.

996
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,600
For the high treat namely
Portlandite

997
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:12,290
the refinement unit cell,

998
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,610
profile as well as a skill factor

999
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,570
first, we will do

1000
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,069
a final check of the refinement

1001
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,460
of the Portlandite by refining the

1002
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,479
preferred orientation.

1003
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,610
Similar rules as will be applied to
the Entrendite,

1004
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,400
as you can see the polynomial
function

1005
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,180
is not powerful enough to fix a

1006
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,594
wide hump from the surges contribute

1007
00:34:32,722 --> 00:34:33,705
in the hydrated cement.

1008
00:34:33,776 --> 00:34:33,826
So

1009
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,380
we changed the background function
to

1010
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,740
manually determine one,

1011
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,130
click the global variable,

1012
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,590
then background, change the type of
background

1013
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,840
function in the object inspector

1014
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,939
from polynomial to use available

1015
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,190
background. In this way

1016
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,839
we can define the background
function

1017
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,830
by ourselves using the determined
background

1018
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,800
by changing the granularity

1019
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,019
and bending factors,

1020
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,110
we should have our background curve

1021
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,879
following the lowest background of
the pattern.

1022
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:04,285
Refinement thing use to get

1023
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,589
much better in fitting of the
pattern,

1024
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:11,730
it refined a preferred

1025
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,799
orientation of the of the

1026
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,570
portlandite.

1027
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,069
Now the fitting is much better
except

1028
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,349
the classical of peaks at around 29

1029
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,430
degrees,

1030
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,704
we will deal with this later, as it
is mainly for the sachet nano

1031
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:21,989
crystal hump. Overall, the manually
determined

1032
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,440
background works for the hydrides

1033
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:31,979
after refinement of the pattern,

1034
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,470
we can output the result.

1035
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,730
Now two steps,

1036
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,250
update the mac value for the sample,

1037
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,690
update the K factor.

1038
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,900
Find out the calculated mac

1039
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,654
for the hydrated cement,

1040
00:35:44,177 --> 00:35:44,969
here is 72.03,

1041
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:47,414
in high score

1042
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:49,489
box click on the global variable it

1043
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,150
will you

1044
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,409
the object inspector.

1045
00:35:53,295 --> 00:35:55,084
In our agreement indices

1046
00:35:55,182 --> 00:35:56,819
you can

1047
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,460
find the item called custom

1048
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,009
mixture mac,

1049
00:36:00,555 --> 00:36:01,780
update the value

1050
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,000
to the calculated one,

1051
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,280
here is 72.03.

1052
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,270
The K factor was obtained within a

1053
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,023
scan or Rutile under the same
condition as the sample scan

1054
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,069
within the same day.

1055
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,590
Inside the Rutile scan,

1056
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,920
copies of phase Rutile to the Rutile
scan,

1057
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,560
then you click the profile

1058
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,000
feed,

1059
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,080
default rietveld

1060
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,370
twice.

1061
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,679
Now you should be able to see

1062
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,110
the amorphous content

1063
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,850
update K factor,

1064
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,599
where we updates the K factor in

1065
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,530
the system showing you

1066
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,740
and there are amorphous for the
standard

1067
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,659
which means that you have the
correct

1068
00:36:41,915 --> 00:36:43,490
K factor for this measurement.

1069
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,190
To export results,

1070
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,139
we should actively the sample scan

1071
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,720
by double clicking the scan in

1072
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,680
scan list,

1073
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,020
and then click the button

1074
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,450
with percentage external standard.

1075
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,150
This is a customized exporting
pattern

1076
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,829
and you can find a way

1077
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,899
to configure the button in hip
files,

1078
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:06,899
otherwise no

1079
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:09,640
longer value showing on fitted
window.

1080
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,350
It's make our duplicate of the
defined

1081
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,700
scan and label it as say

1082
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,710
PC 28 days.

1083
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,779
This is their technique to optimize

1084
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,640
fitting of

1085
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,169
the fitting for such a hump.

1086
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,150
Instead of using the manual
background

1087
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,239
we can introduce a profile for
sensage,

1088
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:29,289
the profile was obtained

1089
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,419
by fitting wall cement hydrate for

1090
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,329
seven years using the 14

1091
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,350
angstrom to promote the structure.

1092
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,719
The extracted profile only
contribute

1093
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,459
to the background fitting result

1094
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,099
quantitative analysis without
quantitative

1095
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,600
information.

1096
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,140
We will only refine your skill
factor

1097
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,920
was the extracted profile

1098
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,780
for the sensage,

1099
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,060
but keep all the other parameters

1100
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,709
constant, as in general

1101
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,070
most of the suasage amp are

1102
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:56,500
similar.

1103
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,370
The background function can be
simplified

1104
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,720
to the polynomial one when the
sensage

1105
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,180
profile was employed.

1106
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,310
Let's change it here,

1107
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,040
three parameters for the background,

1108
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,254
the flat background

1109
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,070
function.

1110
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,619
While the X background

1111
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,459
and co-exist one would be sufficient

1112
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,500
enough to give us a good fit.

1113
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,049
If flat you can add more

1114
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,060
coefficients into your background
function.

1115
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,409
It's refining,

1116
00:38:24,325 --> 00:38:25,884
now the RWP file

1117
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,100
decreased

1118
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,570
and the fitting is much better

1119
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,399
especially the fitting around 29

1120
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,300
degrees.

1121
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,760
means where this sensage hump was

1122
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,400
located.

1123
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,099
Check the Key factor

1124
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,899
and the Mac makes sure they are
correct,

1125
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:40,259
then we export the result.

1126
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,314
Here is a summary of the results for
the hydrated

1127
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:45,800
sample, using a different background

1128
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,479
may assert the

1129
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,489
results from sensage background is

1130
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,680
better as the improved fitting.

1131
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,140
There are no much differences

1132
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:55,829
in the Portland content,

1133
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:58,019
the main differences are those
phases

1134
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,239
present peaks close

1135
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,430
to the sensage hump. For

1136
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,381
powdered Hydration stack samples,

1137
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,479
it's a little

1138
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,408
bit different, so here I will show a
lot of

1139
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:08,840
example

1140
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,279
with the powdered

1141
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:14,160
sample. There are

1142
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,629
little much difference in the
refined

1143
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,789
procedures for the patterned
obtained

1144
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:20,090
and the hydration

1145
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,540
stopped powder.

1146
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:24,149
There are three aspect need to be
addressed

1147
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,479
when analyzing hydration stopped
powder,

1148
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:28,230
first,

1149
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,710
per proof per page combination

1150
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,560
of the samples,

1151
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,550
second,

1152
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,569
preferred orientation,

1153
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,310
third,

1154
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,080
normalization results.

1155
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,650
We see the previous analyzed

1156
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,429
based on the first disk as a
template,

1157
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,950
then remove the scans

1158
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,134
in the HPF file

1159
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,680
there are only the phases

1160
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,510
and the refined parameters next.

1161
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,750
Actually, this is a way how we made

1162
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,610
templates for the analysis

1163
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,860
which will reduce a lot of work to

1164
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,629
imports to

1165
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,090
import and set parameters for
refinement.

1166
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
Insert your scanned,

1167
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,760
then refine.

1168
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,490
You can see some

1169
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,510
mac peaks around 10 degrees
according

1170
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,789
to the identification we made
before,

1171
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:12,410
this is the peak of a modern
Sulphate

1172
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,860
enumenate. Here you copy the phase,

1173
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,339
here is a kuzinite from

1174
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,056
the template further refine the

1175
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,750
pattern which is called kuzinite the
fittings is much

1176
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:22,530
improved.

1177
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,160
The preferred orientation was
important

1178
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,080
that in the powder sample is much

1179
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,919
severe compared to the refresh
state,

1180
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,470
this is mainly because of the

1181
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,009
sampling procedure when we are

1182
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,810
doing powder samples.

1183
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,569
There are also some preferred
orientation

1184
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:40,799
for the Ettrindite phase,

1185
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:41,175
find out the plain, it's

1186
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,849
1006 to much

1187
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:45,444
taller direction to 1046 and then
refine it.

1188
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:49,375
Calculate the K

1189
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,540
factor of the measurement

1190
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,034
and update it.

1191
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:54,017
Update the Mac value for the dried

1192
00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:55,700
paste,

1193
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,600
the Mac value of the dried paste

1194
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,969
should be should also be updated by

1195
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,039
taking the remove of the free water
in

1196
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:02,730
the sample.

1197
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,460
Generally, you need either

1198
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,759
result from TGA to back

1199
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,509
calculate this updated

1200
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,790
background.

1201
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,440
The need for previous output TST
file

1202
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,110
then output the results,

1203
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,510
the drag bases should be converted

1204
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,860
into the fresh paste

1205
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,380
or the hydrate space for comparison.

1206
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,699
The bound water from TGA results

1207
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,480
will be needed to finalize the
conversion.

1208
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:27,650
Alternatively,

1209
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,710
you can direct the measures phrase

1210
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:31,459
for the free water content to
finalize

1211
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,029
the calculation.

1212
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,549
A calculation templates using

1213
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,110
the TGA bond water

1214
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,749
were provided in

1215
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:39,431
the template. The end.

1216
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,939
Overall we

1217
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,459
might conclude that quantitative

1218
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,259
phase analysis of hydrated cement is
not

1219
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,840
so straightforward,

1220
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,889
and it's quite important to say that

1221
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:52,050
XRD data

1222
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,750
of complex systems would actually
not be

1223
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,620
analyzed by black box approaches.

1224
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,880
Experience has shown that

1225
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,890
quantitative phase analysis

1226
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,479
and the accuracy of the results

1227
00:42:04,305 --> 00:42:06,270
even for simple systems

1228
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,280
depends really a lot

1229
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,410
on the strategy

1230
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,330
of analysis

1231
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:14,430
and also the skill and experience of

1232
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:16,320
the analyzer, the analyst.

1233
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,279
You should try to have at least

1234
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,860
a basic understanding of

1235
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,759
the underlying crystallography,

1236
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,369
and of course also of the cement

1237
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,980
chemistry to be able to guide

1238
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,120
the rietveld refinement

1239
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,940
and to judge by the

1240
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,510
quality of the results

1241
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,560
is fine.

1242
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,579
You can actually gain some of

1243
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,440
this practical experience by
practicing

1244
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,980
on simple model mixture that you
make yourself,

1245
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,149
and you can also follow some
trainings

1246
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,730
from more experienced researchers

1247
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,950
in your group or of other groups.

1248
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,929
So retold quatitative phase analysis

1249
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,119
can be subdivided at least

1250
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,560
into two parts.

1251
00:42:56,770 --> 00:42:58,539
So as we discussed this quality
phase

1252
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,399
analysis spot in which

1253
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,169
we identify which phases

1254
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,040
is at present

1255
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,320
and we select the crystal structures

1256
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,279
that are most suited for the
quatitative

1257
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,400
phase analysis that come next.

1258
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,340
So the second step is quantitative
phase analysis

1259
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,389
where we do the data fitting of the

1260
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:16,659
whole powder pattern to a

1261
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,690
calculated

1262
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:23,119
pattern. So as general

1263
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,159
guidelines we could say that it's
very

1264
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,240
good to start

1265
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,310
with good literate instruction
models,

1266
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,010
and we have supplied in the

1267
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,380
database a number of supplemental

1268
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:35,120
supplementary materials

1269
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,220
a folder which contains

1270
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,300
Crystallographic information files

1271
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:42,220
from which you can extract

1272
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,260
the information you need

1273
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,930
to run a rietveld analysis.

1274
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,910
So it's very useful to have a look
at these,

1275
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:51,850
because you can find a lot of
different

1276
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,970
entries in the literature databases

1277
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,469
and they may be more

1278
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,530
or less applicable to cement

1279
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,250
systems.

1280
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:03,130
So we already made some sort of

1281
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:04,570
pre-selection for you

1282
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,340
and which you from which you can
start

1283
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,800
and do your analysis.

1284
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,950
What is quite important as well

1285
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:12,119
is that at least initially,

1286
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,040
but also

1287
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,680
it's best to do this over the whole

1288
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,569
analysis rietveld analysis is

1289
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,459
that you minimize the number of

1290
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,630
refined variables.

1291
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:22,830
Why?

1292
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,270
Well that's

1293
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,729
often already 10 20

1294
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,979
30 40 50 different

1295
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,500
variables that are being filtered in
the rietveld

1296
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,030
refinements

1297
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:34,499
and that's

1298
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,170
not that much information

1299
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,480
that it can be completely

1300
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,850
left and constraint.

1301
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,530
Of course once you have selected

1302
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:45,969
a number of parameters

1303
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,080
that should be varied you should

1304
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:50,410
in the final step of your refinement

1305
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,389
refine them altogether so you come
to

1306
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,820
your final optimized results.

1307
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,250
So basically it means that you have

1308
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,870
optimized all the variables

1309
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,739
and you have at least

1310
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,770
obtained a sort of

1311
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,170
stable global solution.

1312
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,159
So it's quite important that for
quantitative

1313
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,090
phase analysis that

1314
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,550
at least in the first steps that you

1315
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,700
refine only scale factors

1316
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,870
and lattice parameters,

1317
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,610
and then later on you can include

1318
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:21,409
other corrections perhaps

1319
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,010
like a preferred orientation
correction.

1320
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,820
Also it's quite important that

1321
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,189
for lattice parameters

1322
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,290
you constrain parameter

1323
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,430
variation within a sensible
interval.

1324
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,729
As discussed before one

1325
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,559
can very lattice parameters to a
large

1326
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,599
extent or the program could

1327
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,170
do that.

1328
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,329
And then you might end up

1329
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,039
with the crystal structures which

1330
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,330
are just chemically

1331
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,270
and reasonable lengths

1332
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,270
may be stretched while

1333
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,079
you are changing too much while

1334
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:52,949
you are changing or allowing

1335
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,230
to change lattice parameter to

1336
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:55,560
vary.

1337
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,930
Also it's important to check

1338
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,030
the fit and the contributions of the

1339
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:02,710
different individual phases

1340
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:03,800
visually.

1341
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,460
Why? Because many would see what

1342
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,990
a certain parameter

1343
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,269
or change in a certain parameter is
really

1344
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,400
doing in the fitting whether for

1345
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,899
instance then a small

1346
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,929
contribution of a minor phase is

1347
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:16,869
really significant,

1348
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:18,670
whether it's really there

1349
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:20,950
or whether it's just a misfit of
another phase.

1350
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,860
And also a good hand is to

1351
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,550
when you have imposed this let's say

1352
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,889
intervals for instance for lattice
parameter

1353
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,780
you could say well it may

1354
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:32,219
vary about 1.2%

1355
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,379
from the literature

1356
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,240
data,

1357
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,510
that when you did the refinements,

1358
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,850
when you rerun the refinement

1359
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,640
and you check for parameter that

1360
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:43,380
that hit these limits

1361
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,750
that you have just pre-impose

1362
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:47,319
that actually there you

1363
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,890
might have indication for some
problems

1364
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,150
maybe there is another phase,

1365
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,319
maybe there is a problem

1366
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,179
with your crystal structure model
that you selected,

1367
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,580
or there can be other stuff.

1368
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,299
So this table gives you some sort

1369
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,279
of overview of

1370
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,560
what you can vary during the
refinements.

1371
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,180
So

1372
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,230
basically we saw that

1373
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,749
with phase scale factors,

1374
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,349
units cell parameters, peak shape

1375
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,989
parameters, and micro sexual
parameters,

1376
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,330
and even needed preferred
orientation

1377
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:15,990
parameters.

1378
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,760
Of course next to the phase Bennett

1379
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,299
parameters also is so-called global
parameters

1380
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,669
need to be redefined such

1381
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,040
as a specimen displacement
correction

1382
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:28,190
and coeffience of the background
fraction.

1383
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,830
In complex systems such as cement

1384
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,839
the refinement of crystal structure
parameters

1385
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,880
such as atomic positions

1386
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,100
and displacement factors best be
avoided.

1387
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,320
The crystal structure refinement

1388
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:43,560
by the rietveld method should best
be reserved

1389
00:47:44,745 --> 00:47:47,090
just to peer systems.

1390
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,720
The other in which the parameters
are very

1391
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,429
generally dependent on the distance

1392
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,800
to the final vary values is the
so-called

1393
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,290
parameter chips.

1394
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:56,449
But overall,

1395
00:47:57,330 --> 00:47:59,120
it is suggested that you

1396
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,849
first start with the global
parameter to

1397
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,190
be refined and then phase

1398
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,560
dependent parameters.

1399
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:06,669
In case of hydrating cements the
amount

1400
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,220
of solutes varies during

1401
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:11,920
the bundling of water into the
hydration products.

1402
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:14,700
Therefore a finalized step into

1403
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,599
quantification should be to rescaled
the

1404
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,160
results to a common basis

1405
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,079
such as the initial clinker content

1406
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,419
or the cement content to

1407
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,100
enable an easy comparison

1408
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,319
and a straightforward comparison
which in different types

1409
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,200
of reaction.

1410
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,119
This is also called the dilution

1411
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,200
effect.

1412
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:37,210
On the figure here you can see how

1413
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,099
for instance over time the amount of

1414
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:40,210
solutes increases.

1415
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:42,759
Now when you remove the free water
by

1416
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,980
hydration stoppage you should of
course

1417
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,300
account for this effect

1418
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,429
and let's say that for instance 10

1419
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,439
percent in the anhydrous cement
would not be the

1420
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,880
same as 10 percent

1421
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,230
on the

1422
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,840
final solutes

1423
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,040
in the hydrated cement.

1424
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,200
This is a specially

1425
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,029
and particularly important for the

1426
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,070
calculation of the degree of
hydration,

1427
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,929
but you would always need to of
course

1428
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,909
refer to the same kind of basis
because

1429
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,979
10 percent of Alite in

1430
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,749
the initial system could be
different

1431
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,920
than 10 percent of Alite in the
final system.

1432
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,760
The formula given on the right side
here

1433
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,799
gives you a way of how

1434
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,990
to correct this Portland

1435
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:22,410
cement.

1436
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,800
Some of the recalculation formula

1437
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,939
show that actually

1438
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,919
depends they depend on whether

1439
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,300
free water is removed to stop
dehydration

1440
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,909
reactions. If the sample

1441
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,079
is assumed to be underwriting cut of
fresh

1442
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,880
slice,

1443
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,219
then the great correction factor
should contain

1444
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:40,920
the water to cement ratio of the
phase.

1445
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:43,019
So what you initially put us

1446
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:43,799
water into the cement.

1447
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,779
If the sample

1448
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,220
is dried the separate measurement of
the bond

1449
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,430
water content ignited basis

1450
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,620
by measured for instance by

1451
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,239
demographic metrix is needed to
rescale

1452
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,219
the results. The given

1453
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,009
expressions here are developed

1454
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,139
for the case of an underwrites

1455
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,500
fresh hydrated sample

1456
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,030
and for a dry hydrated sample.

1457
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:10,050
And you can use this for your recalculation.
