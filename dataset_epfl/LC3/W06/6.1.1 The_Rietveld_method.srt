00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,120
Before

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,320
we dive into quantitative phase
analysis,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,539
we should first introduce the main
method

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:09,920
to use for this purpose,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,100
"The Rietveld Method". This

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:13,849
lecture describes the basic
principles

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,960
of the method,

8
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,059
and builds further on the insights
into

9
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:19,189
x-ray part of the fraction that has
been

10
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,149
treated in Lecture Two.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,160
The Rietveld Method was

12
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,150
originally developed by Hugo
Rietveld

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,520
in the late 60s.

14
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,969
This was done for a refinement

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,590
of the crystal structure using
nutrient powder

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,530
diffraction, only later

17
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,640
in the 70s,

18
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,820
it was extended to X-rays

19
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,839
and even later

20
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,400
like in the 80s,

21
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,439
it was eventually extended to
quantitative

22
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,790
phase analysis.

23
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,370
For cement analysis,

24
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,660
the first application of the

25
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,550
Rietveld method date back to the

26
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,730
early 90s.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,049
The Rietveld method now finds its
use

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,970
in a wide variety of areas

29
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,370
as a characterization technique for
crystallite

30
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:57,880
solutes.

31
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,519
Next to it's use in quantitative
phase analysis,

32
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,619
the method can be used to derive

33
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,870
or refined crystal structures for

34
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,190
pure powder samples.

35
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:07,959
Also, crystallite size

36
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,119
and strain can be determined through

37
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:10,869
peak shape analysis.

38
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,549
In fact,

39
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,289
many key properties of solid

40
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,740
systems can be studied by Rietveld

41
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,159
analysis. Kinetic studies

42
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,530
for instance of reactions

43
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,660
or curing during cement hydration

44
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:24,450
or Polymorph transitions,

45
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,719
Thermal expansion,

46
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,019
behavior of ceramics In-situ

47
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,380
chemistry,

48
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,050
and Phase transitions can be
analyzed

49
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,490
easily using

50
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,494
the Rietveld methods. To do this,
the Rietveld method minimizes

51
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,680
the difference between observed

52
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,660
and calculated patterns at

53
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,980
each data point

54
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,579
high, in the diffraction pattern
using

55
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,170
the least squares approach.

56
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,269
Here are some of the statistically

57
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,560
weighted,

58
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,410
squared differences between the

59
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,470
observed,

60
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,990
and calculated intensities

61
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,750
is minimized over the whole pattern.

62
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,180
The calculated pattern takes into
account

63
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,929
crystal structure information,

64
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,169
phase concentrations,

65
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,109
and other sample characteristics

66
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,060
such as micro micro texture.

67
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,099
But also diffraction optics an
instrument

68
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,380
dependent parameters such as

69
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,270
X-ray source etc.

70
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,700
are being taken into account when
calculating

71
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,680
the X-ray part of the diffraction
pattern.

72
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:24,110
The calculated intensity

73
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,969
at a given data point in the
diffraction

74
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,360
scan is obtained as the

75
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,720
sum of the contribution of the
background

76
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,720
and all neighboring

77
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,519
reflections B of all 5

78
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,560
of phases J in

79
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,250
your sample.

80
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,920
This is also expressed in

81
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,470
the mother recreation of the
Rietveld method

82
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,340
shown here.

83
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,270
Here, one can see that as

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,810
of 'J' is the scale factor,

85
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:48,830
out 'P',

86
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,080
is a Lorentz polarization factor,

87
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,460
'F' is a structure factor,

88
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,150
'G' is the peak shape

89
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,650
function,

90
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,420
'A' the x-ray absorbtance
proficient,

91
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,369
and 'P' the preferred orientation

92
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,510
correction.

93
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,070
In lecture two,

94
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,819
we have treated each of these
factors

95
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,050
in more detail,

96
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,089
and we have explained what is the
physical

97
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,710
basis of these factors.

98
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,599
Now before we go into a
demonstration

99
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,299
and practice it is worthwhile to

100
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,159
reflect on what we really can

101
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,270
call a good fit,

102
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,640
and how we can actually evaluate
this.

103
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,339
This is needed because we want to
check that we are

104
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,079
going to in the right way

105
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:26,939
when doing the fitting,

106
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:29,239
and there is also any

107
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,269
hint to be able to compare between

108
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,100
different measures of goodness of
fit,

109
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,480
and maybe we also want to do this,

110
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,419
to be able to do this independent of
the quality

111
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,440
of the data.

112
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,060
To this purpose,

113
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,759
the most direct way of checking if a
fit

114
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,799
is good or going the right way is

115
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,050
by actual visual inspecting.

116
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,449
All this is by any means the most

117
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,409
powerful and direct wave evaluation,

118
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,439
it is also the most subjective

119
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,340
way.

120
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,039
What is for instance good in one

121
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,120
student's eyes,

122
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,430
may not be so for his supervisor.

123
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,590
Numerically access the fitting,

124
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,419
several numerical parameters,

125
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,130
or factor, or initials are
available.

126
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,929
Depending on the material itself,

127
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,580
the data quality,

128
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,260
and the purpose of the analysis,

129
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,909
one may prefer to use residual,

130
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:16,679
or R-factors,

131
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,050
or the chi

132
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,450
or goodness of fit indicator,

133
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,680
or for instance the Durbin-Watson
statistic.

134
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,700
Sometimes,

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,710
a very good fit is obtained

136
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,020
by allowing very large shifts

137
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,489
in crystal graphic parameters

138
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,950
such as unit cell parameters,

139
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,200
or increase of structure refinements

140
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,910
atomic positions.

141
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,369
In these cases,

142
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,800
it is good practice to

143
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,840
always check whether the

144
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,429
obtained crystal structure is
chemically

145
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,510
reasonable.

146
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:45,890
For instance,

147
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,019
it is known from a great many

148
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,030
of experimental data

149
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,800
and from chemical bond theory,

150
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,200
that a tetrahedral silicon

151
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,939
oxygen bonds should have a length

152
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,030
of about 1.6 angstroms.

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,650
Very large deviations for instance

154
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,090
1.8 angstroms

155
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,980
are therefore quite suspicious

156
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,410
and would require further

157
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,000
analysis and verification.

158
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,039
This slide shows the mathematical
expressions

159
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,490
of some of the numerical agreement
factors.

160
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:14,819
The pattern residual

161
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,009
and the weight of pattern residual
describe the

162
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,420
agreement between the observed

163
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,400
and calculated pattern at each

164
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,780
data point in the profile.

165
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,180
The residual pattern is therefore
much

166
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,129
affected by the signal to noise

167
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,000
ratio of the background noise level.

168
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,740
The residual related pattern

169
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,869
therefore accords a bit more weight
to

170
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,070
the actual signal

171
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,410
or the peaks to mitigate the
patterns

172
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,570
but still it is much influenced by
the

173
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,030
quality of the data.

174
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,179
To remove this patterns entirely one
can

175
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,069
use the goodness-of-fit indicator
that

176
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,380
normalizes the weight of pattern
residual

177
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,120
by an expect residual.

178
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,420
This expected residual

179
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:54,689
is an inlet that is calculated

180
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,020
for a best achievable

181
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,790
data fit of the data.

182
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,959
While the pattern

183
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,330
residual and the weighted pattern
residual

184
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,250
should reduce as much as possible

185
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,150
during the fitting,

186
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,580
the goodness-of-fit indicator should

187
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,319
obviously converge to a ratio of

188
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,650
one.

189
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,730
On the other hand,

190
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,860
that's the Durbin-Watson statistics,

191
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,340
and this is applied to residuals of
least scrags

192
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,300
analysis to detect any

193
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,189
waves of auto correlation between

194
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:24,970
the data.

195
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,220
As the value is closer to two,

196
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,160
than there are no indications of

197
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,270
autocorrelation.

198
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,060
If they're actually indications of
autocorrelation,

199
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,459
then the measures to increase the
signal to noise

200
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,439
ratio or resolution should actually
be

201
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,160
considered.

202
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,969
Let's have a look at how Rietveld

203
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,720
fitting operates in practice.

204
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,480
We will show you some snapshots

205
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,339
of a Rietveld refinement over a
simple

206
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,890
two phrase material consisting of
Alite

207
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,580
and Rutile.

208
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,400
To continue with the Rietveld method

209
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,980
We should have already done the
identification.

210
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,590
With the results from the
identification the

211
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,190
related to crystallographer
information

212
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,830
file,

213
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,019
namely the 'C file' must

214
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,660
be formed to perform the root for
the analysis.

215
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,639
The file can be found in the
commercial

216
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,670
database such as

217
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,010
Inorganic Crystal Structured

218
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,060
Database (the ICSD),

219
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,340
or the open database such as

220
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,950
Crystallography Open Database,

221
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,850
(the COD).

222
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,230
First,

223
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,030
create a new file,

224
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,900
then insert the data.

225
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,920
According to the identification we
did before,

226
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,279
mixture is made of Calcite

227
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,450
and Quartz.

228
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,380
Firstly, we import the structures.

229
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,290
Let's change the name Calcite

230
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,550
and then Quartz.

231
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,670
For each phase the skill factor,

232
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,619
units cell and profile should

233
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,570
be defined.

234
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,670
Constraints of one percentage of
rivalries

235
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,440
on the unit cell would applied

236
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,459
to secure refinements.

237
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:55,620
Another

238
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,890
constraint for the profile

239
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,474
W of 0.0001

240
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:01,529
to 0.2

241
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,990
was applied.

242
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,700
The application of constraints

243
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,349
to the refined parameters will
improve

244
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,910
the stability of the overall
refinement.

245
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,970
When especially we are

246
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,430
analyzing complex

247
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,139
sample, such as the hybrid cement,

248
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,839
do the same settings for

249
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,319
Quartz phase,

250
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:21,149
follow global parameters,

251
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,620
and specimen displacement,

252
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,130
background functions are refined.

253
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,350
For the background functions,

254
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,910
where the polynomial functions,

255
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:31,960
together with a flat background,

256
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,720
1/x together with

257
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,940
a fifth five,

258
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,639
together with a five co-efficient.

259
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,989
We use a manual mode for refinement,

260
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,770
as we set the parameters manually.

261
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,030
After all the parameters are set,

262
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,240
the refinement can be executed.

263
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,719
Open the additional graphics

264
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,640
for the difference plot

265
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,469
to visually check the fitting.

266
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,749
Change XY to square

267
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,879
roots to show more details on a

268
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,750
small piece.

269
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,410
You can evaluate the fitting by
checking

270
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,980
the equipment indices.

271
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,479
Name these R profile,

272
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,570
weighted R profile

273
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,890
and the goodness-of-fit.

274
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,450
The aim of the refinement is to
decrease

275
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,830
the rigidity of the fitting,

276
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,809
that's the value for R profile

277
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,909
and weighted R profile should

278
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:18,970
be lower better.

279
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,310
Typically, five to 15

280
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,400
percentage for the weighted R
profile is

281
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,450
acceptable for most of the cases.

282
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,280
Theoretically,

283
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,830
the goodness-of-fit should be one.

284
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,380
Practically, a value of one to five

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,750
can be acceptable depending on the
case.

286
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,120
Now the goodness-of-feet is 5.9

287
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,319
and the weighted R profile is

288
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:42,770
16.6.

289
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,110
If you check the residual plot,

290
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,540
the fitting at around 27

291
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,249
and 13 degrees is not

292
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,000
too good,

293
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,859
and this can be because of the
preferred

294
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,120
orientation.

295
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,519
If you locate a mouse on the peak
which

296
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,780
is not well fitted,

297
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,760
the crystal of plane must

298
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,409
be appear here along

299
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,000
with the name of the phase.

300
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,790
Here if it is a 104 plane for

301
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,360
Calcite.

302
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,429
To setup peripheral direction,

303
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,469
you can click on the Calcite

304
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,360
the refinement control,

305
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,009
then in Optic inspector

306
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,959
for calcite you will find them,

307
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,330
you will find the item called

308
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:18,889
'Preferred Orientation'.

309
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,780
The March-Dollase

310
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
model is recommended.

311
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,295
Specify the Direction h, k, l of the

312
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,640
plain for the preferred orientation.

313
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,179
After setting the direction tick

314
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,039
the refine for the march-dollase

315
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,270
factor.

316
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:33,680
Similarly,

317
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:36,029
too similar to the other

318
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,009
perimeter we put a limit for the

319
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,440
refinement of 0.7

320
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,100
to 1.

321
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,289
The value 1 means there is no any

322
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:43,914
preferred orientation,

323
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,350
the smaller the value is

324
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,170
the higher the preferred
orientation.

325
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,040
In most of the cases 0.07

326
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,820
should be enough,

327
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,119
if value is too small which

328
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,849
means a sampling is not really

329
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,170
done, a reputation of the XRD

330
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,350
data collection base more attention

331
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,370
on reducing the preferred
orientation

332
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,600
is recommended.

333
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,360
By refining, the fitting of the peak
is

334
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,260
much improved,

335
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,620
during a same on the

336
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,920
preferred orientation

337
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,850
of quartz.

338
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,719
The plain of the quartz

339
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,610
is 10-1,

340
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,540
and then refine.

341
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,450
There is some improvement for
goodness-of-fit

342
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,119
and then weighted R profile.

343
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,560
As you can see,

344
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,749
there are still some misfitting from
the

345
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,529
peaks of calcite

346
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:32,670
and quartz.

347
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,600
For calcite and quartz,

348
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,199
binary mixture to achieve better

349
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,129
fitting, more profile perimeters
needed

350
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,600
to be used.

351
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,489
Let's try all the profile

352
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,689
parameters for quartz,

353
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,810
and calcite.

354
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,319
Refinement mean the fittings is much

355
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,660
improved by using more profile

356
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,410
parameters,

357
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,599
and the calculated weight percentage

358
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,879
for the calcite and quartz are
getting closer

359
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,380
to the weight amount.

360
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
Save the HPF file,

361
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,250
press a button

362
00:11:59,310 --> 00:11:59,519
with percentages,

363
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,349
you will have the quantitative

364
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,039
data output in TSD file,

365
00:12:03,115 --> 00:12:04,620
in a default,

366
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,990
highscore class folder,

367
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,269
or simply look down the results from

368
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,500
the graphic window.

369
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,110
This is our X-ray diffraction scam.

370
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Measure it on a conventional lab

371
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,580
Rietveld method, using copper K

372
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
alpha radiation.

373
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,569
We can see a multitude of peaks,

374
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,220
some single,

375
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,330
others overlapping.

376
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,610
In a first try,

377
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,360
a background function is fitted,

378
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,750
and the first residual is calculated

379
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,870
as you can see below the graph.

380
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,559
Obviously, this residual is still
very

381
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,660
high because we have not fitted any

382
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,780
of the red peaks.

383
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,239
In a second step,

384
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,429
we introduce rutile into the

385
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,360
fitting procedure.

386
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,180
Now you can see that only the
intensities

387
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,859
on the peaks of the rutile are being
fitted,

388
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:52,410
and this is done by adapting

389
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:52,704
the scale factor.

390
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:55,229
You can see that the

391
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,330
residual has decreased.

392
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,159
Then we will introduce

393
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,439
Alite as free clinic free

394
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,269
cals silicates into

395
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,250
the refinements.

396
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,789
Again you can see that only the
intensities

397
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,566
of the Alite are fitted,

398
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:11,663
and the

399
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,069
agreement index drops again,

400
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,109
but you can clearly see that there
is

401
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,939
still a visual mismatch of some

402
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,290
of the Alite peak.

403
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,510
We then allow the Alite

404
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,480
and Rutile lattice parameters

405
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,179
to be refined together.

406
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:25,870
Together

407
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,660
with the skill factors of each

408
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:27,900
as well.

409
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,270
Now,

410
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,619
we clearly see that the

411
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,900
weighted pattern residual drops
drastically

412
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,059
and that there is already quite a
good fit

413
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,100
when looking at

414
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,120
the residual.

415
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,660
This Residual curve

416
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,530
in gray below

417
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:45,989
the diffraction scan,

418
00:13:46,205 --> 00:13:48,280
help us spot slight

419
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,360
meet mismatches

420
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,490
and see where there's some
deviations

421
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,810
from the new.

422
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,870
Now we also refined the next step,

423
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,749
the peak width for both Alite

424
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,780
and Rutile.

425
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,409
Again you can see that this
significantly

426
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,100
improves a fitting both in the
residual as

427
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,550
well as in the visual

428
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,630
appearance.

429
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,890
So the fine tuning of the Rietveld
refine

430
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,650
can now be done.

431
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,780
For instance, by adding the

432
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,019
displacement factor from the later

433
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,950
data. Then finally

434
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,380
we can include a preferred
orientation correction

435
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,380
for the Alite phase to achieve our
final fitting

436
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:22,830
results.

437
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,169
One can now see that the fitting is
really

438
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,630
nice and it's a residual curve is

439
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,200
quite flat.

440
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,330
In case of this sample,

441
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,700
we don't actually had about

442
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,370
27 percent of Rutile

443
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,569
and about 73

444
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,924
percent of citri X

445
00:14:40,182 --> 00:14:41,979
the clinics citri x in

446
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,640
this mix.

447
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,510
This example shows that the
parameters

448
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
that we vary in quantitative phase
analysis

449
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,599
are first so-called global
parameters

450
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,130
such as the background

451
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,020
and a sample displacement
correction.

452
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,520
And then second,

453
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:56,539
phase specific parameters,

454
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,550
such as scale factors

455
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,379
that will fit to the observed beacon

456
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,460
intensities,

457
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,220
units out parameters that

458
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,960
will fit to the peak positions,

459
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,419
and peak profile functions that

460
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,310
will fit to the shape of the peak.

461
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,289
The use of intensity corrections
such

462
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,280
as preferred orientation functions

463
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:16,750
may be necessary

464
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,360
but will be included later in the
refinement

465
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:19,920
always.

466
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,560
The refinement of

467
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,899
other crystal structure parameter
such

468
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,520
as the atomic positions,

469
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,350
sites occupancies

470
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,560
are atomic displacement parameters

471
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,489
is not recommendable for complex

472
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,180
mixtures of phases such as cements.

473
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,250
This is because this may lead to
wrong results

474
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,220
due to strong correlations

475
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,200
and parameter variations

476
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,370
during the fitting

477
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,460
as the ratio between variables

478
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,079
and in the bond data strongly

479
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,430
decreases,

480
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,290
and the minimization problem

481
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:53,980
gets

482
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,150
under constraint.
