00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:10,650
Welcome back to the second part of Week 2
of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,389
and x-ray free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:18,251
In this video, we will discuss how we must
refine the atomic form factor to account for

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:22,810
the fact that the electrons in a material
are generally bound to the atomic nucleus

5
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:28,149
with well-defined binding energies, and what
consequences this then has on the phenomena

6
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,570
of refraction, reflection, and absorption.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,950
In order to do this, we add two so-called
dispersive corrections, so named because they

8
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,740
depend on the photon energy.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,760
We finish this section on the interaction
of x-rays with matter, by considering the

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,710
fate and subsequent products after absorption
of x-rays, in particular the emission of fluorescence

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,710
and electrons.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,329
At the end of the last video, we described
the atomic form factor of the elements as

13
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:08,960
a function of the scattering vector Q (or
equivalently, sin theta/lambda) using the

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,670
expression shown here.

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,590
Note that f has a superscript “zero”,
highlighted here in red.

16
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,950
This denotes that this expression is the simplest
description of f, which assumes the electrons

17
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,569
are unhindered in their response to the incoming
x-rays by the fact that they are bound to

18
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,149
atomic nucleii.

19
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:35,819
For photon energies much larger than the binding
energy, this is a valid approximation.

20
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:42,969
(Turn to slide to the side) However, this
is not always the case, as can be seen here

21
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:48,340
for the most tightly bound electrons in the
so-called K-shell (with principle quantum

22
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,020
number n = 1) for all the naturally occurring
elements.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,570
The binding energy of the K-electron (indeed,
the only electron) of a hydrogen atom is 13.6

24
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,310
eV.

25
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,369
The binding energy of K-electrons of the rest
of the elements increase as the square of

26
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:13,240
Z, the atomic number, due to the increased
Coulomb attraction, which means the K-electron

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:21,970
of uranium, the heaviest naturally occurring
element, is above 100 keV, accessible at only

28
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,420
the highest-energy synchrotron storage rings.

29
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,220
So it should be clear that in many cases,
depending on the photon energy being applied

30
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:36,640
and the elements present in the sample under
investigation, the assumption of free motion

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:45,540
of the electron, that is, that it is not influenced
by being bound to the atom, is invalid.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,100
We can model the response of a bound electron
to an incident electromagnetic field to that

33
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,620
of a forced oscillator, such as shown here
as a ball on the end of a spring being forced

34
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,960
to respond to an oscillatory driving force
via a handle.

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,410
The spring with ball on it has a natural oscillation
frequency, given by omega-zero.

36
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:16,930
If the driving frequency omega is much smaller
than w0, the spring will remain stiff and

37
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,740
the ball will move in phase with the driving
handle.

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:27,970
In the other extreme on the right, the spring
will react essentially instantaneously with

39
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,830
the handle before the ball can respond, due
to its inertia, and the ball’s motion will

40
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:41,340
therefore be exactly out of phase, that is,
lagging by 180 degrees.

41
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,860
When the ball is driven at the natural frequency,
the system is said to be in resonance and

42
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,900
the ball moves at a phase 90 degrees lagging
the driving force, and will have a maximum

43
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,000
amplitude.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,140
Note however, that although the electron moves
out of phase with the E-field at high photon

45
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,110
energies, the re-emitted radiation is in phase
with the incident radiation, as the driving

46
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:20,150
force is -eE, that is, it is negative.

47
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,030
An electron in an atom will respond similarly.

48
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,460
Because it cannot respond unhindered by its
attraction to the nucleus, its response will

49
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,530
be damped accordingly.

50
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:37,040
This means we need to add a negative term
f’ to f0 to represent this reduced response.

51
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,870
The sum of these, f1, is thus generally smaller
than f0.

52
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,900
This reduction is most pronounced at resonance,
where the photon energy equals the binding

53
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,990
energy of the electron to the atom.

54
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,320
In addition we must consider absorption.

55
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:04,030
We include another component f2, which increases
abruptly at resonance and is also shown here.

56
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:09,889
Importantly f2 lags f1 by 90 degrees, which
is mathematically expressed by it being an

57
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,210
imaginary term.

58
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,600
The total structure factor is thus a complex
number, consisting of both real and imaginary

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,710
components.

60
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:27,060
Exactly why the component representing absorption
is imaginary (that is, lagging by 90 degrees)

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,490
will become clear shortly.

62
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:35,860
We can represent the change in f graphically
in a so-called Argand, or phase diagram.

63
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,370
For those of you unfamiliar with this construct,
a document can be found in this week’s supplementary

64
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,370
information.

65
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,760
It is certainly worth taking your time to
understand Argand diagrams, as we will use

66
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,370
them extensively in the part of the course
on diffraction, especially with regards to

67
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,800
anomalous effects.

68
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,720
Briefly, the original zeroth-order value for
f, f-zero, is reduced by an amount f’, to

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:09,050
a new value f_1. 90 degrees out-of-phase to
this is the imaginary component f_2, or if_2,

70
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,180
the square-root of -1, i, representing this
phase shift.

71
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,919
The vector product of these two components,
f1 and if2, is the total structure factor

72
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:22,970
f.

73
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,360
So let us summarise these concepts here.

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,990
f0 is now modified by two correction terms:
f’ is a negative term reducing the scattering

75
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,669
amplitude by the fact that the electron is
bound.

76
00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:43,350
f1 is the sum of f0 and f’ and is thus smaller
than f0, as f’ is always negative.

77
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:52,180
The second term f” = f2 is 90 degrees lagging
f1 and increases sharply at resonance, that

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,550
is, when the photon energy equals the electron’s
binding energy.

79
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,530
The total atomic form factor is thus a complex
value which depends on both the scattering

80
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:07,620
vector Q and the photon energy hbar omega.

81
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,920
How does f2 depend on the photon energy?

82
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:21,410
It turns out that f2 = sigmaPA/(2 lambda r0).

83
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:26,430
We know that sigmaPA, the absorption cross-section,
increases suddenly at resonance, and thus

84
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,120
these features are referred to as absorption
edges.

85
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,699
In addition, away from these edges, the absorption
cross-section falls of as 1/hn cubed.

86
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:44,760
But because f2 is inversely proportional to
lambda, which is itself inversely proportional

87
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,620
to the photon energy, f2 is therefore proportional
to the inverse square of the photon energy.

88
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,610
The double logarithmic plot shown here thus
has a gradient of -2.

89
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:06,070
The dependence of the absorption cross-section
and thus f2 on the element type away from

90
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:12,680
absorption edges increases with the fifth
power of Z for lighter elements, slowly changing

91
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,190
to Z^4 with increasing Z.

92
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,830
Shown here are two real examples for the elements
Ga (Z = 31) and As (Z = 33).

93
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:30,210
Let us begin with f2, shown in green and red.

94
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:39,210
The K-absorption edge (i.e., the binding energy
of its 1s electron) for Ga lies 1500 eV lower

95
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:44,950
than that for As, as its attraction to the
less positively charged nucleus is weaker.

96
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,200
f1 is shown in blue and yellow.

97
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,060
Note also that I have plotted two curves each
for Ga and As, in order to underline the fact

98
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:00,630
that f1 depends not only on the photon energy,
but also on the scattering vector Q. The two

99
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:08,440
values of Q chosen here are 2.223 (for the
upper blue and yellow curves) and 4.446 A-1

100
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,690
(for the lower blue and yellow curves), which,
by the by, happen correspond to maxima in

101
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,210
the diffraction pattern of GaAs.

102
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,500
We need not concern ourselves with this extra
information here, but we will return to this

103
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,680
later in the course.

104
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:32,020
Note also, that both f1 and f2 have detailed
features, consisting of small oscillations.

105
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,420
These are not experimental artefacts, but
are infact important features from which detailed

106
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:44,140
information can be drawn in methods such as
EXAFS, also covered later in the course.

107
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,420
So, how do these additional refinements to
the atomic form factor affect the properties

108
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,830
of x-rays travelling through matter?

109
00:09:52,830 --> 00:10:00,110
The phenomena we will be most interested in
are refraction, reflection, and absorption.

110
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,820
We begin with refraction.

111
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,600
We are all familiar at some level with refraction
in the visible regime.

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,100
Visible light travels more slowly in a transparent
medium than in vacuum.

113
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,060
Imagine a platoon of soldiers walking in formation
that come across a ploughed field at an oblique

114
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,060
angle.

115
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,460
The first soldiers that begin to walk across
the ploughed field will slow down.

116
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,320
As a result the distance between the rows
of soldiers in the field is shortened, and

117
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,750
their direction is altered.

118
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,421
Analogously, the wavelength of visible light
is shortened; the velocity is smaller in a

119
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:48,190
transparent medium by a factor n, known as
the refractive index; and light beams are

120
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,550
bent to steeper angles when entering the medium.

121
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,720
This simple concept explains why, for example,
an object partially in water seems to be abruptly

122
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:14,510
bent at the air-water interface, shown step
for step here.

123
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,250
The change in angle of light travelling across
a heterogeneous interface is given by Snell’s

124
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,700
law, shown here.

125
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,290
Let us consider the simpler case where the
lighter medium has a refractive index nR = 1

126
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,589
(it is actually a vacuum).

127
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:38,029
First, it should be clear that refraction
acts equally when the the light enters the

128
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:44,300
medium or exits it.

129
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,810
Now let us reduce the angle alpha’ until
the angle alpha outside the medium is reduced

130
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,520
to zero.

131
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:59,160
The cosine of zero degrees is 1, and hence
cos alpha’, which we relabel in this special

132
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,580
case to alpha_c, is equal to 1/nR’.

133
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:13,589
Below this angle, which is typically about
40 degrees for water, all light impinging

134
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,180
on the interface will be reflected back into
the medium.

135
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,760
This phenomenon is known as total internal
reflection, and is used, for example, to channel

136
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,040
light along optical fibres in telecommunication.

137
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,910
This is shown nicely in the video on the left
- the water surface acts as a somewhat wobbly

138
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,980
mirror, reflecting the carapace of the turtle.

139
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,210
So that was refraction in the visible.

140
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,390
We now consider the refractive index of matter
for the case of x-rays.

141
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:55,930
This is a complex number, containing a real
part nR and imaginary component inI.

142
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:01,730
We will now see that the real part of the
complex refractive index is responsible for

143
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:08,390
refraction of x-rays, while the imaginary
part describes absorption.

144
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,390
Remember that we have just also stated that
the atomic form factor is also complex?

145
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,700
This is no coincidence.

146
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,360
It turns out that the refractive index n for
x-rays is related to the atomic form factor

147
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,959
by this expression.

148
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,110
But we know that f = f1 + if2, so we can insert
this into our expression for n, and immediately

149
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,300
identify the expressions for nR and nI.

150
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,740
We simplify the expression for n as n = 1
- delta + i beta.

151
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,480
Let us begin by considering the sum term.

152
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,470
The real part of this is simply the sum over
all elements i within the material of their

153
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,990
number density Ni, multiplied by the real
part of their atomic form factor in the forward

154
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,920
direction (Q = 0).

155
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,709
Far from an absorption edge, f1i(0) is equal
to Zi, the atomic number of the i-th atom

156
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:03,709
type.

157
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:09,730
Thus the sum is nothing more than the number
density of the electrons in the material in

158
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,370
units of electrons per unit volume.

159
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:20,330
Even close to absorption edges, we can equate
the sum to the EFFECTIVE electron number density.

160
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,570
So we insert rho into our expression for delta.

161
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,560
From this, we should immediately recognise
that delta is inversely proportional to the

162
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,121
square of the photon energy, as all the other
elements of the equation are (far from an

163
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:40,970
absorption edge) independent of hn.

164
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,649
As we discussed earlier, however, f2i is itself
inversely proportional to the square of the

165
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:52,770
photon energy, and hence beta falls of with
the inverse fourth power of hn.

166
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:58,770
We will return to this fact of this differing
dependence of beta and delta in the technique

167
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:03,430
of phase-contrast tomography towards the end
of the course.

168
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,280
The next thing we should do is estimate how
large delta and beta are, in other words,

169
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:16,170
how much does the refractive index for x-rays
differ from unity (i.e., no change at all).

170
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:22,700
We already know that x-rays pass relatively
unhindered through matter, so we might (correctly)

171
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,519
suspect that these dispersion corrections
are small.

172
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,760
First, because Z is always close to being
half of the atomic mass, and because interatomic

173
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,700
spacings in condensed matter do not vary wildly,
one can easily generate a very rough and ready

174
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:47,570
rule of thumb that the electron density is
of the order of Z/20, expressed in electrons

175
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,510
per cubic Angstrom.

176
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:56,649
For one-Angstrom radiation, the rest of the
expression for delta is approximately 4 x

177
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:04,730
10^-6 cubic Angstrom, which thus yields a
value for delta of 2Z x 10^-7.

178
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:11,690
Thus, even for the heaviest elements, delta
is of the order of 2 x 10^-5, much less than

179
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,520
unity.

180
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,430
Beta varies more strongly according to the
sum term, but is even smaller still than delta

181
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:26,100
in most cases by up to three or more orders
of magnitude, depending on both the element

182
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,709
and photon energy.

183
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:35,970
So, in summary, the refractive index in the
x-ray regime equals unity minus a tiny amount,

184
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,050
plus an imaginary component of even tinier
magnitude.

185
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:47,089
Before we apply these new insights to the
phenomena of refraction, reflection, and absorption,

186
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:52,790
a small but important issue should be mentioned.

187
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,650
The more attentive student might object to
the fact that the refractive index is less

188
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,020
than one for x-rays.

189
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:07,010
Doesn’t this imply that the velocity of
x-rays in matter exceeds c, the speed of light

190
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,010
in vacuum?

191
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:09,640
Indeed it does.

192
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:16,929
However, this is referring to the PHASE velocity,
the speed at which the peaks and troughs of

193
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:20,339
the electromagnetic train move.

194
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:29,340
The GROUP velocity, however, is equal to cn,
which is less than c, and it is this that

195
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,500
describes the propagation of energy or information,
or here, the speed of the “packet” or

196
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,180
envelope of light.

197
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:43,340
Einstein’s theory of special relativity
remains inviolate!

198
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,799
So, now let us consider Snell’s law for
x-rays.

199
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:54,570
Because n is less than unity, the x-rays are
bent to shallower angles when traversing from

200
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,100
a lighter to a denser material.

201
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:02,720
Using the same arguments as earlier for visible
light, there will therefore be a critical

202
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,980
incident angle alpha_c for which the x-rays
will be entirely externally reflected at the

203
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,750
surface.

204
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,250
This means mirrors can be constructed for
x-rays.

205
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,820
How large is alpha_c.

206
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,540
From Snell’s law, we see this is equal to
the real component of the refractive index,

207
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:33,970
nR = 1 - delta, which we know to be only very
marginally less than unity.

208
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:42,530
The Taylor expansion of the cosine function
can be very accurately approximated by 1 - x2/2

209
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,050
for x being a small angle (given in radians,
NOT degrees!)

210
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,050
For those of you unfamiliar with the angle
unit the radian, there are 2 pi radians in

211
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,050
a circle, therefore one radian = 360 degrees/2
pi = 57.296 degrees).

212
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:58,080
Hence we can state that 1 - alpha_c^2/2 = 1
- delta, and therefore alpha_c is equal to

213
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,980
the square-root of 2 delta, when expressed
in radians.

214
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:10,040
So, for example, a block of silicon ***** will
reflect 10-keV x-rays at incident angles shallower

215
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,400
than 0.179 degrees.

216
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,880
***** ***** So if an x-ray beam has a height
of 1 mm, ***** its footprint along the mirror

217
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,799
will be very long, ***** of the order of 30
cm.

218
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,169
X-ray mirrors at synchrotrons are therefore
generally large components.

219
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:32,090
Because they also need to be exceedingly flat
on both a macroscopic and atomic level, they

220
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,090
are also very expensive!

221
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:41,760
Lastly, it should be mentioned that even at
incident angles shallower than the critical

222
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,919
angle, the x-rays do penetrate a short distance
into the reflecting surface in an evanescent

223
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:50,510
wave.

224
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:56,370
This should be intuitively obvious, as the
x-rays must interact at some level with the

225
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,130
material to “know” that they will be reflected.

226
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,799
Close to an absorption edge, this will result
in a reduction in the critical angle by a

227
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:12,230
factor equal to to the square root of the
jump in beta at that edge.

228
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:20,780
This is shown here for rhodium below, above,
and at the K-absorption edge at 23.22 keV.

229
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:27,850
It will also result in some absorption and
a lowered reflectivity.

230
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,280
We now move on to absorption.

231
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,550
When an x-ray wave passes into a block of
material, the wavefronts will increase their

232
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:46,400
separation by a factor 1/nR = 1/(1-delta),
while the amplitude E0 of the electromagnetic

233
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,890
radiation will drop off exponentially due
to absorption.

234
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:56,510
How can we relate this exponential decay with
the absorption index, beta?

235
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,470
The description of the propagation in time
and space of a plane wave in vacuum is given

236
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:16,050
in the Eulerian formalism 
by E(z,t) = Eo exp(i(k0z - wt)).

237
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:21,280
When travelling through matter, one must include
the refractive index n on the spatial term,

238
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,460
highlighted here in red.

239
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:31,940
But n = nR + inI, so inserting this into the
equation, we can break it down in to an exponential

240
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:37,080
decay term with exponent (-inIk0z) and an
temporal or oscillatory term.

241
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:45,460
The amplitude of the x-ray wave thus decays
such that after a distance (1/nIk0), it is

242
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,140
1/e (or about 37%) of its original value.

243
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,640
However, the intensity of the beam, the thing
we actually measure, is proportional to the

244
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:05,039
square of the amplitude, and hence the beam
intensity will decay to 1/e after only (1/2nIk0).

245
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,309
This factor is the absorption length.

246
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:13,539
The absorption coefficient mu is the reciprocal
of this and is therefore equal to 2nIk0.

247
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:21,929
Because nI = beta is proportional to the inverse
fourth power of the photon energy, mu is therefore

248
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,350
proportional to the inverse third power.

249
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,070
As one can see from the graph on the right,
depending on the electron density of the material

250
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:37,740
and the photon energy, the absorption length
can vary from the order of 10 nm for lead

251
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:45,539
at low photon energies, to centimetres for
beryllium in the hard x-ray regime.

252
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:51,650
We finish this video by considering what possible
subsequent processes might occur after removing

253
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,390
an electron by absorption of a photon.

254
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:00,830
For the purposes of this course, we consider
four main products, namely the photoelectron

255
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:08,480
itself, fluorescence, Auger emission, and
secondary electrons.

256
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,230
The photoelectron is the direct product of
absorption.

257
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:17,160
The promoted electron may actually reside
in an unoccupied orbital if the photon energy

258
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,500
is only marginally larger than the electron’s
binding energy.

259
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,540
Such orbitals are accessed and the information
used to work out both chemical and orientational

260
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:34,860
information in the technique of XANES (also
called NEXAFS), which we discuss later.

261
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,110
If the electron leaves the atom entirely,
it can be detected, its kinetic energy determined,

262
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,300
and from this and a knowledge of the photon
energy, the binding energy of the electron

263
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,419
calculated.

264
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:54,700
Subtle changes in this value provide invaluable
chemical information in the technique of XPS

265
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,280
(also called ESCA), while the dependence of
the yield as a function of both photon energy

266
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:08,190
and exit angle of the electron in single-crystal
samples, yields detailed information on the

267
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:19,309
sample’s electronic structure in angle-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy (or ARPES).

268
00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:25,929
The removal of a core electron can cause another
electron from a less tightly bound orbital

269
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,850
to relax into the “hole” left behind.

270
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,490
The excess energy produced by this can be
channeled in one of two ways.

271
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,850
Firstly, this energy can be removed as a photon
in the form of fluorescence at characteristic

272
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,360
photon energies, which is exploited in x-ray
fluorescence techniques.

273
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,200
Alternatively, the excess energy can cause
yet another electron to be ejected.

274
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,470
As the kinetic energy of this so-called Auger
electron depends only on the energy difference

275
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:05,510
between the initial hole state and that of
the relaxing electron; and the binding energy

276
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:12,600
of the Auger electron, its kinetic energy
is independent of the incident photon energy,

277
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,290
which distinguishes it from direct photoelectrons.

278
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:23,380
Auger processes tend to dominate for low-Z
atoms, while fluorescence occurs more commonly

279
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,789
for heavier elements.

280
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:33,900
Finally, any ejected electron will on average
collide with other electrons after a certain

281
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,840
characteristic distance, measured in nanometers
or at most tens of nanometers for most kinetic

282
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,970
energies under consideration.

283
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,380
This makes Auger spectroscopy and photoelectron
spectroscopy very surface sensitive.

284
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,470
If, however, the ejected electron is generated
deeper in the sample (remember, the penetration

285
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:58,260
depth of x-rays is normally significantly
larger than the escape depth of electrons)

286
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,900
then it will undergo multiple collisions,
producing a cascade effect and the production

287
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:10,980
of many more secondary electrons which have
been thermalised and have energies measured

288
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,659
in fractions of an electronvolt.

289
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:23,000
This signal is often used as an indirect measure
of absorption strength, such as in the spectromicroscopic

290
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,039
technique of photoemission electron microscopy
(PEEM).

291
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,850
Summarising this second video for this week,
we have seen how an electron bound to an atom

292
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:39,730
responds differently to incident x-rays than
in the free-electron model we introduced in

293
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,370
the last video.

294
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,480
This causes scattering to be reduced, particularly
when the photon energy is close to the binding

295
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,360
energy of the electron.

296
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:57,669
The resonant component causes energy loss
and absorption to occur.

297
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:03,830
We then argued how these dispersive corrections
to the atomic form factor are correlated to

298
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:11,780
the phenomena of refraction, reflection, and
absorption of x-rays, and provided quantitative

299
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:18,750
expressions linking the atomic form factor
with the complex refractive index in the x-ray

300
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,470
regime.

301
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:27,240
Lastly, we briefly summarised which processes
can occur once a photon is absorbed, and how

302
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:36,130
these can be used in synchrotron methods to
investigate the properties of material.

303
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:40,440
Next week, we will discuss the physics behind
the generation of synchrotron light, often

304
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,710
referred to as “machine physics”.
