1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,950
Now how are UV photons used ?
There are several reasons.

2
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:19,039
First, they allow a better energy resolution
of the electrons in the CHA.

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:29,419
Perhaps most importantly, because the energies
of UV photons are close to that of valence-band-electron

4
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:40,570
binding energies, the absorption cross-section
of UV photons is large.

5
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:49,620
The reference binding energy of 0 eV is defined
as the Fermi energy, that is, the energy of

6
00:00:49,620 --> 00:01:01,240
the highest occupied state of the system at
0 K. Note that this depends on the direction

7
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,309
of the electron momentum with respect to the
crystal structure.

8
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:13,049
Note also, that E_F is lower than the vacuum
energy, the energy of a free electron having

9
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:23,439
zero kinetic energy, by an amount equal to
the work function.

10
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,720
This leads us on to the concept of the Fermi
surface, that is, the plot in reciprocal,

11
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,280
or momentum, space of the Fermi energy, in
other words, as a function of the wavevector

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,780
k of the electron.

13
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,990
k has three components k_x, k_y, and k_z.

14
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,600
Not surprisingly, the Fermi energy changes
according to which direction the electron

15
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:07,049
is moving through the crystal, depending on
the interaction between it and the ionic electrostatic

16
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,570
potential in that direction.

17
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,940
Even for the most simple elemental metals
such as copper, the Fermi surface can assume

18
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,060
complex forms, as shown here.

19
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,910
To understand this 3D-plot a little better,
we make a slice through the Fermi surface,

20
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,990
for which the cross-section is shown on the
right.

21
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,560
The centre, which has zero momentum, is called
the Γ-point, while the two crystallographic

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:51,370
directions (111) (denoted ‘L’) and (100)
(‘X’) are also shown.

23
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,340
Let’s consider this more closely.

24
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:06,710
We look along the Gamma-L and Gamma-X directions
The Fermi surface never crosses the Γ–L

25
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:13,040
line and in this direction all the states
are below the Fermi energy and therefore a

26
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,680
gap opens up between the occupied states and
unoccupied states.

27
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,520
In contrast, in the Γ–X direction, the
Fermi surface crosses the Fermi energy, and

28
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,300
copper is thus conducting in this direction.

29
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:41,350
Angle-resolved PES, or ARPES, attempts to
determine the electron kinetic energies as

30
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,010
a function of angle.

31
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:54,100
With this information, the electrons’ momenta
p_x, p_y, and p_z can be accessed, which should

32
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,900
lead to a complete picture of the electronic
structure.

33
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,950
Synchrotron radiation provides two further
variables excluded to lab-based ARPES experiments,

34
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,060
namely the possibility of tuning the incident
photon energy, and the possibility of varying

35
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,150
the polarisation.

36
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,350
The momenta in plane in the k_x and k_y directions
for a given electron binding energy below

37
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:31,990
the Fermi energy can be plotted in a Fermi
surface map, or FSM, as we have already met

38
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,410
in the previous slides on the Fermi surface
of copper.

39
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:44,130
Alternatively, one can plot the binding energy
as a function of the electron wavevector in

40
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:52,790
a given direction, in a momentum-distribution
curve, or MDC.

41
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:59,630
For a fixed k-value, the intensity as a function
of energy can be plotted in an energy-distribution

42
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:03,310
curve.

43
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,970
These two plots can be combined in a two-dimensional
map called the energy-distribution map.

44
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:18,620
Finally, all these plots can be combined in
a 3-D plot, shown on the right, from which

45
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:26,880
any planar section can be viewed.

46
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,810
Ultraviolet photoelectron diffraction (UPD)
and x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD)

47
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,750
are techniques used to obtain direct structural
information in the neighbourhood of the photoelectron

48
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,830
emitter in single crystals.

49
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:54,650
The techniques depend on the strong forward-scattering
nature of photoelectrons by neighbouring atoms,

50
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,590
particularly for the higher kinetic energies
found in XPD, which thus delivers sharper

51
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:08,930
data than UPD.

52
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:30,240
UPD and 

53
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,300
XPD are now an established and invaluable
tools for investigating surface absorbates

54
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,240
and heteroepitaxial thin films on single crystals.

55
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:51,730
In an XPD experiment, the outgoing photoelectron
wave can reach an electron detector on a direct

56
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:58,650
path or can be scattered by the atoms surrounding
the emitter.

57
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,330
The intensity measured at the detector is
given by the interference of the direct and

58
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:11,110
the scattered wave parts and changes as a
function of emission direction (theta_s in

59
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,790
the figure on the left), or electron kinetic
energy.

60
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:24,699
These modulations can be used to determine
the local structure around the emitter.

61
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:29,110
Prediction of the angular distribution of
the signal in photoelectron diffraction is

62
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,590
much simplified by the well-known phenomenon
of the enhanced forward elastic scattering

63
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:44,050
of photoelectrons - the scattering signal
is strongest for theta_s = 0.

64
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,240
For high-energy electrons in the range from
a few hundred electron volts to several keV,

65
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,340
elastic scattering from the electronic clouds
around adjacent atoms is associated with only

66
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,070
a very small phase shift.

67
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:08,580
Hence in the forward direction, interference
is constructive, while at larger angles, partial

68
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:14,620
destructive interference causes the scattering
amplitude to drop off sharply.

69
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,889
This forward scattering results in an amplification
of the scattering intensity along low-index

70
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,669
crystallographic axes, where the photoelectrons
regularly meet atoms.

71
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:36,180
XPD and UPD therefore provide direct real-space
information on the directions between neighbours.

72
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:43,180
Because of the high sensitivity of surfaces
to contaminants and the typical kinetic energies

73
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:51,589
of the photoelectrons, XPD and UPD only work
for the near-surface region of single-crystal

74
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:57,810
samples kept in ultrahigh vacuum.

75
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,870
An example of XPD is shown here.

76
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:12,410
The single-layer sp2-hybridized material hexagonal
boron nitride is isoelectronic with graphene,

77
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:23,120
and is of high technological interest, as
it can form a corrugated “nanomesh” when

78
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,450
deposited on the surfaces of certain transition-metals.

79
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:34,760
These nano meshes can act as trapping centres
for other molecules, or indeed induce periodic

80
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,200
segregation on a nanometer scale when alloys
of metals are used as the substrate material.

81
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,000
In order to fully understand their physical,
chemical, and potential catalytic properties,

82
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,500
their structure should be known with high
accuracy.

83
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,440
One very important parameter is a knowledge
of d_A-S the distance between the h-BN layer

84
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,430
and the top atomic layer of the metal, as
this provides information on bonding strength

85
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,520
and the redistribution of electron density
across the nano mesh, and also provides important

86
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,350
starting information for theoretical calculations.

87
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:29,300
The nominal structure of h-BN on Ni(111) is
shown on the top right, both in plan and side

88
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
view.

89
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,540
The recorded XPD signal from the ejection
of the Nitrogen 1s electron is shown bottom

90
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,730
right.

91
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:46,330
Strong forward scattering in the direction
of the N-N bonds and the N-B bonds can be

92
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,210
seen in the hemispherical plot of the XPD
intensity.

93
00:10:51,210 --> 00:11:01,760
This was modelled, for which the best fit
was for a distance d_A-S of 2.11 +/- 0.002

94
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,720
Angstroms.

95
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:11,920
XPS at synchrotrons is not in general used
for high-resolution chemical analysis (ESCA),

96
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,340
as this can normally be performed quite satisfactorily
using a lab-based source.

97
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:26,000
The exception to this rule is high-pressure
XPS (HPXPS), also called ambient-pressure

98
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,350
PES.

99
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,339
Although photoemission is a highly powerful
tool for investigating clean surfaces under

100
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:42,910
ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, many interesting
processes occur on surfaces, and surface chemistry

101
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:49,680
under realistic reaction conditions have pressures
several orders of magnitude higher than those

102
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,420
typically used for traditional XPS experiments.

103
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:06,250
Such “ambient” experiments are thus excluded
from investigation using standard PES spectrometers.

104
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:15,130
This has been in recent years the spur to
develop the APPES technique.

105
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:23,230
A typical example of the application of APPES
is the investigation of the surface chemistry

106
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:31,630
and its change under different reaction conditions
(in particular gas pressure and type) of heterogeneous

107
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:34,340
catalysts.

108
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:41,220
The mean free path Lambda of an electron travelling
through a gas depends on the gas pressure

109
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,570
P and the electron’s kinetic energy E_e.

110
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:54,510
For a given gas type and electron energy,
the product of Lambda and P is a constant.

111
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,620
An example is shown here for electrons travelling
through oxygen gas.

112
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:11,310
So, a photoelectron with a kinetic energy
E_e of 400 eV would have a mean free path

113
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:20,399
in 100 Pa (or 1 mbar) oxygen of approximately
4 mm.

114
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,550
XPS measurements at higher pressures are made
possible by employing one or more differentially

115
00:13:27,550 --> 00:14:00,790
pumped stages between the sample surface and
the electron analyzer.

116
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:07,730
The diameter D0 of the primary aperture is
decisive for the fundamental scales of the

117
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:14,530
experiment with regards to observable photoelectron
energies and maximum possible pressures.

118
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:21,930
There is a fine balance between placing the
aperture too close to the sample, thereby

119
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:29,110
perturbing the chemical environment, and positioning
it too far away, when scattering of the primary

120
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:37,029
photoelectron by the gas becomes highly probable,
and the solid angle subtended by the aperture

121
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:45,550
becomes so tiny that the captured photoelectron
signal becomes unacceptably small.

122
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,870
In practice, the ideal separation between
the sample surface and the primary aperture

123
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,290
is a few times D0.

124
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:02,670
The maximum ambient gas pressure is inversely
proportional to D0, hence reducing D0 allows

125
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:08,720
a higher ambient pressure, but at the cost
of photoemission signal, which scales with

126
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,140
D0^2.

127
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:19,710
Typical modern APPES chambers have apertures
in the range of 0.5 mm, sample–aperture

128
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:27,709
distances of the order of a few mm, and hence
maximum working pressures approximately 1000

129
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:31,339
Pa (10 mbar).

130
00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:41,089
The introduction of electrostatic lenses in
the differentially pumped stages in order

131
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:49,540
to collect a larger fraction of the photoemission
signal represented a breakthrough in APPES

132
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,610
technology.

133
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,839
In addition to reactions occurring on solid
surfaces, chemistry from a liquid jet is another

134
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:05,510
possibility, whereby the jet is collected
in a catcher with a narrow entrance.

135
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,640
Such experiments have the added advantage
that the liquid surface is being constantly

136
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,740
refreshed.

137
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:24,240
We complete our overview of photoelectron
techniques with a brief synopsis of hard x-ray

138
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,220
photoelectron spectroscopy, or HAXPES.

139
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:36,670
“Normal” UPS and XPS depends intimately
on the properties in the near surface region,

140
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:42,589
given by the inelastic mean-free path of the
photoelectrons, which in most cases is less

141
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:45,300
than a nanometer.

142
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:50,600
This means that samples must be kept exceedingly
clean with well-defined crystallographic and

143
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,180
chemical properties, while any structural
differences of the surface region, and through

144
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:02,510
this, also of the chemical and/or electronic
properties, can often mean that such experiments

145
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:08,319
might not represent the properties of the
bulk material.

146
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,520
Below approximately 2 nm from the surface
of a single-crystal sample, one can generally

147
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,919
assume that the properties are essentially
bulk like.

148
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,760
In order to access these depths, however,
electron kinetic energies (and therefore also

149
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:35,900
photon energies) in excess of a keV or even
higher must be used, according to the universal

150
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:45,360
curve.

151
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,850
These high energies are, unfortunately, associated
with low absorption cross-sections, which,

152
00:17:52,850 --> 00:18:04,970
away from absorption edges, drop off as 1/hnu^3,
as you might remember from the second week

153
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,730
in this course.

154
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:15,650
In addition, the detector efficiency drops
off as 1/E_e, while in order to maintain the

155
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:23,610
desired chemical sensitivity through subtle
chemical shifts of the order of 0.1 eV, the

156
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:31,360
analyser specifications are tighter still
than in normal XPS.

157
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,290
Despite all these technical difficulties,
there are several important advantages to

158
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,290
HAXPES.

159
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,500
First, because the bulk is being probed, the
need for ultrahigh vacuum conditions, required

160
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,940
in normal XPS in order to maintain surface
cleanliness, is obviated.

161
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:58,730
Secondly, this increase in the probing depth
increases the periodicity “seen” by the

162
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:05,260
electron in the direction perpendicular to
the surface, which thus reduces the uncertainty

163
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,169
of the wavevector of the electrons in this
direction.

164
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:19,620
This allows a more precise definition of the
full 3-D wavevector k_e than is possible in

165
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,420
“normal” ARPES.

166
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,750
Lastly, because the photon wavelengths at
these high energies are generally significantly

167
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:37,290
smaller than typical interatomic spacings,
the photoemission matrix elements reduce to

168
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:46,130
atomic cross-sections, thus simplifying data
analysis.

169
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:52,220
The momentum of photoelectrons in HAXPES can
be significant, causing the emitting atom

170
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,880
to recoil.

171
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,080
According to the conservation of momentum,
the apparent binding energy will shift due

172
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:11,730
to this recoil, which must be taken into account,
in particular for light elements.

173
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,160
Summarising this week’s videos, spectroscopic
techniques that use synchrotron radiation

174
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:24,570
have the unique advantage that the incoming
x-rays can be tuned and/or scanned in energy.

175
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,600
This adds an invaluable new dimension to experiments
excluded to those based on laboratory x-ray

176
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:37,011
sources and has been exploited to full advantage
in many of the above-described methods, not

177
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:43,840
least in XAS, ARPES and RIXS.

178
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:52,610
Indeed, all XAS techniques are only possible
using tunable synchrotron light.

179
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:57,010
The high brilliance of third-generation sources,
coupled with the ability to focus

180
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:03,450
down to the nanometer scale, has opened up
new vistas in synchrotron spectroscopy.

181
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,790
Enormous progress has also been made in the
performance of fast, energy dispersive detectors,

182
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:16,010
and it is expected that the range of experiments
available will continue to burgeon as rapidly

183
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,460
as has been experienced in the last decade.

184
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,850
Spectroscopy using x-rays will remain the
most prominent and sought after general synchrotron

185
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,270
technique because of the detailed information
that can be gleaned about the chemical and

186
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,130
electronic properties of matter.

187
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:42,920
In an era where ever more novel and unexpected
materials are being tailored and synthesized,

188
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,460
synchrotron spectroscopy will continue to
play a central role in materials research.
