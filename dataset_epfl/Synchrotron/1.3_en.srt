1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,530
So, what are synchrotrons?

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,559
Simply stated, they are very brilliant sources
of light, or electromagnetic radiation.

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,490
Although some synchrotrons offer tunable radiation
in the infrared and visible regimes, this

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:25,000
is quite unusual and will not be discussed
further in this course, as, from the near

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,800
IR, through the visible, to the near UV range,
conventional lasers tend to dominate *******. As

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,620
already mentioned, it is at higher photon
energies, beginning at about 10 to 20 eV,

7
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,220
where synchrotrons come into their own *******, providing
radiation all the way up to approximately

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,130
one mega-electronvolt photons.

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:52,920
OK, we now know qualitatively what synchrotrons
provide – very brilliant beams of radiation

10
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,260
– but what actually are synchrotrons?

11
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,370
How do they look like?

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:01,080
Here is a schematic of a synchrotron facility.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:08,310
To put this into perspective, the larger ring
structure shown here typically has a circumference

14
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,590
of the order of a few hundred meters.

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,060
Let us break down the components of a synchrotron,
beginning with a source of electrons, the

16
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:25,210
so-called electron gun, which may be a heated
metal filament ejecting electrons by thermionic

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,400
emission.

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,640
These electrons are then accelerated in an
evacuated linear accelerator, or “LINAC”

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,780
(it should be noted that, in order that they
are not scattered by air molecules, the electrons

20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,280
always experience ultrahigh vacuum conditions,
with pressures typically of the order of a

21
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,740
thousandth of a billionth of an atmosphere
or less).

22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:56,970
The electrons then enter a so-called booster
ring in which their energy is further ramped

23
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,799
up until they attain the design energy of
the main “storage” ring,

24
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,619
into which they are injected and where they
remain (or are stored, hence the term “storage

25
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,730
ring”) and are used to generate synchrotron
radiation.

26
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,309
The design energies of the electrons in the
storage ring are typically measured in giga-electronvolts,

27
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:24,909
that is, billions of electronvolts.

28
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:30,939
At these energies, the electrons are highly
relativistic (that is, their velocities are

29
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:36,900
exceedingly close to the speed of light),
which, we will see later, has important consequences

30
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,870
on the nature and direction of the electromagnetic
radiation that is produced.

31
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,269
Now, in both the booster ring and the storage
ring, the electrons are required to remain

32
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,989
on a closed path (shown here in blue).

33
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:56,040
This is achieved using bending magnets, highlighted
here

34
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
in red.

35
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,010
As we shall discuss in detail later in the
course, forcing electrons to execute a curved

36
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,650
trajectory causes them to emit electromagnetic
radiation – this is your synchrotron light!

37
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,719
It is perhaps worth repeating here that the
energy of even the most energetic photons

38
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:23,519
produced at synchrotrons is less than a mega-electronvolt,
three orders of magnitude or more smaller

39
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,579
than the energies of the electrons that produce
them.

40
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:34,340
In addition, the straight sections between
the bending magnets are used to insert alternating

41
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:40,969
arrays of north-south, south-north magnet
dipoles, shown here in orange.

42
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,249
These so-called “insertion devices” are
even more brilliant sources of synchrotron

43
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:50,010
radiation than are the bending magnets.

44
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,430
Tangential to the BMs and IDs are positioned
the beamlines, that use the radiation (normally

45
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:04,430
x-rays, and shown here as yellow and green
beams) produced by the magnet devices in the

46
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,719
storage ring.

47
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:11,250
A typical synchrotron might have anything
between 10 and 50 beamlines, depending on

48
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,309
the size of the facility.

49
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:19,970
For most experiments using x-rays, or indeed
most measurements using any kind of electromagnetic

50
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,699
radiation, four properties are in general
desirable.

51
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:33,030
The beam should be intense, as monochromatic
as achievable, parallel, and emanate from

52
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,039
as small a source point as possible.

53
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,449
Accordingly, a figure-of-merit called “brilliance”,
or “brightness”, encapsulates these attributes

54
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,590
and is equal to the intensity expressed in
photons per second, divided by the product

55
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:54,990
of the horizontal and vertical beam divergences;
the source size; and the relative spectral

56
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,099
bandwidth.

57
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:03,530
The precise definition and units are discussed
later in the course.

58
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:07,789
As an example, however, it is instructive
to consider the following.

59
00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:13,910
A medical x-ray machine may generate as much
as a kilowatt of x-radiation for radiography,

60
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,870
some two orders of magnitude greater than
that used at all the beamlines together at

61
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,750
a typical third-generation synchrotron facility.

62
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,069
However, when the sources’ sizes, divergences,
and bandwidths are factored in, just a single

63
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,949
beamline at a synchrotron will have a brilliance
some 12 orders of magnitude higher than that

64
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,770
of the medical x-ray machine!

65
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,479
An illustrative experimental example is shown
here of a so-called x-ray powder-diffraction

66
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,830
pattern of calcium phosphate.

67
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,889
The lower pattern in red was recorded over
nearly three hours using a lab-based x-ray

68
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,969
tube source, and has been expanded vertically
by a factor of a thousand.

69
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:03,909
The upper trace in blue was recorded in five
seconds at the Materials Science beamline

70
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,229
at the Swiss Light Source.

71
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,409
The peak line widths are almost a factor of
two narrower.

72
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:15,599
A direct comparison in intensity is inappropriate,
as the two patterns were recorded using detectors

73
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,400
based on different operational principles.

74
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,139
Nonetheless, one immediately sees that the
quality of the SR-based measurement is far

75
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:34,169
superior, which can be directly attributed
to the differences in the sources’ brilliances.

76
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:39,919
Since the first synchrotron-based experiments
began in the 1950s, the available brilliance,

77
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,639
which until then had more or less stagnated
since shortly after the discovery of x-rays,

78
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,060
increased meteorically by some 13 or 14 orders
of magnitude over less than five decades,

79
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:58,759
due to the introduction of sophisticated magnet-based
sources, in particular insertion devices called

80
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:07,009
wigglers, and then undulators, which we shall
consider in detail later in the course.

81
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:13,569
***** More recently, beginning in 2009 at
the LCLS at the SLAC facility in California,

82
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:18,719
x-ray free-electron lasers began operation,
while so-called diffraction-limited synchrotrons

83
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:22,340
(DLSRs) are just beginning to see first light.

84
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,080
***** These remarkable advances in x-ray brilliance
over the last half century can be compared

85
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,909
to the much-vaunted improvements in computer
power, encapsulated in Moore’s law, which

86
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:38,499
observes a two-fold gain in computer power
approximately every eighteen months.

87
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:42,819
The same doubling in x-ray brilliance has
occurred on average every ten months during

88
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,110
the last three decades.

89
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:52,490
X-ray free-electron lasers, or XFELs, are
new sources of x-radiation, with peak brilliances

90
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,849
approximately ten orders of magnitude greater
still than those of modern synchrotrons.

91
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:05,409
In addition, they produce trains of pulses
with durations between a few femtoseconds

92
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:13,360
to a few tens of femtoseconds (a femtosecond
is 10-15 of a second, that is, a millionth

93
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,720
of a billionth of a second).

94
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,509
This is over three orders of magnitude shorter
than pulse lengths produced by synchrotrons,

95
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:28,270
and sufficiently short to follow chemical
reactions as they occur in real time.

96
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:37,300
Thus XFELs marry the temporal advantages of
femtosecond lasers in the visible and near-visible

97
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:44,099
regime with the spatial resolution associated
with x-radiation.

98
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,800
The exceedingly high brilliance of XFELs compared
to synchrotrons means that in general, changes

99
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,630
in the approaches to experiments using XFELs
compared to synchrotrons are not incremental

100
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:03,320
in nature, but rather represent a completely
new paradigm shift.

101
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,510
Synchrotrons and XFELs are thus complementary
to one another and one should not think that

102
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,029
XFELs will replace synchrotron sources.

103
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:15,290
The architecture of XFELs is also very different
from that of synchrotrons.

104
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,610
A short electron bunch is generated by irradiating
a metallic target with a femtosecond laser

105
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,980
pulse.

106
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,430
This is accelerated in a LINAC and then undergoes
one or more bunch compressions to make the

107
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,180
pulse shorter by approximately a factor of
100.

108
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,720
The shortened electron pulse is then further
accelerated along a long LINAC to several

109
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:44,610
GeV energy and then enters a long array of
alternating north-south, south-north magnet

110
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,610
dipoles.

111
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,880
As we will discuss later, this magnet array,
called an “undulator”, is essentially

112
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,760
identical to devices also used in the straight
sections of synchrotron storage rings (the

113
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,930
“insertion devices” mentioned earlier
in this video in the context of synchrotron

114
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,180
facilities), apart from the fact that they
are over an order of magnitude longer, typically

115
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,800
several tens of meters long.

116
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,649
For reasons that will become apparent later
in this course, this long magnet array is

117
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:20,620
required in order to induce a phenomenon known
as self-amplified spontaneous emission, or

118
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
SASE.

119
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:28,511
The result of SASE is that, after exiting
the long undulator magnet array, the electron

120
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:35,250
bunch has been altered such that it is now
divided into many microbunches, each having

121
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,230
a duration of only a few femtoseconds.

122
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,400
These bunches produce the femtosecond x-radiation
characteristic of XFELs.

123
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:50,279
The latest development in synchrotron technology
has focussed on improving the brilliance not

124
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:59,509
by increasing the photon flux, but rather
by reducing the source size and divergence

125
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:01,760
of the beam.

126
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,160
**** Diffraction-limited storage rings promise
approximately a further two orders of magnitude

127
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,889
increase in brilliance compared to third-generation
synchrotrons **** by gentler steering of the

128
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:18,079
electrons in the storage ring - in other words,
by using more bending magnets, each magnet

129
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,149
forcing the electrons to bend through a smaller
angle.

130
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:27,070
This seemingly prosaic change actually has
a significant beneficial impact on the beam

131
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:34,100
properties, but has only recently become possible
with advances both in computer-controlled

132
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,570
machining and in vacuum technology, which
have allowed the necessary miniaturisation

133
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:47,070
of components in the storage ring to achieve
this goal.

134
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:52,130
To summarize the first week of this course,
it should now be apparent why x-rays are such

135
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,569
a useful tool for investigating the material
world, why synchrotrons and XFELs are the

136
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:06,240
premier examples of such tools, and why synchrotron
science is such an interdisciplinary endeavour.

137
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,120
You should now be comfortable with the concept
of photons, that is, that light can be described

138
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,839
as consisting of indivisible quanta of energy,
the photons, whose energy is inversely proportional

139
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:23,579
to their wavelength.

140
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:28,050
According to how these photons interact with
matter, in particular with regards to their

141
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:35,110
wavelength compared to that of interatomic
distances; and their energy compared to that

142
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:42,889
of electrons bound to the atomic nuclei, different
x-ray regimes are defined.

143
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:49,930
Lastly, we have qualitatively described the
anatomy, or architecture of synchrotrons and

144
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,580
XFELs, which will prepare us for that part
of the course in which we discuss machine

145
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,839
physics.

146
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,610
Next week, we explore in detail how x-rays
interact with matter, which will lay the foundations

147
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:09,579
to understand x-ray techniques used in modern
synchrotron and XFEL science.
