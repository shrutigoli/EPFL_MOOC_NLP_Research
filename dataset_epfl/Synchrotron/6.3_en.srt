00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:11,870
Welcome to the third and last video of Week
6 of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,400
and x-ray free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,660
This video is concerned first with the complementary
scattering methods of x-ray reflectivity and

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,560
the more general technique of small-angle
x-ray scattering; then finally, with some

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,820
insights into experimental approaches unique
to diffraction and scattering experiments

6
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,950
using XFEL radiation.

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:47,650
X-ray reflectivity does exactly what it says
on the can - one measures the specular reflectivity

8
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,610
of x-rays as a function of incident angle.

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,550
The range of angles typically lies between
a little below the critical angle for total

10
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,210
external reflection, and a few degrees.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,580
From this data, diverse information can be
extracted, including the electron-density

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:16,270
profile down to the penetration depth of the
sample, surface roughness and, in the case

13
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:23,719
of layered systems, the interface roughness,
layer thickness, and layer density as well;

14
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:30,830
the properties of multilayer structures; and
even real-time kinetics experiments monitoring

15
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:37,509
film growth down to pm/s growth rates or even
slower.

16
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:45,600
The reflectivity amplitude (remember, we actually
measure the intensity, proportional to the

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,990
amplitude squared) is given by the Fresnel
equations for reflectivity and transmission,

18
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,369
and is equal to the difference in incident
and transmitted angles across the surface

19
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,999
divided by their sum.

20
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:10,210
Exactly at the critical angle, therefore,
alpha’ = 0, and the reflectivity is unity,

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,840
as we would expect.

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,250
We should also recognise that the reflectivity
will drop off thereafter very rapidly with

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:23,250
the incident angle, as the difference in angle
between the incident and transmitted beam

24
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,909
rapidly becomes very small.

25
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:34,510
From this, it can be easily demonstrated using
the relationship between delta and alpha,

26
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:43,980
that the reflectivity intensity, big R, is
equal to the expression shown here top left.

27
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:51,670
For angles significantly larger than alpha_c,
this is accurately approximated by R = alpha_c/(2

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,250
alpha), all to the fourth power.

29
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:10,430
Because alpha is proportional to the scattering
vector Q, the reflectivity curves drop off

30
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:16,750
with the inverse fourth power of Q.
Note also that because the electron density

31
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:28,490
of material in electrons/cubic Angstrom oscillates
around approximately Z/25, a very rough and

32
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:34,189
ready rule of thumb emerges that the critical
angle in degrees is equal to the square-root

33
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:45,890
of the average atomic number divided by 30,
times the wavelength in Angstroms.

34
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,799
The reflectivity drops off even more rapidly
if the x-rays are being reflected off a rough

35
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,870
surface, even for roughnesses of the order
of a few Angstroms.

36
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:06,719
If we describe the average roughness as a
Gaussian distribution with a roughness standard

37
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:15,489
deviation sigma , the reflectivity above the
critical angle drops off as the perfectly

38
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:24,620
flat surface, multiplied by the Fourier-transform
of the roughness function, that is, the exponent

39
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,320
of [-2k alpha sigma all squared].

40
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,220
For the more maths-adept student, it is briefly
mentioned that this can be explained by the

41
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:45,199
convolution theorem - the surface is the convolution
of a flat surface with a Gaussian roughness

42
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:53,060
function, and therefore the scattering pattern
is the Fourier transform of this convolution,

43
00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:01,430
in other words, the reflectivity curve of
the perfectly flat surface multiplied by the

44
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,170
Fourier transform of the roughness function.

45
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:14,960
The example on the right shows the reflectivity
of silicon for 10-keV photons as a function

46
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,990
of angle and surface roughness.

47
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:30,310
Thin films grown on materials have many applications,
such as in heteroepitaxial growth of electronic

48
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:38,590
devices, tribological coatings, protective
layers, and in lipid biology, to name just

49
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,259
a few examples.

50
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:49,190
A characterisation of these layers is of high
technological importance.

51
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,740
The condition for constructive interference
is as always - that is, the optical path difference

52
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:06,070
shown here as solid red lines must be equal
to an integer number of wavelengths.

53
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:14,190
This is essentially a restatement of Bragg’s
law, where alpha equals theta and we approximate

54
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:26,669
sine alpha with alpha for the shallow angles
relevant to x-ray reflectivity, and the “d-spacing”

55
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,009
is simply the film thickness Delta.

56
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:38,130
This causes the reflectivity curve to exhibit
oscillations known as “Kiessig fringes”.

57
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:47,020
The separation between fringes is simply lambda/2
Delta (though the fringes do deviate from

58
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:54,520
this in the first few oscillations due to
dynamical effects, not covered in this course).

59
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,009
The film thickness can thus be directly obtained
for the Kiessig-fringe period.

60
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:08,139
On the right, the reflectivity curves for
10-nm films (first element) on atomically

61
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,100
smooth substrates (second element) are shown.

62
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,910
Note that the phase of the Kiessig-Fringe
oscillations differ by approximately pi for

63
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,550
Au on Si compared to Si on Au.

64
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:32,620
This is because in the latter case, the reflection
at the interface undergoes a pi-phase shift

65
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:39,389
when the film is less dense than the substrate,
while when the film is denser than the substrate,

66
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,530
no such phase shift occurs.

67
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,600
A simple example is shown here.

68
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:58,000
An quasicrystalline alloy TiNiZr was grown
on an atomically flat sapphire substrate to

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,169
a thickness of approximately 120 nm.

70
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,139
This was then measured some days later, whereby
in the intervening time, the film had been

71
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,870
exposed to air.

72
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:22,030
The rapid Kiessig oscillations associated
with the film itself 

73
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:29,139
were further modulated by a much slower oscillation,
which was associated with the upper 4 nm of

74
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:41,490
the film being oxidised during its exposure
to air.

75
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:49,579
The decrease in reflectivity with surface
roughness can be exploited in in-situ XRR

76
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:54,200
experiments to monitor film growth.

77
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,800
If the film grows in a layer-for-layer manner
(called Frank van der Merwe growth), then

78
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:08,260
the roughness will vary sinusoidally, being
maximally rough when each new monolayer is

79
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,260
half complete.

80
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,050
By monitoring the reflectivity during growth,
therefore, the growth can be followed monolayer

81
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,950
for monolayer.

82
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,910
If the material is crystalline, a good angle
to choose to monitor growth is half way between

83
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:37,029
the direct beam (zero degrees) and the first
Bragg peak in the specular direction (i.e.,

84
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,090
the 001 Bragg peak, if it is not a systematic
absence).

85
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:58,240
Here, the reflectivity is at a minimum, but
also varies most strongly with roughness.

86
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,070
Because of the weakness of the signal, the
use of synchrotron radiation is important.

87
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:09,760
Indeed, note that in the curve on the right,
every second roughness oscillation is stronger

88
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:18,050
- this is due to Kiessig fringes passing through
the point of observation as the film grows.

89
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,130
A movie of the growth in real time is shown
here as an example.

90
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,620
Note, first, that the intensity initially
INCREASES at the start of growth, indicative

91
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:37,279
that the substrate material on which the film
grew was not perfectly atomically flat and

92
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,700
that the first part of the growth filled in
this incomplete monolayer.

93
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:48,910
Also note that with increasing film thickness,
the oscillation amplitude wanes - this is

94
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,930
due to the fact that growth is not perfectly
layer-for-layer, and that with time, the film

95
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,510
accumulates an underlying roughness.

96
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,380
This is called Stranski-Krastanov growth.

97
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,010
X-ray reflectivity is in fact just a special
form of small-angle x-ray scattering.

98
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:14,690
We discuss this technique now.

99
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:21,470
X-ray scattering from larger objects up to
about a micron in size can also provide important

100
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,860
structural and dimensional information.

101
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Consider an object with a characteristic length
D. The ratio of this length to that of the

102
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:40,760
x-ray wavelength being used can, depending
on the system, be anything from about 20 to

103
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,170
several thousands.

104
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,240
Scattering is thus typically over angles lambda/D,
which can thus be anything from a couple of

105
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,890
thousandths of a degree to a couple of degrees.

106
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:04,829
Importantly, the samples investigated using
SAXS need not be crystalline, and the large

107
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:11,850
majority of experiments are on noncrystalline
samples.

108
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:18,699
Scattering occurs, just as it does in x-ray
reflectivity, through electron-density variations

109
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:28,170
Delta rho, and not from individual atoms,
the case in diffraction.

110
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:36,519
Typical information extracted from SAXS include
characteristic shapes and sizes, surface-area

111
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:45,139
to volume ratios, and in special cases, the
relationship between two well-defined sizes,

112
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:53,209
such as between the radius and thickness of
a circular platelet.

113
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:59,730
Just as the scattering intensity in diffraction
scales with the square of Z, the atomic number,

114
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:03,950
SAXS signal increases with the square of Delta
rho.

115
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:10,510
In general, one assumes the individual scatterers
in an ensemble of these, investigated with

116
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:23,899
SAXS, are well separated (i.e., with neighbour
distances larger than the coherence length)

117
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:32,709
and can be regarded as separate entities,
in which case the scattering intensity increases

118
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:40,170
linearly with N_p, the number of illuminated
scatterers.

119
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,401
SAXS has many applications, for example as
an adjunct to protein crystallography, in

120
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:52,990
order to determine the overall shape of a
given protein structure; in cell biology;

121
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:59,690
colloidal and polymer sciences; in nanostructure
grown either naturally or specially fabricated

122
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:06,120
on thin films, to name just a few disciplines.

123
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,449
We have already determined that scattering
angles are measured in small fractions of

124
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:16,279
a degree up to one or two degrees, hence,
it should not come as a surprise that the

125
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:22,220
ratio of the distance between the sample and
the detector recording the SAXS signal and

126
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,470
the detector linear dimensions is large.

127
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,410
The sample - detector distance is typically
measured in a few meters.

128
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:40,670
It is important to avoid spurious signal arising
from other elements at the beamline, such

129
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,290
as forward scattering from x-ray windows or
indeed air!

130
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:51,180
So, for example, the path between the sample
and detector is normally evacuated using a

131
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,880
long flight tube, while the entrance window
to that flight tube is typically fabricated

132
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,899
not from amorphous material such as kapton,
which would produce its own SAXS signal, but

133
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:12,529
from thin sheets of highly crystalline material
such as diamond or mica.

134
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:19,990
Scattering from cleanup slits upstream of
the sample must also be suppressed.

135
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,480
Just as in “normal” crystallography, the
scattering vector Q connects the direct beam

136
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:36,400
with the scattered beam and, as before, is
equal to 2 k sin theta, or simply 2 k theta,

137
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,279
if theta is expressed in radians.

138
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,940
The SAXS signal tends to be circularly symmetric,
as a large number of randomly oriented particles

139
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,259
are probed simultaneously.

140
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:54,320
It is therefore the radial signal that is
of interest.

141
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:05,041
There are three regimes in SAXS: small Q-values,
for which Q is much smaller than 2pi/D, where

142
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:11,080
D is the characteristic scale of the object
being investigated, large values, for which

143
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:19,440
Q is much larger than 2pi/D, and an intermediate
regime.

144
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,710
The intermediate regime can provide information
on fractal scaling in systems with nested

145
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:28,810
characteristic length scales.

146
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:37,269
The low-Q regime is known as the Guinier regime.

147
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,860
Because the length scales probed here are
generally much larger than the characteristic

148
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:48,290
length D, details of the particle shape are
completely lost.

149
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:55,560
Instead, one obtains only information in the
Guinier regime on the overall size, or, more

150
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,709
specifically, the so-called radius of gyration,
R_g.

151
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:08,120
The radius of gyration is equal to the radius
of inertia in classical mechanics, and is

152
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:17,650
the radius of a spherical shell of zero shell
thickness, with the same mass (or, more accurately,

153
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,850
scattering power) as the object under investigation.

154
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:35,090
Guinier’s law states that, at low Q, the
intensity follows the form I(Q) = I_0 exp(-Q^2R_g^2/3),

155
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:43,750
and is valid for all objects, as long as a
is much larger than D. A plot of the natural

156
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:52,920
logarithm of I(Q) as a function of Q^2 therefore
results in a gradient of -R_g/3 in the Guinier

157
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,930
regime.

158
00:17:53,930 --> 00:18:01,580
The Porod regime describes the other end of
the scale at large Q, where length scales

159
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,240
much smaller than the object are being probed.

160
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:17,050
If this is small enough, the x-rays will “see”
the object as being smooth on this scale.

161
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:24,080
As scattering occurs where there is a change
in electron density, this regime is equivalent

162
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:33,800
to that of reflectivity, and the intensity
should fall off as 1/Q^4.

163
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:41,520
A plot of I(Q) v 1/Q^4 should thus produce
a straight line with a gradient equal to 2

164
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,790
pi A, where A is the sample surface area.

165
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:53,580
This regime is hardest to probe, due to the
associated low intensities.

166
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,840
We finish this week with a brief overview
of diffraction and scattering experiments

167
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,870
at XFELs.

168
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:06,240
As early as 2000, it was predicted that crystallites
could survive irradiation by XFELs just long

169
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,950
enough before exploding.

170
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,500
This was experimentally confirmed in 2011
for nanocrystals of photosystem I, recorded

171
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,270
at the LCLS.

172
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:28,090
This concept of diffraction before destruction
led to the method of serial femtosecond crystallography,

173
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,820
in which successive diffraction images of
freshly delivered and randomly oriented crystals

174
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,280
are recorded.

175
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,660
The delivery method may be through some sort
of liquid jet, an aerosol, or on a fixed membrane

176
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,660
system.

177
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,770
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

178
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:55,120
For example, liquid jets are prone to freezing
as they expand into a vacuum, plus only a

179
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,271
very small fraction of the crystallites are
ever irradiated - firstly, the jet moves at

180
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:07,400
a few meters per second, meaning that, at
the LCLS, running at 120 Hz, the jet moves

181
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:14,300
forward by approximately 5 or 6 cm between
XFEL pulses, a stretch of material that can

182
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:24,220
contain several thousand or even some tens
of thousands of crystals.

183
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,560
Increasing the repetition rate helps only
so far, as the jet itself is ripped apart

184
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:36,370
by the XFEL jet and requires some time to
heal itself and flow continuously once more.

185
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,400
On the other hand, narrow liquid jets have
a relatively low background caused by the

186
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,530
water or other solvent the crystallites are
travelling in.

187
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:52,430
Because the crystal orientation is random,
each pattern must be ascertained individually,

188
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:59,470
and sophisticated programs have been developed
to perform this automatically.

189
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,820
As we shall see in the next slide, this is
exacerbated by other factors associated with

190
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,600
the XFEL pulses.

191
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,020
In order to obtain a complete diffraction
pattern with a resolution that allows identification

192
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:20,680
of individual atoms, several hundred thousand
or even more partial patterns must be recorded.

193
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:27,110
So, what are the motivations for performing
macromolecular crystallography at XFELs, and

194
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:32,250
what obstacles other than sample delivery
stand in the way?

195
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:39,190
First, because the crystals anyway explode
immediately after irradiation, cryocooling

196
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,790
becomes entirely redundant.

197
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:49,090
The increased mosaicity of protein crystals
caused by cryocooling is therefore bypassed.

198
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:56,320
Also, because the XFEL pulses can be routinely
focussed down to sub micron dimensions, very

199
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,150
small crystal sizes excluded to synchrotron
experiments can be used, which opens up access

200
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,270
to new systems which have resisted crystal
growth to dimensions of the order of a few

201
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,910
microns or larger.

202
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:16,540
The large class of proteins called membrane
proteins is a premier example.

203
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:24,300
Also, if one assumes a given density of crystallographic
defects per unit volume in a crystal, smaller

204
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,180
crystals will be crystallographically purer.

205
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,800
Perhaps most importantly, XFELs allow one
to follow chemical dynamics on a sub-picosecond

206
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,740
time scale, even down to a few femtoseconds,
which is highly relevant for many biochemical

207
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,900
processes.

208
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:50,160
Biology is all about change - the response
to internal and external physicochemical stimuli

209
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,950
- which is excluded to more conventional synchrotron
studies of cryocooled systems.

210
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:03,270
Only XFELs can provide this avenue of research.

211
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,340
Accurate data interpretation is hampered by
many issues, however.

212
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,330
first, there are large fluctuations in the
energy of individual pulses, which can vary

213
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:20,460
by several tens of percent, although this
aspect is slowly improving.

214
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:29,171
Secondly, the central energy of any single
pulse may fluctuate by a few tens of eV due

215
00:23:29,171 --> 00:23:36,130
to the random nature of the SASE process in
XFELs.

216
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:42,890
This means that the shell of the Ewald sphere
increases in thickness with Q, varying approximately

217
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:51,490
as sin^2\theta between 0 in the forward direction
and 2Delta k in the backward scattering direction,

218
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:57,670
whereby Delta k is the difference in the minimum
and maximum wavevectors associated with the

219
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,580
energy difference.

220
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,670
Because each diffraction pattern is recorded
over a few femtoseconds, there is no possibility

221
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:10,360
to rotate the crystal during exposure.

222
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:15,260
This means that diffraction spots are likely
to represent only a partial integration over

223
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:21,160
the entire diffraction Bragg peak - this is
most obvious in the forward scattering direction,

224
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:28,910
where the Ewald sphere is still very thin,
and less so as Q increases, though these peaks

225
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,800
become increasingly weak.

226
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,860
Lastly, the size of the crystallite responsible
for any one diffraction pattern is unknown

227
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:43,601
- is the signal strong because the crystallite
was large, the XFEL pulse energy large, or

228
00:24:43,601 --> 00:24:49,970
due to a coincidental alignment of the Ewald
sphere with the diffraction pattern in reciprocal

229
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,100
space?

230
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,910
Actually, this randomness in crystallite size
can be turned to advantage - after many, many

231
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:03,490
shots, numbering the hundreds of thousands,
each diffraction peak will have been partially

232
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,860
sampled many times at different positions
relative to the Ewald sphere and originating

233
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,360
from many different crystal sizes.

234
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,980
The crystal can thus be modelled as having
a kind of Gaussian cloud form, representing

235
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:27,770
an average of all the crystallite sizes and
orientations.

236
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:33,660
Single-particle imaging using XFEL radiation
was one of the first long-term goals when

237
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,490
funding for XFELs was being sought.

238
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:45,510
Single-particle imaging is the coherent cousin
to SAXS - the whole mesoscopically-sized particle

239
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,600
is irradiated coherently and the scatter pattern
is recorded.

240
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:57,380
This is essentially the same as coherent x-ray
diffractive imaging, the major difference

241
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:03,320
here being that each particle is obliterated
after each shot.

242
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:10,590
XFELs have 100% transverse coherence, making
it possible to record the coherent scattering

243
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:18,010
pattern, or “speckle”, of substantially
sized objects, in particular noncoherent objects.

244
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:24,900
The Fourier transform of that speckle, assuming
one can solve the phase problem, should provide

245
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:33,650
a 2D slice of the object associated with its
orientation relative to the Ewald sphere.

246
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:41,670
A complete reconstruction requires that all
orientations have been sampled to a sufficiently

247
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,610
high angular accuracy.

248
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,790
The problem with nonperiodic objects is that
they have no Bragg peaks with which to index

249
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:55,750
them and through this determine their orientation.

250
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,000
To overcome this, sophisticated iterative
algorithms have been developed, based on the

251
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,530
EMS, or expand, maximise, and compress”
paradigm, explained in detail in the references

252
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,200
below.

253
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,900
Single-particle imaging is also fraught with
technical and experimental obstacles.

254
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,650
First, the sample holder can potentially add
spurious signal to the already weak signal

255
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:26,070
from the actual sample.

256
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,170
In addition, it is important that any forward
scattering off clean-up slits or other optical

257
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,040
elements is entirely avoided.

258
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:39,490
Lastly, it is important that sample-to-sample
reproducibility is high.

259
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,080
If a significant fraction of the samples have
a different architecture on the scale to which

260
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:52,480
the object is to be resolved, the reconstructed
model will contain features of both.

261
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,780
With this, we finish our discussion of scattering
and diffraction experiments at synchrotrons

262
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,920
and XFELs.

263
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,010
X-ray reflectivity and SAXS offer complementary
methods to crystallography methods, not least

264
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:11,820
in the field of noncrystalline and mesoscopic
objects.

265
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,980
Scattering experiments at XFELs promises a
bright future, especially in those studies

266
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:25,030
of dynamics of systems such as conformational
changes in proteins under in-vivo-like conditions.

267
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,100
XFEL science is still in its infancy.

268
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:37,600
The unprecedented jump in peak flux associated
with XFELs opens up new avenues as yet unexplored

269
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,600
in the field of protein structure, and we
can be confident that great new science will

270
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:49,380
emerge as a consequence of this.

271
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,230
Next week, we turn our attention to spectroscopy
experiments at synchrotrons and XFELs.
