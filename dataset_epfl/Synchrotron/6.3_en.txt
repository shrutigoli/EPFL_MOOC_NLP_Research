Welcome to the third and last video of Week
6 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This video is concerned first with the complementary scattering methods of x-ray reflectivity and the more general technique of small-angle x-ray scattering; then finally, with some insights into experimental approaches unique to diffraction and scattering experiments using XFEL radiation.
X-ray reflectivity does exactly what it says on the can - one measures the specular reflectivity of x-rays as a function of incident angle.
The range of angles typically lies between a little below the critical angle for total external reflection, and a few degrees.
From this data, diverse information can be extracted, including the electron-density profile down to the penetration depth of the sample, surface roughness and, in the case of layered systems, the interface roughness, layer thickness, and layer density as well; the properties of multilayer structures; and even real-time kinetics experiments monitoring film growth down to pm/s growth rates or even slower.
The reflectivity amplitude (remember, we actually measure the intensity, proportional to the amplitude squared) is given by the Fresnel equations for reflectivity and transmission, and is equal to the difference in incident and transmitted angles across the surface divided by their sum.
Exactly at the critical angle, therefore, alphaâ€™ = 0, and the reflectivity is unity, as we would expect.
We should also recognise that the reflectivity will drop off thereafter very rapidly with the incident angle, as the difference in angle between the incident and transmitted beam rapidly becomes very small.
From this, it can be easily demonstrated using the relationship between delta and alpha, that the reflectivity intensity, big R, is equal to the expression shown here top left.
For angles significantly larger than alpha_c, this is accurately approximated by R = alpha_c/(2 alpha), all to the fourth power.
Because alpha is proportional to the scattering vector Q, the reflectivity curves drop off with the inverse fourth power of Q.
Note also that because the electron density of material in electrons/cubic Angstrom oscillates around approximately Z/25, a very rough and ready rule of thumb emerges that the critical angle in degrees is equal to the square-root of the average atomic number divided by 30, times the wavelength in Angstroms.
The reflectivity drops off even more rapidly if the x-rays are being reflected off a rough surface, even for roughnesses of the order of a few Angstroms.
If we describe the average roughness as a
Gaussian distribution with a roughness standard deviation sigma , the reflectivity above the critical angle drops off as the perfectly flat surface, multiplied by the Fourier-transform of the roughness function, that is, the exponent of [-2k alpha sigma all squared].
For the more maths-adept student, it is briefly mentioned that this can be explained by the convolution theorem - the surface is the convolution of a flat surface with a Gaussian roughness function, and therefore the scattering pattern is the Fourier transform of this convolution, in other words, the reflectivity curve of the perfectly flat surface multiplied by the
Fourier transform of the roughness function.
The example on the right shows the reflectivity of silicon for 10-keV photons as a function of angle and surface roughness.
Thin films grown on materials have many applications, such as in heteroepitaxial growth of electronic devices, tribological coatings, protective layers, and in lipid biology, to name just a few examples.
A characterisation of these layers is of high technological importance.
The condition for constructive interference is as always - that is, the optical path difference shown here as solid red lines must be equal to an integer number of wavelengths.
This is essentially a restatement of Braggâ€™s law, where alpha equals theta and we approximate sine alpha with alpha for the shallow angles relevant to x-ray reflectivity, and the â€œd-spacingâ€� is simply the film thickness Delta.
This causes the reflectivity curve to exhibit oscillations known as â€œKiessig fringesâ€�.
The separation between fringes is simply lambda/2
Delta (though the fringes do deviate from this in the first few oscillations due to dynamical effects, not covered in this course).
The film thickness can thus be directly obtained for the Kiessig-fringe period.
On the right, the reflectivity curves for
10-nm films (first element) on atomically smooth substrates (second element) are shown.
Note that the phase of the Kiessig-Fringe oscillations differ by approximately pi for
Au on Si compared to Si on Au.
This is because in the latter case, the reflection at the interface undergoes a pi-phase shift when the film is less dense than the substrate, while when the film is denser than the substrate, no such phase shift occurs.
A simple example is shown here.
An quasicrystalline alloy TiNiZr was grown on an atomically flat sapphire substrate to a thickness of approximately 120 nm.
This was then measured some days later, whereby in the intervening time, the film had been exposed to air.
The rapid Kiessig oscillations associated with the film itself were further modulated by a much slower oscillation, which was associated with the upper 4 nm of the film being oxidised during its exposure to air.
The decrease in reflectivity with surface roughness can be exploited in in-situ XRR experiments to monitor film growth.
If the film grows in a layer-for-layer manner
(called Frank van der Merwe growth), then the roughness will vary sinusoidally, being maximally rough when each new monolayer is half complete.
By monitoring the reflectivity during growth, therefore, the growth can be followed monolayer for monolayer.
If the material is crystalline, a good angle to choose to monitor growth is half way between the direct beam (zero degrees) and the first
Bragg peak in the specular direction (i.e., the 001 Bragg peak, if it is not a systematic absence).
Here, the reflectivity is at a minimum, but also varies most strongly with roughness.
Because of the weakness of the signal, the use of synchrotron radiation is important.
Indeed, note that in the curve on the right, every second roughness oscillation is stronger
- this is due to Kiessig fringes passing through the point of observation as the film grows.
A movie of the growth in real time is shown here as an example.
Note, first, that the intensity initially
INCREASES at the start of growth, indicative that the substrate material on which the film grew was not perfectly atomically flat and that the first part of the growth filled in this incomplete monolayer.
Also note that with increasing film thickness, the oscillation amplitude wanes - this is due to the fact that growth is not perfectly layer-for-layer, and that with time, the film accumulates an underlying roughness.
This is called Stranski-Krastanov growth.
X-ray reflectivity is in fact just a special form of small-angle x-ray scattering.
We discuss this technique now.
X-ray scattering from larger objects up to about a micron in size can also provide important structural and dimensional information.
Consider an object with a characteristic length
D. The ratio of this length to that of the x-ray wavelength being used can, depending on the system, be anything from about 20 to several thousands.
Scattering is thus typically over angles lambda/D, which can thus be anything from a couple of thousandths of a degree to a couple of degrees.
Importantly, the samples investigated using
SAXS need not be crystalline, and the large majority of experiments are on noncrystalline samples.
Scattering occurs, just as it does in x-ray reflectivity, through electron-density variations
Delta rho, and not from individual atoms, the case in diffraction.
Typical information extracted from SAXS include characteristic shapes and sizes, surface-area to volume ratios, and in special cases, the relationship between two well-defined sizes, such as between the radius and thickness of a circular platelet.
Just as the scattering intensity in diffraction scales with the square of Z, the atomic number,
SAXS signal increases with the square of Delta rho.
In general, one assumes the individual scatterers in an ensemble of these, investigated with
SAXS, are well separated (i.e., with neighbour distances larger than the coherence length) and can be regarded as separate entities, in which case the scattering intensity increases linearly with N_p, the number of illuminated scatterers.
SAXS has many applications, for example as an adjunct to protein crystallography, in order to determine the overall shape of a given protein structure; in cell biology; colloidal and polymer sciences; in nanostructure grown either naturally or specially fabricated on thin films, to name just a few disciplines.
We have already determined that scattering angles are measured in small fractions of a degree up to one or two degrees, hence, it should not come as a surprise that the ratio of the distance between the sample and the detector recording the SAXS signal and the detector linear dimensions is large.
The sample - detector distance is typically measured in a few meters.
It is important to avoid spurious signal arising from other elements at the beamline, such as forward scattering from x-ray windows or indeed air!
So, for example, the path between the sample and detector is normally evacuated using a long flight tube, while the entrance window to that flight tube is typically fabricated not from amorphous material such as kapton, which would produce its own SAXS signal, but from thin sheets of highly crystalline material such as diamond or mica.
Scattering from cleanup slits upstream of the sample must also be suppressed.
Just as in â€œnormalâ€� crystallography, the scattering vector Q connects the direct beam with the scattered beam and, as before, is equal to 2 k sin theta, or simply 2 k theta, if theta is expressed in radians.
The SAXS signal tends to be circularly symmetric, as a large number of randomly oriented particles are probed simultaneously.
It is therefore the radial signal that is of interest.
There are three regimes in SAXS: small Q-values, for which Q is much smaller than 2pi/D, where
D is the characteristic scale of the object being investigated, large values, for which
Q is much larger than 2pi/D, and an intermediate regime.
The intermediate regime can provide information on fractal scaling in systems with nested characteristic length scales.
The low-Q regime is known as the Guinier regime.
Because the length scales probed here are generally much larger than the characteristic length D, details of the particle shape are completely lost.
Instead, one obtains only information in the
Guinier regime on the overall size, or, more specifically, the so-called radius of gyration,
R_g.
The radius of gyration is equal to the radius of inertia in classical mechanics, and is the radius of a spherical shell of zero shell thickness, with the same mass (or, more accurately, scattering power) as the object under investigation.
Guinierâ€™s law states that, at low Q, the intensity follows the form I(Q) = I_0 exp(-Q^2R_g^2/3), and is valid for all objects, as long as a is much larger than D. A plot of the natural logarithm of I(Q) as a function of Q^2 therefore results in a gradient of -R_g/3 in the Guinier regime.
The Porod regime describes the other end of the scale at large Q, where length scales much smaller than the object are being probed.
If this is small enough, the x-rays will â€œseeâ€� the object as being smooth on this scale.
As scattering occurs where there is a change in electron density, this regime is equivalent to that of reflectivity, and the intensity should fall off as 1/Q^4.
A plot of I(Q) v 1/Q^4 should thus produce a straight line with a gradient equal to 2 pi A, where A is the sample surface area.
This regime is hardest to probe, due to the associated low intensities.
We finish this week with a brief overview of diffraction and scattering experiments at XFELs.
As early as 2000, it was predicted that crystallites could survive irradiation by XFELs just long enough before exploding.
This was experimentally confirmed in 2011 for nanocrystals of photosystem I, recorded at the LCLS.
This concept of diffraction before destruction led to the method of serial femtosecond crystallography, in which successive diffraction images of freshly delivered and randomly oriented crystals are recorded.
The delivery method may be through some sort of liquid jet, an aerosol, or on a fixed membrane system.
Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.
For example, liquid jets are prone to freezing as they expand into a vacuum, plus only a very small fraction of the crystallites are ever irradiated - firstly, the jet moves at a few meters per second, meaning that, at the LCLS, running at 120 Hz, the jet moves forward by approximately 5 or 6 cm between
XFEL pulses, a stretch of material that can contain several thousand or even some tens of thousands of crystals.
Increasing the repetition rate helps only so far, as the jet itself is ripped apart by the XFEL jet and requires some time to heal itself and flow continuously once more.
On the other hand, narrow liquid jets have a relatively low background caused by the water or other solvent the crystallites are travelling in.
Because the crystal orientation is random, each pattern must be ascertained individually, and sophisticated programs have been developed to perform this automatically.
As we shall see in the next slide, this is exacerbated by other factors associated with the XFEL pulses.
In order to obtain a complete diffraction pattern with a resolution that allows identification of individual atoms, several hundred thousand or even more partial patterns must be recorded.
So, what are the motivations for performing macromolecular crystallography at XFELs, and what obstacles other than sample delivery stand in the way?
First, because the crystals anyway explode immediately after irradiation, cryocooling becomes entirely redundant.
The increased mosaicity of protein crystals caused by cryocooling is therefore bypassed.
Also, because the XFEL pulses can be routinely focussed down to sub micron dimensions, very small crystal sizes excluded to synchrotron experiments can be used, which opens up access to new systems which have resisted crystal growth to dimensions of the order of a few microns or larger.
The large class of proteins called membrane proteins is a premier example.
Also, if one assumes a given density of crystallographic defects per unit volume in a crystal, smaller crystals will be crystallographically purer.
Perhaps most importantly, XFELs allow one to follow chemical dynamics on a sub-picosecond time scale, even down to a few femtoseconds, which is highly relevant for many biochemical processes.
Biology is all about change - the response to internal and external physicochemical stimuli
- which is excluded to more conventional synchrotron studies of cryocooled systems.
Only XFELs can provide this avenue of research.
Accurate data interpretation is hampered by many issues, however. first, there are large fluctuations in the energy of individual pulses, which can vary by several tens of percent, although this aspect is slowly improving.
Secondly, the central energy of any single pulse may fluctuate by a few tens of eV due to the random nature of the SASE process in
XFELs.
This means that the shell of the Ewald sphere increases in thickness with Q, varying approximately as sin^2\theta between 0 in the forward direction and 2Delta k in the backward scattering direction, whereby Delta k is the difference in the minimum and maximum wavevectors associated with the energy difference.
Because each diffraction pattern is recorded over a few femtoseconds, there is no possibility to rotate the crystal during exposure.
This means that diffraction spots are likely to represent only a partial integration over the entire diffraction Bragg peak - this is most obvious in the forward scattering direction, where the Ewald sphere is still very thin, and less so as Q increases, though these peaks become increasingly weak.
Lastly, the size of the crystallite responsible for any one diffraction pattern is unknown
- is the signal strong because the crystallite was large, the XFEL pulse energy large, or due to a coincidental alignment of the Ewald sphere with the diffraction pattern in reciprocal space?
Actually, this randomness in crystallite size can be turned to advantage - after many, many shots, numbering the hundreds of thousands, each diffraction peak will have been partially sampled many times at different positions relative to the Ewald sphere and originating from many different crystal sizes.
The crystal can thus be modelled as having a kind of Gaussian cloud form, representing an average of all the crystallite sizes and orientations.
Single-particle imaging using XFEL radiation was one of the first long-term goals when funding for XFELs was being sought.
Single-particle imaging is the coherent cousin to SAXS - the whole mesoscopically-sized particle is irradiated coherently and the scatter pattern is recorded.
This is essentially the same as coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, the major difference here being that each particle is obliterated after each shot.
XFELs have 100% transverse coherence, making it possible to record the coherent scattering pattern, or â€œspeckleâ€�, of substantially sized objects, in particular noncoherent objects.
The Fourier transform of that speckle, assuming one can solve the phase problem, should provide a 2D slice of the object associated with its orientation relative to the Ewald sphere.
A complete reconstruction requires that all orientations have been sampled to a sufficiently high angular accuracy.
The problem with nonperiodic objects is that they have no Bragg peaks with which to index them and through this determine their orientation.
To overcome this, sophisticated iterative algorithms have been developed, based on the
EMS, or expand, maximise, and compressâ€� paradigm, explained in detail in the references below.
Single-particle imaging is also fraught with technical and experimental obstacles.
First, the sample holder can potentially add spurious signal to the already weak signal from the actual sample.
In addition, it is important that any forward scattering off clean-up slits or other optical elements is entirely avoided.
Lastly, it is important that sample-to-sample reproducibility is high.
If a significant fraction of the samples have a different architecture on the scale to which the object is to be resolved, the reconstructed model will contain features of both.
With this, we finish our discussion of scattering and diffraction experiments at synchrotrons and XFELs.
X-ray reflectivity and SAXS offer complementary methods to crystallography methods, not least in the field of noncrystalline and mesoscopic objects.
Scattering experiments at XFELs promises a bright future, especially in those studies of dynamics of systems such as conformational changes in proteins under in-vivo-like conditions.
XFEL science is still in its infancy.
The unprecedented jump in peak flux associated with XFELs opens up new avenues as yet unexplored in the field of protein structure, and we can be confident that great new science will emerge as a consequence of this.
Next week, we turn our attention to spectroscopy experiments at synchrotrons and XFELs.
