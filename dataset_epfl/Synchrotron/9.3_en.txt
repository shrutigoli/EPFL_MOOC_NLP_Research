Welcome to the third and final video of Week
9 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we discuss techniques that depend on the change in the structure factor because of absorption effects.
The technique of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction only works using unable synchrotron or xfel radiation.
SAD in principle does work for a fixed-wavelength lab source, but in practice is never done using lab sources due to the weakness of the
SAD signal and therefore the need to obtain very clean data with highly reliable diffraction intensities.
Lastly, we will briefly discuss current and possible future trends in macromolecular crystallography.
In the graphs here, various important aspects of the atomic form factor of selenium are shown.
Selenium was chosen here as it is one of the most common elements that is substituted into protein structures via selenomethionine, the selenium-substituted version of otherwise sulphur-containing methionine, one of the human essential amino acids (which, incidentally has a natural abundance of 1.8%).
Top left is the atomic form factor of selenium with values at 0, 2, 4, and 6 reciprocal Angstroms highlighted by the coloured circles.
Top right is the change in fâ€™ and fâ€� in the neighbourhood of the K-absorption edge of selenium, centered at 12658 eV.
An alternative plot is shown bottom left, in which fâ€� is plotted as a function of fâ€™.
The photon-energy values of points on this curve that lie as far from each other as possible have been highlighted.
Lastly, the magnitude of the complex atomic form factor as a function of energy and Q is shown in the dashed lines in the bottom-right curve, for the four values of Q highlighted top left.
The corresponding change in phase compared to energies where the anomalous contributions are insignificant is shown with the solid lines, and is equal to the arctangent of fâ€�/(f_1
= f^0 + fâ€™).
Take a little time to absorb this information and understand it, as we will be using it repeatedly from hereon in.
The beauty of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction over multiple isomorphous replacement is that
(a) only one heavy-atom structure is required, and (b) isomorphism is guaranteed insofar that no physical substitution is needed to change the structure factors.
Instead these change due to one or more heavy atoms modifying their atomic form factors as one passes across an absorption edge.
MAD experiments require one to record three or more diffraction data sets around the absorption edge of the heavy atom . F_H will change its magnitude and phase and cause F_PH to do so also.
In addition, for any one photon energy, the
Friedel pairs will also show differences for the reasons outlined in the first video of this week.
This is, actually, SAD signal, but weâ€™ll discuss this more later.
One potential setback with MAD, though no more so than in MIR, is that the reliability of the data depends on the crystal not being radiation damaged to an extent that this swamps the MAD differences before the minimum of three data sets are recorded.
For any one energy in MAD, we can construct the Harker diagram like we did in the last video for MIR.
Letâ€™s look at how we obtain F_PH^+.
To the native structure factor we add the heavy atom structure factor . But we have chosen the photon energy to be around the absorption edge of this atom or atoms.
So we need to subtract fâ€™ and add fâ€� at
90 degrees to this . This is our final structure factor F_PH^+ . Now, what about the Friedel pair F_PH^-?
Well, we proceed as before . But now letâ€™s pause before adding on fâ€�.
. . Now, we donâ€™t continue to reproduce the mirror image of what we did for F_PH^+, but instead, add fâ€� in the other direction
. If we mirror flip this across the real axis, we see clearly the difference . The complex conjugate of F_PH^- is distinct from F_PH^+
. The vector difference between them has a magnitude of 2 times fâ€�.
Their magnitudes differ too, as shown here by the dashed circles . And now we rearrange the vectors in the same way as we did when when we introduced Harker diagrams in the last video . 
From hereon in, the procedure is much the same as in MIR.
This is done for other photon energies, the impact on the Harker diagram depending on the changes in fâ€™ and fâ€� as one crosses the absorption edge.
Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction thus exploits these changes in the anomalous signal.
Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction exploits only the fact that Friedel-pair intensities differ if fâ€� is not too small, and as such requires just one diffraction data set at one energy.
As such it is the method that, to date, requires the shortest acquisition times and therefore suffers least from radiation damage.
SAD can be performed on a heavy-atom derivative, or if one is lucky, there may be a naturally occurring heavy atom such as iron.
The latest developments in SAD, called â€œnativeâ€�
SAD, exploit anomalous signal from lighter naturally occurring elements, most notably sulphur, but also phosphorus in the case of studies of DNA- or RNA-containing biostructures.
Because of the weakness of the SAD signal in lighter atoms, native SAD in particular requires the highest accuracy in recording diffraction structure factors.
In the Harker construction of SAD, which we also looked at in our discussion of MAD, there remains an ambiguity. caused by the two possible solutions that emerge from the overlap of the two Harker circles . Which of these is correct?
. The beauty of SAD is the lack of need to record more than one data set, so how does one overcome this ambiguity?
The approach used is an iterative method called solvent flattening.
A â€œtypicalâ€� protein crystal does not contain protein structure packed to the hilt, but instead contains approximately 50% by volume of protein folds, etc, and 50% solvent molecules.
The former are fixed and repeat more or less faithfully from unit cell to unit cell - itâ€™s for this reason we can obtain protein diffraction data.
The solvent, however, has no long-range order and is instead composed of completely randomly oriented solvent molecules.
Over many unit cells, therefore, the average electron density of the solvent should be flat and featureless.
The average electron density of the solvent is in general lower than that of protein - the former is 0.33 e/A3 for water , while for protein it is 0.43 e/A3 . Any half-way decent model will therefore show islands of higher average electron density in a sea of, on average, lower electron density, though it might be difficult to distinguish the coastlines, if we extend the metaphor.
In addition, before a really good structural model is obtained, the â€œseaâ€� may be very choppy.
The goal of solvent flattening is to obtain
`dead calmâ€™.
After recording a SAD data set, with experimental values found for F+ and F-, a difference-map can be generated and for each structure factor there will be a pair of possible phases phi_A and phi_B.
This is our starting point.
As an input, we take our experimentally determined structure-factor magnitudes, and a random selection of either phi_A or phi_B for each structure factor.
This is Fourier transformed to produce a real-space structure.
Those regions which appear to be protein by dint of their higher electron density are â€œshrink-wrappedâ€� and preserved, while the remainder is deemed to be solvent.
Any noise to these regions is then either flattened, or, in an alternative approach, flipped around the expected average value for the solvent being used.
This modified real-space model is then inverse
Fourier transformed , and the resulting calculated structure-factor magnitudes replaced with the experimental values . The choice of phi_A or phi_B is determined by which is closer to the newly calculated value.
This cycle is repeated until consistency arises between real and reciprocal space.
In conventional SAD, which tries to get as large a signal out of the fâ€� form factor component as possible, certain energies and atom types are of particular interest.
In addition to selenium SAD, significantly stronger signal can be obtained if one is able to insert heavy elements such as platinum, gold, or mercury in an isomorphic manner.
This supplies a SAD signal 2fâ€� of 10 electrons or larger.
At lower energies between approximately 3 and 7 keV, the fâ€� values can exceed 50 electrons nd the SAD difference between Friedel pairs may be very large indeed.
However, lower photon energies are associated with more radiation damage, more absorption and scattering from ambient air, other gas, or solvents, and a reduced access to reciprocal space.
Nonetheless, this is a highly interesting new direction, and a large cylindrical Pilatus detector containing 12 million pixels has been installed at the I23 beamline at the
Diamond Light Source, and is beginning to produce first data in 2016.
Because of the increased absorption of air, the detector is placed in vacuum, which also imposes potential problems of denaturing of the protein crystals in such an environment.
As already briefly mentioned, the most modern
SAD experiments attempt to solve the phase problem and extract the structure via the weak anomalous signals associated with atoms that are native to the protein, in particular sulphur.
Indeed, as already mentioned, the first ever demonstration of SAD was both using sulphur, and, more remarkably, using a Cu-K alpha lab source at 8.04 keV, some 5 and half keV higher in energy than the sulphur K-edge.
At this energy, 2f_2 is less than 1 electron
. Now, there WAS a gap of eight years between recording the data and eventual publication, a sign of how weak the SAD signal was and how difficult the phasing using this must have been.
Nonetheless, it does show that one doesnâ€™t have to be all that close to the absorption edge to see an effect, particularly for clean and intense data recorded at synchrotrons.
One of the reasons why crambin lent itself to sulphur-SAD was its unusually high concentration of sulphur - some three times higher than seen on average in proteins.
Me!!!!!
The next step is to see how strong native SAD signal is, and how contributions from all native atom types are (apart from hydrogen, which is far too weak to contribute significantly).
Before we proceed, we assume an average protein chemical formula given here.
This was calculated by summing the chemical formulae of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids in vertebrates, weighted by their relative abundance, then normalising this to one sulphur atom.
In addition, as we found out in the second week of this course, the value of f_2 scales with the fourth power of Z, which means, for example, that sulphur has an imaginary anomalous contribution that is approximately 50 times larger than that of carbon.
So how do the individual vectorial form factors add up on average?
In native SAD, sulphur obviously has the largest value for f_2.
At 5 keV, this amounts to about 1.3 electrons
. The f_2-values for carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen at this energy are 0.028, 0.05, and
0.09, respectively, in other words between one or two orders of magnitude smaller than that of sulphur.
Does this mean we can ignore their contributions to the SAD signal?
This depends very much on the sulphur content in the protein.
If we take the average chemical composition of proteins given in the previous slide, we see from the table here that, for example, a 50kDa protein has almost 100 times more carbon atoms than sulphur.
So is carbonâ€™s small value for f_2 compensated by its abundance?
Letâ€™s begin with the carbon atoms.
Like I already said in the last video, there is patently no correlation between the incident plane wave of x-rays and the positions of the atoms, so their scattering phases must be entirely random . We can therefore say, that on average, the vector addition of one type of atom to produce a structure factor for this, will produce a vector with a magnitude equal to that of an individual atom of this type at this Q-vector, multiplied by the square root of the number of those atoms . So far,
I have assumed no anomalous terms.
How can we include these?
First, fâ€™ becomes very small if one lies even only a few hundred eV above an absorption edge, so we ignore this for all the native atoms considered here. f_2 drops off much more slowly, however.
Because this is always at +90 degrees to the real part of the atomic form factor, the sum of f_2 will also be at +90 degrees and will also be proportional to the square-root of the number of atoms of that type.
So, in the case of carbon, the square-root of 1949 is approximately 44, so the real part of F_C = 44 x 3.07 = 135 electrons, and the imaginary part of F_C = 44 x 0.028 = 1.23 electrons.
If we make the same calculations for nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, we get the following results . From this, we see that sulphur has a summed f_2 value equal to approximately twice that of oxygen, and a little over four times that of nitrogen or carbon.
How does one add up the contributions from carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen?
- clearly not linearly, as this would imply that their summed vectors all lie in the same direction.
It turns out that on average, their vector addition is the square-root of the sum of their squares, which in this instance equal
3.27 electrons, about 60% of the contribution from the sulphur atoms.
Importantly, the values for the sum of f_2 for C, N, and O are more statistically reliable than for the sulphur atoms, on account of there being many more of them.
Hence, the summed f_2 values for sulphur may, with a higher probability, tend to deviate from the statistical average, either positively or negatively.
Perhaps more importantly, if the protein happens to have less than the average abundance of sulphur, this will also have a large impact.
The take-home message is, therefore, that, with increasingly accurate data acquisition,
SAD might soon be possible even for those structure that are entirely devoid of any atom types heavier than oxygen.
Is â€œCNOâ€�-SAD the ultimate phasing technique for the experimental macromolecular biologist?
We finish this video with a summary of how the popularity of different phasing methods has evolved since the advent of third-generation synchrotron facilities.
First, , single isomorphous replacement, and multiple isomorphous replacement waned rapidly once unable and intense synchrotron radiation became available.
Computer-based ab-initio methods have remained mainly unchanged, despite John Kendrewâ€™s prediction in his Nobel speech that speculated that, â€˜although this day will not come soonâ€™, a proteinâ€™s structure could be predicted based solely on its amino-acid sequence, and that x-ray crystallographers can go out of business, perhaps with a certain sense of reliefâ€™.
Over sixty years later, we still await this momentous day.
As SIR and MIR waned, multiple isomorphous replacement waxed . As detector technology improved and further incremental steps were made in synchrotron brilliance, SAD techniques, which circumvent the need to record three or more data sets, became increasingly popular, as it allowed smaller crystals to be investigated due to the reduced recording times.
Nowadays, approximately 80% of synchrotron-based
MX experiments are based on SAD.
Within SAD itself, the move towards native
SAD is just beginning to take off after a hiatus of nearly two decades after Teeter and Hendricksonâ€™s seminal paper in 1981; and now sits on the verge of being the â€œfirst-choiceâ€� phasing method.
As an example, the crystal structure of the tubulin-stathmin-TTL complex is shown, which has a molecular mass of 266 kDa and contains
118 sulphur atoms, 13 phosphorus atoms, and three Ca2+ ions.
This is the largest structure to be solved by native SAD to date.
This week has concentrated on phasing techniques in macromolecular crystallography, and how these have developed as the complexity of the structures under investigation and the sophistication of the x-ray sources have increased.
The still further increased brilliance of
DLSRs will allow the investigation of micron-sized crystals, thus opening up a vista of new types of biomolecules that until now have been excluded to investigation, due to the limited size to which they could be crystallised.
The experimental approaches with these small crystals are likely to be based on serial millisecond crystallography, the synchrotron sister-technique to serial femtosecond crystallography used at XFELs.
The future remains truly bright.
