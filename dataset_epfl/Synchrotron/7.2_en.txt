Welcome to the second video of Week 7 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, I will introduce you to different absorption spectroscopies, which absolutely require the tunability of synchrotron radiation.
We can divide up absorption spectroscopies to the so-called XANES regime that lies within a couple of tens of eV from the absorption edge, and the EXAFS technique, which ranges from approximately 50 eV above an absorption edge to several hundred eV, or even a kiloelectronvolt above this.
We start by discussing XANES.
XANES is short for x-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy.
It also goes under another name, NEXAFS, or near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure, though I prefer to avoid this, as it is both redundant, and its orthographical similarity to EXAFS, an absorption technique based on entirely different principles, can be the source for confusion.
In addition to â€œsimpleâ€� XANES, the variants
STXM, PEEM, XMCD, and XMLD will be discussed.
XANES is a technique in which the photon energy is so chosen that a core-level electron can be promoted to an unoccupied but bound or quasibound orbital of the system.
Depending on the system, these unoccupied states can be diffuse, but can also be fairly sharp, especially for example, for molecule that are weakly adsorbed on a surface and may only weakly interact with that â€œhostâ€� material.
The absorption cross-section for photoexcitation of a core-electron to the near vacuum exhibits oscillations in the neighbourhood of the absorption edge caused by excited bound states and also the quasicontinuum just above the ionization threshold, which exhibit large fluctuations in their density of states.
This is the XANES signal.
For the low photoelectron energies typical of XANES, the inelastic mean free path becomes significantly larger than at higher energies
- remember the universal curve shown in the previous video.
XANES therefore â€˜seesâ€™ a large range of absorberâ€“scatterer distances.
This results in multiple scattering of the photoelectrons, which means theoretical modelling of XANES still remains a significant challenge.
XANES spectra are therefore mostly interpreted and not quantitatively analyzed.
The lowest-energy XANES signals actually occur below the absorption edge, and are referred to pre-edge transitions.
Pre-edge features are strongly influenced by the symmetry of the local environment around the absorbing atom.
To understand this, one must first appreciate that orbitals in molecules and solid-state systems can assume the character of a mixture of atomic orbitals and are related to the symmetry of the local environment, such as the simple example the famous tetragonally symmetric sp3-orbitals of diamond formed by hybridization of one 2s- and three 2p-atomic orbitals.
Those orbitals around an atom which are allowed depend on the symmetry of the local environment.
In general orbitals exhibit a so-called â€˜parityâ€™ of (âˆ’1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number - it is equal to 0,
1, and 2, for s-, p-, and d-orbitals, respectively.
An orbital has positive parity and is symmetric if it is invariant under the operation of moving each volume element of the orbital amplitude wavefunction from r to âˆ’r â€“ it is said to be inversion symmetric.
Hence, the spherically symmetric s-states have positive parity (as do the d-orbitals), while the p- and f-states are antisymmetric and have therefore negative parity, as we touched on in the last video.
One can also have local environments which are inversion symmetric, such as any of the atom sites in a rocksalt crystal.
In such environments, atomic orbitals with different parities cannot hybridize, as the symmetry of such hybridized orbitals does not match that of the environment.
So, for example, an sp3-orbital is incompatible with an inversion-symmetric environment.
Consider as an example a material for which a transition between a symmetric K-state (1s, l = 0) and a bound excited state of mostly
(symmetric) d-character is observed with high intensity.
We have already argued that in the dipole approximation, only p-states (antisymmetric) are accessible from s-states.
Hence the upper bound state must have both p-type (antisymmetric) and d-type character.
From this we learn that the environment around the absorbing atom cannot be inversion symmetric because of the partial antisymmetric p-character.
The presence of bound-state resonant absorption peaks therefore provides important information on the local symmetry of the system.
We now show two illustrative examples of information that can be extracted using XANES.
The XANES spectra of the five 5d-metals Re,
Os, Ir, Pt, and Au is shown here.
The ground-state electronic configuration of Re is that of [Xe], plus 6s2 4f14 5d5.
As one moves to the right in the periodic table from Re, the remaining five available
5d-states are filled.
In gold, these states are fully occupied.
In the elements Re to Pt, the bound but unoccupied
5d-states, which are below the ionization threshold, are seen as intense peaks, though this become weaker as the d-orbitals are successively filled.
As gold has no such unoccupied states, excitation is necessarily directly into the unbound continuum, and its XANES spectrum is consequently much flatter.
In the second XANES example, it is shown that orientational information can be extracted by observation of changes in XANES spectra according to the polarisation of the x-rays used.
The probability of a photon being absorbed depends on the orientation of the electric field vector (the polarization, P) of the electromagnetic field of the x-rays relative to the polarization direction of the orbital being excited.
So, for example, the pi-orbital of the formate radical shown top centre lies perpendicular to the molecular plane, and is most efficiently excited if P has the same orientation.
Because the electric field is always perpendicular to the propagation direction of the x-ray beam, this means that the latter must lie in or close to the molecular plane.
In contrast, the sigma orbital is responsible for the C-O bond and lies along that axis, top right.
The strongest excitation of this orbital thus requires the polarisation to be in the same direction.
The formate radical binds strongly to the surface of Cu(110) shown top left.
The orientation of the molecule was unambiguously determined by the change in the XANES signal with x-ray polarization orientation and incident angle of the x-rays on the surface.
Importantly, when the x-rays strike the surface at a glancing angle of 20 degrees and P is parallel to the âŸ¨110âŸ© crystal axis of the copper, excitation of the pi-orbital is suppressed, but is strongly enhanced if the sample is rotated so that P is parallel to the âŸ¨001âŸ© direction.
This leads to the conclusion that the formate radical is oriented with the molecular plane perpendicular to the surface and parallel to the âŸ¨110âŸ© direction, shown bottom-right.
Further details of this beautifully illustrative example can be found in the reference given here.
Since the introduction of high-brilliance radiation in third-generation synchrotron facilities and the development of high-quality x-ray focussing elements such as Fresnel zone plates, x-ray focal spot sizes of the order of a micron or even an order of magnitude smaller have become routinely achievable.
With this, so-called â€˜microspectroscopyâ€™ methods have flourished, in which the chemistry of heterogeneous samples can be mapped out with high spatial resolution.
One of the most important of these to emerge is scanning transmission x-ray microscopy
(STXM), particularly in the field of polymer chemistry and physics, where phenomena such as segregation and heterogeneous morphology must be understood at a submicron scale.
STXM can be thought of raster-scanning XANES operated in the transmission mode.
There are many problems in biology, organic chemistry, and polymer physics which require detailed chemical analysis at a submicron scale but mapped over macroscopic areas.
Although traditional methods such as infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance can differentiate chemical species (by observing subtle differences in bond strengths caused by the local chemical environment), their spatial resolution is limited to the millimetre-scale.
STXM is a technique for spatially mapping with submicron resolution the chemical contents of organic samples.
This is particularly important for experiments performed within the energy range defined by the so-called â€˜water windowâ€™, which lies between the K-edge of carbon at 284 eV and 543 eV, the K-edge of oxygen.
In this energy range, biological and in-vivo specimens absorb approximately an order of magnitude more strongly than water and can therefore reside in an aqueous environment and need not be stained with heavy metals or sliced (both of which are common procedures in the preparation of organic specimens in transmission electron microscopy).
Note also that the L-edges of several biologically relevant elements, in particular potassium, sulfur, and calcium, lie within the water window, while phosphorusâ€™s L1-edge is sometimes also accessible at 189 eV.
STXM is frequently used to characterize polymer films, because of the very rich and informative
C 1s XANES spectra of polymers.
Examples of XANES spectra for three common polymers are shown here.
Note that the aromatic polymer PEEK and the unsaturated polymer neoprene, both of which contain pi orbitals, contain sharp pre-edge carbon peaks associated with the lowest unoccupied pi* orbital, while the saturated polymer polythene contains signal associated only with sigma bonding.
Such differences when scanned across polymer films provides important information on the polymerisation process and degree of inhomogeneity.
Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is a technique that images the spatial distribution of electrons emitted from a sample due to x-ray absorption in the XANES region.
Although the technique uses photoelectrons for its signal, it is not an electron-spectroscopy technique.
Photoelectron spectroscopy detects photoelectrons from the near-surface region that have not been inelastically scattered.
In contrast, in PEEM the energies of the electrons are not distinguished.
Instead, the absorption coefficient is indirectly measured via the yield of secondary electrons, that is, those electrons released by the system after multiple scattering events in a cascade process originating with the directly produced photoelectron from the absorbing atom . This initial photoelectron may derive from an atom relatively deep in the material, as the x-rays can penetrate to depths of several tens of nanometres.
The initial photoelectron can only travel a few Angstroms, however, before interacting inelastically with its surroundings via one of several scattering phenomena, which produces a cascade of â€˜daughterâ€™ electrons with ever decreasing energy.
As the electronsâ€™ kinetic energy approaches only a few eV, the mean free path increases rapidly and they can escape the surface with higher probability â€“ a typical graph of yield versus energy shows a maximum just above the work function, which then drops off with energy.
The majority of emitted secondary electrons therefore have energies of the order of an electronvolt.
Although their detection does not yield absolute results for the absorption coefficient, the spectral dependence is adequately reflected.
This secondary-electron signal is collected using electron optics similar to those used in electron microscopy
A PEEM experiment essentially consists of tuning synchrotron radiation illuminating an entire sample in vacuum and imaging the spatial variation of the subsequent secondary-electron yield using the electrostatic and/or electromagnet lens system.
As such, PEEM is a form of â€˜spectromicroscopyâ€™ â€“ full-field images are recorded at different photon energies, in contrast to STXM, a microspectroscopy technique in which the focussed x-ray beam is rastered across the sample.
The secondary electrons are imaged using a
2-D detector.
In contrast to scanning electron microscopy,
PEEM does not use a scanned probe electron beam, but instead the sample surface is uniformly illuminated by the x-rays.
The magnified image of the surface can therefore be observed directly and in real-time - stroboscopic time-resolved experiments can therefore be performed using the time structure of the synchrotron down to time scales well below a nanosecond.
Because the IMFP of the secondary electrons is of the order of several nanometers or more,
PEEM is in general not surface sensitive, although this can be induced by irradiating the sample with x-rays at very glancing angles theta, thereby reducing their penetration depth below the sample surface by a factor sin theta.
The best resolution of PEEM lies around 25 nm, and depends on the acceleration high voltage of the objective lens and how close this is to the sample.
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray magnetic linear dichroism are two variants of PEEM commonly used to investigate domain formation in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, respectively, by detecting differences in their absorption spectra according to the type and orientation of the polarisation of the incident x-rays.
XMCD functions because magnetic materials have an imbalance of electrons with spin up and spin down in the valence band.
So, for example, the transition from a 2p core level to the unoccupied states 3d band via absorption of an x-ray photon will contain two components, one from the 2p1/2, the other from the 2p3/2.
These are allowed, as the change in orbital angular momentum, Delta l = 1.
One must take a further selection rule into account which states that for dipole transitions, spin flips are forbidden.
This rule is not entirely strict for condensed matter, but is sufficiently observed to induce dichroism.
To obtain the XMC signal, one uses circularly polarized light. in the case of domain 1, an incident RCP photon has its orbital angular momentum pointing forwards (in the direction of propagation, and will preferentially excite the 2p3/2 (or
L3) levels over the 2p1/2 (or L2) levels.
The opposite case arises for LCP photons, whereby the 2p1/2 states are favoured.
If we now focus on region 2, the whole story reverses, as now the spin-down 3d-subband is shifted to higher energies than the spin-up subband.
By recording PEEM images of ferromagnetic domains with RCP and LCP x-rays and dividing the intensities of one image, pixel-for-pixel, by those of the other, the domain structure is revealed with maximum contrast.An example is given here for magnetic structures fabricated from thin films of Ni-Fe.
The pyramid-looking contrast indicates the formation of a closed loop of magnetic domains, a mimimum-energy configuration.
X-ray magnetic linear dichroism probes the domain structure of antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials, which are characterized by having antiparallel orientations of neighbouring magnetic moments and thus no net spin, but nevertheless a defined magnetic axis below a critical temperature (the Neel temperature), as shown here for nickel oxide.
XMLD signal arises from the fact that, due to spin-orbit coupling, the spatial distribution of the electron density is marginally distorted, providing the necessary dichroism depending on whether the linear polarization vector is parallel to or perpendicular to the magnetic axis.
The effect is usually small and detecting
XMLD is more challenging than XMCD.
It has a cos^2 theta dependence, where theta is the angle between the polarization vector of the x-ray light and the magnetic axis of the domain.
The maximum XMLD effect therefore occurs when the signal for the polarization parallel to the magnetic axis is compared to that perpendicular to the axis.
We now move on and up in energy to EXAFS techniques.
Extended x-ray absorption fine structure begins approximately 50 eV above the absorption edge and consists of oscillations in the absorption up to as far as a keV above the edge.
If we remember our equation for the de Broglie wavelength, we see that EXAFS probes electrons with wavelengths of the order of 0.4 to 1.5
Angstroms, similar to if slightly smaller than interatomic distances.
The mean-free path of electrons in this range is short, of the order of a few Angstroms, hence EXAFS only probes the immediate neighbourhood of the absorbing atom.
EXAFS is therefore an important technique in noncrystalline solids and liquids, as it yields information of the short-range structure.
It is much used for investigating liquids, clusters, biological materials, low-concentration impurities down to 10 parts per million, and catalysts, although it can also be used for well-ordered structures, and is thus complementary to diffraction.
EXAFS is caused by single backscattering events by nearest-neighbour atoms of the outgoing photoelectron produced through x-ray absorption.
The scattered waves interfere with the original photoelectron wave, which results in a change in the electron density at the absorbing atom and consequently leads to a modulation of the absorption strength mu(E) as the photon energy is scanned.
The most important parameters in addition to the atomic absorption coefficient mu are the electron wavelength lambda_e, the number and type of nearest neighbours, and the distance
R between the absorbing atom and neighbouring atoms, as shown schematically here.
The EXAFS oscillatory signal increases with the number of neighbours in a given shell; while the oscillation period dilates with decreasing shell radius.
Consider first the absorption coefficient of an isolated atom, Î¼0(k), which varies monotonically and smoothly with wavevector
(or energy) above the absorption edge.
In condensed matter, however, the absorption coefficient Î¼(k) is modulated by the so-called
EXAFS function Ï‡(k) because of interference with backscattered waves, and so mu(k) = mu_0(k) times (1+chi(k)), which we can rearrange to obtain chi(k) - mu(k) - mu_0(k) divided by mu_0(k).
Chi(k) is therefore an expression of the effect on an isolated atomâ€™s absorption characteristics caused by it no longer being isolated.
More precisely, the effect of a given shell j is the sum of the N_j atoms in that shell, assuming their contributions are isotropic.
An illustrative example of the effect of neighbouring atoms is shown on the right for the K-edge of krypton in its gas, liquid, and crystalline solid phase.
We now present the standard expression used for Ï‡iso(k) and then justify its content.
The EXAFS equation is shown here.
Although this might seem at first intimidatingly complex, we can break to down into individual components as follows.
First, the summation is over j shells - as the EXAFS electrons only have short mean-free paths, we need not consider any shell radii much larger than this, that is, a few Angstroms.
Each shell contains N_j backscattering atoms. while the scattering amplitude of these atoms is expressed through the term t_j(k).
The heart of the EXAFS equation is given the sinusoidal term expressing the interference between the outgoing and backscattered electron waves
- it is this part which, through Fourier analysis, yields the interatomic distances.
The 1/R_j^2 is simply the inverse square law of a spherically expanding signal, and should be self-explanatory - the further out the scattered atom at a distance R_j, the weaker is the backscattered wave at the initially absorbing atom.
The Gaussian term here accounts for the fact that the neighbouring atoms are not stationary, but vibrating with an amplitude sigma_j parallel to k.
This is the well-known Debye-Waller factor, and is normally only marginally below unity for samples at room temperature.
Lastly, the exponential term accounts for inelastic and multiple scattering of the electron wave (mainly by plasmons and phonons) on its round trip of 2Rj, where Î› is the electronâ€™s mean-free path length.
The entire equation is shown again here with the visual prompts, for completeness.
Data analysis of EXAFS spectra proceeds as follows.
The oscillatory function chi(k) is extracted from the raw data mu(E) by removal of the background signal fitted to the pre-edge signal and then the monotonically varying signal mu_0(E) above the absorption edge.
The EXAFS function is then re-expressed as a function of k instead of E_e and weighted to enhance the weak oscillations at higher k by multiplication of chi(k) by k^2 or k^3.
This function is then Fourier transformed, which converts the data from being expressed in terms of frequencies (proportional to k) to a plot which reveals characteristic lengths, associated with the interatomic distances
R_j.
EXAFS is a useful technique to observe chemical changes, particularly in poorly crystalline or entirely noncrystalline materials.
Two methods in particular are used.
In quick-EXAFS, or QEXAFS, monochromatic tuning of bending-magnet or wiggler radiation is achieved using a channel-cut monochromator.
***** These sources and this type of monochromator is used in order to achieve the highest speeds
- the sources are broadband and so do not require variation of the gap size associated with undulator photon-energy tuning, which would slow things down significantly; the channel-cut mono is used, as it requires the rotation of a single motor, again thereby avoiding the need to mechanically change synchronously several components, as would be the case in a double-crystal monochromator.
In energy-dispersive x-ray absorption spectroscopy, or EDXAS, a divergent white x-ray beam impinges on a bent crystal or grating sitting on an ellipse defined by its foci being at the source and the sample.
This selects different wavelengths from the white beam, depending on the angle the divergent beam hits the bent crystal.
This dispersed radiation is focussed by the bent crystal on to the sample, and the transmitted signal is detected using a one- or two dimensional detector.
There are no moving parts in EDXAS, hence very rapid changes can be monitored.
The disadvantages of EDXAS are that even very small distortions of the polychromator crystal due to thermal drifts or other effects will cause the dispersed signal to drift spatially.
This sets exceedingly stringent specifications in EDXAS for mechanical and thermal stability.
EDXAS is also often used for studies at extreme conditions of pressure using diamond-anvil cells, which have small volumes and limited acceptance angles.
A limitation of EDXAS is that it assumes that the sample is homogeneous across the focussed spot.
If this condition is not met, artefacts will arise in the recorded spectra.
This completes our discussion of absorption spectroscopies.
In the third and last video of the week, we consider spectroscopies that probe products of absorption, namely fluorescence photons and photoelectrons.
