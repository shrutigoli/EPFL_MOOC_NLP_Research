00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:11,380
Welcome to the first video of Week 8 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,750
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:20,670
This week, we will discuss x-ray imaging techniques,
including different flavours of x-ray tomography,

4
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,800
coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, and ptychography.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,970
In this first video, after some introductory
comments, the basic concepts behind x-ray

6
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,970
tomography are presented.

7
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:42,109
The first point to mention is that the choice
of the methods described this week is perhaps

8
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:49,500
a little arbitrary, as a large fraction of
third-generation synchrotron-based experiments

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,300
can be said to be imaging methods.

10
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,899
In fact, synchrotrons are often presented
to the general public as being exceedingly

11
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,399
powerful microscopes.

12
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:11,400
For example, photoemission electron microscopy
directly images absorption maps via the secondary

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:21,170
electrons that are emitted; scanning-x-ray-fluorescence
plots the intensity of certain photon energies

14
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:29,040
associated with emission from selected elements
as a function of sample position; while even

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,560
x-ray diffraction provides “images” of
unit cells from diffraction data after solving

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,950
the phase problem.

17
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:47,180
X-ray computed tomography, and the two related
techniques of CXDI and ptychography are covered

18
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:55,439
here, because they sit rather uncomfortably
within the techniques described to date, although

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,090
CXDI and ptychography are closely related
to small-angle x-ray scattering, and ptychography

20
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,160
also has much in common with scanning transmission
x-ray microscopy.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,930
It is the relative transparency of condensed
matter to hard x-rays that makes them such

22
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,750
a powerful tool for investigating the internal
structures of objects in a nondestructive

23
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,280
manner.

24
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,350
Indeed, this benefit of x-rays was the first
to be recognized and which caused such a sensation

25
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,550
immediately after their discovery more than
a century ago - imagine the frisson of wonder

26
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,140
or even horror the public must have experienced
at the first display of the radiograms of

27
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,640
Roentgen’s wife’s and of his colleague
von Kolliker’s hands!

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,030
Medical radiographic imaging remains the most
widespread application of hard x-radiation

29
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,790
well over a century later.

30
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,360
The word ’tomography’ is derived from
the Greek words ‘tomos’ meaning ‘to

31
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,470
slice’ and ‘graph’ meaning ‘image’.

32
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,940
Tomography in its most general sense is the
generation of a three-dimensional image by

33
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:22,470
analyzing several transmission radiographic
projections taken of a specimen at different

34
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,350
angles.

35
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,930
This requires radiation which has an absorption
length of the same order of magnitude as the

36
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,630
size of the specimen under investigation.

37
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:43,260
Nowadays, computed tomography with a resolution
of approximately 500 microns is a standard

38
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,170
diagnostic medical imaging tool in hospitals
around the world.

39
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:58,930
Approximately 100 million CT scans per year
are performed in the United States alone.

40
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,510
High-resolution x-ray tomographic microscopy
is a synchrotron-based nondestructive microscopy

41
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,900
technique for creating quantitative, three-dimensional
images of solid objects, including their detailed

42
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:23,900
internal architecture, with a spatial resolution
which can extend well below the micron range.

43
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:37,940
It is useful for a wide range of materials,
including inorganic substances such as rock,

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,620
concrete, ceramic, or metal, and also for
objects made from bone and soft tissue.

45
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,169
In recent years, optimization of tomography
beamlines using high x-ray fluxes has driven

46
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,680
the speed of data acquisition to such an extent
that it is now routine to record entire tomography

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:07,039
scans in a few seconds or even, in favourable
circumstances, in the subsecond timescale.

48
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,360
Time-resolved biomedical studies using tomography
of processes such as breathing or blood circulation

49
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,930
are now possible, and processes on timescales
well below a tenth of a second are beginning

50
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,669
to be probed.

51
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:28,550
Tomography provides a deeper insight into
the structure of bodies.

52
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,800
Now, when one sees a radiograph of a hand,
it is immediately clear what this is - a hand.

53
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,990
It would be a very strange object indeed that
looked so much like a hand but actually wasn’t.

54
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:51,499
Now let’s consider the simple example shown
here . This radiograph would be consistent,

55
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:57,300
for example, with this 3-dimensional object,
viewed from in front.

56
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:03,449
However, it would be also compatible with
this object here, in which the bottom row

57
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:11,520
of two blocks are separated, or indeed, with
this object here, a more radically different

58
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,970
object than the first set of blocks.

59
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,919
Viewing these structures from the right reveals
their differences and provides the necessary

60
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,259
added information to unambiguously reconstruct
the real bodies.

61
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:36,099
For more complex bodies, more angular perspectives
are required to unravel their structure, both

62
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,539
internal, and their envelope.

63
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,039
This is the basis of tomography.

64
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:48,030
The basic principles behind tomography are
shown here in this cartoon.

65
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:55,330
The x-ray transmission image, or radiograph
of an object placed in a parallel x-ray beam

66
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,740
is recorded on a scintillator.

67
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:12,590
The visible output of the scintillator is
then imaged (and magnified) on to a CCD array.

68
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:20,990
The object is then rotated by a small amount
and a new radiogram is recorded.

69
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:29,259
This process continues until the object has
been rotated through a full half-circle (180

70
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,710
degrees).

71
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,439
For each row of the CCD, the pixel response
of that row can be plotted out as a function

72
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,020
of the object angular orientation in a so-called
sinogram.

73
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:55,860
As we 

74
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:03,650
will discuss in the following slide, the sinograms
are analysed using a computer, each sinogram

75
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:11,550
thereby providing a 2-D slice of the object
in the horizontal plane at a height given

76
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,509
by that of the row of pixels that generated
it.

77
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:30,370
Let us look more closely at these sinograms.

78
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:37,310
Consider an object irradiated from a certain
angle, alpha_1, producing at a certain height

79
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:44,680
(or row of pixels) an absorbtion profile,
which we label profile 1.

80
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,580
The transmission at any pixel along the row
is proportional to the inverse exponent of

81
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,830
the integrated absorption coefficient along
the path of the x-rays travelling through

82
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,380
the object to that pixel.

83
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,960
We consider one of these paths l_1 that passes
through the red dot at (x,y), which has a

84
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,310
certain absorption coefficient mu(x,y).

85
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,210
The transmitted intensity is expressed mathematically
here.

86
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:28,600
At another angle alpha_2, we obtain a different
profile, profile 2 . The intensity at the

87
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:36,340
pixel at the end of the path l_2 that also
passes through the same red dot at (x,y),

88
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:47,650
is given by a similar expression . Note that
both the integrands mu(l_1) and mu(l_2) contain

89
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:55,270
this common point mu(x, y) where they intersect
with each other.

90
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:03,900
Hence the value that mu(x,y) can assume has
been a little constrained by these two conditions

91
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:12,320
of the recorded intensities I(alpha_1, l_1)
and I(alpha_2, l_2).

92
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,130
By recording many different angles, the value
of mu(x,y) becomes more strictly constrained,

93
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,450
as indeed do all other positions of this section
of the object.

94
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:33,510
Johann Radon provided the mathematics to extract
the spatial distribution of mu in a so-called

95
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,640
Radon transform . The mathematical details
behind this were translated into English and

96
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,020
published in the reference provided here bottom
left.

97
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:53,140
What advantages does tomography confer over
transitional radiographic projections?

98
00:10:53,140 --> 00:11:00,780
Let us consider two adjacent rows of “voxels”
within a tomographic slice.

99
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:11,010
Voxels are the three-dimensional equivalent
of pixels within the 3-D tomographic reconstruction.

100
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:18,640
The size of the voxel is given by the pixel
dimensions and the angular step size.

101
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:27,800
In the radiographic projection, the two intensities
correspond to the sum of the absorption contributions

102
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,150
of all the voxels in their respective lines.

103
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:41,330
The sums result here in very similar transmissions,
although the individual voxels in the two

104
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:48,070
rows are substantially different - so for
example, the two absorption strength of the

105
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:54,300
voxels highlighted here are very different
from each other.

106
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:01,800
In other words, the contrast between individual
voxels in the tomographic reconstruction is

107
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,580
in general much higher than that in a radiographic
projection.

108
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:16,190
And, of course, one gets to see the detailed
three-dimensional internal architecture.

109
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:25,400
An alternative approach to obtaining tomographic
slices 

110
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,920
has become possible with the emergence of
modern and powerful computers, which are capable

111
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:42,070
of performing so-called fast Fourier transforms
(FFTs) and inverse FFTs exceedingly quickly.

112
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,810
The approach is based on the so-called Fourier
slice theorem.

113
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:57,250
This states that the Fourier transform of
the 1-D projection (in this coordinate system,

114
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:07,050
along x) of an object at a certain height
(here, z) through that object is equal to

115
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:15,110
the central line section through a 2D Fourier
transform of a slice through that object at

116
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:18,400
the same height, z.

117
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:27,060
One thus repeats this procedure at different
angles until all of Fourier space is mapped

118
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,150
with the desired accuracy.

119
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:37,250
However, what one now has is an uneven distribution
of points in the Fourier transform, so you

120
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:50,820
need to interpolate the data from this polar
distribution to orthogonal Cartesian coordinates.

121
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:58,990
From this, the inverse Fourier transform yields
the tomogram slice.

122
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:12,350
Lastly, improved contrast in tomographic images
can be achieved by recording below and above

123
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:18,740
an absorption edge of a material known to
exist in the sample, such as here for a caesium

124
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,850
plume in igneous rock.

125
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:32,250
By subtracting one from the other , an enhanced
image for that material is generated.

126
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,640
Summarizing this first video, we have demonstrated
that tomography is a powerful technique to

127
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:45,230
nondestructively image the 3-dimensional internal
architecture of bodies with a high contrast

128
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,990
that is inaccessible to standard radiographic
methods.

129
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:58,160
In the next video, we will discuss two variants
of tomography, namely phase-contrast tomography,

130
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,880
and high-speed tomography.
