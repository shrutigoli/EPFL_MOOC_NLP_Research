Welcome back to the second part of Week 2 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we will discuss how we must refine the atomic form factor to account for the fact that the electrons in a material are generally bound to the atomic nucleus with well-defined binding energies, and what consequences this then has on the phenomena of refraction, reflection, and absorption.
In order to do this, we add two so-called dispersive corrections, so named because they depend on the photon energy.
We finish this section on the interaction of x-rays with matter, by considering the fate and subsequent products after absorption of x-rays, in particular the emission of fluorescence and electrons.
At the end of the last video, we described the atomic form factor of the elements as a function of the scattering vector Q (or equivalently, sin theta/lambda) using the expression shown here.
Note that f has a superscript â€œzeroâ€�, highlighted here in red.
This denotes that this expression is the simplest description of f, which assumes the electrons are unhindered in their response to the incoming x-rays by the fact that they are bound to atomic nucleii.
For photon energies much larger than the binding energy, this is a valid approximation.
(Turn to slide to the side) However, this is not always the case, as can be seen here for the most tightly bound electrons in the so-called K-shell (with principle quantum number n = 1) for all the naturally occurring elements.
The binding energy of the K-electron (indeed, the only electron) of a hydrogen atom is 13.6 eV.
The binding energy of K-electrons of the rest of the elements increase as the square of
Z, the atomic number, due to the increased
Coulomb attraction, which means the K-electron of uranium, the heaviest naturally occurring element, is above 100 keV, accessible at only the highest-energy synchrotron storage rings.
So it should be clear that in many cases, depending on the photon energy being applied and the elements present in the sample under investigation, the assumption of free motion of the electron, that is, that it is not influenced by being bound to the atom, is invalid.
We can model the response of a bound electron to an incident electromagnetic field to that of a forced oscillator, such as shown here as a ball on the end of a spring being forced to respond to an oscillatory driving force via a handle.
The spring with ball on it has a natural oscillation frequency, given by omega-zero.
If the driving frequency omega is much smaller than w0, the spring will remain stiff and the ball will move in phase with the driving handle.
In the other extreme on the right, the spring will react essentially instantaneously with the handle before the ball can respond, due to its inertia, and the ballâ€™s motion will therefore be exactly out of phase, that is, lagging by 180 degrees.
When the ball is driven at the natural frequency, the system is said to be in resonance and the ball moves at a phase 90 degrees lagging the driving force, and will have a maximum amplitude.
Note however, that although the electron moves out of phase with the E-field at high photon energies, the re-emitted radiation is in phase with the incident radiation, as the driving force is -eE, that is, it is negative.
An electron in an atom will respond similarly.
Because it cannot respond unhindered by its attraction to the nucleus, its response will be damped accordingly.
This means we need to add a negative term fâ€™ to f0 to represent this reduced response.
The sum of these, f1, is thus generally smaller than f0.
This reduction is most pronounced at resonance, where the photon energy equals the binding energy of the electron to the atom.
In addition we must consider absorption.
We include another component f2, which increases abruptly at resonance and is also shown here.
Importantly f2 lags f1 by 90 degrees, which is mathematically expressed by it being an imaginary term.
The total structure factor is thus a complex number, consisting of both real and imaginary components.
Exactly why the component representing absorption is imaginary (that is, lagging by 90 degrees) will become clear shortly.
We can represent the change in f graphically in a so-called Argand, or phase diagram.
For those of you unfamiliar with this construct, a document can be found in this weekâ€™s supplementary information.
It is certainly worth taking your time to understand Argand diagrams, as we will use them extensively in the part of the course on diffraction, especially with regards to anomalous effects.
Briefly, the original zeroth-order value for f, f-zero, is reduced by an amount fâ€™, to a new value f_1. 90 degrees out-of-phase to this is the imaginary component f_2, or if_2, the square-root of -1, i, representing this phase shift.
The vector product of these two components, f1 and if2, is the total structure factor f.
So let us summarise these concepts here. f0 is now modified by two correction terms: fâ€™ is a negative term reducing the scattering amplitude by the fact that the electron is bound. f1 is the sum of f0 and fâ€™ and is thus smaller than f0, as fâ€™ is always negative.
The second term fâ€� = f2 is 90 degrees lagging f1 and increases sharply at resonance, that is, when the photon energy equals the electronâ€™s binding energy.
The total atomic form factor is thus a complex value which depends on both the scattering vector Q and the photon energy hbar omega.
How does f2 depend on the photon energy?
It turns out that f2 = sigmaPA/(2 lambda r0).
We know that sigmaPA, the absorption cross-section, increases suddenly at resonance, and thus these features are referred to as absorption edges.
In addition, away from these edges, the absorption cross-section falls of as 1/hn cubed.
But because f2 is inversely proportional to lambda, which is itself inversely proportional to the photon energy, f2 is therefore proportional to the inverse square of the photon energy.
The double logarithmic plot shown here thus has a gradient of -2.
The dependence of the absorption cross-section and thus f2 on the element type away from absorption edges increases with the fifth power of Z for lighter elements, slowly changing to Z^4 with increasing Z.
Shown here are two real examples for the elements
Ga (Z = 31) and As (Z = 33).
Let us begin with f2, shown in green and red.
The K-absorption edge (i.e., the binding energy of its 1s electron) for Ga lies 1500 eV lower than that for As, as its attraction to the less positively charged nucleus is weaker. f1 is shown in blue and yellow.
Note also that I have plotted two curves each for Ga and As, in order to underline the fact that f1 depends not only on the photon energy, but also on the scattering vector Q. The two values of Q chosen here are 2.223 (for the upper blue and yellow curves) and 4.446 A-1
(for the lower blue and yellow curves), which, by the by, happen correspond to maxima in the diffraction pattern of GaAs.
We need not concern ourselves with this extra information here, but we will return to this later in the course.
Note also, that both f1 and f2 have detailed features, consisting of small oscillations.
These are not experimental artefacts, but are infact important features from which detailed information can be drawn in methods such as
EXAFS, also covered later in the course.
So, how do these additional refinements to the atomic form factor affect the properties of x-rays travelling through matter?
The phenomena we will be most interested in are refraction, reflection, and absorption.
We begin with refraction.
We are all familiar at some level with refraction in the visible regime.
Visible light travels more slowly in a transparent medium than in vacuum.
Imagine a platoon of soldiers walking in formation that come across a ploughed field at an oblique angle.
The first soldiers that begin to walk across the ploughed field will slow down.
As a result the distance between the rows of soldiers in the field is shortened, and their direction is altered.
Analogously, the wavelength of visible light is shortened; the velocity is smaller in a transparent medium by a factor n, known as the refractive index; and light beams are bent to steeper angles when entering the medium.
This simple concept explains why, for example, an object partially in water seems to be abruptly bent at the air-water interface, shown step for step here.
The change in angle of light travelling across a heterogeneous interface is given by Snellâ€™s law, shown here.
Let us consider the simpler case where the lighter medium has a refractive index nR = 1
(it is actually a vacuum).
First, it should be clear that refraction acts equally when the the light enters the medium or exits it.
Now let us reduce the angle alphaâ€™ until the angle alpha outside the medium is reduced to zero.
The cosine of zero degrees is 1, and hence cos alphaâ€™, which we relabel in this special case to alpha_c, is equal to 1/nRâ€™.
Below this angle, which is typically about
40 degrees for water, all light impinging on the interface will be reflected back into the medium.
This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection, and is used, for example, to channel light along optical fibres in telecommunication.
This is shown nicely in the video on the left
- the water surface acts as a somewhat wobbly mirror, reflecting the carapace of the turtle.
So that was refraction in the visible.
We now consider the refractive index of matter for the case of x-rays.
This is a complex number, containing a real part nR and imaginary component inI.
We will now see that the real part of the complex refractive index is responsible for refraction of x-rays, while the imaginary part describes absorption.
Remember that we have just also stated that the atomic form factor is also complex?
This is no coincidence.
It turns out that the refractive index n for x-rays is related to the atomic form factor by this expression.
But we know that f = f1 + if2, so we can insert this into our expression for n, and immediately identify the expressions for nR and nI.
We simplify the expression for n as n = 1
- delta + i beta.
Let us begin by considering the sum term.
The real part of this is simply the sum over all elements i within the material of their number density Ni, multiplied by the real part of their atomic form factor in the forward direction (Q = 0).
Far from an absorption edge, f1i(0) is equal to Zi, the atomic number of the i-th atom type.
Thus the sum is nothing more than the number density of the electrons in the material in units of electrons per unit volume.
Even close to absorption edges, we can equate the sum to the EFFECTIVE electron number density.
So we insert rho into our expression for delta.
From this, we should immediately recognise that delta is inversely proportional to the square of the photon energy, as all the other elements of the equation are (far from an absorption edge) independent of hn.
As we discussed earlier, however, f2i is itself inversely proportional to the square of the photon energy, and hence beta falls of with the inverse fourth power of hn.
We will return to this fact of this differing dependence of beta and delta in the technique of phase-contrast tomography towards the end of the course.
The next thing we should do is estimate how large delta and beta are, in other words, how much does the refractive index for x-rays differ from unity (i.e., no change at all).
We already know that x-rays pass relatively unhindered through matter, so we might (correctly) suspect that these dispersion corrections are small.
First, because Z is always close to being half of the atomic mass, and because interatomic spacings in condensed matter do not vary wildly, one can easily generate a very rough and ready rule of thumb that the electron density is of the order of Z/20, expressed in electrons per cubic Angstrom.
For one-Angstrom radiation, the rest of the expression for delta is approximately 4 x
10^-6 cubic Angstrom, which thus yields a value for delta of 2Z x 10^-7.
Thus, even for the heaviest elements, delta is of the order of 2 x 10^-5, much less than unity.
Beta varies more strongly according to the sum term, but is even smaller still than delta in most cases by up to three or more orders of magnitude, depending on both the element and photon energy.
So, in summary, the refractive index in the x-ray regime equals unity minus a tiny amount, plus an imaginary component of even tinier magnitude.
Before we apply these new insights to the phenomena of refraction, reflection, and absorption, a small but important issue should be mentioned.
The more attentive student might object to the fact that the refractive index is less than one for x-rays.
Doesnâ€™t this imply that the velocity of x-rays in matter exceeds c, the speed of light in vacuum?
Indeed it does.
However, this is referring to the PHASE velocity, the speed at which the peaks and troughs of the electromagnetic train move.
The GROUP velocity, however, is equal to cn, which is less than c, and it is this that describes the propagation of energy or information, or here, the speed of the â€œpacketâ€� or envelope of light.
Einsteinâ€™s theory of special relativity remains inviolate!
So, now let us consider Snellâ€™s law for x-rays.
Because n is less than unity, the x-rays are bent to shallower angles when traversing from a lighter to a denser material.
Using the same arguments as earlier for visible light, there will therefore be a critical incident angle alpha_c for which the x-rays will be entirely externally reflected at the surface.
This means mirrors can be constructed for x-rays.
How large is alpha_c.
From Snellâ€™s law, we see this is equal to the real component of the refractive index, nR = 1 - delta, which we know to be only very marginally less than unity.
The Taylor expansion of the cosine function can be very accurately approximated by 1 - x2/2 for x being a small angle (given in radians,
NOT degrees!)
For those of you unfamiliar with the angle unit the radian, there are 2 pi radians in a circle, therefore one radian = 360 degrees/2 pi = 57.296 degrees).
Hence we can state that 1 - alpha_c^2/2 = 1
- delta, and therefore alpha_c is equal to the square-root of 2 delta, when expressed in radians.
So, for example, a block of silicon ***** will reflect 10-keV x-rays at incident angles shallower than 0.179 degrees.
***** ***** So if an x-ray beam has a height of 1 mm, ***** its footprint along the mirror will be very long, ***** of the order of 30 cm.
X-ray mirrors at synchrotrons are therefore generally large components.
Because they also need to be exceedingly flat on both a macroscopic and atomic level, they are also very expensive!
Lastly, it should be mentioned that even at incident angles shallower than the critical angle, the x-rays do penetrate a short distance into the reflecting surface in an evanescent wave.
This should be intuitively obvious, as the x-rays must interact at some level with the material to â€œknowâ€� that they will be reflected.
Close to an absorption edge, this will result in a reduction in the critical angle by a factor equal to to the square root of the jump in beta at that edge.
This is shown here for rhodium below, above, and at the K-absorption edge at 23.22 keV.
It will also result in some absorption and a lowered reflectivity.
We now move on to absorption.
When an x-ray wave passes into a block of material, the wavefronts will increase their separation by a factor 1/nR = 1/(1-delta), while the amplitude E0 of the electromagnetic radiation will drop off exponentially due to absorption.
How can we relate this exponential decay with the absorption index, beta?
The description of the propagation in time and space of a plane wave in vacuum is given in the Eulerian formalism by E(z,t) = Eo exp(i(k0z - wt)).
When travelling through matter, one must include the refractive index n on the spatial term, highlighted here in red.
But n = nR + inI, so inserting this into the equation, we can break it down in to an exponential decay term with exponent (-inIk0z) and an temporal or oscillatory term.
The amplitude of the x-ray wave thus decays such that after a distance (1/nIk0), it is
1/e (or about 37%) of its original value.
However, the intensity of the beam, the thing we actually measure, is proportional to the square of the amplitude, and hence the beam intensity will decay to 1/e after only (1/2nIk0).
This factor is the absorption length.
The absorption coefficient mu is the reciprocal of this and is therefore equal to 2nIk0.
Because nI = beta is proportional to the inverse fourth power of the photon energy, mu is therefore proportional to the inverse third power.
As one can see from the graph on the right, depending on the electron density of the material and the photon energy, the absorption length can vary from the order of 10 nm for lead at low photon energies, to centimetres for beryllium in the hard x-ray regime.
We finish this video by considering what possible subsequent processes might occur after removing an electron by absorption of a photon.
For the purposes of this course, we consider four main products, namely the photoelectron itself, fluorescence, Auger emission, and secondary electrons.
The photoelectron is the direct product of absorption.
The promoted electron may actually reside in an unoccupied orbital if the photon energy is only marginally larger than the electronâ€™s binding energy.
Such orbitals are accessed and the information used to work out both chemical and orientational information in the technique of XANES (also called NEXAFS), which we discuss later.
If the electron leaves the atom entirely, it can be detected, its kinetic energy determined, and from this and a knowledge of the photon energy, the binding energy of the electron calculated.
Subtle changes in this value provide invaluable chemical information in the technique of XPS
(also called ESCA), while the dependence of the yield as a function of both photon energy and exit angle of the electron in single-crystal samples, yields detailed information on the sampleâ€™s electronic structure in angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (or ARPES).
The removal of a core electron can cause another electron from a less tightly bound orbital to relax into the â€œholeâ€� left behind.
The excess energy produced by this can be channeled in one of two ways.
Firstly, this energy can be removed as a photon in the form of fluorescence at characteristic photon energies, which is exploited in x-ray fluorescence techniques.
Alternatively, the excess energy can cause yet another electron to be ejected.
As the kinetic energy of this so-called Auger electron depends only on the energy difference between the initial hole state and that of the relaxing electron; and the binding energy of the Auger electron, its kinetic energy is independent of the incident photon energy, which distinguishes it from direct photoelectrons.
Auger processes tend to dominate for low-Z atoms, while fluorescence occurs more commonly for heavier elements.
Finally, any ejected electron will on average collide with other electrons after a certain characteristic distance, measured in nanometers or at most tens of nanometers for most kinetic energies under consideration.
This makes Auger spectroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy very surface sensitive.
If, however, the ejected electron is generated deeper in the sample (remember, the penetration depth of x-rays is normally significantly larger than the escape depth of electrons) then it will undergo multiple collisions, producing a cascade effect and the production of many more secondary electrons which have been thermalised and have energies measured in fractions of an electronvolt.
This signal is often used as an indirect measure of absorption strength, such as in the spectromicroscopic technique of photoemission electron microscopy
(PEEM).
Summarising this second video for this week, we have seen how an electron bound to an atom responds differently to incident x-rays than in the free-electron model we introduced in the last video.
This causes scattering to be reduced, particularly when the photon energy is close to the binding energy of the electron.
The resonant component causes energy loss and absorption to occur.
We then argued how these dispersive corrections to the atomic form factor are correlated to the phenomena of refraction, reflection, and absorption of x-rays, and provided quantitative expressions linking the atomic form factor with the complex refractive index in the x-ray regime.
Lastly, we briefly summarised which processes can occur once a photon is absorbed, and how these can be used in synchrotron methods to investigate the properties of material.
Next week, we will discuss the physics behind the generation of synchrotron light, often referred to as â€œmachine physicsâ€�.
