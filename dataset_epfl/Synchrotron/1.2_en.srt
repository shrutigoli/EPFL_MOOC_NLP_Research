00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:09,490
In this second video of the first week of
this course, we consider why are x-rays so

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,370
ubiquitous in society and in scientific endeavours.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:18,690
Before we answer this, a distinction should
be made between x-rays of different energy

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,660
ranges, as their interactions with matter
vary strongly accordingly.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,250
Typically, one speaks of soft, tender, and
hard x-rays.

6
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,640
Soft x-rays begin after the visible and ultraviolet
regime and cover a wavelength range of approximately

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,399
100 nm down to 0.6 nm; hard x-rays have wavelengths
shorter than 0.3 nm.

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:52,420
Perhaps counterintuitively, it is 
soft x-rays that in general interact much

9
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:57,789
more strongly with matter than do hard x-rays,
and it is this property which has resulted

10
00:00:57,789 --> 00:00:59,989
in their distinction.

11
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:05,519
Because the transition between soft and hard
x-rays is not abrupt and is anyway somewhat

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,260
arbitrary, depending strongly on the material
being irradiated, the concept of tender x-rays

13
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,870
was introduced to bridge these two regimes.

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:21,720
Normally, however, one characterizes x-rays
by their photon energy E rather than their

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,760
wavelength λ.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,741
A photon is the indivisible quantum unit of
light characterized by the light’s wavelength

17
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:36,090
or frequency, and was first postulated by
Albert Einstein in 1905.

18
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,750
The relationship between energy and wavelength
is given by the Planck-Einstein relation E

19
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:52,060
= hc/λ, where h is Planck’s constant = 6.63
x 10-34 J.s and c is the speed of light in

20
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,060
vacuum = 2.9979 x 10^8 m/s.

21
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,950
See the supplementary table for a list of
the physical constants most commonly used

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,300
in this course.

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:11,420
Inserting these into the equation, one sees
that even for the hardest (that is, the most

24
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,579
energetic) x-rays used in synchrotron science
(which have wavelengths of the order of a

25
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:20,660
picometer), photon energies are of the order
of a tenth of a thousandth of a billionth

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,459
of a Joule (i.e., 10-13 J).

27
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:30,490
The Joule is therefore obviously not a convenient
energy unit to use when discussing x-ray photon

28
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:38,609
energies - I would never tell my doctor, for
example, that I weigh 4.27 x 10-29 solar masses.

29
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:41,640
Instead, we use the electronvolt.

30
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,719
This is the gain in kinetic energy of an electron
when it is accelerated across an electric

31
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:55,269
potential of 1 Volt and is equal to 1.6022
x 10-19 Joules.

32
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,719
Using this unit of energy, one can quickly
derive this simple practical relationship

33
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:05,760
between photon energy expressed in electron
volts and wavelength expressed in nanometers,

34
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:15,069
given by E in eV = 1239.84/lambda in nanometers.

35
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:21,559
Because many x-ray scientists prefer to use
the length unit Angstrom (0.1 of a nanometer

36
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:31,799
= 10-10 m), we can also re-express the relationship
as E in eV = 12398.4/lambda, where lambda

37
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,540
is now expressed in Angstroms.

38
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,659
So, for example, the photon energy of one-Angstrom
hard x-rays is 12.3984 keV.

39
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:45,989
We will use this expression many times in
this course, so I recommend you become familiar

40
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,099
with it.

41
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:51,420
The different x-ray regimes shown earlier
are redrawn here, but now in relationship

42
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,010
to the photon energy.

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:01,999
The vacuum ultraviolet and soft x-rays produced
at synchrotrons begin at 10 to 20 eV and continue

44
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:08,069
up to approximately 2000 eV.

45
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:15,449
Hard x-rays conventionally begin at 4 keV,
while the tender regime spans the gap between

46
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,580
2 and 4 keV.

47
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:22,160
Hard x-rays are used at airports and in medicine
primarily because of their large penetration

48
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,080
depths through matter and changes in these
according to the density of material being

49
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,160
irradiated, as can be seen in this graph – as
a rule of thumb, the lighter the material,

50
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,230
the more transparent it is to x-rays, while
the shorter the x-ray wavelength (or, in other

51
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,560
words, the higher the x-ray energy), the more
penetrating it will be.

52
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,810
It is often said that x-rays are “nondestructive”.

53
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,530
This is true insofar that they allow one to
see the inner structure and composition of

54
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:00,670
an object without the need to open or slice
it, though on another level, they can most

55
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:07,770
certainly be harmful, due to chemical processes
that are induced after their absorption.

56
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:16,700
A useful unit to describe absorption of x-rays
is the Gray (Gy).

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,590
One Gray is equal to one Joule of absorbed
radiation energy per kilogram.

58
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:29,560
A dose of approximately 5 Gy in one exposure
(equivalent to approximately 400 J absorbed

59
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,870
radiation for an adult weighing 80 kg) will
usually result in death within 14 days.

60
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,880
To put this in perspective, the same amount
of deposited energy would warm a cup of tea

61
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,810
up by about 0.5 degrees Celsius; or is equal
to the sunlight absorbed by a sunbather on

62
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,460
a sunny day after approximately half a second…

63
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,430
This remarkable difference in the impact of
the same amount of total absorbed energy is

64
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,590
due to the fact that the x-ray photons directly
channel their energy into the release of otherwise

65
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,340
bound electrons, that can wreak havoc by inducing
chemical reactions, often in a cascade effect,

66
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,160
depending on the details of the absorption
process.

67
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,580
Perhaps the best definition of hard x-rays
is that they have wavelengths comparable to

68
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,260
or shorter than typical distances between
atoms (that is, the bond lengths).

69
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:37,960
The shortest bond length under normal pressure
is that of the H2 molecule, at 0.74 Angstroms;

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:46,420
while bonds between heavy elements can exceed
3 Angstroms, the wavelength of 4-keV photons.

71
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:55,430
Shown here is 10-keV x-radiation passing over
carbon-carbon single, double, and triple bonds.

72
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,080
This property of hard x-rays makes them useful
in investigating the atomic structures of

73
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,750
materials, in techniques such as x-ray diffraction.

74
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:14,190
Lastly, hard x-rays have energies similar
to bonding energies of core electrons in atoms.

75
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,220
In this figure, the four most tightly bound
electron shells are plotted as a function

76
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:23,560
of Z, the atomic number from Z = 1 (hydrogen)
to Z = 92 (uranium).

77
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:31,550
The hard x-ray regime can access all elements
with atomic numbers above Z = 20 (the atomic

78
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,590
number of calcium).

79
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:40,640
This property can be exploited in hard x-ray
spectroscopies and also in crystallography,

80
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,690
as an aid to solving structures from data
recorded at specially chosen photon energies.

81
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,000
What are then the main attributes of soft
x-rays that make them useful tools in investigating

82
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,490
the properties of matter?

83
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,370
The lower photon energy of x-rays means that
they interact primarily with light atoms and

84
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,210
the outer, or valence, electrons of heavier
atoms.

85
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:10,389
This is exploited to investigate many different
properties of materials such as, for example,

86
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:17,350
the electronic properties of metals, semiconductors,
and superconductors; the chemical composition

87
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:27,250
of heterogeneous systems; or the imaging of
magnetic domains down to the nanometer scale.

88
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,139
Summarising this video, we have discussed
the wavelengths and photon energies associated

89
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:38,729
with ultraviolet radiation, soft, and hard
x-rays, how they interact with matter, and

90
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:45,480
thereby provided a brief insight into hoe
they might be applied in the natural sciences.

91
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,560
In the next video, we encounter synchrotrons
for the first time - what they look like,

92
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,070
with an overview of their components.

93
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:00,800
Four simple attributes synchrotrons are introduced
as it is these that make them so popular.

94
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,270
From this, the concept of “brilliance”,
or “brightness” will be introduced as

95
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,150
a figure of merit for the performance of synchrotron
facilities.

96
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:16,240
A brief summary of the progress in brilliance
over the last 100 years will lead us also

97
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,810
to the two “new kids on the block” in
the world of x-ray science, namely x-ray free-electron

98
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,510
lasers (XFELs) and diffraction-limited storage
rings (DLSRs).
