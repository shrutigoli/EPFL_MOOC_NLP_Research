00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:12,440
Welcome to the third and final video of Week
7 of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,590
and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we discuss techniques that

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:27,310
probe either photons or electrons resulting
after absorption. Specifically, we will discuss

4
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:37,820
the photon-in - photon-out techniques of x-ray
fluorescence and RIXS, plus variants of photoelectron

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:45,330
spectroscopy, in particular x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoelectrons

6
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,420
spectroscopy, and hard x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,350
Fluorescence spectroscopies are photon-in
- photon-out techniques and can be carried

8
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:04,320
out on both conducting and insulating samples.
As a result, these techniques can often be

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:13,350
applied under ambient or indeed in-vivo environments,
depending on the energy range of interest.

10
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,719
X-ray fluorescence generally probes the fluorescence
spectrum resulting from absorption at a fixed

11
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:29,719
incident photon energy, although excitation
can also be via impact of energetic electrons.

12
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,569
Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, on the
other hand, probes the emission spectra as

13
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:40,030
a function of incident photon energy.

14
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:47,060
X-ray fluorescence probes the photons emitted
as a consequence of relaxation of the system

15
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:57,979
after photoabsorption.
The energy ranges of XRF and XAS are related,

16
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:07,289
insofar that where XRF ends, XAS begins. This
is because the emission spectrum probes the

17
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:17,570
highest-energy occupied states, whereas XAS
spectra only begin at the lowest-energy unoccupied

18
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,400
states.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,230
X-ray fluorescence is a powerful method for
determining the chemical composition of objects

20
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:34,129
that are either too thick for transmission-absorption
measurements, or are insulating and therefore

21
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:45,620
preclude photoemission techniques. XRF is
used widely in geochemistry, archaeology,

22
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:53,790
forensic science, and investigations of rare
or ancient artefacts. It exploits the ‘fingerprint’

23
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,870
characteristic radiation of the elements for
chemical and elemental analysis.

24
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:09,530
In x-ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy, the
dispersed XRF signal is mapped out spatially

25
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:19,590
using a focussed beam. This can be performed
either using EDX or a von-Hamos spectrometer.

26
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:33,080
WDX setups, in which the fluorescence energy
is serially scanned, are too slow.

27
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:43,219
XRF signal is strongly absorbed by air for
emission below approximately 2500 eV, which

28
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:51,170
corresponds to Sulphur or Chlorine K-alpha
emission, or thereabouts. For emission signal

29
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:58,790
below this photon energy, the path to the
detector should be evacuated to avoid absorption

30
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,989
by the residual gas, such that the product
of the sample–detector distance and pressure

31
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:14,901
is less than approximately 1 Pa m (note that
there are 100’000 Pa per atmosphere, or

32
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:24,341
100 Pa per mbar). A sample-detector distance
of 10 cm would thus require pressures of the

33
00:04:24,341 --> 00:04:30,000
order of 0.1 mbar or lower.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,080
If the XRF spectra are energetically well
resolved, requiring either a WDX or von-Hamos

35
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:46,380
setup, subtle peak shifts and splittings can
be detected, much as in XANES. For example,

36
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:55,449
the K-alpha lines omitted by 3d-elements,
produce two lines, K-alpha-1 and K-alpha-2,

37
00:04:55,449 --> 00:05:04,800
caused by spin-orbit splitting of the core
2p-electron energy level. This is still energetically

38
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:14,830
removed from the valence states, the states
that are most affected by chemistry, and thus

39
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,760
provide little or no chemical information.
In contrast, relaxation from the 3p electron

40
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,690
levels (the so-called k-beta lines) ***** exhibit
more subtle splittings and shifts, due to

41
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:36,791
the significantly stronger interaction between
the 3p-states and the 3d-valence band. If

42
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:43,220
the spectra are recorded with an energy resolution
of the order of an eV or better, valuable

43
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:50,420
information of the local oxidation state and
chemical bonding can be gleaned.

44
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:58,620
An example is shown here of x-ray fluorescence
microspectroscopy carried out on the famous

45
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:09,229
fossil specimen of archaeopteryx thermopolis
at the SSRL in Stanford, recorded with incident

46
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:22,511
energies of 3.15 keV and 13.5 keV for low-Z
and high-Z elements, respectively, and a spatial

47
00:06:22,511 --> 00:06:31,550
resolution of 100 microns.
Results show that portions of the feathers

48
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:38,669
are not merely impressions, but are in fact
remnant body fossil structures, that, remarkably,

49
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,250
have maintained elemental compositions that
are completely different from the embedding

50
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:53,300
geological matrix, indicating elemental retention
in soft tissue (through the presence of phosphorus

51
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:01,900
and sulfur), as well as trace metal (Zn and
Cu) retention in bone structures over many

52
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:10,180
tens of millions of years. In addition, information
about the likely fossilisation process (known

53
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,370
as “taphonomy”) could be extracted.

54
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:27,639
Both XRF and x-ray absorption spectroscopy
are sensitive to local electronic structure

55
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:34,789
and bonding around the absorbing/emitting
atom. When one combines these techniques,

56
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:40,800
further detailed information becomes possible,
in the relatively new technique of resonant

57
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,669
inelastic x-ray spectroscopy, or RIXS. RIXS
has many analogies with Raman spectroscopy

58
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,990
in the visible and infrared regime.
The energy difference between the emitted

59
00:07:53,990 --> 00:08:03,560
photon and the incident photon can range between
some meV and a few eV. This energy loss, plus

60
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:12,349
the momentum transfer and change in polarization
between the incoming and outgoing photon is

61
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,490
directly associated with the production of
an electron-hole pair, induced by one or more

62
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,810
important processes related to electronic
and superconducting properties, such as phonon,

63
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,660
magnon, or low-energy electronic excitations.

64
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:43,029
Like I just said, RIXS is the marriage of
conventional x-ray absorption and x-ray fluorescence

65
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:51,640
in a single experiment. RIXS signal can be
directly generated following resonant absorption

66
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,870
of a photon by an atom promoting an electron
to an unoccupied conduction-band state, followed

67
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:12,540
by relaxation of a lower-lying state to the
core, resulting in the formation of an electron-hole

68
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,529
pair.
Indirect RIXS signal occurs when absorption

69
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:27,310
and relaxation are between the same two states,
but, when the atom is in the excited intermediate

70
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:34,100
state, a strong electrostatic screening potential
around the core hole ‘shakes’ the atom,

71
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,760
resulting in the promotion of an electron
from the valence- to the conduction band and

72
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,750
an energetic rearrangement of the absorbing
upper level.

73
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:56,290
XAS and/or XRF alone cannot probe the electron
momenta and can therefore yield no insights

74
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,760
into the material’s electronic bandstructure.
The reason for this is essentially because

75
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:11,190
a core hole is involved — in the case of
XAS this hole is in the final state after

76
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:20,720
absorption, while in XRF it is in the initial
state. due to the local formation of a hole,

77
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,760
this results in a breakdown of the crystal’s
translational symmetry at exactly the location

78
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:34,630
where the measurement is being made, which
has the consequence that k, the electron momentum,

79
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:42,110
is no longer well defined.
In RIXS, neither the initial or final states

80
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:49,610
contain a core vacancy and thus momentum remains
a good quantum number. This makes RIXS an

81
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,620
important adjunct to ARPES, described later
in this video, as a probe for the electronic

82
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:05,680
bandstructure of a wide variety of materials.
In addition, because RIXS excitations are

83
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:13,500
second-order and involve the virtual absorption
of a photon, certain excitations (such as

84
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,680
the d − d excitation between 3d-states in
transition-metal oxides) are allowed, but

85
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,220
which are forbidden in direct optical processes.

86
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,220
A unique feature of RIXS is the very large
range of energies and momenta that can be

87
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:44,339
transferred to the system under investigation
in the inelastic scattering event. This is

88
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:55,140
because photons instead of electrons (used
in photoelectron studies) are used as probes.

89
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,670
For a given wavelength lambda (be it the de
Broglie wavelength of the electron or the

90
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:07,430
photon wavelength), or more conveniently,
the wavenumber k, which equals 2pi/lambda,

91
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:16,290
and is directly proportional to the momentum,
the ratio of the photon- to electron energy

92
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:34,260
is hnu/Ee = hbar c k divided by hbar^2k^2
over 2m, which equals 2 mc/hbar k, or in practical

93
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:47,960
units 517.3/k, where k is expressed in reciprocal
Angstroms. So for typical wavevectors of the

94
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:55,200
order of 1 reciprocal Angstrom, the range
of energies and scattering vectors Q available

95
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:04,220
to RIXS surpass other x-ray methods by approximately
two orders of magnitude.

96
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,840
One distinguishes two types of energy-loss
features in RIXS, according to whether they

97
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:17,829
vary or not as a function of the incident
photon energy hbar Ω. Features which are

98
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:26,360
independent of hbar Q appear as vertical lines
in a two-dimensional plot of energy transfer

99
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:37,820
versus incident energy, shown here schematically.
They represent electron-hole pair excitations

100
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,949
associated with two well-defined states and
are therefore products of RIXS processes.

101
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:51,300
Their analogy in the optical regime are Stokes
phonons in Raman spectroscopy, from which

102
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:59,740
they obtain their name of Raman peaks. In
contrast, those features which exhibit a constant

103
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:11,050
emission photon energy are called x-ray fluorescence-
or emission lines. In the plot of energy transfer

104
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:18,370
versus incident energy, these lines have a
gradient of unity.

105
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:28,910
We turn now to photoelectron spectroscopies.
There are many variants of PES. Ultraviolet

106
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,260
and very soft x-rays probe the most weakly
bound, valence electrons of a system, and

107
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,209
can provide important information on the material’s
electronic band structure, particularly when

108
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:48,670
the electron momentum (that is, it’s emission
direction relative to the crystal lattice

109
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:57,290
from which it emerged) is also recorded.
At higher photon energies, core electrons

110
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:05,970
can also be accessed, providing information
on the sample chemistry in the technique of

111
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:13,720
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, originally
named electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis,

112
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,860
or ESCA.
Scattering phenomena of the photoelectrons

113
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,290
as they emerge for the sample surface can
provide invaluable structural information

114
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:37,550
of that surface and near-surface region.
Hard x-ray PES, or HAXPES, uses high-energy

115
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:45,690
x-rays, not to access information of the chemistry
via excitation of core electrons, but instead

116
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:52,040
to probe the electronic properties of the
sample via the valence electrons, similar

117
00:15:52,040 --> 00:16:02,180
to the case of ARPES. However, because the
photon energy is high and the valence-electron

118
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:10,670
binding energies low, the photoelectron energies
will also be high. This brings us towards

119
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,639
the high-energy regime of the universal curve,
for which the inelastic mean-free path is

120
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:25,779
higher. As a result, HAXPES probes not the
surface region, but instead the sample’s

121
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:32,569
bulk properties, or, indeed, the electronic
properties of interfacial regions in thin-film

122
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:38,350
heterostructures.

123
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:46,370
We begin our discussion of PES with the physical
process responsible for the generation of

124
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:54,310
photoelectrons, the photoelectric effect.
This is the phenomenon that electrons can

125
00:16:54,310 --> 00:17:04,760
be emitted from the surface of a metal, but
only if the wavelength of light used is shorter

126
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:14,710
than a critical value. Light of longer wavelengths
than this fail to eject electrons, even if

127
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:22,160
higher beam intensities are used. Although
both Heinrich Hertz and JJ Thomson observed

128
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,310
aspects of the photoelectric effect, it would
take the insights of Albert Einstein to explain

129
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:35,610
it. Einstein invoked the concept of there
being a minimum packet of energy associated

130
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,670
with light of a frequency nu, and that light
consisted of these packets, or quanta, of

131
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:56,420
light, called nowadays photons. This paradigm
shift in the description of light as consisting

132
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:03,550
of particles instead of being a wave would
earn Einstein a Nobel prize in physics in

133
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:09,220
1921.

134
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:16,130
The threshold upper wavelength for electron
emission, or, more intuitively, the lowest

135
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:26,100
frequency, is associated with the so-called
work function. The work function arises because,

136
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:32,410
as an electron originally residing in a state
at the top of the valence band is removed

137
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:39,470
from the surface of a material, it is attracted
by its positively charged mirror image that

138
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:47,670
is produced by a rearrangement of the surface
charge resulting from its departure.

139
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:56,000
Only at distances of more than about 100 Angstroms
does this electrostatic image force become

140
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,180
negligible. This image potential is the reason
why electricity does not ‘leak’ out from

141
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:09,370
metals and electrons do not shoot out of kinks
in current-carrying wires; so, for typical

142
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:17,750
work functions of 5 eV, one would require
electric field strengths of the order of 100

143
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:28,950
MeV/m to electrostatically remove electrons
from metal surfaces.

144
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:35,870
The energy of the photoelectrons is thus equal
to the photon energy minus the electron binding

145
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:45,680
energy and also minus the work function. Both
UPS and XPS in general produce electrons with

146
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:53,390
kinetic energies between a few tens of eV
and approximately 1000 eV , for which the

147
00:19:53,390 --> 00:20:09,390
IMFP is less than a nanometer. In the HAXPES
regime, the photon energy is generally significantly

148
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:15,100
larger than the binding energy, resulting
in electron kinetic energies well in excess

149
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:24,480
of a kiloelectronvolt . In this regime, the
electrons’ IMFP is significantly larger,

150
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,270
and bulk properties of the sample can be investigated.

151
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:38,150
The electron kinetic energies are determined
using concentric hemispherical analysers,

152
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:47,050
or CHAs. For an electron of energy E_e to
exit through the centre of the exit hole of

153
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:57,700
the CHA, the conditions given by the equation
here must be met. However, electrons with

154
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:04,820
lower energies will be more deviated by the
electric field between the concentric domes,

155
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:14,080
while those of higher energies, less so. By
using a larger exit aperture and an area electron

156
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,740
detector such as a multichannel plate, a two
dimensional plot can be recorded, in which

157
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:28,840
the energy is dispersed in one direction,
and angular differences in emission are distinguished

158
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,690
in the perpendicular direction. In this manner,
large regions of both energy and momentum

159
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:45,060
can be simultaneously recorded, accelerating
data acquisition, particularly in the technique

160
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:48,540
of ARPES.

161
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,510
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (or
UPS) uses photon energies of the order of

162
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:06,120
10 eV up to approximately 200 eV. In this
regime, mainly the valence electrons are probed,

163
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,760
as the photon energy is insufficient to eject
core electrons other than those in the very

164
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:20,060
lightest elements, which are in any case strongly
affected by bonding.

165
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,970
The valence electrons are in general responsible
for the electronic properties of materials.

166
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,010
By also recording the direction of the photoelectrons
relative to the crystallographic structure

167
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:40,480
of single-crystal samples, a detailed description
of the electronic properties can be made.
