Hello and welcome!
My name is Phil Willmott.
I will be guiding you through the world of x-ray science and its applications in this introductory course â€œSynchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers - techniques and applicationsâ€�.
I am a physicist by training, but have been exposed to many other disciplines both over the last decade-and-a-half working at synchrotrons, but also earlier in my academic career.
Presently, in addition to being an adjunct professor at the University of Zurich, I am responsible for running the Materials Science beamline at the Swiss Light Source at the
Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.
This course is partly based on my introductory textbook on synchrotron radiation, which is available through most online bookstores, or the publisherâ€™s website, John Wiley and
Sons, for those who would like to review many of the concepts presented here at their own leisure, using the more traditional medium of the written page, or read deeper into aspects of particular interest.
In this first, introductory, week, we will cover the following topics.
After a brief description of who might be users of synchrotron radiation (including glimpses into some applications), the range of wavelengths (or, alternatively, photon energies) typically produced by synchrotron facilities within the context of length and energy scales in the material world will be outlined.
Lastly, a short overview follows of synchrotron and XFEL machines and what makes them so desirable.
In this video a cartoon of the generation of synchrotron light is shown and will be described in detail later in the course.
Stated simply, synchrotrons provide intense sources of electromagnetic radiation over large ranges of wavelengths, typically spanning values marginally shorter than that of visible light (i.e., beginning at approximately 100 nm in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet regime) to hard x-rays with wavelengths that are one to two orders of magnitude shorter than typical chemical bond lengths.
This brilliant source of tunable radiation is used in a myriad of ways to investigate manifold properties of innumerable sample types!
Shown here are just some recent examples spanning disciplines as varied as art history to magnetic nanostructures.
In this course I will use the terms â€œlightâ€� and â€œelectromagnetic radiationâ€� interchangeably and synonymously to cover the range of wavelengths covered by synchrotron facilities that spans approximately five orders of magnitude.
Who might be interested in using synchrotron radiation?
Before about two to three decades ago, synchrotron science was almost exclusively the province of physicists and physical chemists.
In contrast, modern-day synchrotron users come from all walks of scientific and academic life, from art history, palaeontology, and cultural ethnology, to molecular biology, materials science, and high-tech industry, as shown clearly in this pie chart.
To accommodate this growing demand, there are now several tens of synchrotrons around the world, of which some of the more prominent examples are shown here in yellow; along with the six free-electron lasers operating in the UV or x-ray regime presently either under construction or in operation, shown here in red.
The impact of x-rays and synchrotron light on society is reflected in the number of Nobel prizes that have been awarded in this field.
Since the first Nobel prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen for his discovery of x-rays, 21 prizes have been awarded for x-ray science.
Of these, nine have been in the field of molecular biology, of which the four most recent (awarded in
2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012, all for chemistry) used synchrotron light as a primary tool in their investigations, a fact which I believe reflects the emergence of synchrotrons in the last two decades as one of the primary reach tools in the natural sciences and beyond.
From this, it should be clear that synchrotron science represents one of the premier examples of interdisciplinary research.
It is my belief that this diversity of potential applications would be further expanded if
(a) the power of synchrotron science were more effectively disseminated to the wider community; and (b) those contemplating using synchrotron light were not so intimidated by the perceived complexity of this powerful tool.
One of the primary aims of this course is to tackle both of these obstacles.
Let us return to the last of the examples shown in the previous video â€“ the â€œNobel trilogy of lifeâ€�.
How does nature construct a living thing from simple chemical components?
For example, how does a human emerge nine months after the unique mixing of its parentsâ€™ genetic material contained in a single fertilized egg?
When I was a child, these questions were only just beginning to be answered.
Indeed, just five months before my own birth, the Nobel committee announced that the 1962 prize for physiology or medicine would be awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick, and
Maurice Wilkins for their elucidation of the structure of deoxyribosenucleic acid (DNA) and (quoting from the Nobel committeeâ€™s announcement) â€œits significance for information transfer in living materialâ€�.
It was Rosalind Franklinâ€™s famous x-ray â€œphotograph 51â€� of DNA crystal diffraction which provided the final clue to the structure.
Franklin would sadly die of ovarian cancer before the Nobel prize was awarded.
DNA resides permanently within the nucleus of a living cell.
How then, is its information conveyed to the rest of the cell and elsewhere in the organism; how is new living material subsequently synthesized; and how do initial (â€œstemâ€�) cells differentiate into specialized cells as diverse as ganglions, muscle cells, or skin?
Major steps towards answering these questions were made in research that would result in
Nobel prizes in chemistry in 2006 and 2009.
The first step in carrying out the commands encoded in DNA is its transcription into so-called messenger-RNA, which then leaves the confines of the nucleus to the protein-producing parts of the cell.
How mRNA is synthesized and carries the genetic information with high fidelity, via a very special macromolecule called RNA-polymerase, was reported by Roger Kornberg and co-workers in 2001, for which he received the 2006 Nobel prize in chemistry.
The following step, that of protein synthesis, uses the blueprint of the messenger RNA, plus raw material in the form of amino acids attached to small transfer-RNA (tRNA) molecules in a chemical factory called the ribosome.
The detailed description of the mechanisms by which this highly complex biomolecular process occurs won Ada Yonath, Thomas Steitz, and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2009.
This course is not about molecular biology.
It is, however, concerned with diverse aspects of a tool now considered indispensible to molecular biologists â€“ synchrotron radiation.
The thematic link between the above works is that of structure â€“ atomic structure â€“ and its implicitly inherent importance in determining biomolecular activity.
X-rays and, in recent years synchrotron radiation, have played a central role in this enterprise.
The relevance of these studies goes well beyond that of pure academic understanding â€“ the detailed description of the DNA transcription process, as well as a knowledge of the biochemical function of the ribosome, are already having a huge impact on the design of novel antibiotic substances and other drugs, plus a deeper understanding of how some cancers arise and how they might be tackled.
The year that Yonath, Ramakrishnan, and Steitz were awarded their Nobel prize (2009) also saw first light at the first hard x-ray free-electron laser, the Linear Coherent Light Source (or
LCLS) at the SLAC facility in Stanford, California.
The first report of an entirely new biological structure, cathepsin B, determined using the
LCLS was reported a little over three years later.
XFELs provide x-ray beams with unique properties regarding pulse duration, peak pulse intensity, and beam cross-section.
Using a technique coined â€œdiffraction-before-destructionâ€�, crystals with sizes orders of magnitude smaller in volume than hitherto possible can now be investigated.
The application of this technique at XFELs represents a new paradigm shift in this field of research, and is indicative of how x-ray science continues to develop unabated over
100 years since its inception.
Almost immediately since their discovery at the end of the 19th century, x-rays have played a central scientific and technological role in society.
Barely two weeks after their discovery, Dr
Otto Walkhoff of Braunschweig undertook the first dental radiograms of his own jaw.
The first exposure was for 25 minutes and resulted in a very blurred image, due mainly to the fanlike nature and large size of the source of x-rays.
Modern radiograms expose the patient for durations typically well under a second and can distinguish features well under a millimeter in size.
Radiography is today one of the primary diagnostic tools available to medicine and dentistry.
Other common uses of x-rays are in security, such as at airports (we are all familiar with this, sometimes frustratingly!!); in the aeronautical industry to investigate fatigue and weathering of components such as turbine blades; and in the pharmaceutical industry, to characterize drugs for their atomic structure, functionality, and purity.
So why are x-rays so used?
We discuss this in the next video.
