00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:13,780
Welcome to Week 6 of this introductory course
on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!

2
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:21,440
This week is concerned with x-ray diffraction
and scattering and its use at synchrotrons.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,300
After some introductory remarks about why
diffraction is attractive, particularly using

4
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:32,980
synchrotron light, I will recap some basic
concepts required to understand the remainder

5
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,020
of this week’s contents.

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,609
This will be followed by three types of diffraction
experiment, namely single-crystal and powder

7
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:48,260
diffraction, and macromolecular crystallography
(which is actually just a certain sort of

8
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:55,850
single-crystal diffraction, but of such high
importance, that it is covered separately).

9
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:03,420
Lastly, small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray
reflectivity will be detailed before a brief

10
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,120
overview of how diffraction and scattering
experiments at XFELs differ from those at

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,190
synchrotrons.

12
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:23,820
In this first video, we ask what is diffraction
and why is it used; how diffraction at synchrotrons

13
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,380
opens up experimental approaches excluded
to lab-based sources; and then a brief review

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,560
of some diffraction basic concepts.

15
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,920
A knowledge of the detailed atomic structure
of condensed matter is exceedingly important

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,320
in many fields of the natural sciences.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,600
In many cases, a knowledge of the atomic structure
leads directly to the functionality of the

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:59,520
system, as exemplified by the now famous understatement
of Watson and Crick in the penultimate paragraph

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,410
of their Nobel-prize-winning Nature paper
on the structure of DNA in 1953: “It has

20
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:14,650
not escaped our notice that the specific pairing
we have postulated immediately suggests a

21
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:21,310
possible copying mechanism for the genetic
material”.

22
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:28,319
This correlation between structure and function
is not limited to biology however, and many

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,870
insights to physical and chemical properties
have been made in the fields of electronics,

24
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:40,260
for example in the strongly-correlated electron
systems based on perovskite structures; or

25
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,340
in energy/catalysis and the role of open structures
such as zeolites.

26
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:54,020
So, given the need to obtain atomic-resolution
to understand the physical properties of a

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,430
given system, what should be our approach?

28
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,680
First, it should be stressed that in order
to observe features of a certain characteristic

29
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,540
size, one needs to use a probe with a wavelength
of similar dimensions.

30
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,980
This means, for electromagnetic radiation,
x-rays.

31
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,150
So can we use an x-ray lens?

32
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:28,060
Let’s consider how much we need to magnify
an object in order to directly image it.

33
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,790
Interatomic spacings are of the order of a
few Angstrom, while detectors presently have

34
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:42,239
at best pixel sizes of a few microns, that
is, 10^4 times larger, which thus defines

35
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,269
our magnification q/p.

36
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:53,700
But no x-ray lens is capable of such a huge
magnification factor, hence full-field direct

37
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,200
imaging on the Angstrom scale is excluded.

38
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,120
What can we do to circumvent this problem?

39
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,140
The scattered x-ray signal of an object past
a certain distance from that object is actually

40
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:20,150
nothing more than the Fourier transform of
the object . A lens refocusses this scattered

41
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:27,210
light back into an image - one can thus consider
a lens to perform an inverse Fourier transform

42
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,790
on the scattered signal to regain an image
of the original object.

43
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,060
Now, instead of using a lens, which we’ve
argued is anyway impractical for hard x-rays,

44
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,949
we simply capture the scattered signal from
our object using an area detector . We send

45
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:54,500
this scattered signal to a computer which
then performs the operation of the lens using

46
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,710
mathematical algorithms . This is called “phasing”
the signal, as the detector measures not the

47
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:08,169
signal amplitude (including the phase), but
the intensity.

48
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,150
We have therefore lost half of the information,
the phases between the individual components

49
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,690
of the scattered signal.

50
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,690
Strategies for regaining these are varied
and sophisticated, and we will touch on some

51
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,720
of these later in the course.

52
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:35,870
Once phasing is completed, however, the original
structure is recovered.

53
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,090
Diffraction and scattering experiments at
synchrotrons profit from synchrotron radiation

54
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,389
for several reasons.

55
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:50,759
The low divergence and high flux of synchrotron
radiation compared to lab sources means that

56
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:58,020
better angularly resolved and much higher-intensity
patterns can be recorded, much facilitating

57
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,620
the process of phasing and obtaining an atomic
structure.

58
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,599
The two powder-diffraction patterns on the
right highlight this difference - the top

59
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:17,040
one was recorded in 5 seconds using synchrotron
radiation and a 1-D Mythen detector, while

60
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,090
the lower one (blown up by a factor of 1000
here) was recorded over nearly three hours

61
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,660
at a lab-based source, and exhibits a significantly
broader signal, by approximately a factor

62
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,570
of two.

63
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:39,220
The low emittance of synchrotrons can also
be exploited to obtain tight focusses, of

64
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,650
the order of a micron, for investigation of
very small crystalline samples, such as the

65
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,639
lysozyme crystals shown in the upper image.

66
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,300
The low emittance can be otherwise exploited
by allowing a large working distance by parallelising

67
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:04,020
the beam as much as possible, in order to
accommodate complex experimental setups, such

68
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,009
as that shown here in the lower image.

69
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,610
High photon energies up to a mega-electronvolt
are accessible at high-energy synchrotron

70
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:23,979
storage rings such as the ESRF, APS, and SPring8.

71
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,900
The high penetration lengths of this radiation
means that larger objects such as aeronautical

72
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,720
components or large fossil specimens can be
probed.

73
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,129
A unique property of synchrotron light is
its tunability.

74
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:45,500
As we discussed in detail in the second week,
the scattering amplitude and phase of a certain

75
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:51,940
atom type changes abruptly and sometimes very
strongly close to an absorption edge of that

76
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,360
atom, that is, at an energy equating the binding
energy of one of the atom’s electrons (normally

77
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,880
a core electron).

78
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,419
By recording diffraction data in this region,
techniques such as multi-wavelength anomalous

79
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:16,870
diffraction, MAD, and single-wavelength anomalous
diffraction, SAD), can unambiguously solve

80
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,349
the phase problem mentioned a few slides previously.

81
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:28,319
MAD, which exploits the tunability are only
possible at synchrotrons and XFELs.

82
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,570
SAD, which uses a single wavelength, can in
principle be carried out using a lab source,

83
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,710
and indeed the first ever report of SAD was
using a copper K-alpha source.

84
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:48,130
However, the subtle differences between pairs
of signals means that in most cases, only

85
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:56,730
data from synchrotrons have sufficient signal-to-noise
ratios to extract meaningful information.

86
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,120
The remainder of this first video will be
devoted to a recap of some essential diffraction

87
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,720
basic concepts.

88
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,161
This course is not a treatise on crystallography
but does, in particular this week, describe

89
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:14,290
crystallography experiments at synchrotrons.

90
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,140
As a result, some basic rules of diffraction
should be explained, which include a description

91
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:29,640
of crystals, the concept of reciprocal space,
Bragg’s law, and the Ewald sphere.

92
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,100
We begin with a description of crystals.

93
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,820
We concern ourselves here with the classical
definition of crystals, invoking translational

94
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,950
symmetry, although it should be noted that
a new class of material, quasicrystals, were

95
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,530
discovered in the 1980s, which also exhibit
sharp diffraction patterns, but which never

96
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:55,440
repeat themselves through translational symmetry.

97
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:04,410
A crystal is defined as consisting of a framework
of evenly spaced points in space , known as

98
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:16,350
the Bravais lattice, plus a so-called basis
of atomic positions associated with each Bravais-lattice

99
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,450
point, to generate a crystal.

100
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,160
The separation in three dimensions between
adjacent Bravais-lattice points is defined

101
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:37,200
by the three lattice vectors a, b, and c (of
which a and b are shown here in this 2-dimensional

102
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,700
representation).

103
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:46,320
The translational symmetry of crystals mean
that they remain invariant under a translation

104
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:55,590
by a vector T = the vector sum of integer
multiples of the lattice vectors.

105
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:10,580
In the 2-dimensional example shown here, T
= 3a + 2b.

106
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:17,500
The volume of a unit cell, that is, the repeat
unit in 3-dimensional space, is the cross

107
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,180
product of one lattice vector (here, c) with
the area defined by the scalar product of

108
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:32,570
the other two vectors (here a dot b) . In
this vector algebra, the relative angular

109
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,950
orientations are implicit.

110
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:43,350
The other three lattice constants are the
angles alpha, beta, and gamma, where alpha

111
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,430
is the angle opposite a, subtended by b and
c, and so forth.

112
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:57,560
Armed with this information, the unit-cell
volume is given by the expression shown here.

113
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,090
Note that in high-symmetry cases, such as
cubic or orthorhombic crystals, this expression

114
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:14,630
becomes much simpler.

115
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:21,130
A lattice plane, or more accurately, a family
of parallel lattice planes, intersect with

116
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:29,030
the Bravais lattice at three non-colinear
points that are integer fractions of the lattice

117
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,230
vectors that define that Bravais lattice.

118
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,900
The integers defining these fractions are
the Miller indices.

119
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:48,030
So in this first example, the (100) plane
intersects a at h = 1, but never intersects

120
00:12:48,030 --> 00:13:02,460
b or c, which implies k and l = 0, as b/0
and c/0 equal infinity - the distance required

121
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:09,920
before b and c are intersected by the (100)
plane!

122
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:19,610
Using similar arguments, the top-middle and
top right examples are clearly the (110) and

123
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,370
(111) planes, respectively.

124
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:33,960
Bottom left shows the (200), because the in
the a-direction, the plane crosses a at a/2.

125
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:45,750
In the bottom middle example, the intersection
points are at 1/2, 1/3, and 1, hence this

126
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:59,710
is the (213) plane . The last example is the
(012) plane .

127
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:05,950
The separation between crystallographic planes
is given by the lattice constants a, b, c,

128
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:15,010
alpha, beta, and gamma, plus the Miller indices
(hkl) according to the expressions shown here.

129
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:22,330
Again, although these seem complex for the
general case (for a so-called triclinic crystal,

130
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:35,570
which exhibits the lowest symmetry), things
become much simpler for those cases where

131
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:42,000
one or more angles are right-angles and/or
two or more of a, b, and c are equal to each

132
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,110
other.

133
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:54,610
Examples of families of four different crystal
planes in 2-dimensions are shown on the right.

134
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:01,770
Now we have described crystals, we should
see how x-rays scattered from them look like.

135
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,440
Let us begin with a single point scatterer.

136
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,990
The far-field pattern (remember, this is the
Fourier transform of the object) is a modulated

137
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,030
Gaussian.

138
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:24,020
Interference between scattering from two adjacent
spots results in interference fringes much

139
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:32,850
like seen in the famous Youngs’ double slit
experiment.

140
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,490
and increasing the number of evenly spaced
scatterers will sharpen that interference

141
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:46,350
signal, just like the maxima of a grating
monochromator sharpen with the number of scattering

142
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:54,770
facets, described in the second video of last
week.

143
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,290
Extending this motif to a second dimension
causes the pattern to change from being a

144
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:08,990
set of fringes to being a set of spots.

145
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,990
. .

146
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:16,420
while the angle between scatterers is reflected
at 90 degrees in the interference or diffraction

147
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,360
pattern.

148
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:25,640
Also importantly, the larger the separation
between the scatterers, the smaller their

149
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:32,100
angular separation, or separation in reciprocal
space, and vice versa.

150
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:40,160
Hence, crystals with small unit cells such
as NaCl have widely spaced diffraction features,

151
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,890
while protein crystals, which have characteristic
repeat dimensions two orders of magnitude

152
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:53,700
larger than NaCl, have very crowded diffraction
patterns.

153
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:03,130
In the second week of this course, we described
Thomson scattering and the scattering vector

154
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:10,730
Q, that is the vector difference between the
incoming and scattered wavevectors.

155
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:16,560
The direction of Q is ALWAYS at right-angles
to the scattering planes responsible for the

156
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,490
scattered signal in the direction of k_out,
while its magnitude can be expressed in a

157
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,970
variety of ways.

158
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:34,340
We determined Q to be equal to 4 pi/lambda
sin theta, and, combining this with Bragg’s

159
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:47,790
law, lambda = 2d sin theta, we see that Q
is equal to 2 pi/d_hkl.

160
00:17:47,790 --> 00:18:01,310
So, for example, Q for the Si(004) reflection
has a value of 2 pi/d(004).

161
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:25,050
d(004) is equal to 1.3578 Angstrom, hence
Q = 4.628 A^-1.

162
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:38,160
A convenient practical expression for Q is
also given and is equal to 1.0135 (close to

163
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:48,960
unity) times the photon energy in keV times
sin theta.

164
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,420
Because the incident and scattered wavevectors
have equal magnitude (we are concerned here

165
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:04,190
only with elastic scattering), one can use
the construct known as the Ewald sphere.

166
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:14,010
The incident beam obviously points in the
(000) direction, whereas the scattered beam,

167
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:22,870
if at a Bragg peak defined by the Miller indices
(hkl), terminates on that Bragg maximum.

168
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:29,470
The orientation of the crystal that will result
in the hkl Bragg peak lighting up is when

169
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,080
this point in the diffraction pattern sits
on the Ewald sphere.

170
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:43,500
Let us consider one such example to make this
clearer.

171
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:49,690
Consider a crystal at some random orientation,
and we are interested in looking at a certain

172
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,910
Bragg reflection (hkl).

173
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:01,140
We can now rotate the crystal, which will
also cause the diffraction pattern to rotate

174
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,610
in exactly the same manner.

175
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:12,480
When the rotation angle is such that the (hkl)
spot sits on the Ewald sphere, in other words,

176
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,440
when the size of the wavevector along the
scattering direction is equal in magnitude

177
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:26,290
to the incident wavevector, we will see the
corresponding Bragg maximum.

178
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:37,320
So, by rotating a crystal around an axis while
recording the pattern using an area detector,

179
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,070
different Bragg maxima will light up and can
be recorded, as shown schematically here.

180
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,040
This is the basic approach to most single-crystal
diffraction experiments, in particular in

181
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:57,480
macromolecular crystallography.

182
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,150
In this first video of Week 6, the arguments
for the need of diffraction experiments, in

183
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,800
particular at synchrotrons, have been laid
out.

184
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,140
The basic rules needed to understand different
types of diffraction experiments have been

185
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,230
covered.

186
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:22,440
This leads us on in the next video to a discussion
of the most common synchrotron-based diffraction

187
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:22,899
methods.
