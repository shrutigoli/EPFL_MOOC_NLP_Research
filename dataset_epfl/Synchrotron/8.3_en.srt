00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:09,700
Hello, and welcome to this, the final video
of week 8.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:16,630
In this video, we will discuss the related
imaging techniques of coherent x-ray diffractive

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:23,020
imaging, and ptychography.

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:29,390
Coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, also called
lensless imaging, or diffraction microscopy,

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,720
has many features in common with x-ray diffraction
and small-angle x-ray scattering.

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:44,570
In XRD, the samples have translational symmetry,
and as a result, the far-field scattering,

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,750
or diffraction, pattern consists of a set
of sharp diffraction maxima, from which the

8
00:00:50,750 --> 00:01:00,030
structure of the repeat unit, or unit cell,
can be gleaned by solving the phase problem.

9
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,990
Typically many unit cells are illuminated
coherently within the coherence volume.

10
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,100
The resolution of the atomic positions can
be established with a resolution of the order

11
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,920
of an Angstrom, or indeed much better than
this in the case of small unit cells containing

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,659
a modest number of atoms, while the unit cell
size can often be determined with femtometer

13
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,530
accuracy.

14
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:37,310
CXDI follows the same general principle as
XRD, though because the objects under investigations

15
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:44,720
are typically larger (note that this may not
be the case in so-called Bragg-CXDI of nanoscale

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,270
crystallites, discussed in a moment), the
scattering angles are smaller; and, in the

17
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:58,860
case of noncrystalline samples, the scattering
pattern is continuous, containing small grainy

18
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,530
features collectively called “speckle”
. The upper limit to the size of the object

19
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:15,000
that can be investigated with CXDI is given
by the coherence volume of the incident radiation.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,350
Big increases in this are expected once DLSRs
come online in the immediate future.

21
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:33,010
Inhomogeneities with an irradiated object
are the sources of scattered signal of the

22
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,419
incident beam.

23
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:43,010
Interference between these scattered wavelets
result in a so-called speckle pattern in the

24
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:51,690
far field, which is the absolute square of
the Fourier transform of the object.

25
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,930
By performing an inverse Fourier transform
of the speckle, the real-space reconstruction

26
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,530
of the sample is possible, once the ubiquitous
phase problem has been overcome.

27
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:11,520
The ultimate resolution of the reconstruction,
Delta x, is equal to 4 lambda Z_0/D, where

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,700
Z_0 is the sample-detector distance, and D
is the lateral detector size.

29
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,040
The resolution cannot be arbitrarily improved
by increasing the detector size, as associated

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,411
with this is an increase in scattering angle,
or scattering vector, Q.

31
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:38,870
But, as we recall from Week 6, the scattering
intensity drops off with the inverse fourth

32
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:46,199
power of Q, hence in most instances, the signal
towards the edge of the detector is so weak

33
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,620
that no sensible data can be recovered here.

34
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:58,220
As we have just stated, speckle is the result
of interference between wavelets produced

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,600
by scattering of a beam of x-rays caused by
spatial variations in the electron density

36
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,150
within an object.

37
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,540
To obtain a stable speckle pattern, the object
must be coherently illuminated – if this

38
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,540
is not the case, the speckles become averaged
out due to fluctuations of the form of the

39
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,600
wavefront incident on the sample.

40
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,480
In the forward direction around the direct
beam, this incoherent signal is simply the

41
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:40,880
small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) signal
described in Week 6.

42
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,450
There are three characteristic length-scales
related to speckle: the wavelength lambda

43
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:52,100
of the x-rays, measured in Angstroms; the
typical linear dimensions of the sample a,

44
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,351
which should be smaller than the transverse
coherent illumination cross-section (of the

45
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:08,730
order of 10 to 100 μm); and d, the typical
length describing the variation in electron

46
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:16,980
density (or distribution of ‘particles’)
within the illuminated object, which can range

47
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,460
between approximately 10 and 1000 nm.

48
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,510
The x-rays are on average scattered through
an angle of the order of lambda/d, which can

49
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:35,030
be as small as 100 μrad (less than 0.01 degrees).

50
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:41,330
The speckles arise through interference between
all the scattered wavelets across the coherently

51
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:49,260
illuminated area and therefore have angular
separations that can be as small as lambda/a

52
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,630
of the order of 1 μrad.

53
00:05:53,630 --> 00:06:01,270
Note that in order to resolve such features,
a detector having 50 μm-sized pixels would

54
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:07,350
need to be at least 50 m downstream of the
sample, for hard x-radiation in the Angstrom

55
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,350
range.

56
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:15,400
Normally, however, the illuminated area is
limited to only a few microns, and sample–detector

57
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,080
distances of approximately 10 m are more common.

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,150
Alternatively, softer x-radiation can be used,
although the increased absorption at lower

59
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:36,250
photon energies sets an upper limit to the
thickness of objects that can be studied.

60
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,760
You should note also, that because the speckles
arise from interference between the scattered

61
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,040
wavefronts from all the particles in the sample,
the entire speckle pattern will change even

62
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,560
if only one particle moves.

63
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,800
The speckle pattern therefore contains information
on the positions of all the particles, which

64
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,090
can be obtained by inverting the pattern,
which, like I say, involves solving the phase

65
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,090
problem.

66
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:13,580
At this point, it is worth introducing the
concepts of oversampling and redundancy.

67
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,230
Imagine a scatter pattern that has an intrinsic
spatial “graininess” associated with the

68
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:29,440
speckle of a size Delta Q. The spatial frequency
range of the signal, although it is random,

69
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:40,990
will extend up to approximately f_max = 1/Delta
Q. The minimum spatial frequency of the detector

70
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:50,240
recording such a pattern needs to be 2f_max,
according to the so-called Nyqvist theorem.

71
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,720
In other words, the pixel size needs to be
no bigger than half the speckle separation.

72
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,669
If the detector pixel size is smaller than
1/2f_max by a factor beta, one says that the

73
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,830
signal has been oversampled by this amount.

74
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:15,350
beta determines the resolution of the real-space
solution.

75
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:23,000
The redundancy, on he other hand, determines
how ambiguous any one solution might be.

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,931
If the experimental data provides M independent
values, and the object under investigation

77
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:36,620
has N unknowns (for example, N “voxels”
of electron density, the linear size of the

78
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,600
voxel corresponding to the minimum spatial
fluctuation of the density of the sample),

79
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:53,300
then the redundancy is given by M/N. The larger
the redundancy, the more likely one is to

80
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,500
obtain the correct solution.

81
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,290
Note also that equating M to the number of
pixels in the detector is the absolute upper

82
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,370
limit.

83
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,440
In nearly all cases, the intensities towards
the outside of the detector are so weak that

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,550
they can be discarded.

85
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,040
Also, if the pixel size is significantly smaller
than the typical speckle separations (relating

86
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:27,540
back to the concept of oversampling) then
one cannot assume that adjacent pixels record

87
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:33,060
“independent” values.

88
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:41,180
CXDI can be used to investigate both noncrystalline
and crystalline objects.

89
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,100
In the former case, the 3-D speckle pattern
associated with the 3-D Fourier transform

90
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:54,700
(squared) of the object is recorded by rotating
the object (and therefore also the scattering

91
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:03,460
pattern) through 180 degrees and recording
simultaneously until all of the pattern has

92
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:11,589
passes through the Ewald sphere . This sets
very stringent specifications on the mechanical

93
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:18,290
stability of both the rotation table for the
object, and the position of the incident x-ray

94
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,450
beam.

95
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:27,370
In the case of small- or nanocrystalline objects,
the crystal diffraction pattern has features

96
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,960
to it not normally observed in larger crystalline
objects.

97
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:42,760
Consider a homogeneous nanosized object, ignoring
to begin with that it may be crystalline.

98
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,740
The scattering amplitude pattern of such an
object is simply the Fourier transform of

99
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,200
the shape of that object, called the shape
function.

100
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,380
A cartoon of how a shape function of a cubic
object may look like is shown here on the

101
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,440
right - fringes arise due to interference
of opposite faces of the cube, to produce

102
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,730
a star-shaped object (with six stellations,
of which only four are shown here in this

103
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,330
2-D representation).

104
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:21,560
If we now imagine that the nanocube is a single
crystal, then we can expect to see Bragg peaks

105
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,690
- in other words a diffraction pattern.

106
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:34,250
But this diffraction pattern doesn’t consist
of narrow Bragg peaks, but instead, each Bragg

107
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:49,500
peak exhibits the form of the shape function.

108
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:57,940
The reason for this is that in real space,
the nanocrystal is the multiplication of an

109
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,430
infinite crystal with the envelope of the
nanocrystal, which, by applying the convolution

110
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:11,089
theorem, means that the scattering pattern
is the convolution of the Fourier transform

111
00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:17,140
of an infinite crystal, in other words a perfect
diffraction pattern consisting of infinitely

112
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:24,630
narrow Bragg peaks, convoluted with the Fourier
transform of the nanocrystal shape, that is,

113
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,500
the shape function shown in the previous slide.

114
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,430
This finite-size effect is also exploited
in grazing-incidence small-angle scattering

115
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,820
and in surface diffraction.

116
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:46,290
Now let us return to our experimental setup
for recording CXDI data, this time for a crystalline

117
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,500
object.

118
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:56,170
Now, instead of looking at the signal around
the (000) forward scattered direct beam , one

119
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:05,970
can move the detector to a Bragg peak (hkl)
and record there . This so-called Bragg-CXDI

120
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,870
method for crystalline samples has four important
consequences.

121
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:18,230
First, coherent diffractive imaging can be
carried out far away from the direct beam,

122
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,830
which means one can dispense with a beamstop
(which excludes features in the reconstruction

123
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,720
above a certain size).

124
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,670
Also, artefactual diffuse scattering in the
forward direction produced by other sources

125
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,360
than the sample is avoided.

126
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:43,750
Thirdly, because the Bragg peak shape is only
affected by the electron density of the crystalline

127
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,620
part of the object, it is highly sensitive
to crystalline defects and strain fields.

128
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,459
And lastly, one need only rotate the sample
through a much smaller angular range than

129
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:01,411
in the case of noncrystalline samples, in
order for all the features to pass through

130
00:14:01,411 --> 00:14:08,810
the Ewald sphere , significantly relaxing
the technical specifications of the rotation

131
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,410
stage.

132
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,310
We finish this last video of Week 8 with a
discussion of ptychography.

133
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,540
Remember that in CXDI, the sample size is
limited to being smaller than the coherent

134
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,269
part of the beam.

135
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:31,690
The real-space structure is then calculated
using some sort of iterative algorithm which

136
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:39,380
cycles between real space and reciprocal space,
varying real-space constraints in each cycle

137
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:45,940
until consistency is arrived at, that is,
no further changes are needed in the real-space

138
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,720
solution in order for it to agree with the
diffraction pattern in reciprocal space.

139
00:14:51,720 --> 00:15:00,450
Ptychography is scanning CXDI, largely though
not exclusively of noncrystalline samples.

140
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:07,110
Importantly, ptychography allows large-scale
structures, many times larger than the coherence

141
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,550
volume of the beam, to be investigated with
the same resolution as offered by CXDI.

142
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,400
The upper limit to the size of the sample
under investigation is given by technical

143
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:26,029
issues, in particular the volume of data generated,
the computing power needed to solve the structure,

144
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:33,250
and the accuracy and reproducibility of the
scanning stage of the sample.

145
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,450
The approach to ptychography is simple.

146
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:42,010
A coherent beam typically of the order of
a few microns in diameter illuminates a part

147
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,180
of the sample , and the speckle pattern is
recorded.

148
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:52,339
The sample is then shifted to illuminate a
new region , for which a different scattering

149
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:55,019
pattern is recorded.

150
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,940
Importantly, this region should overlap with
the previous spot.

151
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:07,140
This, logically, means that any correct real-space
structural solution for both of these speckle

152
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:16,589
patterns MUST contain a common region regarding
their detailed structures where they overlapped.

153
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:23,010
This imposes a strong constraint and provides
added redundancy to the algorithm used to

154
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,730
solve the structure.

155
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,000
If the overlap is too large, little added
information is gained and the scanning procedure

156
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,920
is slowed down, while if there is too little
overlap, the degree of ambiguity of the solution

157
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
increases.

158
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:48,040
As a rule of thumb a 40% areal overlap is
close to being optimal.

159
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,950
Ptycography and CXDI will benefit significantly
from the increase in coherence of DLSRs compared

160
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,050
to 3rd generation facilities.

161
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:05,380
This can be exploited in one of two manners
- either a reduction in exposure times to

162
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:11,789
obtain the same information; or access to
finer detail.

163
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:23,569
The resolution improves with Q, but the intensity
drops off approximately as 1/Q^4, so a hundredfold

164
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:32,950
increase in coherent intensity would allow
a factor of 100^1/4, or approximately 3 in

165
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:39,359
Q, bringing the finest details down to the
low nanometer regime.

166
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:49,159
Indeed, further tricks not directly associated
with the increased coherent fraction of DLSRs

167
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:55,230
are liable to increase the speed or accuracy
of ptychography by up to another 3 orders

168
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,090
of magnitude, through, for example, an increased
bandwidth of radiation allowed through the

169
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:09,009
monochromator - remember, this only affects
the longitudinal coherence, and it is the

170
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:13,179
lateral coherence that is of primary interest.

171
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:19,869
Secondly improvements in undulator technology,
in particular magnet materials; and thirdly,

172
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:26,730
more efficient optics, for example migrating
from Fresnel zone plates to K-B focussing,

173
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:34,490
will all contribute to significant improvements
of this burgeoning imaging technique.

174
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:41,429
Imaging using x-rays is an enormously profitable
enterprise, in which insights on the sub-micron

175
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:47,480
to nanometer scale can often be rapidly obtained
– indeed, the first demonstration of the

176
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:53,139
power of x-rays was made by Roentgen with
his radiographs of human hands.

177
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:58,009
The impact these must have had on society
can hardly be appreciated in a modern world

178
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:02,710
in which medical radiographic imaging is so
commonplace.

179
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:09,869
However, the detailed architectural information
provided by tomography on a microscopic scale

180
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:13,169
can still both surprise and delight.

181
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:20,619
The immediacy of the feedback and the relative
ease of an at least qualitative interpretation

182
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:28,240
supplied by x-ray imaging makes it one of
the most attractive modern synchrotron techniques.

183
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:36,720
As still more powerful and coherent x-rays
sources such as DLSRs begin to come online,

184
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,350
their associated enormous power densities
means that any optical components such as

185
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,999
focussing lenses will be circumvented if they
are not absolutely necessary.

186
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:54,490
Lensless imaging, in particularly CXDI and
more recently ptychography, is emerging not

187
00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:00,499
just as an attractive alternative to conventional
x-ray microscopy, but may in many cases be

188
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:07,409
the only realistic approach in investigating
complex and large-scale structures on a near-atomic

189
00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:09,369
scale.

190
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:13,429
This drive promises still more exciting developments
in the near future.
