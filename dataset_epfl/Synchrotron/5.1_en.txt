Welcome to Week 5 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
Last week, we finished our discussion of the generation of synchrotron light and its properties.
This radiation as it emerges from the source, be that a bending magnet or an insertion device, is, to a greater or lesser extent both divergent and polychromatic.
This week, we discuss how we manipulate this radiation at beamlines, including the role of the so-called â€œfront endâ€�; mirrors and other focussing optics; monochromators, including the suppression of harmonics; and finally different types of photon detectors.
This first video is primarily concerned with the most important features of the front end; and then a discussion of mirrors and other focussing optics.
So, let us begin with an overview of elements of a beamline.
The generic setup shown schematically here is just one possible configuration, but most beamlines follow this concept in general terms.
In the discussions this week, we divide up the beamline into the front end, primary optics, including mirrors and monochromators, and beamline instrumentation, in other words, those components most commonly (though not necessarily always) found in the experimental hutch, the furthest point downstream of the beamline.
The purpose of the front end is to â€œclean upâ€� the source radiation before it impinges on the primary optics and other components.
Its primary functions include monitoring the position of the x-ray beam, normally at two or more positions, so that the position can be triangulated and the stability monitored, also allowing feedback to improve this, if necessary.
In most cases, very high-energy gamma radiation up to the energy of the electrons within the storage ring is produced as an inevitable consequence of the electrons occasionally colliding with the residual gas molecules that remain even at pressures as low as 10^-10 mbar.
This radiation, although only generating a total power measured in a few tens of mW throughout the entire facility, is highly ionising and must be blocked.
Due to the very high energies, Bremsstrahlung is not deflected by, for example, the first reflecting mirror, but simply passes through it.
So the desired synchrotron radiation (with photon energies typically well over three orders of magnitude lower) IS deflected by the mirror, so the Bremsstrahlung blocker can be placed behind this.
This needs to be made of a block of heavy metal (typically tungsten) with a thickness measured in several tens of centimetre.
Only such a dense obstacle is sufficient to absorb Bremsstrahlung.
The acceptance angle of the beamline is defined by a beam-defining apertures, discussed in a little more detail shortly.
Radiation in an unwanted spectral region can also be removed using filters.
Finally, in many, but not all, instances a window that is transparent to the x-rays of interest for the beamline is placed as one of the final components of the front end, in order to protect and isolate the storage ring in case the vacuum at the beamline suddenly fails, thereby preventing the entire ring from venting, which would result in the entire facility being out of operation for days.
Beam-position monitors can come in various shapes, sizes, and working principle.
The simplest is simply a thin wire that can be traversed across the beam, which generates a photocurrent proportional to the beam intensity.
This provides one coordinate of the beam position; the orthogonal coordinate can be obtained by placing a second wire monitor at 90 degrees to the first.
Both x- and y- coordinates can be simultaneously determined using four blades in a configuration as shown here.
The beam halo is sufficiently intense to generate a photocurrent in the blades.
By moving the four blades together left/right and up/down, the difference in the photocurrent between oppositely facing pairs can be equalised using comparator electronics, and the beam position thereby determined.
Lastly, a more modern approach is to use thin transparent windows (often diamond) coated with an array of ultrathin metallic pads.
This delivers not only directly the beam position, but also the profile of the beam.
The acceptance angle of the source needs to be defined.
This is obvious in the case of bending-magnet sources, as they sweep angles far larger than typically desired for experiments, as we discussed last week.
Even for undulators, however, the radiation does not immediately fall to zero outside the angles +/-1/gamma, but instead contains a substantial amount of radiation, especially of softer x-rays.
Remember, it is the soft x-rays that interact most strongly with matter, so often (at least in the case of hard x-ray beamlines), the aperture cuts this out.
In order to cope with the high heat load associated with this, the aperture is normally conical, thereby spreading the absorbed energy over a larger area, and is water cooled.
Nonetheless, the central part of the beam that passes through the aperture may still contain an unacceptably large fraction of unwanted x-rays (usually soft x-rays) that need to be removed.
This can only be performed using a high-pass absorption filter.
The specifications for this are strict - it should efficiently absorb soft x-rays (typically up to approximately 5 keV), and will thus heat up substantially, meaning the filter must have a high melting temperature and remain mechanically robust.
This heat also needs to be efficiently dissipated, requiring good thermal conductivity.
Essentially there is only one material that fits all these requirements - diamond (which, incidentally is the best known heat conductor, even surpassing copper or silver).
Thin, artificially grown, diamond windows are commercially available, and can be brazed onto a water-cooled vacuum flange, as shown here.
Obviously, this high-pass filter is not used for beamlines operating in the tender or soft x-ray regime.
We now turn our attention to the primary optics and other focussing elements.
For the remainder of this video, we will discuss x-ray mirrors and x-ray focussing elements.
The topic of monochromator will be dealt with separately in the next video.
The primary optics typically include one or more mirrors which may or may not also focus, plus a dispersive instrument, the monochromator, used to select a certain, normally narrow, range of wavelengths.
In the second week of this course, we established that at sufficiently shallow incident angles, x-rays can be made to reflect off a flat surface via total external reflection.
The upper limit to the incident angle, you will remember, is given by the critical angle, alpha_c, which is equal to the square-root of 2 delta, where delta is the refractive-index decrement. delta is itself directly proportional to the electron density rho of the reflecting material and to the square of the x-ray wavelength
(and thus inversely proportional to the square of the wave vector or photon energy).
So alpha_c decreases as 1/the photon energy and increases with the square root of the electron density.
Even the most collimated synchrotron beam has a finite cross-section, with a height typically of the order of a millimetre at the primary optics, which may be 20 m or further downstream of the source.
This means, as the photon energy increases, the critical angle gets smaller, and the footprint of the beam becomes longer and longer as one is forced to reduce the incident angle.
Below an angle (given in radians) equal to the beam height divided by the length of the mirror (normally measured in a few tens of centimetres), in other words, a few milliradians, or between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees, a substantial fraction of the beam will spill over the ends of the mirror.
Normally, fabrication of the x-ray mirror is limited to approximately a metre or less.
This overspill problem is resolved not by making longer and longer mirrors, but instead by coating the mirror (made almost always either from silicon or fused silica glass) with a layer of high-density material, most commonly rhodium and/or platinum, in order to bump up the critical angle, which, weâ€™ve just reiterated, is proportional to the square root of the electron density.
Mirrors thus commonly have stripes of coatings of different density, so by a simple lateral movement of them, one can switch from one material to another.
So, for example, the uncoated part of a silicon mirror has a critical angle approximately
3 times smaller than that part coated with a platinum layer.
This aspect of the energy-dependence of the critical angle can be used to advantage.
When one selects a certain photon energy, h-nu, using a monochromator at a beamline, harmonics of this radiation, that is, at 2 h-nu, 3 h-nu, etc, will also be selected.
Radiation from synchrotrons is polychromatic
- in the case of bending magnets and wigglers, it is broad band, but also even for undulators, the maxima are integer multiples (m) of the fundamental energy.
Therefore, harmonic signal will also pass through to the beamline unless measures are taken to circumvent this.
Some other strategies are detailed in the second video this week, but one of the most effective ways to achieve harmonic suppression is explained here in the context of mirror reflectivity.
Let us consider a particular photon energy, highlighted here with the red arrow.
If we set the incident angle to be only marginally below the critical angle for the mirror at this photon energy, then the double of this energy, i.e., the second harmonic, . . .
(shown here in green) will have its critical angle BELOW the incident angle and will be only inefficiently reflected.
The 3rd harmonic (here shown in blue) will be still less reflected.
As an example, a silicon mirror tilted at an angle of 0.2 degrees will efficiently reflect
8-keV radiation, for which the critical angle is 0.23 degrees.
However, the critical angles for the second harmonic at 16 keV and third at 24 keV are
0.114 and 0.076 degrees respectively, both above the incident angle.
Their reflectivities are, approximately 8 x 10^-3 and 1.4 x 10^-3, respectively.
In some instances, such as in most diffraction experiments, a still higher degree of harmonic rejection is required.
One commonly-used approach is to allow the radiation to bounce off a second mirror at the same angle, thus squaring the degree of reflectivity, which in this instance would be 6.4 x 10^-5 and 2 x 10^-6, respectively.
Before we move on to discuss aspects of focussing, it is briefly mentioned here that the reason that mirrors are not fabricated with lengths much more than a metre is because their quality deteriorates.
The two main properties defining mirror quality are the so-called â€œslope errorâ€�, i.e., the amount of wobbliness of the surface over macroscopic distances (typically measured in microradians); and the atomic roughness, measured in a few Angstroms.
This does not mean the surface needs to be atomically flat without any imperfections along the entire length of the mirror, but it should maintain on average the desired specifications within at least one or two multiples of the coherence lengths of the radiation being reflected, which can thus be of the order of several hundred microns in the case of transverse coherence.
We now turn to aspects of x-ray focussing.
Before we discuss specific examples, some fundamental features need to be clarified.
The two shapes of primary concern for us will be the ellipse and the parabola, and, in a moment, their spherical or cylindrical approximations.
Ellipses and parabolas are conic sections.
An ellipse is a section for which the sectional plane subtends an angle greater than phi with the cone axis, where phi is the opening half angle of the cone.
A parabola is described by the intersection between a cone and a plane for which the cone-axis
- plane angle is exactly phi.
Their mathematical equations are shown here.
Ellipses and parabolas are interesting because, when using ray optics, they can focus to an exact point.
Note that ray optics do not represent reality, as diffraction effects (i.e., wave optics) means that no focal spot can be of zero size.
Nonetheless, diffraction effects excluded, these shapes are in principle aberration-free.
An ellipse will focus a point source to a point focus if the source lies on one of the foci of the ellipse, +/- fâ€™ (the prime is used here, as this is NOT the same as the focal length, denoted by f).
The distance defined by the reflected rays between the source and image are all equal in length (Indeed, you might remember that one can draw an ellipse by pinning down a piece of string at two point which then define the foci, and then putting the string under tension with a pencil, and moving this from one end to the other).
Consider the symmetrical path between the foci, highlighted here in red.
***** This path subtends the shallowest angle with the ellipse where it is reflected.
This angle is equal to the arctangent of b/fâ€™ and needs to be shallower than the critical angle for total external reflection.
It is therefore clear that b must be much smaller than fâ€™, by about three orders of magnitude.
In this case, fâ€™ is approximately equal to a, the semi-major axis - in other words, the foci are exceedingly close to the left and right hand apexes of the ellipse, and the ellipse is much, MUCH wider than it is high.
Ellipses are therefore excellent shapes for refocussing a small source via reflection.
Parabolas, on the other hand, focus PARALLEL light to a point, as shown here on the right hand side.
Although some optics are indeed manufactured to have either an elliptical or parabolic profile, especially secondary optical elements, it is technologically very demanding to fabricate mirrors and larger focussing elements with exactly these shapes.
Instead, one often approximates the surface of ellipses and parabolas with that of a circle
(or sphere for two-dimensionally focussing elements).
It can be shown, for example, that a cylindrical surface with a radius R_m equal to a^2/b ***** has only a very marginal deviation from the elliptical surface at the symmetrical reflection point, which was shown in red in the last slide.
Similarly, a circle with radius 2f ***** closely approximates the profile of a parabola of the form x^2/a at its apex.
The geometric ray optics described until now, in which a point source can be perfectly focussed to another point, are, unsurprisingly, unachievable.
Due to diffraction, no beam with a Gaussian profile can be focussed to a perfect point with no physical extent, but instead will have a minimum beam â€˜waistâ€™ diameter 2w_0, shown here.
The Rayleigh length z_R is the distance along the propagation direction (z) between this waist and where the beamâ€™s linear extent is larger by a factor of square-root of 2
(i.e., where the beam cross-section increases by a factor of two), and is given by z_R = pi w_0^2/lambda, where lambda is the beamâ€™s wavelength.
The validity of this equation assumes w_0 remains significantly larger than lambda, which certainly holds true for hard x-radiation of wavelengths of the order of an Angstrom.
The depth of field is twice z_R.
The beam radius w_z at a distance z from the beam waist is given by w_z = w_0 x sqrt(1
+ (z/z_R)^2),
From this, it can be demonstrated that the
FWHM divergence, big Theta, is related to w_0 and z_R by Theta = 2w_0/z_r.
Using this relationship, and substituting for either z_R or w_0, their relationship to the beam divergence can be derived, as shown here.
The more focussed the beam (large Theta), the smaller the focal spot, and the shorter the depth of field.
As an example, a Gaussian beam of 1-Angstrom radiation, focussed using parabolic optics with Î˜ = 10 mrad (0.57 degrees), will produce a spot size of 6.4 nm with a depth of field of 2.55 Î¼m.
A ten-times more gentle focus of Î˜ = 1 mrad can only be focussed to 64 nm, although the
DOF will increase a hundredfold to 255 Î¼m.
The cost of strong demagnification is thus an accompanying rapid (inverse square) reduction in the depth of field.
The lensmaker equation states that the reciprocal of the focus of a lens, 1/f, equals the sum of the reciprocals of the source - lens distance p and lens - image distance q.
The degree of magnification is q/p - hence values greater than unity will blow up the image size compared to the source, while demagnification with q/p less than one, will focus down the image to sizes smaller than the source.
Note also that an m-fold demagnification (q/p
= 1/m) will be accompanied by an m-fold increase in beam divergence, and vice-versa.
This is merely a restatement of the fact that the beam emittance will remain constant.
The Coddington equations relate p, q and f, with the bending radii R_m and R_s.
R_m is the â€œmeridionalâ€� bending radius in the plane perpendicular to the mirror or reflecting element (including, for example, a diffracting crystal) which also includes the beam axis.
R_m thus focusses in the transverse plane perpendicular to the bending plane, which in the case shown here is the vertical direction.
R_s is the sagittal bending radius required to focus in the direction perpendicular to the meridional focussing, here horizontally.
As we should now know, theta is in general small for mirrors, as will be sine theta.
Hence R_m for mirrors are typically measured in kilometres, while R_s, which is directly proportional to sine theta, may only be a few centimetres.
Focussing can also be achieved by bending gratings or crystals in monochromators, as we will see in the next video.
In general, the incident angles on dispersive monochromator elements is larger, and the meridional and sagittal radii less radically different from each other.
A convenient shape for achieving sagittal and meridional focussing in one element is the toroidal mirror.
This is a cap-section of a ring torus with ring radius R_s and torus outer radius R_m, as shown here.
As R_m is in general significantly larger than R_s, particularly for mirrors, the ring torus is very thin, much like a bicycle inner tube.
In general, toroidal mirrors have fixed surfaces machined out of a solid block of material, that is, neither R_m or R_s can be varied.
Kirkpatrick-Baez, or K-B, mirrors provide independent orthogonal focussing using two cylindrically bent surfaces.
This has the advantage that vertical and horizontal focussing are decoupled.
Indeed, it is possible to dynamically bend the mirrors using a flexor system, thus allowing adjustment of the position of the focal spot.
The separation of focussing into two stages does, however, make K-B mirrors more bulky.
We finish this video with a discussion of refractive and diffractive focussing elements.
Compound refractive lenses, or CRLs, in their simplest form, consist of holes drilled out of transparent material such as beryllium.
The focal length is given by the hole radius
R divided by 2 times the number of holes, n_h, and the refractive-index decrement, delta.
This last parameter is equal to about 2 Ã— 10âˆ’6 for Be at 12 keV.
Hence a CRL consisting of an array of thirty
200 Î¼m-diameter holes has a focal length of approximately 70 cm.
CRLs have the advantage that they are easy to align in the x-ray beam, they do not divert the beam axis, and elements can be stacked after one another to change the focal length.
Their main disadvantages are (a) that the focal length is proportional to the square of the x-ray photon energy, which means that they must be repositioned, restacked, or replaced if the photon energy is changed; and (b) that the transmission is in general fairly poor.
A 100-hole CRL made of Be, with walls of 100
Î¼m thickness separating adjacent holes has a transmission of 0.5 at 12 keV.
In addition, because refraction of x-rays is so weak, the hole diameter R needs to be quite small in order to achieve a reasonably short focal length.
But this can often mean that the beam propagates through the sides of the holes, where the deviations from a parabola are large, resulting in significant optical aberrations.
Much effort has been made in recent years to fabricate CRLs with parabolic surfaces, using sophisticated mechanical milling, or even focussed ion-beam milling.
Lastly, the choice of material depends on the photon energy range for which the CRL is being manufactured, the required focal length, and the acceptable loss in flux due to absorption.
So, for example, although the attenuation length of diamond at e.g., 15 keV, is 5 times smaller than for beryllium, its refractive-index decrement is more than double that of Be.
Fresnel zone plates, or FZPs, are diffractive focussing lenses consisting of a set of concentric rings.
These rings can either be opaque, in which case light passes through the gaps in between them, or, in the case of so-called phase-FZPs, have a specific height for the thicker rings, in order to enhance diffractive effects by adjustment of the optical path length.
The general approach of FZPs is to design them so that light being scattered as it passes through different parts of the FZP will always have an integer number of wavelengths path difference at the focal spot.
So, in the figure shown here, light passing along path P_n+2 will be longer than that passing through P_n by an integer number of wavelengths.
The conditions for constructive interference and thus the radii of the rings in an FZP are given here.
See also the website given at the bottom for a more detailed description.
The width of the outermost ring, Delta r_N, is equal to the square-root of the wavelength times the focal length/divided by large N, the total number of rings.
An FZP of diameter r_N = 100 microns, consisting of 4000 rings will have an outer ring thickness of 50 nm.
Such a delicate structure is synthesized by electron-beam lithography.
Note also that the ultimate resolution of an FZP is determined by Delta r_N, the outer-ring thickness, and is equal to a value a little more than this, by a factor of 1.22.
FZPs are used when requiring the tightest focus, and values in the range of a few tens of nm for hard x-rays has been recently achieved.
Lastly, it should be note that the inverse dependence of the focal length on lambda implies a linear dependence with photon energy.
This is less severe than the square dependence of CRLs with energy, which can make FZPs more attractive for use with unmonochromatized
XFEL radiation, which can have a substantial bandwidth.
The efficiency of FZPs is in general only moderate.
The theoretical equation for this is given here for phase-FZPs, where nu is the ratio between the absorption index beta and refractive-index decrement delta and phi - 2 pi delta t/lambda is the phase shift induced by the x-rays passing through a ring of thickness t.
The actually achieved efficient is in general lower than this, as this equation has assumed that the thin rings of the FZP have zero thickness.
Summarising this first video of week 5, we have covered the function of the front end; features of both reflecting an focussing mirrors; plus a description of compound refractive lenses and Fresnel zone plates.
In the next video, we cover monochromatization of synchrotrons using gratings, crystal, or multilayers.
