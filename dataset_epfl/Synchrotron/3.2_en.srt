00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,150
Welcome to the second video of Week 3 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:15,750
free-electron lasers!
In the first video of this week, we covered

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,960
basics of the electric and magnetic fields
acting on electrons, and, by heuristic arguments,

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,480
showed that accelerating electrons causes
them to radiate light, of which synchrotron

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,270
radiation is one example. The characteristics
of synchrotron light were shown to depend

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,629
on several parameters, including the electron
energy and the magnitude of the centripetal

7
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:45,760
acceleration.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,370
We begin the second video by investigating
this aspect in more detail. The bending magnets

9
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,489
used for this, and other elements associated
with the storage ring, comprising together

10
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:04,640
the so-called magnet lattice, are described
in more detail. Lastly, we show how the energy

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,980
lost by the electrons because of their emission
of light is replenished in a radio-frequency

12
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,900
cavity installed in the storage ring.

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:23,910
Let’s now begin by considering how we steer
electrons in a closed path. The electrons

14
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:30,210
must experience a centripetal force acting
at right angles to their motion in order to

15
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,380
maintain them on a closed orbit. Note that
this force need not be applied along the entirety

16
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,660
of the storage ring, but can be broken up,
with straight sections in between. Remember,

17
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,880
indeed, that third-generation synchrotrons
are defined by these straight sections, as

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,890
it is here that insertion devices are placed,
which provide the most intense sources. We’ll

19
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:03,070
talk about these in detail next week.
For now, let’s concentrate on getting those

20
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:13,420
electrons on a closed path. The centripetal
acceleration is a = v-squared/rho, where v

21
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,409
can be very accurately approximated by c,
the speed of light, and rho is the radius

22
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:26,390
of the bending orbit. Note also, that because
the electron is traveling at relativistic

23
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:33,430
speeds, its mass from our perspective is gamma
times its rest mass, which we’ve already

24
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:40,840
established typically increases the mass by
several thousand. The force is therefore gamma

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:49,719
m c^2/rho.
Two at first obvious candidates come to mind

26
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:56,129
for imparting the centripetal force - an electric
field, such as also used in old-fashioned

27
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:03,930
cathode-ray tubes in TVs dating back to the
end of the 20th Century; or magnetic fields,

28
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,680
such as used for electric motors or loudspeakers.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,019
Let’s first consider the use of an electric
field. First, don’t get confused with E

30
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:20,959
here, which denotes the electric-field strength,
or amplitude, with E, the electrons’ kinetic

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,200
energy. As we will see in just a moment, we
can discount the electric field as a reasonable

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,849
candidate for steering electrons, so let’s
tolerate this slight ambiguity for the meantime.

33
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:41,950
If one plugs typical values for rho and gamma
into our force equation, and using the known

34
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,359
values for the physical constants m, c, and
e, we obtain electric-field strengths which

35
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:57,920
must be of the order of a billion volts per
metre to do the required job. The breakdown

36
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,201
field strength of dry air at 1 atmosphere
is approximately 3 million volts/m, over two

37
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:12,270
orders of magnitude weaker, while that of
pure silica is up to 40 MV/m. It should therefore

38
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:20,540
be clear that using electric fields as a steering
mechanism is impossibly hazardous.

39
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:30,129
Which leaves us with the Lorentz force of
magnetic fields. In the last video, we established

40
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:37,770
that this is equal to evB, or for our highly
relativistic electrons within the storage

41
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:45,259
ring, approximately ecB, assuming the magnetic
field points perpendicular to the electrons’

42
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:53,590
motion. Equating this to gamma m c^2/rho,
the centripetal force, and then rearranging

43
00:04:53,590 --> 00:05:04,000
this, we see that the bending radius rho equals
gamma mc/eB.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:15,159
But gamma mc^2 is equal to the electrons’
kinetic energy E, hence rho = E/ceB. We can

45
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:22,909
re-express this in practical units such that
rho in metres equals 3.3 x the storage-ring

46
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:31,860
energy expressed in GeV divided by B given
in Tesla.

47
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,800
Hence an electron travelling in a horizontal
plane that experiences a constant B-field

48
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,060
acting vertically, will be steered in a circular
path of radius rho. From our practical expression

49
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,560
for rho, we see that a few-GeV storage ring
containing magnets with field strengths of

50
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,460
the order of a Tesla, will bend electrons
along a path with a radius of the order of

51
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:04,099
10 meters. The fan of radiation in the horizontal
plane will subtend the same angle as the arc

52
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:09,509
of the bending magnet itself. Only a small
angular fraction of this passes through an

53
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:16,340
aperture to a bending-magnet beamline. Because
the fan angle is so much larger than the typical

54
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:23,520
acceptance angle of a beamline, more than
one bending-magnet beamline can be served

55
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,300
by a single bending magnet. ***** waaaaaaait.
. .

56
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,129
What are typical magnetic field strengths?
The earth’s magnetic field varies considerably,

57
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:41,009
but is strongest close to the poles and can
reach around 60 microTeslas. Indeed it is

58
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:46,840
the combination of this higher field strength
and energetic charged particles from the solar

59
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,030
wind (primarily energetic electrons) that
generate the aurora as these particles are

60
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,270
funnelled by the Earth’s magnetic field
to the polar regions, where they collide with

61
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:06,340
molecules in the upper atmosphere, causing
them to fluoresce.

62
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,050
At a more mundane level, typical kitchen magnets
have field strengths approximately three orders

63
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:21,129
of magnitude stronger. The soft-iron permanent
magnets used at synchrotrons bending magnets

64
00:07:21,129 --> 00:07:28,960
are one to two orders of magnitude stronger
still, at around a Tesla. Significantly higher

65
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:37,129
fields can be achieved using cryogenically
cooled superconducting intermetallic compounds,

66
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:49,379
such as Nb3Sn, which needs to be cooled to
less than 18.3 K, in the form of coil windings

67
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:58,759
in superconducting bending magnets, or “superbends”.
As we shall see very shortly, increasing the

68
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:04,409
magnetic-field strength can bring substantial
benefits, particularly for experiments demanding

69
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:10,319
high photon energies at low- or medium-energy
storage-ring facilities.

70
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,710
The spectrum and intensity of bending-magnet
radiation depends on several parameters. Firstly,

71
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,499
we need to know the angular frequency of the
orbiting electrons, that is, how many radians

72
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:32,650
per second they rotate during those times
they are being redirected by a bending magnet.

73
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:39,360
To simplify the determination of this, let’s
assume that the orbit is perfectly circular,

74
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,570
although even for real storage rings consisting
of straight and bent sections, the result

75
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:54,560
holds true. The orbit’s circumference is
2 pi rho, and a relativistic electron with

76
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:04,350
a velocity close to c will thus execute c/(2
pi rho) revolutions every second. But every

77
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:11,760
revolution contains 2 pi radians (because
there are 2 pi radians in 360 degrees), hence

78
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:22,860
the number of radians swept through per second
is 2 pi c/2 pi rho = c/rho. Inserting typical

79
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,620
values into this, we obtain an angular frequency
for the storage-ring electrons of the order

80
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:37,050
of 10^7 to 10^8 radians per second.

81
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,670
The critical frequency is a value associated
with the synchrotron-radiation spectrum (NOT

82
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,269
the electrons, although it is determined by
their energy and the bending radius rho!).

83
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:57,560
It emerges that this is equal to three halves
gamma^3 omega_0. We can re-express this either

84
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:06,089
by substituting omega_0 with c/rho, or indeed
one step further, by remembering that c/rho

85
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:12,970
= eB/gamma m, which we discovered a little
earlier in this video when we equated the

86
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:23,290
Lorentz and centripetal forces.
This leads us to the expression omega_c = 3/2

87
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:31,370
gamma^2 eB/m. Inserting typical values into
any of these equivalent expressions yields

88
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:39,961
a critical frequency of the order of 10^19
radian/sec. If we multiply this by h-bar we

89
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:46,750
obtain the photon energy associated with this
critical frequency. Converting this to electronvolts,

90
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:53,750
we obtain a photon energy of the order of
4 keV. In actuality, this can vary strongly,

91
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,010
due to its square dependence on gamma, the
Lorentz factor describing the storage-ring

92
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:05,760
energy, plus its linear dependence on B.

93
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,430
To repeat, the critical energy is linearly
proportional to B and varies with the square

94
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:17,700
of the storage-ring energy. A practical expression
for this is provided here. For a given magnetic

95
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,459
field strength, a bending magnet at SPring8
will have a critical energy some 18 times

96
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:31,199
greater than the same magnet at the ALS, as
the ratio is simply the square of their storage-ring

97
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:41,149
energies, that is (8 GeV/1.9 GeV), all squared.
The 

98
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:46,639
red dots ***** show the critical energies
for two bending magnet beamlines at the two

99
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:57,079
high-energy storage rings SPring8 (8 GeV)
and the ESRF (6 GeV). In order to compensate

100
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:07,220
for their more modest electron energies, facilities
such as the Swiss Light Source (2.4 GeV) and

101
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:16,149
the Advanced Light Source (1.9 GeV) have installed
superbends (shown here as blue dots) in order

102
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,350
to access higher photon energies than would
otherwise be possible using normal bending

103
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,990
magnets.
But what precisely does the critical energy

104
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,259
describe? From our discussion so far, it is
probably already clear that it is somehow

105
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:39,100
linked to the bending-magnet spectrum. Before
this is shown explicitly, let us have a little

106
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,400
think about what we might expect the radiation
spectrum from a bending magnet to look like,

107
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,220
at least qualitatively.

108
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,639
You should remember from the first video this
week that an electron undergoing sinusoidal

109
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,089
acceleration from a harmonic driving force
(such as, for example, the electric-field

110
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:05,160
component of an incident x-ray beam), will
re-radiate light at the same frequency. In

111
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,230
other words, the electron scatters the incident
light elastically - it has the same frequency.

112
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:22,420
Imagine now an observer of the electron tangential
to the bending magnet. From her perspective,

113
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,360
the electron is first moving along the straight
section upstream of the bending magnet with

114
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,160
constant velocity - it is not being accelerated,
so we should not expect her to see any radiation.

115
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,930
But once the electron enters the gap between
the dipole of the bending magnet, it experiences

116
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,800
a pulse of centripetal acceleration towards
the centre of the ring due to the magnetic

117
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:55,050
field. In contrast to the case of sinusoidal
acceleration, this “pulse” of acceleration

118
00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:01,069
cannot be described by a single frequency,
but instead is composed of a continuous spectrum

119
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:08,339
of frequencies, and the electron will emit
this in response. For the more mathematically

120
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,500
predisposed of you, you might recognise that
the spectrum that emerges from this pulse

121
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:22,120
of acceleration to be proportional to the
Fourier transform of the temporal description

122
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,170
of that acceleration. . . For those of you
less familiar with such insights, don’t

123
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,750
worry!

124
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:42,630
As a consequence, we can expect the bending-magnet
spectrum to be broad. Shown here are three

125
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:50,260
curves for different storage-ring energies
and magnetic-field strengths. Note that the

126
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,970
only difference between the spectra for a
1-Tesla bending magnet in a 4-GeV ring and

127
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:07,279
a 4-Tesla BM in a 2 GeV ring is the intensity,
which differ from each other by a factor of

128
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,149
four. Their critical energies, highlighted
as circles, are identical, as the products

129
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:22,130
of the square of the storage-ring energy and
magnetic field strength are equal. Note again

130
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:29,649
that high-energy storage rings, such as shown
in blue for a 6-GeV facility, easily access

131
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:39,040
high critical energies on account of the square
dependence on the storage-ring energy.

132
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,980
It turns out that half of the integrated radiative
power produced by a bending magnet lies below

133
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:52,660
the critical energy, and half above. But what
we haven’t yet discussed is how the spectral

134
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,610
flux is spatially distributed.

135
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:08,839
In general, the centre of the cone of radiation
is the most intense and most blue-shifted

136
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:15,380
to high photon energies. As one moves off
axis, the radiation becomes weaker (remember

137
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:24,529
that the beam only has a width of approximately
+/- 1/gamma, of the order of 0.01 degrees)

138
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:33,040
and the maximum is red-shifted to lower photon
energies. Obviously, in the case of bending

139
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,699
magnets, for which the horizontal angular
spread is equal to the angle subtended by

140
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:45,730
the magnet and is measured in degrees, the
fan of radiation in this plane at the beamline

141
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:52,199
is determined by the opening angle of the
aperture to the beamline, always much smaller

142
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:59,850
than the fan angle, but on the other hand,
also much larger than 1/gamma.

143
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:05,829
The total integrated radiative power output
of a bending magnet is given by the equation

144
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:14,610
shown here, where L is the length of the electron
path passing between the magnet poles. As

145
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:22,059
the entire storage ring requires bending magnets
to provide a closed orbit for the electrons,

146
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:31,250
the entire power output of all the bending
magnets together is given for a length L = 2

147
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:38,800
pi rho, where rho is the bending radius. Note
again, that this is NOT equal to the storage-ring

148
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:46,260
circumference, as the bending magnets are
separated by straight sections. There is also

149
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,080
radiative power production by insertion devices
in the straight sections, which we will discuss

150
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,950
next week, but here we are concerned only
with the bending magnets.

151
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:08,540
So, for example, a 3-GeV storage ring using
1-Tesla bending magnets will have a bending

152
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:20,800
radius rho = 9.9 m, for which 2 pi rho = 62
m. If the electron current is 0.4 amps, the

153
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:31,360
total power output due to bending-magnet radiation
will be 283 kW. Any one bending magnet port

154
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,049
may only accept, for example, approximately
5 mrad of this (or less than 1/1000 of 2 pi),

155
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:47,340
or in other words, 225 W. If this is further
monochromatized to select a narrow band of

156
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,790
energy, as is more often than not the case,
perhaps only of the order of 10 mW may then

157
00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:03,090
remain. This might not seem very much, but
equates to, for example, approximately 10^13

158
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:10,020
10-keV photons per second, several orders
of magnitude more than can be provided by

159
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,200
laboratory-based x-ray sources.

160
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,289
To finish this video, we will now consider
the ratio between the power consumption caused

161
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:23,130
by the generation of synchrotron radiation,
which we have just calculated to be of the

162
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:29,150
order of 300 kW for bending-magnet radiation
alone, and might be double this when the insertion

163
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,400
devices are also accounted for, and the stored
power of the electron circulating in the storage

164
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,250
ring.
The stored energy is simply their kinetic

165
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,890
energy, or storage-ring energy, E, multiplied
by the number of electrons within the ring

166
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:53,250
at any one time. This is simply the current
in amps divided by the elementary charge of

167
00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,990
the electron, multiplied by the storage-ring
circumference, big C, divided by the speed

168
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:09,250
of light, little c. This turns out to be of
the order of 10^12 electrons, hence the stored

169
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:20,799
energy is approximately a kJ. The stored power
is simply E x I, which is measured in GW.

170
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,580
One might therefore think that the power loss
through radiation is relatively slow, as the

171
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,821
radiative power is four orders of magnitude
smaller than the stored power. However, it

172
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:40,279
only requires a small deviation from the nominal
storage-ring energy for an electron to enter

173
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:46,470
an unstable and open orbit, and crash into
the walls of the vacuum chamber making up

174
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:53,909
the storage ring. Hence, the electrons require
a steady replenishment of this lost energy.

175
00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:02,120
We finish this video by discussing this now.

176
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:08,580
Inserted in the storage ring is a radio-frequency
cavity, running typically at a few hundred

177
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:15,590
megahertz. Within this resonant cavity, the
electric field oscillates sinusoidally from

178
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:22,830
pointing in one direction to the other. Along
the central axis, this means the electric

179
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:31,000
field is either opposite to or in the same
direction as the electron path. Remember that

180
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,010
an electron is accelerated when the E-field
points in the opposite direction to the electron’s

181
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:45,450
sense of motion, due to its negative charge.
Therefore an electron entering the cavity

182
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:52,920
when the field points maximally in the upstream
direction will cause the electron to be maximally

183
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,850
accelerated, as shown schematically in the
figure on the left.

184
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:03,020
Now let’s consider two electrons, one of
which (A) has a little less energy than the

185
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,140
other (B), due perhaps to the fact that it
has emitted a couple more photons in their

186
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:17,410
last circuit round in the storage ring. B
enters the cavity first and is accelerated

187
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:25,460
by the cavity’s field. Electron A enters
a little later, at which point the field amplitude

188
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,580
has increased in its sinusoidal cycle by an
amount just enough to accelerate it to the

189
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:38,640
same energy as electron B. If the electrons
had entered the cavity at a significantly

190
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:47,039
different part of the RF cycle, the acceleration,
or indeed deceleration they experienced would

191
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:55,640
have caused them to become still less stable
in their orbit, and they would soon be lost.

192
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,350
*****
From this, it should be apparent that only

193
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:04,910
a very particular time window of the RF cycle
is suited to bringing the electrons back to

194
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:12,730
the nominal storage-ring energy. As a consequence,
the electron current in a synchrotron is not

195
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:22,020
continuous, but instead is composed of bunches,
each separated by 1/f, the period of the RF

196
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,870
cycle, and having a temporal width of approximately
one hundredth of their separation.

197
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:37,020
It is a trivial exercise to show that the
number of electrons within any one bunch is

198
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:44,789
equal to the current divided by the product
of the RF frequency and e, the elementary

199
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:50,390
charge, which turns out to be of the order
of 10^9 to 10^10 per bunch.

200
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:59,830
To summarise this second and last video of
the third week, we have reasoned that only

201
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:05,039
a magnetic Lorentz force is a reasonable way
of steering electrons into a closed path in

202
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:18,029
a storage ring. The characteristic, or critical
frequency omega_c and energy E_c were determined

203
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:24,200
and shown to depend on the square of the storage-ring
energy and linearly with the bending-magnet

204
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:31,590
field strength. The radiative power generated
by bending magnets and thus by the whole storage

205
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,570
ring (excluding other components such as insertion
devices) was determined and shown to be a

206
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:45,309
small fraction of the power stored within
the ring. Nonetheless, losses associated with

207
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:51,399
radiation production need to be replenished,
and the mechanism by which this is done, namely

208
00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:58,130
the use of a radio-frequency cavity, results
in the electron current separating out into

209
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:10,260
bunches with bunch durations two orders of
magnitude shorter than their separation.

210
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:19,440
Next week, we define the important photon-beam
parameters of flux, emittance, and brilliance,

211
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,350
further discuss components of the so-called
magnet lattice, namely double- and multi bend

212
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:34,280
achromats, quadrupoles, and sextupoles; and
insertion devices, in particular undulators.

213
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:42,320
The use of multi bend achromats in so-called
diffraction-limited storage rings, or DLSRs,

214
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,870
defines the next generation of synchrotron
facilities and is discussed in some detail.

215
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:55,190
Lastly, we provide an overview of XFEL physics
and architecture and the radiation it produces.
