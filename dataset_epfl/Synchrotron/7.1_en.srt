00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,980
Welcome to the first video of Week 7 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,059
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,059 --> 00:00:20,259
This week, we discuss different spectroscopies
available at x-ray facilities.

4
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:24,860
Synchrotrons are unique insofar that one can
tune the photon energy, allowing experiments

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,640
to be performed that are excluded to lab-based
x-ray sources.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,340
In this first video, we will cover some basic
concepts in x-ray spectroscopy, including

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,480
energy balance considerations, and the properties
of photoelectrons.

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,410
The second video is primarily concerned with
absorption spectroscopies, which absolutely

9
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:51,780
require the tunability of synchrotron radiation.

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,510
The third and final video is concerned with
spectroscopies that probe different products

11
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:06,470
resulting from the absorption process, most
importantly x-ray fluorescence and photoelectrons.

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:12,000
So let us begin with a discussion of different
spectroscopic methods and basic ideas behind

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,400
spectroscopy.

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,520
We can distinguish spectroscopies of tunable
x-ray sources into three main categories.

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,540
Absorption techniques require one to tune
the incident radiation.

16
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,270
The range of photons being tuned relative
to absorption edges differentiates XANES (near

17
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:39,820
the absorption edge) from EXAFS (further above
the absorption edge).

18
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,560
Standard x-ray fluorescence measurements are
typically carried out at fixed incident photon

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,939
energies and can be performed using other
sources, including electron excitation.

20
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,580
Resonant x-ray inelastic scattering is a photon-in
- photon-out technique where the fluorescence

21
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:05,570
spectra as a function of the incident photon
energy are recorded.

22
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:14,140
Lastly, the energies of photoelectrons caused
by x-ray absorption can be recorded in x-ray

23
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:23,000
photoelectron spectroscopy, while if the sample
is a single crystal , the signal can be resolved

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,010
also as a function of angle relative to the
crystallographic axes of the sample in x-ray

25
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:38,190
photoelectron diffraction for harder x-rays,
yielding information on near surface structural

26
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:50,010
conformations; and ARPES, when using ultraviolet
radiation and very soft x-rays, providing

27
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,240
insights into the electronic properties of
the sample.

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:02,440
At the highest photon energies, hard x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, or HAXPES, provides

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,160
important information structural, chemical,
and electronic information, particularly for

30
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:19,740
buried structures that are normally inaccessible
to techniques using lower photon energies.

31
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,670
Before we begin our discussions of individual
spectroscopic methods, the difference between

32
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,930
spectromicroscopies and microspectroscopies
is clarified.

33
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:39,569
Spectromicroscopies image an object at chosen
energies, be the energy that of the incident

34
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,690
radiation, fluorescent signal, or Auger or
photoelectrons.

35
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:53,239
Each of the 2D images in the vertical stack
here are spectromicroscopy results.

36
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,040
In micro spectroscopy, on the other hand,
the spectral response at a microscopically

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:07,020
defined position is probed, such as at positions
S1 or S2 in the schematic figure.

38
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:16,769
Commonly, beamlines are equipped to perform
both of these in a single experiment.

39
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:24,030
XANES and EXAFS are techniques that provide
information on local chemistry, surface adsorbate

40
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,680
configurations, and local structure out to
a few atom-distances.

41
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,819
Both require synchrotron radiation.

42
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:37,719
By using tightly focussed incident beams,
the response as a function of sample position

43
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:41,379
can be recorded in scanning techniques.

44
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,619
X-ray fluorescence provides information on
chemistry, and, more commonly and depending

45
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,869
on the detection technique, elemental content.

46
00:04:49,869 --> 00:04:53,610
This is also amenable to scanning methods.

47
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,300
XRF can be performed using lab sources, though
the enhanced brilliance of synchrotron radiation

48
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,110
opens up a much broader palette of methods
and allows access to energies inaccessible

49
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,330
to lab sources.

50
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:20,689
RIXS, for example, has only become a practicable
method since the advent of high-brilliance

51
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:28,629
third-generation synchrotron facilities.

52
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,610
Photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique
used widely using lab sources.

53
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,280
However, by tuning the incident radiation,
new variants such as resonant photoelectron

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,169
spectroscopies have become available.

55
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,639
The difference between X-ray absorption and
photoelectron spectroscopies is shown here.

56
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:03,759
XAS promotes core-level electrons to unoccupied
valence-state levels and thereby probes these

57
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,779
upper states by varying the incident photon
energy.

58
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:22,619
In contrast, in XPS and UPS, the electrons
are directly promoted into the vacuum and

59
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:29,469
their signal intensity as a function of emitted
electron energy (or binding energy) is recorded

60
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:33,889
for any given incident photon energy.

61
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:40,289
This yields information about the core- or
valence state from which the electrons originated.

62
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:49,969
Hence, each point in an XAS spectrum includes
all the possible processes occurring subsequent

63
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:57,050
to absorption of a photon of energy h nu,
and can thus be thought of as being the energy-integrated

64
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,749
intensity of an XPS spectrum recorded using
the photon energy associated with that point

65
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:08,289
in the XAS spectrum.

66
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:16,800
Pauli’s exclusion principle requires that
the final quantum state Ef was unoccupied

67
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,999
before absorption took place.

68
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:27,969
In addition, quantum mechanics shows us that
the probability Pif of an optical transition

69
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:35,919
by the absorption of a photon from an initial
state (labelled as the state vector or ket

70
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:45,740
psi i in the commonly used Dirac formalism)
to a final state psi f is proportional to

71
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,259
the square of the transition dipole matrix
element shown here in both the shorthand Dirac

72
00:07:52,259 --> 00:08:01,589
formalism and more conventionally as an integral
of the complex conjugate of the final state

73
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:10,580
psi f, the dipole operator er, and the initial
quantum state psi i over all volume of the

74
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,179
electron wavefunctions.

75
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:19,930
The dipole operator allowing the transition
of the electron from the original to final

76
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,919
state is er and is antisymmetric.

77
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:31,259
The wavefunctions are either symmetric or
antisymmetric, hence it should be clear that

78
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:38,409
the integrand needs to be symmetric for the
integral to be nonzero, which in turn requires

79
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:48,740
that one wavefunction is symmetric (even parity)
and the other antisymmetric (odd parity).

80
00:08:48,740 --> 00:09:01,810
So, for example, the integrand 1s er 2s consists
of two symmetric wavefunctions and one antisymmetric

81
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:09,730
operator, and is thus itself antisymmetric,
meaning that its integration over space, the

82
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,300
probability of that transition, is equal to
zero - in other words, a dipole transition

83
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,710
between two symmetric wavefunctions is forbidden.

84
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,860
It is briefly mentioned that other transition
operators such as the quadrupole transition

85
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,230
operator, is itself symmetric, allowing transitions
between two sates of the same symmetry.

86
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:40,510
These are, however, in general much weaker.

87
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,270
From a quantum-mechanical perspective, free
electrons exhibit both particle- and wavelike

88
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,980
properties.

89
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,110
The wavelength lambda_e of an electron, or
indeed any particle with momentum p, is given

90
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:05,830
by lambda_e = h/p, where h is Planck’s constant
equal to 6.63 x 10^-34 J.s.

91
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,959
This is the de Broglie wavelength.

92
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:17,129
Because the wavevector associated with a wavelength
lambda is 2 pi/lambda, p is equal to hbar

93
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,939
k, where hbar = h/2pi.

94
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:31,541
The kinetic energy of a non relativistic particle
is simply 1/2 mv^2, but because p = mv, this

95
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:44,180
means that the KE is equal to p^2/2m, or hbar^2k_e^2/2m_e
for an electron.

96
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,720
But the kinetic energy of an electron is what’s
left over from the photon energy after the

97
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,350
original binding energy of the electron to
the atom is subtracted.

98
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,680
We can rearrange these relationships to obtain
an expression for lambda_e as a function of

99
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,180
the photon energy and binding energy, as shown
here.

100
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:17,459
This can be further modified to obtain the
simple expressions lambda_e in Angstroms = 12.28/square

101
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:37,300
root of E_e in eV, or the wavevector in inverse
Angstroms = 0.512 x square root of E_e in

102
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,330
eV.

103
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:44,900
So, for example, an electron with a 100-eV
kinetic energy, would have a de Broglie wavelength

104
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,709
of 1.228 Angstroms.

105
00:11:50,709 --> 00:12:00,560
The binding energy of an electron E_B depends
on orbital it occupies and the elements atomic

106
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,709
number (i.e., nuclear charge).

107
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:11,449
The binding energies for all the elements
and for the lowest five core levels is shown

108
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,009
here.

109
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:20,639
The soft- tender- and hard-x-ray regimes are
shown in yellow, green, and blue, respectively.

110
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,069
Note that even the most strongly bound K-electron
of uranium can be accessed at some synchrotron

111
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:30,269
facilities.

112
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,810
An important parameter, especially in the
fields of photoelectron spectroscopies and

113
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:46,129
EXAFS, is the so-called inelastic mean free
path, or IMFP, which is the distance through

114
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:52,120
which an electron must pass in a material
before it is scattered inelastically with

115
00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:01,189
a probability of 1 - 1/e = 63%.

116
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:07,950
When an electron has high energies, its small
de-Broglie wavelength means that it has a

117
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:12,550
smaller effective cross-section and larger
IMFP.

118
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:19,649
Conversely, the dominant mechanism to induce
inelastic scatter of electrons is through

119
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,399
excitation of so-called “plasmons”, or
collective oscillations of electrons in the

120
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:28,759
(normally metallic) material.

121
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:36,749
At energies much lower than 10 eV, the electron
has insufficient energy to excite these plasmon

122
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:43,040
modes, and the inelastic mean free path increases
rapidly.

123
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,779
Between approximately 10 and a few hundred
to a thousand eV, the IMFP takes on values

124
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,940
of a few Angstroms to ten or so Angstroms.

125
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,930
This is of the order of the top few atomic
layers of the sample, and hence techniques

126
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:06,559
that record such photoelectrons are in general
highly surface sensitive.

127
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,399
This means that such experiments have highly
stringent requirements on the purity of the

128
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,040
surface and quality of vacuum in which the
experiment is performed, as we will touch

129
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,829
on again later.

130
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:30,540
The variation of the IMFP at a given electron
energy between different elements is fairly

131
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,060
modest.

132
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:39,860
The reason for this is that it is primarily
dependent on average electron-electron distances,

133
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:49,439
which are proportional to the cube root of
the electron density, which for most materials

134
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:53,620
varies no more than a factor of approximately
30.

135
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:04,069
The cube root of 30 is a little over three,
hence the spread of data points lie all fairly

136
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:14,550
comfortably within this range (note the logarithmic
ordinate axes).

137
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:23,740
This is why this plot is referred to as the
“universal curve”.

138
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,730
Lastly, it should be noted that the penetration
depth of photons in a material is in general

139
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:38,029
significantly higher than the IMFP, and hence
it is the latter that determines the depth

140
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:47,759
resolution for those experiments probing the
photoelectron energy.

141
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,730
The density of and interaction between orbitals
depend on whether the system is isolated,

142
00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:03,040
as in a dilute noble gas, or involves inter-atomic
interactions, such as in molecules and even

143
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,069
more so in condensed matter.

144
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:16,959
The well-defined valence orbitals of an atom
become less well defined in molecules due

145
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:23,189
to interaction of orbitals and the formation
of bonds.

146
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:36,720
When a system contains numbers of atoms similar
to Avogadro’s number, the valence orbitals

147
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,579
are so densely packed that they form bands.

148
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:48,490
Just as two separated orbitals of two electrons
combine together in the formation of a bond

149
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:55,079
to form a bound and anti bonding state (the
first being at lower energy and occupied,

150
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:01,790
the latter at higher energy and unoccupied),
the interaction of many, many atoms in condensed

151
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:10,140
matter produce a valence (occupied) band and
a conduction (unoccupied) band, at least at

152
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,439
absolute zero temperature.

153
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:19,270
How the valence and conduction bands sit relative
to one another determines whether the system

154
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,750
is a metal, semiconductor, or insulator.

155
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:29,149
In a metal, the top of the valence band and
bottom of the conduction band meet, allowing

156
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:35,799
the promotion of electrons to the otherwise
empty conduction band even with the tiniest

157
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:38,520
of excitation energies.

158
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,620
In semiconductors, there exists a band gap
that can be overcome by a certain fraction

159
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,700
of the valence-band electrons, spending on
the size of the gap and the temperature of

160
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,920
the system.

161
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:57,060
In insulators, the band gap is so large that
effectively no electrons can access the conduction

162
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:03,110
band without heating it up so much that the
material thermally breaks up.

163
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:09,039
Core orbitals, however, remain fairly inured
to the “outside world” and remain well-defined,

164
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,720
even in condensed matter.

165
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:23,309
Above the K-edge, associated with the 1s lowest-energy
core level, the orbitals are split into sub-levels,

166
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:30,100
manifesting themselves as sub-edges, as shown
here for the L-edge of Zr.

167
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,710
This is caused by the nonzero orbital angular
momentum of some of the orbitals (such as

168
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:45,220
p- or d-orbitals) coupling in different configurations
with the spin angular momentum of the electrons

169
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,230
in a process called spin-orbit coupling.

170
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:57,840
So, for example, the L-edge is composed of
an unsplit 2s-orbital, plus two spin-orbit

171
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,570
split 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 orbitals.

172
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,799
We finish this first video with a schemaitc
of a generic setup for x-ray spectroscopy

173
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,980
experiments.

174
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:18,159
Monochromatic synchrotron radiation is allowed
to impinge on a sample.

175
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:22,250
X-ray absorption spectra can be performed
by measuring the amount of light that passes

176
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,820
through a thin sample.

177
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:33,039
The x-ray intensities before entering the
sample (I0) and after (I) are measured using

178
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:41,680
ionization chambers (IC) or other beam-intensity
monitors, and is particularly suited for samples

179
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,970
that cannot be placed in vacuum, such as in
biological or catalytic experiments.

180
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,500
The total electron current through an ammeter
between the sample and ground can also be

181
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,260
used to indirectly determine the absorption
spectrum.

182
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:04,210
In this case, the sample and detectors must
be in vacuum.

183
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,150
X-ray fluorescence spectra can be recorded,
either using a crystal monochromator (XM)

184
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:17,230
in wavelength-dispersive spectra (WDX), or
by using a dispersive solid-state semiconductor

185
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,580
device (EDX).

186
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:27,200
The integrated fluorescence yield can also
be used as a measure of absorption strength.

187
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,500
Unwanted detection of elastically scattered
x-rays is best achieved by placing the detector

188
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:39,299
on the polarization axis of the synchrotron
radiation.

189
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:44,640
The kinetic energy of photoelectrons and Auger
electrons can be determined using electron

190
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,010
energy-dispersive analysers.

191
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:54,269
In summary, this first video has prepared
us for a closer discussion of individual spectroscopic

192
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:55,269
methods.

193
00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,979
In the second video, we will concentrate on
different variants of absorption spectroscopy.
