00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,750
Welcome to the second video of Week 9 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:16,900
free-electron lasers!
In this video, we will describe in some detail

3
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:24,180
the methods of molecular replacement and multiple
isomorphous replacement, the latter also setting

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,770
the foundations for how the phase problem
is solved in the two more modern methods discussed

5
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,550
in the last video of this week, namely multi-wavelength
anomalous diffraction, and single-wavelength

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,630
anomalous diffraction.

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,800
Molecular replacement is an approach to solving
the structure of a protein by taking chunks

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,260
of protein structures that have already been
solved and testing them out to see if they

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:57,330
might be part of the unsolved structure under
investigation.

10
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:06,030
A protein fold is the manner in which so-called
secondary structures order themselves in space.

11
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:14,121
Secondary structures are the helices and sheets
commonly seen in depictions of proteins. In

12
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:21,930
the snippet of a protein shown here, I have
coloured the alpha-helices gold, and the beta-sheets

13
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,861
blue. Although one fold may look very similar
or essentially identical to another, this

14
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:33,490
does not necessarily mean it has the same
chemistry, that is, the same amino-acid sequence

15
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:41,800
- two such folds are said to be homologous.
Despite Nature’s seemingly infinite variety,

16
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:49,360
it seems that she creates using a limited
collection of building blocks. 1400 protein

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,030
folds have to date been discovered, and the
last of these was in 2008. Although the possibility

18
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,310
remains that there could be many more still
to discover, for example in the relatively

19
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:08,280
unexplored class of membrane proteins, this
seemingly rather circumscribed selection of

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:17,240
folds thus lends itself to the approach of
molecular replacement. As a rule of thumb,

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:24,900
MR is often relatively straightforward if
the unsolved structure shares 40% or more

22
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,920
sequence identity (that is, the amino-acid
sequence) with the known structure.

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:39,510
So, if one suspects that a structure might
contain a certain fold, how does one go about

24
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,310
testing this, and also finding out where exactly
the fold might sit and in which orientation?

25
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:54,330
The approach is one of “divide and conquer”,
and it uses the Patterson map to achieve this.

26
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,411
Consider the cartoon on the right. A block
of a solved structure is suspected to be also

27
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:07,090
present in some unknown position and orientation
in an unknown protein structure for which

28
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:14,490
a set of diffraction patterns has been recorded.
In principle, one could then directly compare

29
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:20,760
this pattern to that of the known structure
for all possible orientations and positions

30
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,709
of that structure within the unit cell. A
good best match between the two would provide

31
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,090
valuable information about the unknown structure.
Such a procedure, however, would require varying

32
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:42,239
three rotational and three translational parameters
with sufficient resolution (given, respectively,

33
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,640
by the rotation angles between diffraction
images in the data set, and by the resolution

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:54,200
of the electron- density map of the known
structure). This six-dimensional search is,

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,260
for anything other than the smallest structures,
computationally too demanding.

36
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,750
Instead, we exploit the fact that Patterson
maps provide information on the relative distances

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:22,620
and directions between atom pairs. We define
“intrachunk” signal in the Patterson map

38
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,520
as being between atoms within the known molecular
motif that is being tested, and “extrachunk”

39
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,620
signal as lying at distances outside this,
that is, outside the circle with a radius

40
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,699
equal to the largest extent of the molecular
chunk.

41
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:51,749
Importantly, the intrachunk signal depends
only on the orientation of the motif being

42
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:59,650
tested, and not on its position in the unit
cell. This will mostly affect the centre of

43
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:07,599
the Patterson map out to the intrachunk radius.
It is therefore this central part of the Patterson

44
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:14,520
map that is optimised between the test and
unknown structures in order to determine the

45
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:23,169
angular orientation. This only involves varying
the three rotational degrees of freedom.

46
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:36,400
In contrast, extrachunk vectors between atoms
inside and outside the protein fold depend

47
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,520
both on its orientation and on its position
relative to the rest of the structure. So,

48
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,449
in the second step, the extrachunk vectors
can be exploited in the outer parts of the

49
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:55,169
Patterson map to determine the translation
vector.

50
00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:01,240
By exploiting this property of Patterson maps,
the six-parameter search can thus be reduced

51
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:10,110
to two independent, three-dimensional searches
of first a rotational operation, and then

52
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:17,550
a translation within the bounds of the unit
cell. It is important to appreciate just how

53
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,490
beneficial this simplification is. Critically,
the complexity of optimization search routines

54
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:31,119
increases not linearly with the number of
parameters, but exponentially. As an example,

55
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:38,800
if a one-parameter search spanning one hundred
values of that parameter requires one second

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,499
of CPU time, adding a second parameter with
the same range of values increases the CPU

57
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:55,680
time to 100 seconds. A similar six-parameter
search would require three hundred years!

58
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:06,749
In contrast, two three-parameters searches
would be complete after only six hours.

59
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:12,949
The power of modern computers and the ever-growing
database of high-quality, atomic-resolution

60
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:18,370
protein structures means that the majority
of protein structures are at least partly

61
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:27,399
solved using MR. Indeed, this predominance
of MR is likely to increase with computing

62
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,830
power, the introduction of novel software
tools to automatically perform the rotational

63
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:39,110
searches, and, in a self-fulfilling process,
the expanding volume of reliable structural

64
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,430
data.

65
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:49,279
We now describe multiple isomorphous replacement,
the historically first approach to determine

66
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:57,879
the structure by observing how the diffraction
pattern changes when controlled structural

67
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:06,619
changes are made to it.
Let’s consider a protein-crystal unit cell.

68
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:14,179
This produces a certain diffraction pattern
with its own set of intensities. Now imagine

69
00:08:14,179 --> 00:08:23,810
the same unit cell , but in which a heavy
atom has either been added or which has substituted

70
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,909
a native atom or small molecular chunk. This
new structure containing the heavy atom produces

71
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:41,200
its own diffraction pattern , which will differ
from the original native structure.

72
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,750
So let’s concentrate on one particular Bragg
peak of the original structure, highlighted

73
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:54,800
here . The Argand diagram consists of many
vector contributions, one each from each atom

74
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,570
in the native structure. We add all these
up vectorially to produce F_P, the native

75
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,590
protein’s structure factor for that particular
reflection, proportional to the square root

76
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:17,330
of the Bragg-peak intensity . Now, what about
the same Bragg peak for the derivative structure

77
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:23,390
containing the heavy atom? Apart from the
addition of this atom, the rest of the structure

78
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:32,060
should remain unchanged (this is the “isomorphous”
aspect, and cannot always be guaranteed).

79
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,450
So we can add on the vector for the structure
factor of the heavy atom F_H, to produce the

80
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:45,880
structure factor of the derivative structure
F_PH, proportional to the square root of the

81
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,750
Bragg peak intensity in the derivative’s
diffraction pattern.

82
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:59,491
OK, now let’s look at this structure factor
of the derivative heavy-atom structure. We

83
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:05,440
can rearrange the vectors like this without
removing the generality of our arguments.

84
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:15,550
F_P, F_H, and F_PH all remain the same regarding
both their phase angles and magnitudes.

85
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:24,630
So, the structure factor of the native structure
F_P lies somewhere on the blue circle shown

86
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:32,810
here - its actual phase angle is given here,
but we don’t know what this is (that’s

87
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:42,310
the problem with the phase problem!!) We now
add the vector F_H , from which we can construct

88
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:52,970
F_PH , which lies somewhere on the orange
circle shown here. There are therefore two

89
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:02,050
possible orientations of F_P (and also F_PH,
not shown here in order to keep things uncluttered).

90
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:11,470
But which of these is correct? In order to
determine this unambiguously, a second derivative

91
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:18,190
structure must be prepared and the diffraction
pattern recorded. We can then draw a third

92
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:24,450
green circle with a radius corresponding to
the square root of the intensity of this particular

93
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:33,440
Bragg peak |F_PH2|^2. This will overlap only
one of the two possible solutions obtained

94
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,410
from the first two diffraction patterns, thereby
removing the ambiguity .

95
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:48,390
Now, the more critical of you might have noticed
that the arguments given here are predicated

96
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:58,210
on knowing the amplitudes and phases of the
two heavy-atom contributions F_H and F_H2,

97
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:04,460
in other words their magnitudes and angles
in the Argand diagram. How do we get these?

98
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,350
We discuss this briefly now.

99
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:17,120
We redraw the vector addition of F_P with
F_H to produce F_PH once more, including the

100
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:27,260
phase angles . 
We define |Delta F|_iso as being equal to

101
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,900
the difference in magnitude between the square-roots
of the intensities of F_PH and F_H at the

102
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:47,980
diffraction spot. The angle between F_H and
F_PH is simply phi_H - phi_PH . Now if we

103
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:58,800
draw a line from the end of F_P to F_PH, perpendicular
to F_PH, we immediately see that the difference

104
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:15,340
between F_PH and F_P is approximately given
by F_H cos(phi_H = phi_PH). This is valid

105
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:25,360
if both F_P and F_PH are significantly larger
than F_H, and is also approximately true for

106
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:36,850
relatively large F_H, as long as phi_H - phi_PH
is small. For most instances, one or both

107
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:46,920
of these approximations hold fairly well.
So, what next? First, we take our approximate

108
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:56,320
equation for |Delta F|_iso and square both
sides. Next , we use the trigonometric identity

109
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:04,279
that the square of the cosine of an angle
is equal to the cosine of double that angle

110
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:16,240
plus one, all divided by two. Substituting
this into the top equation yields DeltaF_iso^2

111
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:37,690
= F_H^2/2 + F_H^2/2 times cosine(2(phi_H - phi_PH)).
But phi_H and phi_PH are not correlated, which

112
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,930
means the cosine of the second term can take
on any value and therefore the second term

113
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:55,490
produces only background noise. This leaves
us with the first term F_H^2/2. This is a

114
00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:05,930
usable Fourier component. By doing this calculation
for all recorded Bragg spots, one can therefore

115
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:12,910
generate a “difference” Patterson map
of the heavy atom, or atoms, only!!

116
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:22,160
So, in conclusion, by performing the above
straightforward mathematical manipulations,

117
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:29,400
we can obtain the Patterson map of the heavy
atoms and obtain the phase angle and magnitude

118
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,650
of F_H. This was the necessary information
that we needed in the previous slide (which

119
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,440
might now seem a long time ago. Sorry!) in
order to obtain the phases of the original

120
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,310
notice protein structure phi_P.

121
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:52,480
Let’s now work out a “typical” order
of magnitude for differences in Bragg-peak

122
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,420
intensities as a consequence of introducing
a heavy atom. I say “typical”, but this

123
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,490
can of course vary hugely, according to how
many heavy atoms one can introduce in a unit

124
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:12,339
cell, and how heavy the total native structure
is. In this particular example, we assume

125
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:20,050
a molecular mass of the native protein of
50 kDa, while the derivative structure contains

126
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:27,930
a single mercury atom.
As we said already, there is no apriori correlation

127
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:33,990
between the phase of the total structure factor
F_P of the native protein and that of the

128
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:43,720
heavy atom, so F_H will sit anywhere on a
circle centered on the end of F_P and having

129
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:54,270
a radius equal to the magnitude of F_H. One
possible outcome is, for example, here. The

130
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:10,789
limits of the values F_PH can assume is therefore
between FP _ F_H and F_P + F_H .

131
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:19,270
We show a plot on the left of the atomic form
factors of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,

132
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:26,970
sulphur, and mercury as a function of scattering
vector Q. Note that the heavier the atom,

133
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:36,690
the more slowly it drops off as a function
of Q. The form factor for carbon at seven

134
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:49,030
reciprocal angstroms is about 28% the value
at Q = 0, while for mercury, it is still about

135
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:59,440
56%. This means that the relative contribution
of the heavy atom increases with increasing

136
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:07,429
Q - larger relative differences in the diffraction
pattern Bragg-peak intensities are to be seen

137
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:14,840
further out in the pattern, even if the absolute
intensities drop off.

138
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,669
We also assume an “average” protein chemical
composition as shown here.

139
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:30,580
For reasons which will become clearer in the
third and last video of this week, the average

140
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,419
structure factor of the native protein can
therefore be calculated using this equation.

141
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:43,120
This is a statistically averaged result based
on the assumption that the positions of the

142
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,990
atomic form factors of each atom are entirely
uncorrelated with the incident x-radiation

143
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:59,299
- it would be a remarkable and very odd situation
if this were not so! In actuality, the real

144
00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:06,749
structure factor magnitudes will vary around
this value (like I say, the equation is a

145
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:14,659
statistical average). Using this equation
for F_P, we can either add or subtract F_H,

146
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:22,649
then square this up to get the upper and lower
limits of the derivative intensities. As you

147
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:29,240
can see, this can be large, up to +/- a few
tens of percent and therefore very easy to

148
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:37,039
detect. Like I say, though, a larger protein
with a lighter heavy-atom substitute or addition

149
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:44,970
will produce weaker effects, while the opposite
is true for smaller proteins and/or heavier

150
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:53,679
atom substitutes, or for the case that there
are more than one heavy atom per unit cell.

151
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,700
In summary, multiple isomorphous replacement
functions by changing the Bragg-peak intensities

152
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:08,370
by addition or substitution of one or more
heavy metals in the unit cell. The validity

153
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,879
of the approach depends on the heavy atom
being able to be inserted into the structure

154
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:21,190
and that this does not disrupt the size or
shape of the remainder of the protein structure,

155
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:31,369
that is, the native part. Famous successful
examples of using MIR that won the users of

156
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:38,809
this technique the Nobel prize include insulin
and penicillin by Dorothy Hodgkin, and myoglobin

157
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:45,640
and haemoglobin by John Kendrew and Max Perutz,
respectively.

158
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:54,610
MIR needs at least two derivative structures,
and this aspect could often represent an insurmountable

159
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:04,179
obstacle. Interestingly, when Martha Teeter
and Wayne Hendrickson attempted to use MIR

160
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:13,549
in the protein crambin in the 1970s, they
were unable to produce any reasonable derivatives.

161
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:19,629
In desperation, they tried to see if they
could identify any differences in intensities

162
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:26,679
between Friedel pairs in the diffraction pattern
of the native structure, and serendipitously

163
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:33,150
thereby invented the technique of single-wavelength
anomalous diffraction, covered in the next

164
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:41,360
video. It was this, and initially in particular
multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, both

165
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:49,809
of which are based on anomalous effects, that
would supersede MIR, especially once the use

166
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:56,990
of synchrotron radiation became more widespread.
We discuss these two methods in the next video.
