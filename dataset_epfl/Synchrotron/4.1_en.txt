Welcome to the first video of Week 4 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week covers more details about machine physics, that is, the generation of synchrotron radiation by storage rings.
We begin by discussing properties of the x-rays generated at synchrotrons, then progress in the second video than overview of the magnet lattice and insertion devices.
In the third and last video of Week 4, we will familiarise ourselves with the latest tools to be developed for x-ray science, namely diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs) and x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).
So, letâ€™s begin with a detailed description of some of the most important properties of x-radiation, namely the flux, the emittance, the combination of these, called the brilliance, and lastly, coherence.
As we have already highlighted qualitatively earlier in this course, for most experiments using x-rays, we would like the beam to be intense, parallel, have as much as possible a single wavelength, and originate from a small source.
The flux associated with an x-ray source is simply the number of photons it emits for a standardised relative spectral bandwidth, delta E/E, where delta E is a range of energies around a central energy E. This expression, incidentally, can be equivalently expressed in terms of the wavelength, that is delta lambda/lambda, or in terms of the frequency delta nu/nu (or indeed the angular frequency, delta omega/omega).
The brilliance is simply the flux divided by the source size in units of area, and also by the divergence in the two orthogonal planes perpendicular to the beam axis, given in units of angle-squared.
Conventionally for synchrotrons, the beam propagates along the positive z-direction, while the x-axis lies in the plane of the synchrotron ring and the y-axis is perpendicular to both x and z.
As we will see, the product of these two properties, that is, the source size and divergence, is known as the emittance.
The brilliance is therefore simply the flux divided by the emittance.
We now look at these different properties of x-rays more quantitatively, beginning with the flux.
By convention, the flux is defined as the number of photons emitted per second within a 0.1% bandwidth around the central energy
(or frequency, or wavelength).
This concept can be at first confusing for nonspectroscopists, so let us consider an example, involving a so-called silicon monochromator, one of the most commonly used devices at synchrotrons.
In general, the spectra emitted by synchrotron sources are far from being monochromatic - as we shall see later this week, bending magnet radiation is very broad, while even that for the generally most desired sources called undulators, consists of spectral peaks regularly spaced in energy, each peak itself having a width that is more often than not too broad to be used without further monochromatization.
Monochromators are therefore used at beamlines to clean up the spectra so that only a very narrow range of photon energies get through to the experiment.
Perhaps the most common of these is the silicon monochromator.
It need not concern us for the present how these instruments work (it is by diffraction, but weâ€™ll get to that next week).
Let us consider my own beamline, the Materials
Science beamline at the Swiss Light Source.
After monochromatization, we have measured, for example, an average power output of 34 mW at a nominal photon energy of 7 keV.
The energy of each photon is easy to calculate and is equal to 7000 eV x 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV
= 1.12 fJ.
The number of photons/s is therefore 34 mW divided by the photon energy = 3 x 10^13 ph/s.
Now, in order to determine the flux, as defined above as the number of photons/0.1% bandwidth, we need to know what the bandwidth of photons is that a Si monochromator allows through.
It turns out that this is a constant, equal to 1.4 x 10^-4.
Now this is SMALLER than 0.1% by a factor of 0.14.
The flux is therefore equal to the number of delivered photons DIVIDED by 0.14, as the silicon monochromator has a narrower b bandwidth that that defined for flux, and is therefore equal to 2.17 x 10^14 ph/s/0.1%BW.
Now let us move on to the property of emittance.
In the two orthonormal directions to z, the emittance is the product of the standard deviation in source size and the standard deviation in divergence.
In order to keep consistent bookkeeping, the definition of standard deviation sigma is shown here.
Briefly, sigma (or sigmaâ€™ in the case of divergence) is defined as shown here for a beam with Gaussian profile, a fair approximation for synchrotron light.
The width 2 sigma is a little smaller than the full-width at half maximum by the factor sqrt(8 ln 2), or 2.355.
Now the emittance actually has two sources; one due to the electron source size and angular distribution, and the other from the photons, in other words, that associated with synchrotron radiation emission.
In general, the electron emittance, in particular in the horizontal plane (i.e., the x-direction), tends to dominate.
Because the sources are independent of each other, their contributions add orthogonally, as given by the equations shown here.
The photon emittance has a lower limit known as the diffraction limit equal to lambda/4 pi, and is a consequence of Heisenbergâ€™s uncertainty principle.
For example, this is equal to 8 pm.rad for
1-Angstrom radiation.
On the other hand, the electron emittance can be substantially larger, especially in the x-direction, as it is in this direction that the Lorentz forces from magnets in general act.
This will increase both the electronsâ€™ effective source size and the divergence.
One of the aims of machine physicists in the last decade and a half has been to minimise any residual horizontal magnetic fields in the plane of the electronsâ€™ orbit caused by imperfect magnet alignment, which would couple part of the horizontal emittance to the vertical emittance, blowing this up as well.
Several facilities can now say that the magnet alignment has been so perfectly tuned that the vertical total emittance is essentially equal to the theoretical minimum.
As we shall discuss in the last video of this week, the improved performance promised by diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs) in the near future is based on efforts to minimise also the electron emittance in the
HORIZONTAL plane and increase the brilliance accordingly.
So a given storage-ring facility will have a certain electron emittance, which is preserved along the entirety of the ring.
The lower limits to this are determined by several factors, and we will touch on these later when discussing DLSRs.
For the moment, we should consider the following.
If a storage ring has a given emittance, how can this be â€œexpressedâ€�?
As the emittance is the product of the source size and divergence, we can either sacrifice source size for a very parallel beam, or vice versa, squeezing the source size to be as small as possible, and accepting a larger divergence.
Or, indeed, any combination between these two extremes.
These are referred to as having a high beta, or low beta, respectively.
The question is now, what to do when?
The so-called beta function is simply the source size divided by the divergence.
A large beta function therefore corresponds to a large source emitting parallel radiation, while as small beta describes a small but divergent source.
Shown on the right is a graph of the variation of beta and sigma in both the x- and y-directions along a sector spanning a little more than
80 degrees of the Swiss Light Source.
As one sees, both beta and sigma vary strongly with position along the ring, due to different elements of the magnet lattice squeezing, focussing, and chromatically correcting the electrons.
For example, along the parts of the ring which contain the straights (used normally to accommodate insertion devices), the beta functions are minimised in order to bring the electrons exactly to the centre of the insertion devices for optimal operation.
Now we have defined both the flux and emittance, we can state that the brilliance is defined as the flux given in photons/s and 0.1% bandwidth, divided by the values for sigma_x and sigma_y, each given in mm, and sigmaâ€™_x and sigmaâ€™_y, expressed in mrad.
I repeat: the brilliance is the flux divided by the total emittance.
So let us make an order-of-magnitude calculation for the brilliance of an undulator in a â€œtypicalâ€� third-generation undulator.
We have already calculated the flux for the
MS beamline at the Swiss Light Source, so letâ€™s take a similar value of around 10^14 ph/s/0.1%BW.
Typical horizontal and vertical emittance are around 0.01 and 10^-4 mm.mrad, respectively, which results in a brilliance of the order of 10^20 ph/s/0.1%BW mm2 mrad2.
This value sits squarely in the middle of the graph shown earlier describing the improvement of brilliance in the last Century or so.
The brilliance offered by XFELs is several orders of magnitude higher still, due both to the highly parallel nature of the beam, and also to the exceedingly high peak flux that really defines XFELs.
As already mentioned, DLSRs owe their improved brilliance primarily to the reduction in horizontal emittance using newly available technologies.
Both these aspects will be discussed in the third video of this week.
We finish this video with a description of coherence.
Coherence describes the relative phase relationship between different parts of the x-ray source, or, from a quantum mechanical viewpoint, of the photons.
A source is said to be coherent if the emitted waves are all in phase and (by necessity) have the same wavelength.
Lasers, for example, have in general a very high degree of coherence.
In contrast, synchrotron sources are in general only partially coherent, and might have a so-called â€œcoherent fractionâ€� less than
0.1% for hard x-rays.
One of the exciting properties of XFEL beams is the high degree of so-called â€œtransverseâ€� coherence, explained shortly.
Coherence is an attractive property in many instances, as this allows macroscopic objects to be irradiated, and their three-dimensional architecture determined, by recording the scattered signal, without the need for a lens.
As we shall see later in the course, x-ray lenses that would be sufficiently strong to magnify an object so that its structure can be determined on a nanometer or Angstrom scale are impossible to construct, due to the fact that the refractive index of materials in the x-ray regime differs only very marginally from unity, meaning refraction by lenses is very weak.
So techniques which dispense with such optical elements, such as x-ray diffraction, small-angle scattering (SAXS), coherent x-ray diffractive imaging (CXDI) , and ptychography, are highly attractive as x-ray imaging methods.
The size of the object that can be measured depends on the degree of coherence - x-ray diffraction is concerned with objects of the order of a few Angstroms to a couple of tens of nanometers (the unit cell size), and in general, it is easy to prepare x-ray beams with sufficient coherence to record high-quality diffraction data.
In the case of coherent x-ray diffractive imaging of an object of characteristic dimensions measured in microns, however, one must take careful measures to ensure the beam is coherent enough that the scattered signal (called â€œspeckleâ€�) contains the required information to regain the sampleâ€™s structure.
In general, if the sample is smaller than the coherence volume, defined in the next slide, lensless scattering imaging of that object becomes possible.
Indeed, in the case of ptychography, a burgeoning field in hard x-ray science, objects substantially larger by orders of magnitude than the coherence length can also be investigated with nanometer or near atomic resolution, by scanning across the sample and using a sophisticated mathematical algorithm which links successive images recorded during the scan.
All these techniques will be covered later in the course.
The coherent volume is spanned by two transverse and one longitudinal coherence length, as shown here, resulting in a coherent volume
. The transverse coherence lengths are determined by the divergence of the beam, while the longitudinal value depends on the monochromacity of the beam.
We discuss these separately now.
The longitudinal coherence length is defined as the length required for parts of the beam with different wavelengths (or energies) that begin in phase to be entirely out of phase and then in phase once more, as shown here.
The phase difference between the two energetically different parts of the beam is thus 2 pi.
Note that this is just one definition - in the literature, on can find the coherence length as being defined as that after a phase difference of pi (180 degrees), or even one radian (about 57 degrees).
In our definition of a phase shift of 2 pi, the longitudinal coherence length is given as being equal to lambda^2/Delta lambda , which for 2-Angstrom radiation after monochromatization using a silicon monochromator with a value of Delta lambda/lambda approximately 10^-4, is thus of the order of a couple of microns.
The transverse coherence length is determined similarly as the lateral distance between parts of the wavefront separated by a phase of 2 pi, due to the source divergence.
Obviously, the more parallel the beam (small
Delta theta), the larger the transverse coherence.
As Delta theta is equal to D/R, where D is the source size and R is the source - sample distance, beamlines constructed for scattering experiments of mesoscopically sized objects, such as in SAXS, CXDI, and ptychography, tend to have long source - end-station distances
(i.e., D) and small source sizes (R).
Because the divergence of x-ray beams is generally larger in the horizontal plane than the vertical, the vertical transverse coherence length is concomitantly larger than that in the horizontal direction.
As an example, the transverse coherent lengths for 2-Angstrom radiation at the cSAXS beamline of the Swiss Light Source are given here.
Even the smaller horizontal value is an order of magnitude larger than typical longitudinal coherence lengths, and it is therefore the transverse coherence which tends to be exploited in such scattering experiments.
In the above calculations determining the transverse coherent lengths, the divergence was assumed to be that of the source.
However, the wavefront can be further scrambled by imperfect optics, such as for specular reflections off an x-ray mirror, caused by that mirror not being perfectly flat.
Beamlines exploiting coherence take great care in minimising such artefacts.
Lastly, the coherent fraction as a function of the electronsâ€™ and photonsâ€™ source sizes and divergences is given here.
In â€œnormalâ€� third-generation facilities, this expression is dominated by sigma_x^e and sigmal_x^eâ€™, and coherent fractions of the order of 10^-3 or less are typical.
If, however, one is able to reduce these, and the equivalent values in the y-direction to those associated with the photons, then one can obtain coherent fraction of 25%.
The next-generation storage rings, DLSRs, promise to make a quantum leap in this direction, obtaining coherent fractions of a few percent, that is almost two orders of magnitude greater than presently possible.
In the case of XFELs, the electron emittance is significantly smaller than the photon emittance, and coherent fractions close to unity are achieved.
In summary, we have discussed in detail in this video the pertinent properties and characteristics of synchrotron beams, namely their flux, emittance, brilliance, and coherence.
In the next video of this week, we discuss the magnet lattice of the storage ring, that is, the set of dipole bending magnets, quadrupoles, and sextupoles responsible for keeping the electrons on a well-defined closed orbit, before considering insertion devices (that is, wigglers, and most importantly, undulators), the magnet arrays placed in the straight sections of the storage ring that produce the most intense beams.
