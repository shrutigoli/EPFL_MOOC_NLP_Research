00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,460
Welcome to the second video of Week 7 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,760
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,610
In this video, I will introduce you to different
absorption spectroscopies, which absolutely

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:24,410
require the tunability of synchrotron radiation.

5
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,269
We can divide up absorption spectroscopies
to the so-called XANES regime that lies within

6
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:37,280
a couple of tens of eV from the absorption
edge, and the EXAFS technique, which ranges

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,210
from approximately 50 eV above an absorption
edge to several hundred eV, or even a kiloelectronvolt

8
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,410
above this.

9
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,120
We start by discussing XANES.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:59,570
XANES is short for x-ray absorption near-edge
spectroscopy.

11
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,130
It also goes under another name, NEXAFS, or
near-edge x-ray absorption fine structure,

12
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,860
though I prefer to avoid this, as it is both
redundant, and its orthographical similarity

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,630
to EXAFS, an absorption technique based on
entirely different principles, can be the

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,150
source for confusion.

15
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:34,560
In addition to “simple” XANES, the variants
STXM, PEEM, XMCD, and XMLD will be discussed.

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,700
XANES is a technique in which the photon energy
is so chosen that a core-level electron can

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:52,570
be promoted to an unoccupied but bound or
quasibound orbital of the system.

18
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,570
Depending on the system, these unoccupied
states can be diffuse, but can also be fairly

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,210
sharp, especially for example, for molecule
that are weakly adsorbed on a surface and

20
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,090
may only weakly interact with that “host”
material.

21
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,450
The absorption cross-section for photoexcitation
of a core-electron to the near vacuum exhibits

22
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,340
oscillations in the neighbourhood of the absorption
edge caused by excited bound states and also

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,290
the quasicontinuum just above the ionization
threshold, which exhibit large fluctuations

24
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,590
in their density of states.

25
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,280
This is the XANES signal.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,060
For the low photoelectron energies typical
of XANES, the inelastic mean free path becomes

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:51,390
significantly larger than at higher energies
- remember the universal curve shown in the

28
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,410
previous video.

29
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:01,269
XANES therefore ‘sees’ a large range of
absorber–scatterer distances.

30
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,569
This results in multiple scattering of the
photoelectrons, which means theoretical modelling

31
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:09,980
of XANES still remains a significant challenge.

32
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:18,780
XANES spectra are therefore mostly interpreted
and not quantitatively analyzed.

33
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,750
The lowest-energy XANES signals actually occur
below the absorption edge, and are referred

34
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,580
to pre-edge transitions.

35
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:33,010
Pre-edge features are strongly influenced
by the symmetry of the local environment around

36
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,520
the absorbing atom.

37
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,480
To understand this, one must first appreciate
that orbitals in molecules and solid-state

38
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,349
systems can assume the character of a mixture
of atomic orbitals and are related to the

39
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:54,400
symmetry of the local environment, such as
the simple example the famous tetragonally

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:06,190
symmetric sp3-orbitals of diamond formed by
hybridization of one 2s- and three 2p-atomic

41
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,780
orbitals.

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,640
Those orbitals around an atom which are allowed
depend on the symmetry of the local environment.

43
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:24,850
In general orbitals exhibit a so-called ‘parity’
of (−1)^l, where l is the orbital angular

44
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:35,580
momentum quantum number - it is equal to 0,
1, and 2, for s-, p-, and d-orbitals, respectively.

45
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:43,310
An orbital has positive parity and is symmetric
if it is invariant under the operation of

46
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,930
moving each volume element of the orbital
amplitude wavefunction from r to −r – it

47
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,740
is said to be inversion symmetric.

48
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:02,120
Hence, the spherically symmetric s-states
have positive parity (as do the d-orbitals),

49
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,229
while the p- and f-states are antisymmetric
and have therefore negative parity, as we

50
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:12,009
touched on in the last video.

51
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:19,440
One can also have local environments which
are inversion symmetric, such as any of the

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,710
atom sites in a rocksalt crystal.

53
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:28,620
In such environments, atomic orbitals with
different parities cannot hybridize, as the

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,960
symmetry of such hybridized orbitals does
not match that of the environment.

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:43,430
So, for example, an sp3-orbital is incompatible
with an inversion-symmetric environment.

56
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,380
Consider as an example a material for which
a transition between a symmetric K-state (1s,

57
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:59,270
l = 0) and a bound excited state of mostly
(symmetric) d-character is observed with high

58
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,740
intensity.

59
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,449
We have already argued that in the dipole
approximation, only p-states (antisymmetric)

60
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,240
are accessible from s-states.

61
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:16,229
Hence the upper bound state must have both
p-type (antisymmetric) and d-type character.

62
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,160
From this we learn that the environment around
the absorbing atom cannot be inversion symmetric

63
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,889
because of the partial antisymmetric p-character.

64
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:33,000
The presence of bound-state resonant absorption
peaks therefore provides important information

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,020
on the local symmetry of the system.

66
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,180
6.

67
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,630
We now show two illustrative examples of information
that can be extracted using XANES.

68
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:57,900
The XANES spectra of the five 5d-metals Re,
Os, Ir, Pt, and Au is shown here.

69
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:10,130
The ground-state electronic configuration
of Re is that of [Xe], plus 6s2 4f14 5d5.

70
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:16,300
As one moves to the right in the periodic
table from Re, the remaining five available

71
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,690
5d-states are filled.

72
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:28,699
In gold, these states are fully occupied.

73
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:37,950
In the elements Re to Pt, the bound but unoccupied
5d-states, which are below the ionization

74
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:45,330
threshold, are seen as intense peaks, though
this become weaker as the d-orbitals are successively

75
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,240
filled.

76
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,940
As gold has no such unoccupied states, excitation
is necessarily directly into the unbound continuum,

77
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:04,410
and its XANES spectrum is consequently much
flatter.

78
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,949
In the second XANES example, it is shown that
orientational information can be extracted

79
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:17,770
by observation of changes in XANES spectra
according to the polarisation of the x-rays

80
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,069
used.

81
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:25,490
The probability of a photon being absorbed
depends on the orientation of the electric

82
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:33,719
field vector (the polarization, P) of the
electromagnetic field of the x-rays relative

83
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,030
to the polarization direction of the orbital
being excited.

84
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:46,440
So, for example, the pi-orbital of the formate
radical shown top centre lies perpendicular

85
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:55,140
to the molecular plane, and is most efficiently
excited if P has the same orientation.

86
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,541
Because the electric field is always perpendicular
to the propagation direction of the x-ray

87
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:08,160
beam, this means that the latter must lie
in or close to the molecular plane.

88
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,920
In contrast, the sigma orbital is responsible
for the C-O bond and lies along that axis,

89
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,190
top right.

90
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,630
The strongest excitation of this orbital thus
requires the polarisation to be in the same

91
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,890
direction.

92
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:34,100
The formate radical binds strongly to the
surface of Cu(110) shown top left.

93
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,190
The orientation of the molecule was unambiguously
determined by the change in the XANES signal

94
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:47,029
with x-ray polarization orientation and incident
angle of the x-rays on the surface.

95
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:54,149
Importantly, when the x-rays strike the surface
at a glancing angle of 20 degrees and P is

96
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:03,320
parallel to the ⟨110⟩ crystal axis of
the copper, excitation of the pi-orbital is

97
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:13,350
suppressed, but is strongly enhanced if the
sample is rotated so that P is parallel to

98
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,470
the ⟨001⟩ direction.

99
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,610
This leads to the conclusion that the formate
radical is oriented with the molecular plane

100
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:32,360
perpendicular to the surface and parallel
to the ⟨110⟩ direction, shown bottom-right.

101
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,430
Further details of this beautifully illustrative
example can be found in the reference given

102
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,800
here.

103
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,450
Since the introduction of high-brilliance
radiation in third-generation synchrotron

104
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:52,600
facilities and the development of high-quality
x-ray focussing elements such as Fresnel zone

105
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,100
plates, x-ray focal spot sizes of the order
of a micron or even an order of magnitude

106
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,210
smaller have become routinely achievable.

107
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:08,540
With this, so-called ‘microspectroscopy’
methods have flourished, in which the chemistry

108
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:16,660
of heterogeneous samples can be mapped out
with high spatial resolution.

109
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,690
One of the most important of these to emerge
is scanning transmission x-ray microscopy

110
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:29,740
(STXM), particularly in the field of polymer
chemistry and physics, where phenomena such

111
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:37,730
as segregation and heterogeneous morphology
must be understood at a submicron scale.

112
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:51,010
STXM can be thought of raster-scanning XANES
operated in the transmission mode.

113
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:56,350
There are many problems in biology, organic
chemistry, and polymer physics which require

114
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,470
detailed chemical analysis at a submicron
scale but mapped over macroscopic areas.

115
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,700
Although traditional methods such as infrared
spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance

116
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,329
can differentiate chemical species (by observing
subtle differences in bond strengths caused

117
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:20,940
by the local chemical environment), their
spatial resolution is limited to the millimetre-scale.

118
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:29,500
STXM is a technique for spatially mapping
with submicron resolution the chemical contents

119
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,820
of organic samples.

120
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,339
This is particularly important for experiments
performed within the energy range defined

121
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:44,120
by the so-called ‘water window’, which
lies between the K-edge of carbon at 284 eV

122
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:50,870
and 543 eV, the K-edge of oxygen.

123
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,500
In this energy range, biological and in-vivo
specimens absorb approximately an order of

124
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,010
magnitude more strongly than water and can
therefore reside in an aqueous environment

125
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:09,750
and need not be stained with heavy metals
or sliced (both of which are common procedures

126
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,540
in the preparation of organic specimens in
transmission electron microscopy).

127
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,360
Note also that the L-edges of several biologically
relevant elements, in particular potassium,

128
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,029
sulfur, and calcium, lie within the water
window, while phosphorus’s L1-edge is sometimes

129
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:35,079
also accessible at 189 eV.

130
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:42,330
STXM is frequently used to characterize polymer
films, because of the very rich and informative

131
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:46,930
C 1s XANES spectra of polymers.

132
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,920
Examples of XANES spectra for three common
polymers are shown here.

133
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,800
Note that the aromatic polymer PEEK and the
unsaturated polymer neoprene, both of which

134
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,120
contain pi orbitals, contain sharp pre-edge
carbon peaks associated with the lowest unoccupied

135
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:11,940
pi* orbital, while the saturated polymer polythene
contains signal associated only with sigma

136
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,340
bonding.

137
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:20,260
Such differences when scanned across polymer
films provides important information on the

138
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,260
polymerisation process and degree of inhomogeneity.

139
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:34,010
Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is
a technique that images the spatial distribution

140
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:41,199
of electrons emitted from a sample due to
x-ray absorption in the XANES region.

141
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,769
Although the technique uses photoelectrons
for its signal, it is not an electron-spectroscopy

142
00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:49,510
technique.

143
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,230
Photoelectron spectroscopy detects photoelectrons
from the near-surface region that have not

144
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,100
been inelastically scattered.

145
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,800
In contrast, in PEEM the energies of the electrons
are not distinguished.

146
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,940
Instead, the absorption coefficient is indirectly
measured via the yield of secondary electrons,

147
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,890
that is, those electrons released by the system
after multiple scattering events in a cascade

148
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:29,900
process originating with the directly produced
photoelectron from the absorbing atom . This

149
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,180
initial photoelectron may derive from an atom
relatively deep in the material, as the x-rays

150
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,180
can penetrate to depths of several tens of
nanometres.

151
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:52,320
The initial photoelectron can only travel
a few Angstroms, however, before interacting

152
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,360
inelastically with its surroundings via one
of several scattering phenomena, which produces

153
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,980
a cascade of ‘daughter’ electrons with
ever decreasing energy.

154
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,360
As the electrons’ kinetic energy approaches
only a few eV, the mean free path increases

155
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,880
rapidly and they can escape the surface with
higher probability – a typical graph of

156
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:23,680
yield versus energy shows a maximum just above
the work function, which then drops off with

157
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,680
energy.

158
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:32,890
The majority of emitted secondary electrons
therefore have energies of the order of an

159
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,160
electronvolt.

160
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,980
Although their detection does not yield absolute
results for the absorption coefficient, the

161
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:47,420
spectral dependence is adequately reflected.

162
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,250
This secondary-electron signal is collected
using electron optics similar to those used

163
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,910
in electron microscopy

164
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:02,029
A PEEM experiment essentially consists of
tuning synchrotron radiation illuminating

165
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:09,429
an entire sample in vacuum and imaging the
spatial variation of the subsequent secondary-electron

166
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:15,049
yield using the electrostatic and/or electromagnet
lens system.

167
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:22,880
As such, PEEM is a form of ‘spectromicroscopy’
– full-field images are recorded at different

168
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:33,440
photon energies, in contrast to STXM, a microspectroscopy
technique in which the focussed x-ray beam

169
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:41,820
is rastered across the sample.

170
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,690
The secondary electrons are imaged using a
2-D detector.

171
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:51,169
In contrast to scanning electron microscopy,
PEEM does not use a scanned probe electron

172
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:56,190
beam, but instead the sample surface is uniformly
illuminated by the x-rays.

173
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:04,590
The magnified image of the surface can therefore
be observed directly and in real-time - stroboscopic

174
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,860
time-resolved experiments can therefore be
performed using the time structure of the

175
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,299
synchrotron down to time scales well below
a nanosecond.

176
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:22,960
Because the IMFP of the secondary electrons
is of the order of several nanometers or more,

177
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,270
PEEM is in general not surface sensitive,
although this can be induced by irradiating

178
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,370
the sample with x-rays at very glancing angles
theta, thereby reducing their penetration

179
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:40,570
depth below the sample surface by a factor
sin theta.

180
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:48,059
The best resolution of PEEM lies around 25
nm, and depends on the acceleration high voltage

181
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:56,919
of the objective lens and how close this is
to the sample.

182
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,340
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism and x-ray
magnetic linear dichroism are two variants

183
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:10,990
of PEEM commonly used to investigate domain
formation in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets,

184
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:16,500
respectively, by detecting differences in
their absorption spectra according to the

185
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,910
type and orientation of the polarisation of
the incident x-rays.

186
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:31,640
XMCD functions because magnetic materials
have an imbalance of electrons with spin up

187
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,420
and spin down in the valence band.

188
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:43,559
So, for example, the transition from a 2p
core level to the unoccupied states 3d band

189
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:51,580
via absorption of an x-ray photon will contain
two components, one from the 2p1/2, the other

190
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:55,990
from the 2p3/2.

191
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:05,800
These are allowed, as the change in orbital
angular momentum, Delta l = 1.

192
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:12,850
One must take a further selection rule into
account which states that for dipole transitions,

193
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,340
spin flips are forbidden.

194
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,940
This rule is not entirely strict for condensed
matter, but is sufficiently observed to induce

195
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,390
dichroism.

196
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:31,280
To obtain the XMC signal, one uses circularly
polarized light.

197
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,590
in the case of domain 1, an incident RCP photon
has its orbital angular momentum pointing

198
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:46,850
forwards (in the direction of propagation,
and will preferentially excite the 2p3/2 (or

199
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,100
L3) levels over the 2p1/2 (or L2) levels.

200
00:20:52,100 --> 00:21:00,820
The opposite case arises for LCP photons,
whereby the 2p1/2 states are favoured.

201
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,900
If we now focus on region 2, the whole story
reverses, as now the spin-down 3d-subband

202
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,299
is shifted to higher energies than the spin-up
subband.

203
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:23,100
By recording PEEM images of ferromagnetic
domains with RCP and LCP x-rays and dividing

204
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,929
the intensities of one image, pixel-for-pixel,
by those of the other, the domain structure

205
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:37,350
is revealed with maximum contrast.An example
is given here for magnetic structures fabricated

206
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,549
from thin films of Ni-Fe.

207
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:47,960
The pyramid-looking contrast indicates the
formation of a closed loop of magnetic domains,

208
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,419
a mimimum-energy configuration.

209
00:21:53,419 --> 00:22:00,600
X-ray magnetic linear dichroism probes the
domain structure of antiferromagnetic (AFM)

210
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,760
materials, which are characterized by having
antiparallel orientations of neighbouring

211
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:16,880
magnetic moments and thus no net spin, but
nevertheless a defined magnetic axis below

212
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:24,950
a critical temperature (the Neel temperature),
as shown here for nickel oxide.

213
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:32,620
XMLD signal arises from the fact that, due
to spin-orbit coupling, the spatial distribution

214
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:38,871
of the electron density is marginally distorted,
providing the necessary dichroism depending

215
00:22:38,871 --> 00:22:46,110
on whether the linear polarization vector
is parallel to or perpendicular to the magnetic

216
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,990
axis.

217
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:56,540
The effect is usually small and detecting
XMLD is more challenging than XMCD.

218
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:02,330
It has a cos^2 theta dependence, where theta
is the angle between the polarization vector

219
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,000
of the x-ray light and the magnetic axis of
the domain.

220
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,130
The maximum XMLD effect therefore occurs when
the signal for the polarization parallel to

221
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:22,660
the magnetic axis is compared to that perpendicular
to the axis.

222
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,150
We now move on and up in energy to EXAFS techniques.

223
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:34,330
Extended x-ray absorption fine structure begins
approximately 50 eV above the absorption edge

224
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:44,120
and consists of oscillations in the absorption
up to as far as a keV above the edge.

225
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,190
If we remember our equation for the de Broglie
wavelength, we see that EXAFS probes electrons

226
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:57,909
with wavelengths of the order of 0.4 to 1.5
Angstroms, similar to if slightly smaller

227
00:23:57,909 --> 00:24:01,190
than interatomic distances.

228
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,660
The mean-free path of electrons in this range
is short, of the order of a few Angstroms,

229
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:13,029
hence EXAFS only probes the immediate neighbourhood
of the absorbing atom.

230
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:19,840
EXAFS is therefore an important technique
in noncrystalline solids and liquids, as it

231
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,480
yields information of the short-range structure.

232
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:32,059
It is much used for investigating liquids,
clusters, biological materials, low-concentration

233
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:39,470
impurities down to 10 parts per million, and
catalysts, although it can also be used for

234
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:47,679
well-ordered structures, and is thus complementary
to diffraction.

235
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:53,820
EXAFS is caused by single backscattering events
by nearest-neighbour atoms of the outgoing

236
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,590
photoelectron produced through x-ray absorption.

237
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:05,179
The scattered waves interfere with the original
photoelectron wave, which results in a change

238
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:13,090
in the electron density at the absorbing atom
and consequently leads to a modulation of

239
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:21,460
the absorption strength mu(E) as the photon
energy is scanned.

240
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,020
The most important parameters in addition
to the atomic absorption coefficient mu are

241
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:34,960
the electron wavelength lambda_e, the number
and type of nearest neighbours, and the distance

242
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:45,150
R between the absorbing atom and neighbouring
atoms, as shown schematically here.

243
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:52,110
The EXAFS oscillatory signal increases with
the number of neighbours in a given shell;

244
00:25:52,110 --> 00:26:01,240
while the oscillation period dilates with
decreasing shell radius.

245
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,890
Consider first the absorption coefficient
of an isolated atom, μ0(k), which varies

246
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:15,040
monotonically and smoothly with wavevector
(or energy) above the absorption edge.

247
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:21,450
In condensed matter, however, the absorption
coefficient μ(k) is modulated by the so-called

248
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:34,650
EXAFS function χ(k) because of interference
with backscattered waves, and so mu(k) = mu_0(k)

249
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:45,409
times (1+chi(k)), which we can rearrange to
obtain chi(k) - mu(k) - mu_0(k) divided by

250
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:47,539
mu_0(k).

251
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:55,230
Chi(k) is therefore an expression of the effect
on an isolated atom’s absorption characteristics

252
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,380
caused by it no longer being isolated.

253
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:07,529
More precisely, the effect of a given shell
j is the sum of the N_j atoms in that shell,

254
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:12,850
assuming their contributions are isotropic.

255
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:21,910
An illustrative example of the effect of neighbouring
atoms is shown on the right for the K-edge

256
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:41,990
of krypton in its gas, liquid, and crystalline
solid phase.

257
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:49,960
We now present the standard expression used
for χiso(k) and then justify its content.

258
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,390
The EXAFS equation is shown here.

259
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,460
Although this might seem at first intimidatingly
complex, we can break to down into individual

260
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,690
components as follows.

261
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:14,120
First, the summation is over j shells - as
the EXAFS electrons only have short mean-free

262
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:24,960
paths, we need not consider any shell radii
much larger than this, that is, a few Angstroms.

263
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:37,350
Each shell contains N_j backscattering atoms.

264
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,149
while the scattering amplitude of these atoms
is expressed through the term t_j(k).

265
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:55,390
The 

266
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:01,809
heart of the EXAFS equation is given the sinusoidal
term expressing the interference between the

267
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:09,640
outgoing and backscattered electron waves
- it is this part which, through Fourier analysis,

268
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:18,289
yields the interatomic distances.

269
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:26,190
The 1/R_j^2 is simply the inverse square law
of a spherically expanding signal, and should

270
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:34,630
be self-explanatory - the further out the
scattered atom at a distance R_j, the weaker

271
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:42,659
is the backscattered wave at the initially
absorbing atom.

272
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:48,679
The Gaussian term here accounts for the fact
that the neighbouring atoms are not stationary,

273
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,809
but vibrating with an amplitude sigma_j parallel
to k.

274
00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:01,070
This is the well-known Debye-Waller factor,
and is normally only marginally below unity

275
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:10,280
for samples at room temperature.

276
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:22,720
Lastly, the exponential term accounts for
inelastic and multiple scattering of the electron

277
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:30,020
wave (mainly by plasmons and phonons) on its
round trip of 2Rj, where Λ is the electron’s

278
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,700
mean-free path length.

279
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:43,059
The entire equation is shown again here with
the visual prompts, for completeness.

280
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:47,559
Data analysis of EXAFS spectra proceeds as
follows.

281
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:55,450
The oscillatory function chi(k) is extracted
from the raw data mu(E) by removal of the

282
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:02,279
background signal fitted to the pre-edge signal
and then the monotonically varying signal

283
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,970
mu_0(E) above the absorption edge.

284
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,980
The EXAFS function is then re-expressed as
a function of k instead of E_e and weighted

285
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:26,779
to enhance the weak oscillations at higher
k by multiplication of chi(k) by k^2 or k^3.

286
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:31,570
This function is then Fourier transformed,
which converts the data from being expressed

287
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,320
in terms of frequencies (proportional to k)
to a plot which reveals characteristic lengths,

288
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:46,890
associated with the interatomic distances
R_j.

289
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:53,130
EXAFS is a useful technique to observe chemical
changes, particularly in poorly crystalline

290
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,500
or entirely noncrystalline materials.

291
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:03,200
Two methods in particular are used.

292
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,769
In quick-EXAFS, or QEXAFS, monochromatic tuning
of bending-magnet or wiggler radiation is

293
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:15,799
achieved using a channel-cut monochromator.

294
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:21,220
***** These sources and this type of monochromator
is used in order to achieve the highest speeds

295
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,320
- the sources are broadband and so do not
require variation of the gap size associated

296
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,460
with undulator photon-energy tuning, which
would slow things down significantly; the

297
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:39,490
channel-cut mono is used, as it requires the
rotation of a single motor, again thereby

298
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:46,690
avoiding the need to mechanically change synchronously
several components, as would be the case in

299
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:49,480
a double-crystal monochromator.

300
00:32:49,480 --> 00:33:00,559
In energy-dispersive x-ray absorption spectroscopy,
or EDXAS, a divergent white x-ray beam impinges

301
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:07,330
on a bent crystal or grating sitting on an
ellipse defined by its foci being at the source

302
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:10,049
and the sample.

303
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:15,440
This selects different wavelengths from the
white beam, depending on the angle the divergent

304
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,840
beam hits the bent crystal.

305
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,179
This dispersed radiation is focussed by the
bent crystal on to the sample, and the transmitted

306
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:31,390
signal is detected using a one- or two dimensional
detector.

307
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,450
There are no moving parts in EDXAS, hence
very rapid changes can be monitored.

308
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:43,730
The disadvantages of EDXAS are that even very
small distortions of the polychromator crystal

309
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:50,299
due to thermal drifts or other effects will
cause the dispersed signal to drift spatially.

310
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:57,080
This sets exceedingly stringent specifications
in EDXAS for mechanical and thermal stability.

311
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:05,010
EDXAS is also often used for studies at extreme
conditions of pressure using diamond-anvil

312
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,129
cells, which have small volumes and limited
acceptance angles.

313
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:16,089
A limitation of EDXAS is that it assumes that
the sample is homogeneous across the focussed

314
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:17,919
spot.

315
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:26,000
If this condition is not met, artefacts will
arise in the recorded spectra.

316
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,870
This completes our discussion of absorption
spectroscopies.

317
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,119
In the third and last video of the week, we
consider spectroscopies that probe products

318
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,639
of absorption, namely fluorescence photons
and photoelectrons.
