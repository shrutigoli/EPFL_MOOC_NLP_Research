00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,270
Welcome to the the second video of Week 5
of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,110
and x-ray free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:19,380
In this video, we will familiarise ourselves
with monochromators and the handling of harmonic

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,000
signal.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,500
What are monochromators and why do we need
them?

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,640
Monochromator, often called “monos” for
short select a certain bandwidth, or set of

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,780
bandwidths, of frequencies from synchrotron-radiation
sources.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,830
Bending magnets and wigglers provide very
broadband radiation, and for the large majority

9
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:48,390
of experiments, only a small fraction of this
in the form of a narrow range of energies,

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,379
is used.

11
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:57,960
Even the bandwidths of undulator spectral
peaks as they emerge is more often than not

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,129
insufficient for many types of experiments
and require further monochromatization.

13
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:11,240
For example, x-ray absorption spectra contain
subtle features that can provide invaluable

14
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,530
chemical and orientational information.

15
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:22,220
The pre-peak in the XANES spectrum of copper
at its K-absorption edge, highlighted here

16
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,220
with an asterisk, provides information on
the oxidation state.

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:37,450
The width of this peak is approximately 1.7
eV, in other words, approximately one five

18
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,900
hundredth of its energy.

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,619
In order to resolve such features, the spectral
bandwidth Delta nu/nu must be better than

20
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,000
this.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,850
On the right a typical macromolecular diffraction
pattern is shown.

22
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:04,829
If we blow up a portion of this we see that
diffraction spots are only very slightly angularly

23
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,090
separated, and would overlap if the degree
of monochromacity were an order of magnitude

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,060
worse.

25
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,111
Depending on the photon-energy range of the
beamline and the demands for flux, different

26
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,920
monochromator types are used.

27
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,670
Soft x-ray beamlines use gratings, while most
hard x-ray beamlines employ monos based on

28
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,200
crystal diffraction.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,110
The tender x-ray regime is also mostly served
by crystal monos, though can use so-called

30
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,590
multilayer monochromators as well.

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,989
Multilayer monos are also employed fairly
extensively in the medium hard x-ray regime

32
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,530
as a means to obtain more flux through their
intrinsically larger bandwidths.

33
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:06,989
A selection of different but representative
monochromator types from synchrotrons around

34
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:16,650
the world is shown here as a function of photon
energy and periodic spacing, d.

35
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,349
One sees immediately the strong correlation
between photon energy and d-spacing.

36
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:29,120
This should come as no surprise - a high photon
energy is associated with short wavelengths,

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,880
for which one needs a diffraction element
of similar periodic dimensions.

38
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,190
How do grating and crystal monochromator differ
from each other?

39
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,659
Gratings can come in various flavours regarding
their groove profiles, of which three examples

40
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,530
are shown here.

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:56,790
Gratings are typically fabricated via advanced
lithographic and etching techniques on glass

42
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,470
substrates.

43
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,620
Scattering off grating features leads, at
certain angles, to constructive interference

44
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:14,540
when the difference in the optical path difference
, d(sin theta_i - sin theta_r) is equal to

45
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,250
an integer number of wavelengths.

46
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,490
As we saw in the previous slide, typical grating
periodicities are anywhere between a couple

47
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,410
of hundred nanometers to a few microns.

48
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:37,030
In the case of a crystal, for which d is a
few Angstroms, interference of hard x-rays

49
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:45,120
is between successive layers of atomic planes
perpendicular to the scattering vector , which

50
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,669
therefore follows the famous Bragg law .

51
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,810
How is the performance of grating monochromators
affected by the number of illuminated facets

52
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,910
N_f.

53
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,970
To understand this better, we resort to the
use of Argand diagrams again.

54
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,070
We assume that illumination of each facet
is the same, and that therefore the scattering

55
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:17,120
amplitude is the same.

56
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,810
How these scattered wavelets add up depends
on their relative phase, in other words, how

57
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,250
they interfere with each other.

58
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,910
Let us consider first the case of illumination
of four facets.

59
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,540
If the optical path difference between scattering
off adjacent facets is an integer multiple

60
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,150
of wavelengths, the phase difference will
be an integer multiple of 2 pi, and the scattering

61
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,820
amplitudes will all add up in one direction
to produce a total amplitude four times the

62
00:05:50,820 --> 00:06:01,639
length of the individual scattering amplitude
from one facet . Now let us change the incident

63
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:09,030
and/or exit angle so that the phase difference
between adjacent facets is pi/12, or 15 degrees.

64
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:16,740
The vector addition of the four contribution
will begin to curl round on itself and the

65
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:30,150
total amplitude will decrease . 
We see this is still more pronounced for a

66
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:42,639
phase difference of pi/6, or 30 degrees . Indeed,
at a phase difference of 90 degrees (pi/2),

67
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,260
the vectors will form four sides of a square,
and cancel each other out entirely, shown

68
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:58,360
here . 
At pi and 3pi/2, the same complete destructive

69
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:09,240
interference will occur, until after a shift
in phase of 2 pi, a maximum is again reached.

70
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,310
Using the same arguments, a similar situation
arises when 8 facets are illuminated.

71
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,949
But now, for a given phase difference, the
degree of destructive interference increases

72
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:31,920
more rapidly as one moves away from a phase
difference of 2 pi, as more individual scattering

73
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,990
amplitudes are involved and the vector addition
curls round on itself more - the position

74
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,940
and size of the total amplitude as a function
of phase difference between 0 and 2 pi is

75
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,830
shown in the animation in the centre for 8
facets.

76
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:57,349
The result is that the condition for constructive
interference becomes stricter and consequently

77
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:02,500
the interference maxima become narrower.

78
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:10,370
Indeed it can be shown that the relative bandwidth
lambda/Delta lambda is directly proportional

79
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,520
to the number of illuminated facets, N_f.

80
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,879
In modern soft-x-ray monochromators, N_f can
easily be several thousand and bandwidths

81
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:29,870
comparable and often superior to those demonstrated
by crystals such as silicon, can be achieved.

82
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:39,870
As was briefly mentioned in the first video
of this week, it is possible to bend dispersive

83
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:48,360
elements in order to simultaneously disperse
the radiation (monochromatize) and to focus

84
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,620
it.

85
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,510
In spherical-grating monochromator (SGMs)
the grating surface has a concave spherical

86
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,190
form with a radius R_b.

87
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:09,690
The grating grooves, or lines, are perpendicular
to the so-called Rowland circle, which lies

88
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:18,760
tangential to the centre of the grating and
has a radius R_R half that of the spherical

89
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,330
grating.

90
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,680
Any source lying somewhere on the Rowland
circle will select a certain wavelength and

91
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:32,940
refocus it at another position on the Rowland
circle.

92
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:44,260
Different energies can be selected by moving
the source around the Rowland circle.

93
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,560
Crystal monochromators use single crystals
to select a given energy using Bragg diffraction.

94
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,839
The most common crystal material is silicon.

95
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,529
Silicon has a reasonable thermal conductivity,
and can be efficiently cooled by liquid nitrogen,

96
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:05,280
in order to minimize the mechanical strain
induced by a local thermal ‘bump’, where

97
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,880
the incoming, polychromatic, beam impinges
on the crystal surface.

98
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:17,000
Importantly, Si can be produced as a near-perfect
single crystal with linear dimensions up to

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,410
tens of centimetres, thanks to its ubiquitous
use in the semiconductor industry, where large

100
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,560
and exceedingly perfect wafers are produced
en masse.

101
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,980
The most common crystallographic orientation
is the (111).

102
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:40,730
Bragg’s law predicts that if one were to
have a perfect, non-absorbing and very weakly

103
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:46,500
scattering crystal of infinite depth, and
a perfectly collimated incoming polychromatic

104
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,260
beam, the bandwidth of the selected radiation
would be infinitely narrow.

105
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:59,290
However, there is always some residual beam
divergence, slightly misaligned crystallites

106
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,829
making up the (imperfect) single crystal (this
is referred to as the ‘mosaicity’), and

107
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,810
finite absorption and extinction depths.

108
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,200
These all contribute to a given crystal always
selecting a bandwidth Delta lambda greater

109
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,839
than zero.

110
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,589
In the case of silicon, the contribution that
normally dominates is due to the finite extinction

111
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:31,300
depth, resulting in a so-called “Darwin
width” of the Bragg reflection, which results

112
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,990
in a relative spectral bandwidth a little
larger than 10^-4.

113
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:46,620
Hence 1-Angstrom radiation, with an energy
of 12.398 keV, has a minimum bandwidth of

114
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,850
approximately 1.7 eV.

115
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:00,430
Note that the corresponding width in theta,
the Bragg angle is Delta lambda/lambda x tan

116
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,060
theta, and thus the crystal also accepts a
fine angular range, of the order of a thousandth

117
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,130
of a degree.

118
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:20,649
This leads us to the concept of dispersive
or nondispersive configurations in monochromator.

119
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:26,410
We have already argued that the incoming radiation
is polychromatic and divergent to a certain

120
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:33,550
degree, and that the crystal thus selects
a band of wavelengths from this incoming beam.

121
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,240
We would therefore expect a range of photon
energies to be reflected off the crystal,

122
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,120
the lower-energy photons being selected at
steeper angles, and those with higher-energy

123
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:52,610
at shallower angles, according to Bragg’s
law.

124
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,240
These will be reflected specularly with respect
to the diffracting planes . If we now place

125
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:07,490
an identical crystal in the path of the reflected
rays, we can adjust its orientation so that

126
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,010
all of those wavelengths selected by the first
crystal are preserved after reflection of

127
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,019
the second crystal.

128
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:28,920
This is a nondispersive configuration.

129
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,000
Now let us consider an alternative setup.

130
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,230
We concentrate to begin with on the central
energy, shown here in green . In the previous

131
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,579
slide, this was intercepted by the second
crystal and reflected back parallel to its

132
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:52,420
initial direction . But we could also reflect
the beam in the opposite sense, shown here

133
00:13:52,420 --> 00:14:02,730
.
Now, what about the other energies?

134
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,750
In this new setup, these no longer impinge
on the surface of the second crystal at the

135
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:18,080
same angle as on the first crystal , and as
a result, they will be lost or strongly attenuated

136
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:26,519
. This is a dispersive setup, as a narrower
range of wavelengths is selected by the second

137
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:29,720
crystal than by the first.

138
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,220
This configuration is therefore more monochromatic,
but at the cost of flux.

139
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,730
A similar effect can be achieved by using
a different crystal type or crystal orientation

140
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,839
for the second element.

141
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,199
This is succinctly explained using so-called
“Du-Mond” diagrams, for which I direct

142
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,260
you to the reference given here.

143
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,690
There are different types of crystal monos.

144
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:08,660
A common configuration is the double-crystal
monochromator, using two identical crystals

145
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,459
in the nondisperive mode.

146
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:18,820
This not only provides greater flux, but also
allows the beam to emerge from the mono parallel

147
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,899
to the incident beam.

148
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,050
If the offset in the monochromatized beam
is to remain constant for all photon energies,

149
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,560
not only do both crystals have to rotate to
the Bragg angle, but also one of them (in

150
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:40,209
this figure, the second) must be translated
along the beam axis.

151
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:48,420
Channel-cut monos are fabricated using just
one single crystal which has had a central

152
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,200
channel milled out.

153
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:58,870
The adds simplicity and speed to changing
the photon energy, requiring a single rotation

154
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,910
stage, a definite advantage when performing
rapid energy scans in certain types of spectroscopic

155
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,579
experiments where physical and/or chemical
changes are to be followed rapidly, with as

156
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:16,649
many as 40 energy scans per second in modern
beamlines.

157
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:22,560
The disadvantage is that the exit beam’s
height will change as the CCM is rotated,

158
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:29,900
though this can be made to be minimal by making
the channel width D to be as small as possible,

159
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:35,639
and scanning over a not too large range of
photon energies (which in turn determines

160
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,200
the angular range of theta).

161
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:47,450
Lastly, the problem of a varying exit-beam
height can be overcome by using a four-bounce

162
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:53,620
configuration, shown here on the right.

163
00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:03,209
Here, the disadvantage is that this is a dispersive
setup, associated with a certain loss in flux.

164
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:09,709
Finally, we discuss multilayer monochromators.

165
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:15,880
Crystals diffract x-rays through scattering
of planes of atoms - it is a 3-dimensional

166
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,699
system, exploiting the periodicity in the
direction parallel to the scattering vector.

167
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:29,660
In the case of multilayers, scattering is
produced by a contrast in electron density

168
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:37,750
at the interfaces between heavy “reflection”
layers and lighter “spacer” layers.

169
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,950
The only required periodicity is in one direction.

170
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,970
Indeed, in many instances, on an atomic level,
the materials which make up the reflection

171
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:57,700
and spacer layers may be amorphous, with no
periodicity at this spatial scale of Angstroms.

172
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,910
What motivates a beamline scientist to use
a multilayer monochromator?

173
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,920
First, the reflectivity can be very high.

174
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:12,550
This, coupled with a bandwidth which may typically
be 100 times larger than that provided by

175
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:21,330
single crystals, means that the flux output
from multilayer monos can be very high.

176
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:28,010
Techniques such as x-ray computed tomography
profit from this, as in few cases does a narrow

177
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,830
bandwidth bring advantages, while rapid data
acquisition can access morphological changes

178
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,830
on the sub-second, or even the few-ms time
scale.

179
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:48,100
Lastly, we will also see that the larger periodicity
of multilayers compared to crystals by an

180
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,169
order of magnitude can lead to refraction
effects that can be exploited in suppressing

181
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:58,880
harmonic contamination.

182
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,919
There are several design parameters which
determine the performance of a multilayer

183
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,160
mono.

184
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:11,730
We have already mentioned that one requires
heavy reflecting layers made of heavy metals

185
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:20,700
such as Ru or tungsten, separated by low-Z
spacer layers made of boron, carbon, or a

186
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,460
combination of these.

187
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,250
The strength of the reflection is determined
partly by the ratio of thicknesses of the

188
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,580
thick to thin layer.

189
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,090
Too thick layers means that the x-rays cannot
penetrate deep enough into the multilayer,

190
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:42,700
while too thin layers reduces the reflected
intensity.

191
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:51,261
A common ratio of thicknesses is 0.4:0.6 heavy
to light , though this can vary, depending

192
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,170
on the applications.

193
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:01,120
The total periodicity big Lambda is typically
measured in a few nanometers, while the number

194
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,240
of layers is commonly of the order of one
hundred.

195
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,980
The total thickness of the multilayer structure
is equal to N Lambda.

196
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:18,770
Making this too large means that the x-rays
cannot penetrate to the bottom of the structure,

197
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,970
obviating any advantages.

198
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:30,730
Lastly, the layers should have atomically
smooth interfaces in order to perform properly.

199
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:36,610
The wavelengths that are selected are approximately
given by the equation shown here, that is,

200
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:44,360
small lambda, the photon wavelength = 2 times
big Lambda, the multilayer periodicity divided

201
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,280
by m, the order of the reflection, times sine
theta.

202
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:57,090
This is in essence identical to the Bragg
equation used for crystals.

203
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:06,919
An example of a multilayer installed at the
ESRF BM5 beamline is shown here.

204
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:15,030
The reflectivity at an incident angle of 1.15
degrees is shown on the right.

205
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,610
Because the reflection and spacer layers are
of equal thickness, all even harmonic reflections

206
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:28,840
are suppressed (this phenomenon is called
a systematic absence, outside the remit of

207
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,169
this course, but an important feature of crystallography).

208
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:45,720
The first harmonic is at 8.01 keV . The 3rd
harmonic, however, is not at three times this

209
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:55,669
value, 24.03 keV, as we might have expected
from our equation shown in the previous slide,

210
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:12,169
but instead at 23.27 keV, 760 eV lower . The
reason for this is, as I just mentioned, the

211
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:15,909
previous equation is an approximation.

212
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:24,750
The exact equation is shown here, where the
second, correction, term in the brackets,

213
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:32,690
K Lambda^2/m^2 accounts for refraction effects.

214
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:38,929
One might ask why this is not also employed
for the “normal” Bragg equation for crystals.

215
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,220
First, in some cases requiring the highest
accuracy, it actually is.

216
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:49,970
However, the deviations are much smaller,
and this is due to the fact that the wavelengths

217
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,080
being selected in multilayers are very much
smaller than the periodicity, resulting in

218
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,920
shallow angles and a larger refractive effect,
in other words, a larger change in angle of

219
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:10,490
the x-rays as they cross the interface between
spacer and reflecting layer.

220
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:19,540
This phenomenon means that multilayers can
be used to suppress higher harmonics.

221
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,360
This brings us to the last topic of this video,
that of harmonic suppression strategies.

222
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,870
In most experiments, we would like to suppress
integer multiples of the photon-energy of

223
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,659
interest, though because both the undulator
and the monochromator harmonics are spaced

224
00:23:37,659 --> 00:24:01,240
evenly in energy, this cannot be done by normal
monochromatization alone .

225
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,130
Although we have seen how this can be done
using a multilayer, and also, in the last

226
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:17,050
video, by one or more reflections off mirrors,
what other possibilities are there?

227
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,540
One simple approach is to use crystals which
suppress certain higher energies because the

228
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:31,309
associated reflections are forbidden, in so-called
systematic absences.

229
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:40,750
For example, for reasons of symmetry, the
reflections highlighted in red for Si(111)

230
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,990
and Si(001) crystals are all nominally forbidden.

231
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:53,210
I say “nominally”, as their complete suppression
assumes that the electron cloud surrounding

232
00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:01,669
the atoms have perfectly spherical symmetry,
which we know not to be 100% valid - for example,

233
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:07,140
the electrons associated with covalent bonding
are far from spherically distributed.

234
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:15,130
Hence, these reflections tend to be very weak,
but not ENTIRELY absent.

235
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,590
Another approach, is to slightly detune the
monochromator.

236
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:30,440
The width (the Darwin width) of each reflection
in the family m(hkl) (for example, the (111),

237
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:43,990
(222), (333), (444), reflections, etc of silicon)
is given 

238
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:55,690
by w_D = K/m^2 times F. F falls off with increasing
m, hence the Darwin width gets rapidly narrower

239
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,720
with m.

240
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:05,990
So only a moderate detuning (and modest loss
of flux) of the mono at the fundamental (m

241
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:13,980
= 1) will mean that the higher harmonics are
much more detuned.

242
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,520
Monochromators are the heart of x-ray optics.

243
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,000
This video has been devoted to their description.

244
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,679
We have now covered the generation of synchrotron
light over the previous two weeks; and its

245
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:30,580
filtering, focussing, and monochromatization
in the first two videos of this week.

246
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,580
We complete this week’s videos in the third
instalment, by discussing x-ray detectors.
