1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,840
Hello and welcome!

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
My name is Phil Willmott.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,750
I will be guiding you through the world of
x-ray science and its applications in this

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,830
introductory course “Synchrotrons and x-ray
free-electron lasers - techniques and applications”.

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,160
I am a physicist by training, but have been
exposed to many other disciplines both over

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,999
the last decade-and-a-half working at synchrotrons,
but also earlier in my academic career.

7
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:34,210
Presently, in addition to being an adjunct
professor at the University of Zurich, I am

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,860
responsible for running the Materials Science
beamline at the Swiss Light Source at the

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,420
Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,030
This course is partly based on my introductory
textbook on synchrotron radiation, which is

11
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:54,550
available through most online bookstores,
or the publisher’s website, John Wiley and

12
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,780
Sons, for those who would like to review many
of the concepts presented here at their own

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,879
leisure, using the more traditional medium
of the written page, or read deeper into aspects

14
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,150
of particular interest.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,190
In this first, introductory, week, we will
cover the following topics.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,530
After a brief description of who might be
users of synchrotron radiation (including

17
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,320
glimpses into some applications), the range
of wavelengths (or, alternatively, photon

18
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,030
energies) typically produced by synchrotron
facilities within the context of length and

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,010
energy scales in the material world will be
outlined.

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:41,810
Lastly, a short overview follows of synchrotron
and XFEL machines and what makes them so desirable.

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,650
In this video a cartoon of the generation
of synchrotron light is shown and will be

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,570
described in detail later in the course.

23
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,310
Stated simply, synchrotrons provide intense
sources of electromagnetic radiation over

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,280
large ranges of wavelengths, typically spanning
values marginally shorter than that of visible

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,200
light (i.e., beginning at approximately 100
nm in the so-called vacuum ultraviolet regime)

26
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,060
to hard x-rays with wavelengths that are one
to two orders of magnitude shorter than typical

27
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,060
chemical bond lengths.

28
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,909
This brilliant source of tunable radiation
is used in a myriad of ways to investigate

29
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,330
manifold properties of innumerable sample
types!

30
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,900
Shown here are just some recent examples spanning
disciplines as varied as art history to magnetic

31
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,900
nanostructures.

32
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,439
In this course I will use the terms “light”
and “electromagnetic radiation” interchangeably

33
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:48,300
and synonymously to cover the range of wavelengths
covered by synchrotron facilities that spans

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,760
approximately five orders of magnitude.

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,940
Who might be interested in using synchrotron
radiation?

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,689
Before about two to three decades ago, synchrotron
science was almost exclusively the province

37
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:05,069
of physicists and physical chemists.

38
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:10,599
In contrast, modern-day synchrotron users
come from all walks of scientific and academic

39
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:18,749
life, from art history, palaeontology, and
cultural ethnology, to molecular biology,

40
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:24,670
materials science, and high-tech industry,
as shown clearly in this pie chart.

41
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,189
To accommodate this growing demand, there
are now several tens of synchrotrons around

42
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:34,650
the world, of which some of the more prominent
examples are shown here in yellow; along with

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,359
the six free-electron lasers operating in
the UV or x-ray regime presently either under

44
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,709
construction or in operation, shown here in
red.

45
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,599
The impact of x-rays and synchrotron light
on society is reflected in the number of Nobel

46
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,670
prizes that have been awarded in this field.

47
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,540
Since the first Nobel prize in physics was
awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Röntgen for his

48
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,829
discovery of x-rays, 21 prizes have been awarded
for x-ray science.

49
00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:08,739
Of these, nine have been in the field of molecular
biology,

50
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:17,919
of which the four most recent (awarded in
2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012, all for chemistry)

51
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,730
used synchrotron light as a primary tool in
their investigations, a fact which I believe

52
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,510
reflects the emergence of synchrotrons in
the last two decades as one of the primary

53
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,020
reach tools in the natural sciences and beyond.

54
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,950
From this, it should be clear that synchrotron
science represents one of the premier examples

55
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,050
of interdisciplinary research.

56
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:47,590
It is my belief that this diversity of potential
applications would be further expanded if

57
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,700
(a) the power of synchrotron science were
more effectively disseminated to the wider

58
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:00,560
community; and (b) those contemplating using
synchrotron light were not so intimidated

59
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,420
by the perceived complexity of this powerful
tool.

60
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,170
One of the primary aims of this course is
to tackle both of these obstacles.

61
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:15,720
Let us return to the last of the examples
shown in the previous video – the “Nobel

62
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,850
trilogy of life”.

63
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,760
How does nature construct a living thing from
simple chemical components?

64
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,030
For example, how does a human emerge nine
months after the unique mixing of its parents’

65
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,640
genetic material contained in a single fertilized
egg?

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,870
When I was a child, these questions were only
just beginning to be answered.

67
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,880
Indeed, just five months before my own birth,
the Nobel committee announced that the 1962

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:47,780
prize for physiology or medicine would be
awarded to James Watson, Francis Crick, and

69
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:57,030
Maurice Wilkins for their elucidation of the
structure of deoxyribosenucleic acid (DNA)

70
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,030
and (quoting from the Nobel committee’s
announcement) “its significance for information

71
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,590
transfer in living material”.

72
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:12,190
It was Rosalind Franklin’s famous x-ray
“photograph 51” of DNA crystal diffraction

73
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,110
which provided the final clue to the structure.

74
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,490
Franklin would sadly die of ovarian cancer
before the Nobel prize was awarded.

75
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,290
DNA resides permanently within the nucleus
of a living cell.

76
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:29,990
How then, is its information conveyed
to the rest of the cell and elsewhere in the

77
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:36,090
organism; how is new living material subsequently
synthesized; and how do initial (“stem”)

78
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:43,050
cells differentiate into specialized cells
as diverse as ganglions, muscle cells, or

79
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,050
skin?

80
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,210
Major steps towards answering these questions
were made in research that would result in

81
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:52,870
Nobel prizes in chemistry in 2006 and 2009.

82
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,340
The first step in carrying out the commands
encoded in DNA is its transcription into so-called

83
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,680
messenger-RNA, which then leaves the confines
of the nucleus to the protein-producing parts

84
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,340
of the cell.

85
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,710
How mRNA is synthesized and carries the genetic
information with high fidelity, via a very

86
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:19,330
special macromolecule called RNA-polymerase,
was reported by Roger Kornberg and co-workers

87
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,650
in 2001, for which he received the 2006 Nobel
prize in chemistry.

88
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:32,290
The following step, that of protein synthesis,
uses the blueprint of the messenger RNA, plus

89
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:38,940
raw material in the form of amino acids attached
to small transfer-RNA (tRNA) molecules in

90
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,950
a chemical factory called the ribosome.

91
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:47,240
The detailed description of the mechanisms
by which this highly complex biomolecular

92
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,390
process occurs won Ada Yonath, Thomas Steitz,
and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan the Nobel prize

93
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,360
in chemistry in 2009.

94
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,930
This course is not about molecular biology.

95
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,340
It is, however, concerned with diverse aspects
of a tool now considered indispensible to

96
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,330
molecular biologists – synchrotron radiation.

97
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,050
The thematic link between the above works
is that of structure – atomic structure

98
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:23,740
– and its implicitly inherent importance
in determining biomolecular activity.

99
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,620
X-rays and, in recent years synchrotron radiation,
have played a central role in this enterprise.

100
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,940
The relevance of these studies goes well beyond
that of pure academic understanding – the

101
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,849
detailed description of the DNA transcription
process, as well as a knowledge of the biochemical

102
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:47,189
function of the ribosome, are already having
a huge impact on the design of novel antibiotic

103
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:53,420
substances and other drugs, plus a deeper
understanding of how some cancers arise and

104
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,500
how they might be tackled.

105
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,220
The year that Yonath, Ramakrishnan, and Steitz
were awarded their Nobel prize (2009) also

106
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:10,080
saw first light at the first hard x-ray free-electron
laser, the Linear Coherent Light Source (or

107
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,259
LCLS) at the SLAC facility in Stanford, California.

108
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,649
The first report of an entirely new biological
structure, cathepsin B, determined using the

109
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:24,560
LCLS was reported a little over three years
later.

110
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,290
XFELs provide x-ray beams with unique properties
regarding pulse duration, peak pulse intensity,

111
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,120
and beam cross-section.

112
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,259
Using a technique coined “diffraction-before-destruction”,
crystals with sizes orders of magnitude smaller

113
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:44,129
in volume than hitherto possible can now be
investigated.

114
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:48,970
The application of this technique at XFELs
represents a new paradigm shift in this field

115
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,709
of research, and is indicative of how x-ray
science continues to develop unabated over

116
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,440
100 years since its inception.

117
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,410
Almost immediately since their discovery at
the end of the 19th century, x-rays have played

118
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,790
a central scientific and technological role
in society.

119
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,020
Barely two weeks after their discovery, Dr
Otto Walkhoff of Braunschweig undertook the

120
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,209
first dental radiograms of his own jaw.

121
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,880
The first exposure was for 25 minutes and
resulted in a very blurred image, due mainly

122
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,100
to the fanlike nature and large size of the
source of x-rays.

123
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,459
Modern radiograms expose the patient for durations
typically well under a second and can distinguish

124
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:34,809
features well under a millimeter in size.

125
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:41,079
Radiography is today one of the primary diagnostic
tools available to medicine and dentistry.

126
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:45,939
Other common uses of x-rays are in security,
such as at airports (we are all familiar with

127
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:51,189
this, sometimes frustratingly!!); in the aeronautical
industry to investigate fatigue and weathering

128
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:56,689
of components such as turbine blades; and
in the pharmaceutical industry, to characterize

129
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:03,199
drugs for their atomic structure, functionality,
and purity.

130
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:05,680
So why are x-rays so used?

131
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,509
We discuss this in the next video.
