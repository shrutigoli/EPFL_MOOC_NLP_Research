00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,940
Welcome to the first video of Week 4 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,210
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,590
This week covers more details about machine
physics, that is, the generation of synchrotron

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,929
radiation by storage rings.

5
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:27,929
We begin by discussing properties of the x-rays
generated at synchrotrons, then progress in

6
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:34,960
the second video than overview of the magnet
lattice and insertion devices.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,070
In the third and last video of Week 4, we
will familiarise ourselves with the latest

8
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,580
tools to be developed for x-ray science, namely
diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs)

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,530
and x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs).

10
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:59,080
So, let’s begin with a detailed description
of some of the most important properties of

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:06,220
x-radiation, namely the flux, the emittance,
the combination of these, called the brilliance,

12
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,650
and lastly, coherence.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,750
As we have already highlighted qualitatively
earlier in this course, for most experiments

14
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:22,609
using x-rays, we would like the beam to be
intense, parallel, have as much as possible

15
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:29,350
a single wavelength, and originate from a
small source.

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,929
The flux associated with an x-ray source is
simply the number of photons it emits for

17
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:41,220
a standardised relative spectral bandwidth,
delta E/E, where delta E is a range of energies

18
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,299
around a central energy E. This expression,
incidentally, can be equivalently expressed

19
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,520
in terms of the wavelength, that is delta
lambda/lambda, or in terms of the frequency

20
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:03,479
delta nu/nu (or indeed the angular frequency,
delta omega/omega).

21
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,010
The brilliance is simply the flux divided
by the source size in units of area, and also

22
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:17,689
by the divergence in the two orthogonal planes
perpendicular to the beam axis, given in units

23
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,459
of angle-squared.

24
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,760
Conventionally for synchrotrons, the beam
propagates along the positive z-direction,

25
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,390
while the x-axis lies in the plane of the
synchrotron ring and the y-axis is perpendicular

26
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,530
to both x and z.

27
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,650
As we will see, the product of these two properties,
that is, the source size and divergence, is

28
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,489
known as the emittance.

29
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:51,290
The brilliance is therefore simply the flux
divided by the emittance.

30
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:55,840
We now look at these different properties
of x-rays more quantitatively, beginning with

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,140
the flux.

32
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,099
By convention, the flux is defined as the
number of photons emitted per second within

33
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:12,480
a 0.1% bandwidth around the central energy
(or frequency, or wavelength).

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,400
This concept can be at first confusing for
nonspectroscopists, so let us consider an

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,099
example, involving a so-called silicon monochromator,
one of the most commonly used devices at synchrotrons.

36
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:36,550
In general, the spectra emitted by synchrotron
sources are far from being monochromatic - as

37
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,480
we shall see later this week, bending magnet
radiation is very broad, while even that for

38
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,050
the generally most desired sources called
undulators, consists of spectral peaks regularly

39
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,430
spaced in energy, each peak itself having
a width that is more often than not too broad

40
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,769
to be used without further monochromatization.

41
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:05,920
Monochromators are therefore used at beamlines
to clean up the spectra so that only a very

42
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,290
narrow range of photon energies get through
to the experiment.

43
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,459
Perhaps the most common of these is the silicon
monochromator.

44
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,180
It need not concern us for the present how
these instruments work (it is by diffraction,

45
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,410
but we’ll get to that next week).

46
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:31,720
Let us consider my own beamline, the Materials
Science beamline at the Swiss Light Source.

47
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,750
After monochromatization, we have measured,
for example, an average power output of 34

48
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:46,610
mW at a nominal photon energy of 7 keV.

49
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:58,600
The energy of each photon is easy to calculate
and is equal to 7000 eV x 1.6 x 10^-19 J/eV

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
= 1.12 fJ.

51
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:12,509
The number of photons/s is therefore 34 mW
divided by the photon energy = 3 x 10^13 ph/s.

52
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:21,590
Now, in order to determine the flux, as defined
above as the number of photons/0.1% bandwidth,

53
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,570
we need to know what the bandwidth of photons
is that a Si monochromator allows through.

54
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:34,870
It turns out that this is a constant, equal
to 1.4 x 10^-4.

55
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,460
Now this is SMALLER than 0.1% by a factor
of 0.14.

56
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,470
The flux is therefore equal to the number
of delivered photons DIVIDED by 0.14, as the

57
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:53,940
silicon monochromator has a narrower b bandwidth
that that defined for flux, and is therefore

58
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:03,819
equal to 2.17 x 10^14 ph/s/0.1%BW.

59
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:06,690
Now let us move on to the property of emittance.

60
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,490
In the two orthonormal directions to z, the
emittance is the product of the standard deviation

61
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,320
in source size and the standard deviation
in divergence.

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:26,160
In order to keep consistent bookkeeping, the
definition of standard deviation sigma is

63
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,570
shown here.

64
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,169
Briefly, sigma (or sigma’ in the case of
divergence) is defined as shown here for a

65
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:41,030
beam with Gaussian profile, a fair approximation
for synchrotron light.

66
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:50,729
The width 2 sigma is a little smaller than
the full-width at half maximum by the factor

67
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,539
sqrt(8 ln 2), or 2.355.

68
00:06:53,539 --> 00:07:03,510
Now the emittance actually has two sources;
one due to the electron source size and angular

69
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,710
distribution, and the other from the photons,
in other words, that associated with synchrotron

70
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:12,530
radiation emission.

71
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:19,069
In general, the electron emittance, in particular
in the horizontal plane (i.e., the x-direction),

72
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:20,479
tends to dominate.

73
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,139
Because the sources are independent of each
other, their contributions add orthogonally,

74
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,479
as given by the equations shown here.

75
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,319
The photon emittance has a lower limit known
as the diffraction limit equal to lambda/4

76
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,699
pi, and is a consequence of Heisenberg’s
uncertainty principle.

77
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:53,659
For example, this is equal to 8 pm.rad for
1-Angstrom radiation.

78
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,270
On the other hand, the electron emittance
can be substantially larger, especially in

79
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:04,729
the x-direction, as it is in this direction
that the Lorentz forces from magnets in general

80
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:06,479
act.

81
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,660
This will increase both the electrons’ effective
source size and the divergence.

82
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,180
One of the aims of machine physicists in the
last decade and a half has been to minimise

83
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,120
any residual horizontal magnetic fields in
the plane of the electrons’ orbit caused

84
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,069
by imperfect magnet alignment, which would
couple part of the horizontal emittance to

85
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,800
the vertical emittance, blowing this up as
well.

86
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,039
Several facilities can now say that the magnet
alignment has been so perfectly tuned that

87
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,820
the vertical total emittance is essentially
equal to the theoretical minimum.

88
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,540
As we shall discuss in the last video of this
week, the improved performance promised by

89
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,110
diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs)
in the near future is based on efforts to

90
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:04,100
minimise also the electron emittance in the
HORIZONTAL plane and increase the brilliance

91
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,339
accordingly.

92
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,670
So a given storage-ring facility will have
a certain electron emittance, which is preserved

93
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,850
along the entirety of the ring.

94
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,920
The lower limits to this are determined by
several factors, and we will touch on these

95
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,570
later when discussing DLSRs.

96
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,880
For the moment, we should consider the following.

97
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,510
If a storage ring has a given emittance, how
can this be “expressed”?

98
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,370
As the emittance is the product of the source
size and divergence, we can either sacrifice

99
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,420
source size for a very parallel beam, or vice
versa, squeezing the source size to be as

100
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,490
small as possible, and accepting a larger
divergence.

101
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,440
Or, indeed, any combination between these
two extremes.

102
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,730
These are referred to as having a high beta,
or low beta, respectively.

103
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:07,040
The question is now, what to do when?

104
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,130
The so-called beta function is simply the
source size divided by the divergence.

105
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:19,160
A large beta function therefore corresponds
to a large source emitting parallel radiation,

106
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:25,840
while as small beta describes a small but
divergent source.

107
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:32,730
Shown on the right is a graph of the variation
of beta and sigma in both the x- and y-directions

108
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:39,029
along a sector spanning a little more than
80 degrees of the Swiss Light Source.

109
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,329
As one sees, both beta and sigma vary strongly
with position along the ring, due to different

110
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:49,589
elements of the magnet lattice squeezing,
focussing, and chromatically correcting the

111
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:50,690
electrons.

112
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:58,450
For example, along the parts of the ring which
contain the straights (used normally to accommodate

113
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:05,079
insertion devices), the beta functions are
minimised in order to bring the electrons

114
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:13,110
exactly to the centre of the insertion devices
for optimal operation.

115
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:18,010
Now we have defined both the flux and emittance,
we can state that the brilliance is defined

116
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:24,579
as the flux given in photons/s and 0.1% bandwidth,

117
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:33,589
divided by the values for sigma_x and sigma_y,
each given in mm, and sigma’_x and sigma’_y,

118
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:35,269
expressed in mrad.

119
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:42,540
I repeat: the brilliance is the flux divided
by the total emittance.

120
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,639
So let us make an order-of-magnitude calculation
for the brilliance of an undulator in a “typical”

121
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,320
third-generation undulator.

122
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,760
We have already calculated the flux for the
MS beamline at the Swiss Light Source, so

123
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:06,730
let’s take a similar value of around 10^14
ph/s/0.1%BW.

124
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:17,740
Typical horizontal and vertical emittance
are around 0.01 and 10^-4 mm.mrad, respectively,

125
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:28,180
which results in a brilliance of the order
of 10^20 ph/s/0.1%BW mm2 mrad2.

126
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,709
This value sits squarely in the middle of
the graph shown earlier describing the improvement

127
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,550
of brilliance in the last Century or so.

128
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:43,050
The brilliance offered by XFELs is several
orders of magnitude higher still, due both

129
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,839
to the highly parallel nature of the beam,
and also to the exceedingly high peak flux

130
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,470
that really defines XFELs.

131
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:59,690
As already mentioned, DLSRs owe their improved
brilliance primarily to the reduction in horizontal

132
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,300
emittance using newly available technologies.

133
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Both these aspects will be discussed in the
third video of this week.

134
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,210
We finish this video with a description of
coherence.

135
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,320
Coherence describes the relative phase relationship
between different parts of the x-ray source,

136
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,089
or, from a quantum mechanical viewpoint, of
the photons.

137
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:30,910
A source is said to be coherent if the emitted
waves are all in phase and (by necessity)

138
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,459
have the same wavelength.

139
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:37,100
Lasers, for example, have in general a very
high degree of coherence.

140
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,680
In contrast, synchrotron sources are in general
only partially coherent, and might have a

141
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:50,320
so-called “coherent fraction” less than
0.1% for hard x-rays.

142
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,160
One of the exciting properties of XFEL beams
is the high degree of so-called “transverse”

143
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,130
coherence, explained shortly.

144
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:05,209
Coherence is an attractive property in many
instances, as this allows macroscopic objects

145
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:10,870
to be irradiated, and their three-dimensional
architecture determined, by recording the

146
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:16,030
scattered signal, without the need for a lens.

147
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,540
As we shall see later in the course, x-ray
lenses that would be sufficiently strong to

148
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,899
magnify an object so that its structure can
be determined on a nanometer or Angstrom scale

149
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:33,600
are impossible to construct, due to the fact
that the refractive index of materials in

150
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:40,040
the x-ray regime differs only very marginally
from unity, meaning refraction by lenses is

151
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,350
very weak.

152
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:52,610
So techniques which dispense with such optical
elements, such as x-ray diffraction, small-angle

153
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:00,810
scattering (SAXS), coherent x-ray diffractive
imaging (CXDI) , and ptychography, are highly

154
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,710
attractive as x-ray imaging methods.

155
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:10,329
The size of the object that can be measured
depends on the degree of coherence - x-ray

156
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:15,420
diffraction is concerned with objects of the
order of a few Angstroms to a couple of tens

157
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,930
of nanometers (the unit cell size), and in
general, it is easy to prepare x-ray beams

158
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:27,540
with sufficient coherence to record high-quality
diffraction data.

159
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:33,089
In the case of coherent x-ray diffractive
imaging of an object of characteristic dimensions

160
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:40,170
measured in microns, however, one must take
careful measures to ensure the beam is coherent

161
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:47,600
enough that the scattered signal (called “speckle”)
contains the required information to regain

162
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,940
the sample’s structure.

163
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,430
In general, if the sample is smaller than
the coherence volume, defined in the next

164
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,190
slide, lensless scattering imaging of that
object becomes possible.

165
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:07,550
Indeed, in the case of ptychography, a burgeoning
field in hard x-ray science, objects substantially

166
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,470
larger by orders of magnitude than the coherence
length can also be investigated with nanometer

167
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:20,110
or near atomic resolution, by scanning across
the sample and using a sophisticated mathematical

168
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,190
algorithm which links successive images recorded
during the scan.

169
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,399
All these techniques will be covered later
in the course.

170
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:38,110
The coherent volume is spanned by two transverse
and one longitudinal coherence length, as

171
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:45,350
shown here, resulting in a coherent volume
. The transverse coherence lengths are determined

172
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:51,420
by the divergence of the beam, while the longitudinal
value depends on the monochromacity of the

173
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,769
beam.

174
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:57,750
We discuss these separately now.

175
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,589
The longitudinal coherence length is defined
as the length required for parts of the beam

176
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:10,930
with different wavelengths (or energies) that
begin in phase to be entirely out of phase

177
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,920
and then in phase once more, as shown here.

178
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,980
The phase difference between the two energetically
different parts of the beam is thus 2 pi.

179
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,860
Note that this is just one definition - in
the literature, on can find the coherence

180
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:33,900
length as being defined as that after a phase
difference of pi (180 degrees), or even one

181
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,950
radian (about 57 degrees).

182
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,080
In our definition of a phase shift of 2 pi,
the longitudinal coherence length is given

183
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:52,570
as being equal to lambda^2/Delta lambda , which
for 2-Angstrom radiation after monochromatization

184
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:59,960
using a silicon monochromator with a value
of Delta lambda/lambda approximately 10^-4,

185
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,560
is thus of the order of a couple of microns.

186
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:12,000
The transverse coherence length is determined
similarly as the lateral distance between

187
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,060
parts of the wavefront separated by a phase
of 2 pi, due to the source divergence.

188
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:27,720
Obviously, the more parallel the beam (small
Delta theta), the larger the transverse coherence.

189
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:37,960
As Delta theta is equal to D/R, where D is
the source size and R is the source - sample

190
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:46,230
distance, beamlines constructed for scattering
experiments of mesoscopically sized objects,

191
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:53,820
such as in SAXS, CXDI, and ptychography, tend
to have long source - end-station distances

192
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,790
(i.e., D) and small source sizes (R).

193
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:07,180
Because the divergence of x-ray beams is generally
larger in the horizontal plane than the vertical,

194
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,820
the vertical transverse coherence length is
concomitantly larger than that in the horizontal

195
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,140
direction.

196
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:22,260
As an example, the transverse coherent lengths
for 2-Angstrom radiation at the cSAXS beamline

197
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,270
of the Swiss Light Source are given here.

198
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,950
Even the smaller horizontal value is an order
of magnitude larger than typical longitudinal

199
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:38,690
coherence lengths, and it is therefore the
transverse coherence which tends to be exploited

200
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:42,340
in such scattering experiments.

201
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,770
In the above calculations determining the
transverse coherent lengths, the divergence

202
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,700
was assumed to be that of the source.

203
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,290
However, the wavefront can be further scrambled
by imperfect optics, such as for specular

204
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:05,440
reflections off an x-ray mirror, caused by
that mirror not being perfectly flat.

205
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,690
Beamlines exploiting coherence take great
care in minimising such artefacts.

206
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,220
Lastly, the coherent fraction as a function
of the electrons’ and photons’ source

207
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,810
sizes and divergences is given here.

208
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:30,560
In “normal” third-generation facilities,
this expression is dominated by sigma_x^e

209
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:38,900
and sigmal_x^e’, and coherent fractions
of the order of 10^-3 or less are typical.

210
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,330
If, however, one is able to reduce these,
and the equivalent values in the y-direction

211
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:51,620
to those associated with the photons, then
one can obtain coherent fraction of 25%.

212
00:20:51,620 --> 00:21:00,850
The next-generation storage rings, DLSRs,
promise to make a quantum leap in this direction,

213
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,320
obtaining coherent fractions of a few percent,
that is almost two orders of magnitude greater

214
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,080
than presently possible.

215
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,210
In the case of XFELs, the electron emittance
is significantly smaller than the photon emittance,

216
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,440
and coherent fractions close to unity are
achieved.

217
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,480
In summary, we have discussed in detail in
this video the pertinent properties and characteristics

218
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,670
of synchrotron beams, namely their flux, emittance,
brilliance, and coherence.

219
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,310
In the next video of this week, we discuss
the magnet lattice of the storage ring, that

220
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:48,370
is, the set of dipole bending magnets, quadrupoles,
and sextupoles responsible for keeping the

221
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:54,480
electrons on a well-defined closed orbit,
before considering insertion devices (that

222
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,270
is, wigglers, and most importantly, undulators),
the magnet arrays placed in the straight sections

223
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,330
of the storage ring that produce the most
intense beams.
