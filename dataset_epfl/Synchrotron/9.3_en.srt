00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,760
Welcome to the third and final video of Week
9 of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,210
and x-ray free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,400
In this video, we discuss techniques that
depend on the change in the structure factor

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,789
because of absorption effects.

5
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:29,430
The technique of multiwavelength anomalous
diffraction only works using unable synchrotron

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,029
or xfel radiation.

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:40,680
SAD in principle does work for a fixed-wavelength
lab source, but in practice is never done

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,970
using lab sources due to the weakness of the
SAD signal and therefore the need to obtain

9
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,610
very clean data with highly reliable diffraction
intensities.

10
00:00:52,610 --> 00:01:04,610
Lastly, we will briefly discuss current and
possible future trends in macromolecular crystallography.

11
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,100
In the graphs here, various important aspects
of the atomic form factor of selenium are

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,130
shown.

13
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,860
Selenium was chosen here as it is one of the
most common elements that is substituted into

14
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:25,119
protein structures via selenomethionine, the
selenium-substituted version of otherwise

15
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:33,330
sulphur-containing methionine, one of the
human essential amino acids (which, incidentally

16
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,080
has a natural abundance of 1.8%).

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:47,170
Top left is the atomic form factor of selenium
with values at 0, 2, 4, and 6 reciprocal Angstroms

18
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,080
highlighted by the coloured circles.

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,090
Top right is the change in f’ and f” in
the neighbourhood of the K-absorption edge

20
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,960
of selenium, centered at 12658 eV.

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,250
An alternative plot is shown bottom left,
in which f” is plotted as a function of

22
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,870
f’.

23
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,529
The photon-energy values of points on this
curve that lie as far from each other as possible

24
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,309
have been highlighted.

25
00:02:20,309 --> 00:02:27,309
Lastly, the magnitude of the complex atomic
form factor as a function of energy and Q

26
00:02:27,309 --> 00:02:33,709
is shown in the dashed lines in the bottom-right
curve, for the four values of Q highlighted

27
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:35,629
top left.

28
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,699
The corresponding change in phase compared
to energies where the anomalous contributions

29
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:49,010
are insignificant is shown with the solid
lines, and is equal to the arctangent of f”/(f_1

30
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,900
= f^0 + f’).

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,159
Take a little time to absorb this information
and understand it, as we will be using it

32
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,159
repeatedly from hereon in.

33
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:09,409
The beauty of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction
over multiple isomorphous replacement is that

34
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:17,839
(a) only one heavy-atom structure is required,
and (b) isomorphism is guaranteed insofar

35
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:24,340
that no physical substitution is needed to
change the structure factors.

36
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,029
Instead these change due to one or more heavy
atoms modifying their atomic form factors

37
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:35,950
as one passes across an absorption edge.

38
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:42,779
MAD experiments require one to record three
or more diffraction data sets around the absorption

39
00:03:42,779 --> 00:03:52,019
edge of the heavy atom . F_H will change its
magnitude and phase and cause F_PH to do so

40
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,639
also.

41
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,799
In addition, for any one photon energy, the
Friedel pairs will also show differences for

42
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,260
the reasons outlined in the first video of
this week.

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,529
This is, actually, SAD signal, but we’ll
discuss this more later.

44
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:19,670
One potential setback with MAD, though no
more so than in MIR, is that the reliability

45
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:26,949
of the data depends on the crystal not being
radiation damaged to an extent that this swamps

46
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:35,449
the MAD differences before the minimum of
three data sets are recorded.

47
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:40,919
For any one energy in MAD, we can construct
the Harker diagram like we did in the last

48
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,130
video for MIR.

49
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,960
Let’s look at how we obtain F_PH^+.

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,009
To the native structure factor we add the
heavy atom structure factor . But we have

51
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,340
chosen the photon energy to be around the
absorption edge of this atom or atoms.

52
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,660
So we need to subtract f’ and add f” at
90 degrees to this . This is our final structure

53
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,440
factor F_PH^+ . Now, what about the Friedel
pair F_PH^-?

54
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,729
Well, we proceed as before . But now let’s
pause before adding on f”.

55
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:30,939
. . Now, we don’t continue to reproduce
the mirror image of what we did for F_PH^+,

56
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:41,319
but instead, add f” in the other direction
. If we mirror flip this across the real axis,

57
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,889
we see clearly the difference . The complex
conjugate of F_PH^- is distinct from F_PH^+

58
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:59,379
. The vector difference between them has a
magnitude of 2 times f”.

59
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:08,210
Their magnitudes differ too, as shown here
by the dashed circles . And now we rearrange

60
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:13,020
the vectors in the same way as we did when
when we introduced Harker diagrams in the

61
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:22,259
last video . 
From hereon in, the procedure is much the

62
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:29,449
same as in MIR.

63
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:35,110
This is done for other photon energies, the
impact on the Harker diagram depending on

64
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:42,789
the changes in f’ and f” as one crosses
the absorption edge.

65
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:52,949
Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction thus
exploits these changes in the anomalous signal.

66
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:58,779
Single-wavelength anomalous diffraction exploits
only the fact that Friedel-pair intensities

67
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:06,909
differ if f” is not too small, and as such
requires just one diffraction data set at

68
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:10,060
one energy.

69
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,360
As such it is the method that, to date, requires
the shortest acquisition times and therefore

70
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,340
suffers least from radiation damage.

71
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:27,830
SAD can be performed on a heavy-atom derivative,
or if one is lucky, there may be a naturally

72
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,690
occurring heavy atom such as iron.

73
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:38,129
The latest developments in SAD, called “native”
SAD, exploit anomalous signal from lighter

74
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:44,770
naturally occurring elements, most notably
sulphur, but also phosphorus in the case of

75
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,759
studies of DNA- or RNA-containing biostructures.

76
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,490
Because of the weakness of the SAD signal
in lighter atoms, native SAD in particular

77
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:04,449
requires the highest accuracy in recording
diffraction structure factors.

78
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:10,160
In the Harker construction of SAD, which we
also looked at in our discussion of MAD, there

79
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,339
remains an ambiguity.

80
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:14,339
. .

81
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,120
caused by the two possible solutions that
emerge from the overlap of the two Harker

82
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,939
circles . Which of these is correct?

83
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:28,849
. The beauty of SAD is the lack of need to
record more than one data set, so how does

84
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:33,490
one overcome this ambiguity?

85
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:39,150
The approach used is an iterative method called
solvent flattening.

86
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:46,480
A “typical” protein crystal does not contain
protein structure packed to the hilt, but

87
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:56,350
instead contains approximately 50% by volume
of protein folds, etc, and 50% solvent molecules.

88
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,370
The former are fixed and repeat more or less
faithfully from unit cell to unit cell - it’s

89
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,500
for this reason we can obtain protein diffraction
data.

90
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,720
The solvent, however, has no long-range order
and is instead composed of completely randomly

91
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,420
oriented solvent molecules.

92
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,370
Over many unit cells, therefore, the average
electron density of the solvent should be

93
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,600
flat and featureless.

94
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,300
The average electron density of the solvent
is in general lower than that of protein - the

95
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:45,840
former is 0.33 e/A3 for water , while for
protein it is 0.43 e/A3 . Any half-way decent

96
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:53,800
model will therefore show islands of higher
average electron density in a sea of, on average,

97
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,779
lower electron density, though it might be
difficult to distinguish the coastlines, if

98
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,810
we extend the metaphor.

99
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:09,480
In addition, before a really good structural
model is obtained, the “sea” may be very

100
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
choppy.

101
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,120
The goal of solvent flattening is to obtain
`dead calm’.

102
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
. .
After recording a SAD data set, with experimental

103
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:29,160
values found for F+ and F-, a difference-map
can be generated and for each structure factor

104
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,660
there will be a pair of possible phases phi_A
and phi_B.

105
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,130
This is our starting point.

106
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:45,660
As an input, we take our experimentally determined
structure-factor magnitudes, and a random

107
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,180
selection of either phi_A or phi_B for each
structure factor.

108
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,009
This is Fourier transformed to produce a real-space
structure.

109
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:03,630
Those regions which appear to be protein by
dint of their higher electron density are

110
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,790
“shrink-wrapped” and preserved, while
the remainder is deemed to be solvent.

111
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:17,959
Any noise to these regions is then either
flattened, or, in an alternative approach,

112
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:23,519
flipped around the expected average value
for the solvent being used.

113
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:31,070
This modified real-space model is then inverse
Fourier transformed , and the resulting calculated

114
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,519
structure-factor magnitudes replaced with
the experimental values . The choice of phi_A

115
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:45,810
or phi_B is determined by which is closer
to the newly calculated value.

116
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:57,589
This cycle is repeated until consistency arises
between real and reciprocal space.

117
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:04,291
In conventional SAD, which tries to get as
large a signal out of the f” form factor

118
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:12,149
component as possible, certain energies and
atom types are of particular interest.

119
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:17,940
In addition to selenium SAD, significantly
stronger signal can be obtained if one is

120
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,820
able to insert heavy elements such as platinum,
gold, or mercury in an isomorphic manner.

121
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:35,209
This supplies a SAD signal 2f” of 10 electrons
or larger.

122
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:43,540
At lower energies between approximately 3
and 7 keV, the f” values can exceed 50 electrons

123
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:50,139
nd the SAD difference between Friedel pairs
may be very large indeed.

124
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:57,069
However, lower photon energies are associated
with more radiation damage, more absorption

125
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:06,410
and scattering from ambient air, other gas,
or solvents, and a reduced access to reciprocal

126
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,740
space.

127
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:14,450
Nonetheless, this is a highly interesting
new direction, and a large cylindrical Pilatus

128
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:21,620
detector containing 12 million pixels has
been installed at the I23 beamline at the

129
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:27,870
Diamond Light Source, and is beginning to
produce first data in 2016.

130
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,800
Because of the increased absorption of air,
the detector is placed in vacuum, which also

131
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:45,740
imposes potential problems of denaturing of
the protein crystals in such an environment.

132
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,610
As already briefly mentioned, the most modern
SAD experiments attempt to solve the phase

133
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:57,209
problem and extract the structure via the
weak anomalous signals associated with atoms

134
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,910
that are native to the protein, in particular
sulphur.

135
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:09,329
Indeed, as already mentioned, the first ever
demonstration of SAD was both using sulphur,

136
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:19,930
and, more remarkably, using a Cu-K alpha lab
source at 8.04 keV, some 5 and half keV higher

137
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,430
in energy than the sulphur K-edge.

138
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:33,420
At this energy, 2f_2 is less than 1 electron
. Now, there WAS a gap of eight years between

139
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:41,750
recording the data and eventual publication,
a sign of how weak the SAD signal was and

140
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:46,589
how difficult the phasing using this must
have been.

141
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:51,640
Nonetheless, it does show that one doesn’t
have to be all that close to the absorption

142
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:00,089
edge to see an effect, particularly for clean
and intense data recorded at synchrotrons.

143
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:06,259
One of the reasons why crambin lent itself
to sulphur-SAD was its unusually high concentration

144
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:19,050
of sulphur - some three times higher than
seen on average in proteins.

145
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:27,370
Me!!!!!

146
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:35,750
The 
next step is to see how strong native SAD

147
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,510
signal is, and how contributions from all
native atom types are (apart from hydrogen,

148
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,100
which is far too weak to contribute significantly).

149
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Before we proceed, we assume an average protein
chemical formula given here.

150
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,410
This was calculated by summing the chemical
formulae of the 20 naturally occurring amino

151
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:05,990
acids in vertebrates, weighted by their relative
abundance, then normalising this to one sulphur

152
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,430
atom.

153
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:14,550
In addition, as we found out in the second
week of this course, the value of f_2 scales

154
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:21,480
with the fourth power of Z, which means, for
example, that sulphur has an imaginary anomalous

155
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:28,639
contribution that is approximately 50 times
larger than that of carbon.

156
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,880
So how do the individual vectorial form factors
add up on average?

157
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,529
In native SAD, sulphur obviously has the largest
value for f_2.

158
00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:50,870
At 5 keV, this amounts to about 1.3 electrons
. The f_2-values for carbon, nitrogen, and

159
00:16:50,870 --> 00:17:02,850
oxygen at this energy are 0.028, 0.05, and
0.09, respectively, in other words between

160
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,990
one or two orders of magnitude smaller than
that of sulphur.

161
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,240
Does this mean we can ignore their contributions
to the SAD signal?

162
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,320
This depends very much on the sulphur content
in the protein.

163
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,900
If we take the average chemical composition
of proteins given in the previous slide, we

164
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:31,990
see from the table here that, for example,
a 50kDa protein has almost 100 times more

165
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:35,120
carbon atoms than sulphur.

166
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,010
So is carbon’s small value for f_2 compensated
by its abundance?

167
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,600
Let’s begin with the carbon atoms.

168
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,840
Like I already said in the last video, there
is patently no correlation between the incident

169
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:02,330
plane wave of x-rays and the positions of
the atoms, so their scattering phases must

170
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:09,540
be entirely random . We can therefore say,
that on average, the vector addition of one

171
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:16,650
type of atom to produce a structure factor
for this, will produce a vector with a magnitude

172
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:24,400
equal to that of an individual atom of this
type at this Q-vector, multiplied by the square

173
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,740
root of the number of those atoms . So far,
I have assumed no anomalous terms.

174
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,130
How can we include these?

175
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:42,580
First, f’ becomes very small if one lies
even only a few hundred eV above an absorption

176
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,870
edge, so we ignore this for all the native
atoms considered here.

177
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:53,910
f_2 drops off much more slowly, however.

178
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:00,350
Because this is always at +90 degrees to the
real part of the atomic form factor, the sum

179
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:09,780
of f_2 will also be at +90 degrees and will
also be proportional to the square-root of

180
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,550
the number of atoms of that type.

181
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:24,880
So, in the case of carbon, the square-root
of 1949 is approximately 44, so the real part

182
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:47,870
of F_C = 44 x 3.07 = 135 electrons, and the
imaginary part of F_C = 44 x 0.028 = 1.23

183
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,810
electrons.

184
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:55,490
If we make the same calculations for nitrogen,
oxygen, and sulphur, we get the following

185
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:03,910
results . From this, we see that sulphur has
a summed f_2 value equal to approximately

186
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:11,720
twice that of oxygen, and a little over four
times that of nitrogen or carbon.

187
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,810
How does one add up the contributions from
carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen?

188
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:23,050
- clearly not linearly, as this would imply
that their summed vectors all lie in the same

189
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:30,210
direction.

190
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,090
It turns out that on average, their vector
addition is the square-root of the sum of

191
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:50,840
their squares, which in this instance equal
3.27 electrons, about 60% of the contribution

192
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,090
from the sulphur atoms.

193
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:09,540
Importantly, the values for the sum of f_2
for C, N, and O are more statistically reliable

194
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:16,160
than for the sulphur atoms, on account of
there being many more of them.

195
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,750
Hence, the summed f_2 values for sulphur may,
with a higher probability, tend to deviate

196
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,140
from the statistical average, either positively
or negatively.

197
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,290
Perhaps more importantly, if the protein happens
to have less than the average abundance of

198
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:39,540
sulphur, this will also have a large impact.

199
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,050
The take-home message is, therefore, that,
with increasingly accurate data acquisition,

200
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:53,650
SAD might soon be possible even for those
structure that are entirely devoid of any

201
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,430
atom types heavier than oxygen.

202
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:07,220
Is “CNO”-SAD the ultimate phasing technique
for the experimental macromolecular biologist?

203
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,230
We finish this video with a summary of how
the popularity of different phasing methods

204
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,870
has evolved since the advent of third-generation
synchrotron facilities.

205
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:26,970
First, , single isomorphous replacement, and
multiple isomorphous replacement waned rapidly

206
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:33,030
once unable and intense synchrotron radiation
became available.

207
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:39,290
Computer-based ab-initio methods have remained
mainly unchanged, despite John Kendrew’s

208
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:46,110
prediction in his Nobel speech that speculated
that, ‘although this day will not come soon’,

209
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:52,840
a protein’s structure could be predicted
based solely on its amino-acid sequence, and

210
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,910
that x-ray crystallographers can go out of
business, perhaps with a certain sense of

211
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,140
relief’.

212
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,210
Over sixty years later, we still await this
momentous day.

213
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:14,530
. .
As SIR and MIR waned, multiple isomorphous

214
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:20,970
replacement waxed . As detector technology
improved and further incremental steps were

215
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:27,410
made in synchrotron brilliance, SAD techniques,
which circumvent the need to record three

216
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:34,650
or more data sets, became increasingly popular,
as it allowed smaller crystals to be investigated

217
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,690
due to the reduced recording times.

218
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:48,070
Nowadays, approximately 80% of synchrotron-based
MX experiments are based on SAD.

219
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:54,030
Within SAD itself, the move towards native
SAD is just beginning to take off after a

220
00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:01,980
hiatus of nearly two decades after Teeter
and Hendrickson’s seminal paper in 1981;

221
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,090
and now sits on the verge of being the “first-choice”
phasing method.

222
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:14,780
As an example, the crystal structure of the
tubulin-stathmin-TTL complex is shown, which

223
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:24,131
has a molecular mass of 266 kDa and contains
118 sulphur atoms, 13 phosphorus atoms, and

224
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:27,930
three Ca2+ ions.

225
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:35,650
This is the largest structure to be solved
by native SAD to date.

226
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:41,110
This week has concentrated on phasing techniques
in macromolecular crystallography, and how

227
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,521
these have developed as the complexity of
the structures under investigation and the

228
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:50,410
sophistication of the x-ray sources have increased.

229
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:59,080
The still further increased brilliance of
DLSRs will allow the investigation of micron-sized

230
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:06,290
crystals, thus opening up a vista of new types
of biomolecules that until now have been excluded

231
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:13,130
to investigation, due to the limited size
to which they could be crystallised.

232
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:18,020
The experimental approaches with these small
crystals are likely to be based on serial

233
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:24,900
millisecond crystallography, the synchrotron
sister-technique to serial femtosecond crystallography

234
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,680
used at XFELs.

235
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,380
The future remains truly bright.
