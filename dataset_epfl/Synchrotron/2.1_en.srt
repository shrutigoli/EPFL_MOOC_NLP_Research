00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:12,120
Welcome to Week 2 of this introductory course
on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,240
This week, we will explore the basic features
and physical description of the interaction

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,850
of x-rays with matter.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:26,740
We shall begin by relating cross-sections
and attenuation lengths for a given process

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,980
and how one can calculate one from the other.

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,820
The only three relevant physical processes
concerning x-ray interactions with matter

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,100
are then introduced, of which that of Compton
scattering is only very briefly described,

8
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,890
as we will not consider this further in the
course.

9
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,390
The remainder of this, the first video of
this week, will be concerned with the description

10
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:57,140
of elastic scattering of x-rays by quasi-free
electrons and the introduction of the concept

11
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,879
of the atomic form factor.

12
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:07,290
In the second video, refinements of the atomic
form factor are added to account for the fact

13
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,509
that the electrons in a material are generally
bound to the nucleus with well-defined binding

14
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,820
energies.

15
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:23,399
Just as visible light is bent, or “refracted”,
as it passes from one medium to another, x-rays

16
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:26,210
are also similarly affected.

17
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:31,479
How the refractive index in the x-ray regime
is related to the atomic form factor will

18
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,049
be covered in detail.

19
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,100
From this, quantitative predictions can be
made about refraction and reflection of x-rays.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,630
Lastly, absorption effects resulting from
excitation of electrons to unoccupied energy

21
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:52,810
states, and subsequent relaxation processes
will be discussed.

22
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,619
Just a brief note about the tone of this week
- although it contains some mathematics, none

23
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:03,350
of this is complex and should be understandable
even for a high-school student, so please

24
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,430
do not feel intimidated by the introduction
this week of some more mathematical expressions.

25
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:16,640
Let’s now begin by discussing the concept
of cross-sections and attenuation lengths.

26
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,810
Consider a process P (as yet undefined) occurring
when x-rays pass through a block of material

27
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:31,520
of depth L, containing a number density rho_a
of atoms responsible for this process.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,530
Each atom has a cross-sectional area sigma_P
associated with the process P. Due to this

29
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:45,800
process, the beam intensity will exponentially
decay as photons are removed or scattered

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,200
from the beam as it travels through the medium.

31
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,990
The attenuation length Lambda_P is defined
as being equal to the length the beam has

32
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,960
travelled through the medium before the original
intensity I_0 has been reduced by a factor

33
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,540
equal to the natural logarithm e = 2.718.

34
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:23,570
The relationship between this and the cross-section
is simply Lambda_P = 1/(sigma_P rho_a).

35
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:30,240
In order to better understand this, let us
consider the example of a 10-keV x-ray beam

36
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,070
passing through cobalt metal.

37
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:46,340
From the density of cobalt (8.9 g/cm3) and
its atomic mass (58.933), the atomic number

38
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,190
density can be directly calculated to be 9.09
x 10^10 atoms per cubic micron.

39
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:00,870
***** The graph on the left of the photoabsorption
attenuation length shows this to be 6.2 microns

40
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,500
at 10 keV.

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,630
Using the equation from the previous slide,
we obtain a photoabsorption cross-section

42
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,980
sigma_PA of 1.77 x 10^-12 square microns.

43
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:23,789
As there are 100 million square Angstroms
per square micron, this equates to 1.774 x

44
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,319
10^-4 square Angstroms.

45
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:35,719
An even more convenient unit to use is that
of the “barn”, which has an area of 10^-28

46
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:41,960
square meters, or 10^-8 square Angstroms.

47
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,729
Cobalt therefore has a photoabsorption cross-section
of 1.774 x 10^4 barn.

48
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:55,830
Incidentally, a barn is approximately equal
to the capture cross-section of uranium nuclei

49
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,300
in fission reactions - the term “barn”
comes from the colloquialism “as big as

50
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,360
a barn door”, as scientists performing wartime
research into uranium fission considered this

51
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,020
to be particularly large target (and therefore
a prime candidate for development of the fission

52
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,310
bomb).

53
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,800
Even more whimsically, there exist (admittedly
rarely used and certainly not mentioned again

54
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,000
in this course) related cross-sectional units,
the “outhouse” (equal to one microbarn),

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,069
and the “shed” (one yoctobarn).

56
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:42,930
So, which processes should we consider when
discussing the interaction of x-rays with

57
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,699
matter?

58
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,750
Nuclear- and pair production only begin to
dominate at photon energies above the highest

59
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:59,699
presently available at synchrotron facilities
and can be entirely ignored.

60
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,749
This leaves Thomson and Compton scattering,
and photoabsorption.

61
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:10,430
All these processes involve the electron and
the electron only.

62
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,270
The nuclear core can be entirely disregarded
due to its relatively very large mass (a single

63
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:25,080
nucleon is some 1800 times heavier than an
electron).

64
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,800
We begin with a brief description of Compton
scattering.

65
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,330
This is a quantum-mechanical effect in which
some of the energy and momentum of an incident

66
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:43,270
photon is imparted to a free electron, which
thereby receives a change in its momentum.

67
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,889
The energy lost by the inelastically scattered
photon results in a lengthening of the wavelength

68
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:57,199
and depends on its scattered angle psi and
initial photon energy h-nu_0, given by the

69
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,900
equation shown here.

70
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,689
The cluster of constants h/mc = 0.0243 Angstroms.

71
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:14,999
The relative energy loss therefore only becomes
significant above a few tens of keV, and for

72
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:20,159
large angles psi, as can be clearly seen in
the graph to the right

73
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:24,800
and only begins to dominate above approximately
100 keV.

74
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,370
This threshold energy is related to the rest-mass
energy of an electron, mc^2 = 511 keV for

75
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,370
electrons.

76
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,610
As such, we will no longer consider Compton
scattering in this course, although it shouldn’t

77
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,819
be forgotten when performing high-energy-photon
synchrotron experiments.

78
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,819
Now we have seen that it is the electron which
is the only particle of interest regarding

79
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:57,069
interaction with x-rays, let us begin by considering
how a free electron responds in the presence

80
00:07:57,069 --> 00:08:02,210
of an electromagnetic field.

81
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:09,960
For nonrelativistic electron velocities, we
need only consider the electric-field component

82
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,220
of the incoming radiation.

83
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,749
The electron will respond to this, moving
in the opposite direction to the E-field (the

84
00:08:20,749 --> 00:08:27,909
force is equal to MINUS the elementary charge
times the electric-field amplitude).

85
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:33,350
This causes the electron to reradiate coherently
with the incident beam, with the same phase

86
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:38,250
and frequency, for reasons we will discuss
later in the course in the beginning of the

87
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,539
section on synchrotron physics.

88
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,570
The intensity of the reradiated or scattered
radiation depends on the polar angle of observation

89
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:54,209
chi according to cosine-squared chi, shown
here.

90
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:00,720
Hence an observer viewing along the E-field
vector at chi = 90 degrees will see no scattered

91
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,920
intensity, as the E-field has zero transverse
component in this direction.

92
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,940
Conversely, in the plane perpendicular to
the electric-field direction, scattering is

93
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,260
maximised.

94
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:21,100
Again, the reason for this spatial distribution
will be made clear when we begin to discuss

95
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:28,450
synchrotron, or “machine”, physics.

96
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,810
This response of the free electrons to light
is the reason why, among other things, mirrors

97
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:41,050
reflect, radio antenna transmit, and, importantly,
synchrotrons produce light.

98
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:49,430
As I just mentioned, the reasons for this
will become clear soon.

99
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,000
This elastic scattering by electrons, that
is, with no loss in photon energy, is referred

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,220
to as Thomson scattering.

101
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,960
Although the photon energy remains invariant,
the direction, or momentum, can change.

102
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,450
Let us consider scattering of a photon by
an angle 2-theta

103
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,850
The vector difference between the incident
and scattered photon wavevectors (each of

104
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:27,050
which have a magnitude equal to k = 2pi/lambda)
is equal to Q, which is referred to as the

105
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,690
scattering vector.

106
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:38,320
The magnitude of Q is easy to calculate as
follows: Half of Q is simply equal to k sin

107
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,370
theta.

108
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:53,120
As k equals 2pi/lambda, Q is therefore equal
to 4pi/lambda sin theta.

109
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,610
How strongly incident radiation is scattered
by a free electron is given by the Thomson

110
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,380
scattering length.

111
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,940
This is determined by equating the classical
electrostatic energy of a charge e at a distance

112
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:18,370
equal to r-zero, the Thomson length, to the
rest-mass energy of the electron, mc-squared.

113
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:25,570
The Thomson length thus turns out to be equal
to 2.82 x 10^-5 Angstroms, and can be thought

114
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,020
of as the classical radius of an electron.

115
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:37,519
The cross-section of a free electron is determined
by integrating over all angles of the dipole

116
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:46,180
radiation, and turns out to be equal to about
2/3 of a barn.

117
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:54,579
We now progress from the case of a free electron
to scattering from an atom.

118
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:59,390
We begin by making the dubious assumption
that all the electrons associated with the

119
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,800
atom can respond entirely unhindered by the
fact that they are actually bound to the atom’s

120
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,839
nuclear core.

121
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,170
We first consider the limit of the x-ray wavelength
being significantly larger than the extent

122
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,100
of the electron cloud around the atom.

123
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,040
In this case, all the scattering elements
will scatter coherently (that is, in phase)

124
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,230
because any differences in positions in space
of the different cloud elements is very small

125
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,470
compared to the wavelength.

126
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:41,180
As there are Z electrons in the cloud, the
scattering cross-section is simply Z^2 sigma_T,

127
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,220
which is independent of wavelength.

128
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,980
So, for example, the low-energy limit of Thomson
scattering in the forward direction, shown

129
00:12:51,980 --> 00:13:08,649
here for barium, is 56-squared, or 3136 times
the cross-section of an individual electron,

130
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:18,440
which is approximately equal to 2000 barns.

131
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,250
As the photon energy increases and the wavelength
shortens to distances comparable and then

132
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,880
less than the size of the atom, however, scattering
from the different elements dV in the electron

133
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:39,310
cloud begin to interfere partially destructively,
resulting in a drop-off of the scattering

134
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:46,629
cross-section and intensity, which follows
approximately an inverse square relationship

135
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:54,750
with respect to the photon energy.

136
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,220
The gradual crossover from the lower-energy
limit of constant scattering cross-section

137
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:06,620
to that of one dropping off is at x-ray wavelengths
comparable to the size of the electron cloud,

138
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:18,700
of the order of 3 Angstrom, equating to an
energy of about 4 keV.

139
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:24,040
The precise drop-off is given by the atomic
form factor, or atomic scattering factor,

140
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
f.

141
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,490
This describes the elastic scattering amplitude
as a function of angle, wavelength, and atom

142
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,490
type.

143
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,759
More accurately, f is normally expressed as
a function of Q or sin theta/lambda, as this

144
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,410
is the appropriate independent variable.

145
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,959
If one performs one experiment at a certain
energy and one observes the scattering at

146
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:53,740
a certain angle 2-theta, then if the energy
is then, say, increased (lambda decreased),

147
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:01,040
then the same interference (i.e., phase difference)
between any two scattering elements dV of

148
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,160
the electron cloud will be the same at shallower
angles.

149
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:11,200
So, for the example shown here for phosphorus,
an atomic form factor of 10 electrons will

150
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:19,070
be observed at high angles for low energies
and low angles for high energies.

151
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:23,170
Note also that in the forward-scattering direction,
all the scattering elements in the electron

152
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:29,259
cloud will scatter in phase, and the amplitude
will be that of the individual electron multiplied

153
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:35,350
by Z, in other words, the total charge surrounding
the atom.

154
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:46,629
The intensity, proportional to the square
of the amplitude, thus increases as Z-squared.

155
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:53,510
The dependence of f on Q (or sin theta/lambda)
can be conveniently expressed as the sum of

156
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,629
four Gaussians plus a constant, and values
for every element for these expressions can

157
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:07,759
be found in the International Tables for Crystallography.

158
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,360
Summarising our discussion of elastic scattering
so far, we should take home the following:

159
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,519
The electrons respond to the electric-field
component of the incident x-rays and reradiate

160
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,939
as a consequence at the same frequency - the
process is elastic.

161
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:31,420
At large wavelengths compared to the size
of the atoms scattering is independent of

162
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,779
the photon energy, as the cloud can be approximated
as being a point source.

163
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:43,050
However, as the wavelength becomes smaller
(photon energy increases), scattering from

164
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,829
the different volume elements within the electron
cloud begin to be out of phase with each other,

165
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:52,639
resulting in increasing destructive interference.

166
00:16:52,639 --> 00:17:01,879
As an approximation, the cross-section drops
off as 1/E^2, and is described in detail by

167
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:11,350
the atomic form factor, f, which is normally
expressed as a function of Q, or sin theta/lambda.

168
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:17,360
In the next video, we will consider how the
situation changes if we account for the fact

169
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,960
that the electrons are not entirely free to
respond to the incident radiation, but are

170
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,939
in fact bound to atoms.

171
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:59,070
This will lead to the phenomena 

172
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:31,120
of refraction, reflection, and absorption.
