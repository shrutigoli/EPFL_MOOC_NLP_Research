Welcome to the second video of Week 4 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This video reviews the magnet lattice and insertion devices.
The magnet lattice is responsible for keeping the electron beam on a closed orbit, including focusing it and chromatically correcting for electrons of slightly different kinetic energies.
The dipole bending magnets also produce synchrotron radiation.
While in general being less brilliant than insertion devices by two to three orders of magnitude, they are still highly brilliant sources of synchrotron radiation and are used extensively in most facilities.
It is the insertion devices, however, which are generally (though not exclusively) most sought after.
We will finish this video by examining these in detail.
Shown here are â€œmugshotsâ€� of typical bending magnets, quadrupoles, and sextupoles at third-generation synchrotron facilities.
They are mounted on girders and can be subtly repositioned and realigned in order to optimise the magnet fields relative to the electron-beam orbit.
Typically, bending magnets come in pairs in a given arc-section of the storage ring, or sometimes in triplets, at third-generation facilities.
It is briefly mentioned here, and discussed in detail in the next video, that the next generation facilities, DLSRs, are characterised by not having pairs or triplets of bending magnets, but clusters of five, seven, or even nine in an arc section of the ring.
In order to understand why dipole bending magnets are never single, we begin with the simplest configuration, that of the double-bend achromat, also called the â€œChasman-Green latticeâ€�, named after its inventors.
Imagine electrons of different energy entering the magnetic field of a bending magnet.
The energy difference, as we have already mentioned, may be as much as a couple of thousandths of their nominal storage-ring energy.
So a 3-GeV ring may have electrons with an energy spread measured in a few MeV.
Due to this spread in energy, the electrons will execute different paths as they travel through the bending magnet , the faster one being less bent than the slower ones, which, if left uncorrected, will blow up the electron-beam in the horizontal plane by an unacceptable degree.
This is resolved by placing a focussing quadrupole magnet (FQM, described in detail shortly) after the bending magnet, then a mirror image of this bend downstream of the FQM.
This refocusses the electrons back onto a common path and is called a double-bend achromat.
With this manipulation of the electrons is associated a certain emittance, given by the formula shown here.
Theta is the angle of a single bending magnet, expressed in radians.
So, for example, a 10-degree turn of a bending magnet, and a gamma-value of 4700 yields a lower limit for the horizontal emittance of approximately 3 nm.rad.
Note that this is significantly larger, by almost three orders of magnitude, than the diffraction limit of 1-Angstrom photons of approximately 8 pm.rad.
The magnet lattice design and its optimisation therefore largely determine the horizontal emittance of the facility.
The central element of the DBA was the focussing quadrupole.
We now consider quadrupoles in more detail.
Quadrupoles are just that - a four-pole array of magnets, with alternating north and south poles facing inwards, as shown here.
If we recall the Lorentz force and its sense of direction from the first video of last week, we can see that electrons moving out of the screen towards you (indicated by the blue dot and circle) will feel different forces, depending on its position.
Exactly in the quadrupole centre, all the forces cancel and the electrons should remain unaffected.
Deviations in the electronsâ€™ position up or down from the central plane will cause them to experience a restoring force to the centre - they will be refocussed, in other words.
In contrast, if the electrons are left or right of the centre, the forces will accentuate this deviation - they will be defocussed.
The action of focussing or defocussing in the horizontal plane defines the naming convention for quadrupole, so, the example shown here is a defocussing, or D-quadrupole magnet (DQM).
If the array is rotated by 90 degrees, however, the electrons are focussed horizontally and defocussed vertically, and this configuration is called a focussing quadrupole magnet, or
FQM.
By the correct placement of a FQM (here labelled
F-4) and a DQM (or D-4) after each other, the electron beam can be focussed both vertically and horizontally, though at different positions along the central axis, according to the electronsâ€™ energy.
This longitudinal dispersion can be subsequently chromatically corrected using sextupole magnets, which have focal lengths that are inversely proportional to the distance of the electrons from the central axis.
We now move on to a discussion of insertion devices.
As has been mentioned several times already, insertion devices are sources of synchrotron radiation consisting of arrays of alternating
N-S, S-N dipoles placed at the straight sections of the storage rings.
There are two sorts of insertion device - the wiggler and the undulator.
Although at first glance they seem similar, differences in the amplitude of the oscillatory path executed by the electrons as they pass along the array of magnets result in strikingly different emission spectra.
The periodicity of the magnet arrays in wigglers and undulators are lambda_w and lambda_u, respectively, and are of the order of several millimetres to a few tens of cm, depending intimately on the magnetsâ€™ B-field and the range of photon energies the insertion device has been designed for.
Perhaps the parameter that best distinguishes undulators from wigglers is the so-called
K-parameter.
This expresses the ratio between the maximum angular excursion of the electrons due to the magnet array, phi-max, to the natural opening angle of the synchrotron radiation,
1/gamma.
K is therefore equal to phi-max times gamma.
It emerges from a simple calculation of the
Lorentz forces that this is equal to eB0/mck_u,w, where k_u or w is the wavevector 2pi/lambda_u or w, of the magnet array.
This can be expressed in practical units as being equal to 0.934 times lambda_u or w in cm multiplied by B0 in Tesla.
Insertion devices for which K is a large number, that is, the electron angular excursions far exceed the natural opening angle 1/gamma, are wigglers.
Undulators have much smaller K-values, typically somewhere between 0.3 and 3.
We begin with a description of wigglers.
One can think of a wiggler simply as a bank of bending magnets in series.
If the wiggler consists of N periods of lambda_w, there are 2N bending magnets.
The output power would thus be 2N times as powerful as a single bending magnet having the same design parameters.
The horizontal angular spread of radiation emerging from wigglers is equal to phi-max and is measured in a few mrad.
Also, the spectral features of wigglers are essentially the same as from a bending magnet
- the spectra are broadband, although the flux is larger because of the 2N poles.
The power output from a wiggler has a very similar form to that already provided for bending magnets in the second video last week.
The factor of 0.633 is half that of that given for bending magnets, 1.266, because in this expression, the MAXIMUM B-field B0 is given, and this drops to zero in between the poles, whereas for the bending magnets, B is constant.
If one plugs in typical values for the electron energy, magnet field strength, wiggler length, and beam current, one obtains an output radiative power measured in several kW, and can be an order of magnitude higher still for the most powerful of these devices.
Thermal management of this is therefore critical in order to avoid optical elements downstream of the wiggler at the beamline being destroyed.
The output power after monochromatization is of the order of 10 mW, thus the efficiency of wigglers when operated at a quasi-single wavelength is of the order of 10^-6.
Their brilliance typically span a range of
10^13 to 10^17 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW.
How does one transition from a wiggler to an undulator?
As already mentioned, undulators have a much lower K-value, being close to unity.
From the expression for K, we see there are in principle two variables we could change to achieve this.
Either one decreases the magnetic field strength, or otherwise, shorten the ID period, lambda_u or w.
Reducing the magnetic field strength is a bad idea, as this will be associated with an unacceptable drop-off in the power output.
Instead, undulators generally have shorter periods, lambda_u (though they remain still of the order of several cm when designed to generate soft x-rays and ultraviolet radiation, as we shall see shortly).
So, although undulators may seem at first glance to look similar to wigglers, the main differences being in a shortening of the magnet period and a consequent reduction in K, the spectra look very different the wigglers produce broadband radiation, while undulators are characterised by narrow peaks of high intensity at regular intervals in energy.
This begs the question, Why?
The reduction in K means that the emission lobes with natural opening angle +/- 1/gamma will now overlap.
This overlap means that they interfere with one another, and consequently only certain wavelengths will interfere constructively.
So what is the condition for constructive interference?
Consider this schematic figure.
Radiation is emitted at time t = 0 at point
A. After a time t = Tâ€™ the electron has moved one undulation downstream to point B along the path S, while the radiation that originated at A has propagated a distance cTâ€².
The difference in these two distances is cTâ€² âˆ’ lambda-u, and only that radiation with a wavelength Î»n equal to an integral fraction
1/n of this will interfere constructively.
The precise derivation for this condition for destructive interference is straightforward but fairly long winded - for those interested in understanding this more deeply, it is given step-by-step in my text book â€œIntroduction to Synchrotron Radiation - Techniques and
Applicationsâ€�.
For now, however, the condition is given without derivation here for radiation along the central axis of the undulator.
This expression can be re-expressed in practical units, as shown here.
As a rule of thumb, for most 3rd-generation facilities, the fraction 13.056 lambda_u/E^2 in cm/GeV^2 is close to (normally a little larger than) unity, lets say, four, and thus nlambda_n is approximately 4 + 2K^2.
This is only an exceedingly rough guideline, and can change substantially depending on the undulator design.
Letâ€™s go with it for the time being (itâ€™s not a bad approximation, for example, for the undulator serving the Materials Science beamline at the Swiss Light Source).
Let us consider, for example, the fifth harmonic
(n = 5), and a K-value of 1.5.
This results in 5 times lambda_5 = 8.5, and therefore lambda_5, the wavelength selected at the fifth harmon = 1.7 Angstroms.
But this seems to imply that one can only select very specific wavelengths.
If for one reason or another one wants to access a wavelength in between the maxima, shown schematically here with the yellow arrow, or indeed if one wants to SCAN the energy continuously, how does one go about this?
Again, the clue is in our expression for K.
We cannot easily change either gamma, the storage-ring energy, or lambda_u, the undulator period, but we CAN change B0, the maximum
B-field.
If, for example, we increase the field by driving the upper and lower jaws of the undulator magnet array together,
K will increase.
The term on the right hand side of our expression for the condition for constructive interference also increases, and thus for a given n, lambda_n will also increase (and the photon energy will DECREASE).
We therefore need only to adjust the gap size so that the spectrum contracts along the energy axis until a spectral maximum lies at our energy (or wavelength) of interest.
Undulators are therefore tuned by varying the gap between the poles of the magnet array.
So, for example, a gap size of 5.5 mm might produce an undulator-spectrum such as shown here, while decreasing this to 4.5 mm will access a different set of maxima.
One cannot decrease the gap size to arbitrarily small values.
Below a certain gap, the weak halo of electrons that generally surround the main electron beam will collide with the magnets and quickly destroy them, and also produce a high flux of so-called Bremsstrahlung, containing photon energies as high as the storage-ring energy, in the hard gamma-ray regime.
So any given undulator will have a design minimum gap size.
In order to tune from low to high energies, therefore, one proceeds as follows.
The gap is closed to its minimum allowed value, here 4 mm.
In this example, the first harmonic is inaccessible as the beamline was designed for energies above about 5 keV.
So we begin with the second harmonic.
This will drift to higher energies from, in this example, approximately 4 keV to 5.5 keV, as the gap is opened, as shown here.
Opening the gap still further is thereafter no longer profitable, as the energy now becomes accessible using the next harmonic, the third harmonic, at the smallest gap, for which the power output is highest.
Thus, one jumps repeatedly from one harmonic to the next as soon as that next harmonic can access the energy with the smallest allowed gap.
The photon emittance of undulators is the narrowest of all 3rd generation sources, being approximately equal to 1/sqrt(nN) gamma, where small n is the harmonic number, and large
N is the number of periods in the undulator array.
This is measured in a few microradians to a few tens of microradian.
Donâ€™t forget, however, that in the horizontal plane, the emittance is much larger due to contributions for the electron beam.
Even in the vertical direction, the electron contribution will dominate, but less so.
In addition the relative spectral width of the odd harmonics (which for subtle reasons that lie outside the scope of this introductory course, are more intense and narrower than the even harmonics), is given by lambda_n/Delta lambda_n = small n times large N.
The spectrally integrated power from undulators is much less than that from wigglers, by an order of magnitude, while their peak intensities are generally significantly higher.
Undulators are, at about 10^-4, therefore approximately 100 times more efficient than wigglers and pose a less severe problem regarding thermal management, though this can still be significant if one considers that the beam divergence is much smaller than for wigglers, hence the areal power density on the first optical elements before monochromatization can be higher still than for wigglers.
The brilliance of undulators is approximately
10^18 to 10^21 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW, three orders of magnitude larger than for wigglers.
We finish this video by briefly mentioning that the polarisation of the light produced by undulators can be adjusted so that any desired polarisation can be achieved regarding both its angle around the emission axis (i.e., anywhere between conventional linear horizontal polarisation and linear vertical) and its degree of ellipticity, between linear and fully circular.
This is achieved using a so-called APPLE undulator.
Both the upper and lower magnet arrays are split lengthways in two, and one subset can be shifted longitudinally with respect to the other.
Shown here are just five possible configurations. of linear horizontal (LH), linear vertical
(LV), linear tilted (LT), right-circularly polarised (RCP) and left-circularly polarised
(LCP).
This capability can be crucial to the success of certain spectroscopic techniques such as, to name just one example, in x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD).
In summary, you have learnt in this video how electrons are steered, focussed, and squeezed in the magnet lattice, while the physics of insertion devices has also been described.
In the next and final video of this week, the physics of diffraction-limited storage rings and XFELs will be covered.
