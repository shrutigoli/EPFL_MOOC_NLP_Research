00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,930
Hello, and welcome to this, the second video
of week 8.

2
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:19,460
In this video, we will discuss important variants
of synchrotron-based tomography, namely phase-contrast

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,500
methods, and high-speed tomography.

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,649
Shown here are the absorption lengths of different
materials at different photon energies, with

5
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:39,430
representative objects corresponding to typical
lengths scales shown on the right.

6
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,789
High-density samples absorb strongly, even
for fairly high-energy photons.

7
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:52,760
Hence, for example, medical radiographs of
bones or teeth use a broad band of energies,

8
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,469
but peaking in the range of several tens of
keV.

9
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,449
On the other hand, traditional radiography
and absorption tomography, while providing

10
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:11,210
invaluable information on a wide spectrum
of materials and objects, runs into problems

11
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:20,380
for samples which are small and/or composed
of low-density material.

12
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:28,061
The attenuation length of flesh, for example,
is around 2 to 3 mm at 10 keV, and an order

13
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:33,940
of magnitude larger at 25 keV.

14
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:43,729
This means that some of the most scientifically
interesting biological samples provide only

15
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,310
poor contrast.

16
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:56,240
In addition, objects which absorb only weakly
tend also to absorb fairly homogeneously throughout

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,330
their internal structure, even if this is
composed of distinct heterogeneous components.

18
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:11,800
So, a strongly absorbing object will show
a clear absorption profile , while little

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:20,180
or no observable contrast will be seen for
a weakly absorbing sample . Again, this is

20
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,629
exemplified by biological samples, where objects
with quite distinct biological functions and

21
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:35,840
structures become almost indistinguishable
with regards to their x-ray absorption coefficients.

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:45,130
So, if absorption becomes an increasingly
poor metric for small and weakly absorbing

23
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:51,450
samples is there another phenomenon we can
exploit to obtain the necessary contrast?

24
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:07,980
Well, yes, there is, namely refraction . This
is exploited in phase-contrast tomography.

25
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:19,610
Remember that any material has a complex refractive
index in the x-ray regime, given by n = 1

26
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:29,239
- delta + i beta.The effect of this is on
the one hand, to attenuate the beam through

27
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:37,019
the beta term, but also to increase the x-ray
wavelength within the medium by a factor of

28
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,189
1/(1-delta).

29
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:50,579
The graph shown here is of the transmission,
refractive-index decrement delta, and absorption

30
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:58,430
index beta, of 1 mm of flesh as a function
of photon energy.

31
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:09,400
Note first, that above 10 or 15 keV, the transmission
rapidly approaches unity, that is, very little

32
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,579
absorption occurs.

33
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:20,799
This is good regarding radiation damage of
the soft, biological sample, but bad for absorption-contrast

34
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,889
measurements.

35
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:32,200
Note also, that the drop-off of beta with
photon energy follows a 1/hv^4 dependence,

36
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,400
while that of delta is only 1/hv^2.

37
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,449
But how exactly does refraction provide the
desired contrast?

38
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:52,190
We begin by assuming ray optics only, ignoring
diffraction effects.

39
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,860
Although this does not represent reality,
it does provide some insights into what we

40
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,140
might expect to see.

41
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:13,280
Let us imagine a block of material of length
L and real part of the refractive index (that

42
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:20,750
is, the part responsible for refraction) 1
- delta.

43
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:28,420
Consider two identical (i.e., coherent) plane
waves, one of which passes through the block,

44
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,139
while the other passes by it.

45
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:39,530
Although the phases of the two waves are identical
as the first enters the block, refraction

46
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,880
causes this to advance relative to the second
block travelling through vacuum.

47
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,620
How much is this advance?

48
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:54,430
Well, the number of wavelengths associated
with the second wave travelling through vacuum

49
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:10,810
a distance equal to the block thickness, L,
is simply L/lambda.

50
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:37,880
The number of wavelengths passing through
the block, on the other hand, is L(1-delta)/lambda,

51
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:47,560
hence the difference between the waves is
simply L delta/lambda.

52
00:06:47,560 --> 00:07:02,220
Let us consider an object that is 100 microns
long, and has a value for delta of 7 x 10^-7

53
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:21,669
at 20 keV (a photon energy which equates to
0.62 Angstroms in vacuum).

54
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:31,210
The 
difference in the number of wavelengths is

55
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:44,310
thus 1.13 periods, or 7.1 radians.

56
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,840
If the block presents a nonnormal surface
to the incident or exit waves, refraction

57
00:07:50,840 --> 00:08:06,639
will bend the beam, causing it to overlap
with the beam passing by the object.

58
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,440
A more realistic description of the effect
of refraction on the transmitted beam is consider

59
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,770
diffraction phenomena by using Huygens construction.

60
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,940
This states that, given a certain wavefront
form, the subsequent wavefront in the direction

61
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,520
of propagation can be constructed by adding
secondary spherical wavelets of the same wavelength

62
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,950
to each point along that wavefront.

63
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,850
So a plane wave will generate another plane
wave, as shown here on the left.

64
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:55,360
Now, if some obstacle blocks the path of the
wavefront, as shown by the black bar in the

65
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,970
central figure, the wavelets in this region
are removed, and interference between the

66
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:10,750
remaining unblocked wavelets results in fringes
forming as they propagate in the forward direction

67
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:22,700
- at sufficiently large distances, Z_0, this
is, in fact, the diffraction pattern, or Fourier

68
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,090
transform of the edge.

69
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:34,250
At very short distances, on the other hand,
for example, if a detector butts up against

70
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:41,110
the absorbing block, little or no diffraction
effect is observed.

71
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:48,770
Using approximations, it is a simple exercise
to show that the distance x_1 of the first

72
00:09:48,770 --> 00:10:01,360
minimum after the geometrical end of the absorbing
block is given by the square root of Z_0 lambda/2.

73
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:13,150
Let us consider two examples of Z_0 for lambda
= 0.7 Angstrom.

74
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:21,860
For Z_0 = 10 mm, x_1 = 0.59 microns.

75
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:33,120
For Z_0 = 1 m, however, x_1 = 5.9 microns.

76
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,470
Any detector with a pixel size larger than
about half of the fringe separation is unable

77
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,400
to resolve this interference phenomenon.

78
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:53,040
Hence the detector would need a pixel size
smaller than 0.3 microns and 3 microns, respectively,

79
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:04,760
for the short and large detector distance
from the object.

80
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,950
Why then, don’t we simply move further downstream
of the object until the fringes are large

81
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:23,900
enough to match the detector we might be using
at the time?

82
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:31,090
The problem is, that the propagated scattering
pattern evolves gradually from being a more

83
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:40,550
or less faithful reproduction of the absorption
profile at very short distances , that is,

84
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:51,540
distances much smaller than a^2/lambda, a
being the typical size of fluctuations in

85
00:11:51,540 --> 00:12:05,740
the architecture of the sample (This absorption
profile, remember, is, however, almost undetectable

86
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:17,331
for weakly absorbing samples), to being the
true diffraction pattern of the object at

87
00:12:17,331 --> 00:12:34,830
very large distances , i.e., much larger than
a^2/lambda in 

88
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:47,200
the so-called Fraunhofer regime . It is at
the sweet spot between these two limits where

89
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:56,170
Z_0 is of the order of a^2/lambda, that the
sample profile is still preserved, but for

90
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,420
which the boundaries between heterogeneous
components are highlighted, not by the insignificant

91
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,510
absorption, but by interference fringes.

92
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,670
This is called the Fresnel regime.

93
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,390
This technique of phase-contrast tomography
is beautifully demonstrated by this example

94
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:22,160
of prehistoric insects trapped within an opaque
amber block.

95
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:36,410
In this first image, recorded at a distance
of 50 mm, using 30-keV (or 0.413 Angstrom)

96
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:45,070
photons, little or no detail can be discerned
in this radiograph.

97
00:13:45,070 --> 00:14:00,441
The first fringe separation x_1 is at a distance
of one micron, whereas the detector used at

98
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:11,420
the ID19 station of the ESRF had a pixel size
of 5 microns and was thus incapable of respiring

99
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,400
these fine diffraction fringes.

100
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:28,290
Increasing the distance to one metre, however,
meant that the fringes are separated by a

101
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:36,050
distance of approximately 5 microns, just
enough to provide a one pixel-width intensity

102
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,880
contrast.

103
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,050
The emergence of exquisite detail by optimising
the sample-detector distance is wonderfully

104
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,760
clear.

105
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,390
Phase-contrast tomography is likely to profit
significantly from the emergence of 4th-generation

106
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,090
diffraction limited storage rings.

107
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:00,110
This is because the technique exploits the
coherent fraction of the synchrotron beam,

108
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,670
which, in 3rd-generation facilities, is a
small fraction of a percent.

109
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:13,810
The coherent fraction of DLSRs is inversely
proportional to the emittance, and will thus

110
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:19,930
increase accordingly, that is, by approximately
two orders of magnitude, allowing much higher

111
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:26,220
data-acquisition rates.

112
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,500
This leads us naturally on to the subject
of high-speed tomography, in which the three-dimensional

113
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,990
structure of an object is recorded as a function
of time.

114
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:46,070
Two sorts of experiment can be performed - either
irreversible processes, or cyclic ones.

115
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,190
The former requires that any changes during
the process be recorded with sufficient speed

116
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,270
and accuracy.

117
00:15:53,270 --> 00:16:00,390
This is presently limited to ten or 20 Hz,
with up to possibly another order of magnitude

118
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:07,610
envisaged in the next few years.

119
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:15,740
In cyclic processes, faster frame rates are
accessible by using a stroboscopic approach.

120
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:25,940
Imagine a rubber rod being repeatedly compressed
and then releases to its relaxed state.

121
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:34,730
Instead of trying to record a full 180 degree
rotation for each time interval Delta T during

122
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:42,880
the cycle of duration big T, radiographs are
recorded in one orientation only as quickly

123
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,420
as possible over time T.

124
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:57,670
The sample is then rotated by a small amount,
and the cycle repeated.

125
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:04,040
The tomogram for each time interval Delta
T is then obtained by selecting the appropriate

126
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,760
radiograph from each set of nonrotating images.

127
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:20,220
There are, needless to say, several technical
obstacles associated with high-speed tomography.

128
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:28,319
First, the exposure between frames needs to
be long enough to obtain sufficiently non-noisy

129
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,070
images.

130
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:37,000
Secondly, rapid rotations will impose significant
forces on the object.

131
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,480
Consider, for example, a sample with a 2-mm
radius rotating at 20 Hz.

132
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,080
The centripetal acceleration is omega^2 r,
where omega = 2pi nu = 126 radian/second.

133
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:11,660
This equates to an acceleration of 31.6 m/s^2,
or 3g, the acceleration experienced by astronauts

134
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,110
on the space shuttle.

135
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:20,000
For soft or liquid samples, this might be
unacceptably severe, and must be taken into

136
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,530
consideration.

137
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:29,990
Thirdly, imagine an irreversible process being
recorded at a time resolution of 50 ms (again,

138
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:40,010
corresponding to 20 Hz) within which 400 angular
orientations are to be recorded.

139
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:48,500
This results in a frame rate of 8000/second.

140
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:58,820
If we assume that each radiograph requires
1 Mbyte of storage, this means that data transfer,

141
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,580
either directly, or to a buffer, must be capable
of at least 8 GB/s.

142
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:13,390
An intensive beamtime can therefore produce
hundreds of terabytes per day, far in excess

143
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,370
of what a “standard” PC can handle.

144
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,770
The problem of data management looms large
in tomography, and also, in ptychography,

145
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,950
described in more detail in the third video
of this week.

146
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,790
We finish this second video with an example
of high-speed tomography, in which the flight

147
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,430
muscles and breathing network of a blowfly
are followed.

148
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:46,700
At the start of the video, the insect is facing
to the left (the head is out of the field

149
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:53,030
of view so appears clipped) and the attachment
point of the mount on the fly’s back is

150
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,900
visible at the top of the thorax.

151
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,480
As the view orbits the flying insect, the
deformations of the thorax are clearly visible

152
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,310
as the wing moves up and down, in particular
the pitching and heaving motions of the bristle-covered

153
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:15,300
structure behind the mount.

154
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:21,900
Also visible are the beating halteres (dumbbell-shaped
structures modified from the hindwings), which

155
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:29,571
oscillate in a void covered by the calypteres
(semi-transparent membranous structures, with

156
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:30,890
an opaque border).

157
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,760
At 30s, a sagittal clipping plane is introduced
computationally.

158
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:44,421
This first reveals the dorsoventral flight
muscles, coloured blue to purple, that power

159
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:51,141
the wingbeat, along with the dorsolongitudinal
flight muscles (not coloured) that become

160
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:57,440
visible as the clipping plane moves further
into the thorax.

161
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,860
An inverse threshold filter is then applied
to reveal the tracheal network and other cavities

162
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,900
within the flight muscle (shown in green).

163
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,510
The clipping plane then continues to move
through the thorax until the steering muscles

164
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:25,720
that provide fine control over the wingbeat
are visible (coloured yellow to purple).

165
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:32,240
This second video has introduced you to two
powerful variations of tomography.

166
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,180
Phase-contrast techniques are employed in
order to highlight the boundaries between

167
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:42,860
heterogeneous components of an object by differences
not in their absorption, which can be very

168
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,810
small, in particular for low-density biological
samples, but instead by differences in the

169
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:58,660
refractive index, which remains more sensitive,
even for low-Z materials.

170
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,800
Both absorption tomography and phase-contrast
tomography can be carried out at high speeds

171
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:11,340
if (a) the flux is sufficiently high; and
(b) the acquisition rates are high enough

172
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:18,150
to capture temporal changes in the object
with suitable resolution.

173
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,620
This method is becoming increasingly popular
in the real world where changes are the norm,

174
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:28,060
not the exception.

175
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,750
In the final video of this week, we will discuss
two techniques, coherent x-ray diffractive

176
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,951
imaging and ptychography, which are based
not on direct imaging like tomography, but

177
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:46,900
instead on lensless techniques, which allow
the experimenter to bridge the spatial-resolution

178
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:55,020
gap between tomography and electron microscopies
and crystal diffraction, while also allowing

179
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,090
the internal structure of the sample to be
probed.
