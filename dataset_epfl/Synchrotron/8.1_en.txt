Welcome to the first video of Week 8 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week, we will discuss x-ray imaging techniques, including different flavours of x-ray tomography, coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, and ptychography.
In this first video, after some introductory comments, the basic concepts behind x-ray tomography are presented.
The first point to mention is that the choice of the methods described this week is perhaps a little arbitrary, as a large fraction of third-generation synchrotron-based experiments can be said to be imaging methods.
In fact, synchrotrons are often presented to the general public as being exceedingly powerful microscopes.
For example, photoemission electron microscopy directly images absorption maps via the secondary electrons that are emitted; scanning-x-ray-fluorescence plots the intensity of certain photon energies associated with emission from selected elements as a function of sample position; while even x-ray diffraction provides â€œimagesâ€� of unit cells from diffraction data after solving the phase problem.
X-ray computed tomography, and the two related techniques of CXDI and ptychography are covered here, because they sit rather uncomfortably within the techniques described to date, although
CXDI and ptychography are closely related to small-angle x-ray scattering, and ptychography also has much in common with scanning transmission x-ray microscopy.
It is the relative transparency of condensed matter to hard x-rays that makes them such a powerful tool for investigating the internal structures of objects in a nondestructive manner.
Indeed, this benefit of x-rays was the first to be recognized and which caused such a sensation immediately after their discovery more than a century ago - imagine the frisson of wonder or even horror the public must have experienced at the first display of the radiograms of
Roentgenâ€™s wifeâ€™s and of his colleague von Kollikerâ€™s hands!
Medical radiographic imaging remains the most widespread application of hard x-radiation well over a century later.
The word â€™tomographyâ€™ is derived from the Greek words â€˜tomosâ€™ meaning â€˜to sliceâ€™ and â€˜graphâ€™ meaning â€˜imageâ€™.
Tomography in its most general sense is the generation of a three-dimensional image by analyzing several transmission radiographic projections taken of a specimen at different angles.
This requires radiation which has an absorption length of the same order of magnitude as the size of the specimen under investigation.
Nowadays, computed tomography with a resolution of approximately 500 microns is a standard diagnostic medical imaging tool in hospitals around the world.
Approximately 100 million CT scans per year are performed in the United States alone.
High-resolution x-ray tomographic microscopy is a synchrotron-based nondestructive microscopy technique for creating quantitative, three-dimensional images of solid objects, including their detailed internal architecture, with a spatial resolution which can extend well below the micron range.
It is useful for a wide range of materials, including inorganic substances such as rock, concrete, ceramic, or metal, and also for objects made from bone and soft tissue.
In recent years, optimization of tomography beamlines using high x-ray fluxes has driven the speed of data acquisition to such an extent that it is now routine to record entire tomography scans in a few seconds or even, in favourable circumstances, in the subsecond timescale.
Time-resolved biomedical studies using tomography of processes such as breathing or blood circulation are now possible, and processes on timescales well below a tenth of a second are beginning to be probed.
Tomography provides a deeper insight into the structure of bodies.
Now, when one sees a radiograph of a hand, it is immediately clear what this is - a hand.
It would be a very strange object indeed that looked so much like a hand but actually wasnâ€™t.
Now letâ€™s consider the simple example shown here . This radiograph would be consistent, for example, with this 3-dimensional object, viewed from in front.
However, it would be also compatible with this object here, in which the bottom row of two blocks are separated, or indeed, with this object here, a more radically different object than the first set of blocks.
Viewing these structures from the right reveals their differences and provides the necessary added information to unambiguously reconstruct the real bodies.
For more complex bodies, more angular perspectives are required to unravel their structure, both internal, and their envelope.
This is the basis of tomography.
The basic principles behind tomography are shown here in this cartoon.
The x-ray transmission image, or radiograph of an object placed in a parallel x-ray beam is recorded on a scintillator.
The visible output of the scintillator is then imaged (and magnified) on to a CCD array.
The object is then rotated by a small amount and a new radiogram is recorded.
This process continues until the object has been rotated through a full half-circle (180 degrees).
For each row of the CCD, the pixel response of that row can be plotted out as a function of the object angular orientation in a so-called sinogram.
As we will discuss in the following slide, the sinograms are analysed using a computer, each sinogram thereby providing a 2-D slice of the object in the horizontal plane at a height given by that of the row of pixels that generated it.
Let us look more closely at these sinograms.
Consider an object irradiated from a certain angle, alpha_1, producing at a certain height
(or row of pixels) an absorbtion profile, which we label profile 1.
The transmission at any pixel along the row is proportional to the inverse exponent of the integrated absorption coefficient along the path of the x-rays travelling through the object to that pixel.
We consider one of these paths l_1 that passes through the red dot at (x,y), which has a certain absorption coefficient mu(x,y).
The transmitted intensity is expressed mathematically here.
At another angle alpha_2, we obtain a different profile, profile 2 . The intensity at the pixel at the end of the path l_2 that also passes through the same red dot at (x,y), is given by a similar expression . Note that both the integrands mu(l_1) and mu(l_2) contain this common point mu(x, y) where they intersect with each other.
Hence the value that mu(x,y) can assume has been a little constrained by these two conditions of the recorded intensities I(alpha_1, l_1) and I(alpha_2, l_2).
By recording many different angles, the value of mu(x,y) becomes more strictly constrained, as indeed do all other positions of this section of the object.
Johann Radon provided the mathematics to extract the spatial distribution of mu in a so-called
Radon transform . The mathematical details behind this were translated into English and published in the reference provided here bottom left.
What advantages does tomography confer over transitional radiographic projections?
Let us consider two adjacent rows of â€œvoxelsâ€� within a tomographic slice.
Voxels are the three-dimensional equivalent of pixels within the 3-D tomographic reconstruction.
The size of the voxel is given by the pixel dimensions and the angular step size.
In the radiographic projection, the two intensities correspond to the sum of the absorption contributions of all the voxels in their respective lines.
The sums result here in very similar transmissions, although the individual voxels in the two rows are substantially different - so for example, the two absorption strength of the voxels highlighted here are very different from each other.
In other words, the contrast between individual voxels in the tomographic reconstruction is in general much higher than that in a radiographic projection.
And, of course, one gets to see the detailed three-dimensional internal architecture.
An alternative approach to obtaining tomographic slices has become possible with the emergence of modern and powerful computers, which are capable of performing so-called fast Fourier transforms
(FFTs) and inverse FFTs exceedingly quickly.
The approach is based on the so-called Fourier slice theorem.
This states that the Fourier transform of the 1-D projection (in this coordinate system, along x) of an object at a certain height
(here, z) through that object is equal to the central line section through a 2D Fourier transform of a slice through that object at the same height, z.
One thus repeats this procedure at different angles until all of Fourier space is mapped with the desired accuracy.
However, what one now has is an uneven distribution of points in the Fourier transform, so you need to interpolate the data from this polar distribution to orthogonal Cartesian coordinates.
From this, the inverse Fourier transform yields the tomogram slice.
Lastly, improved contrast in tomographic images can be achieved by recording below and above an absorption edge of a material known to exist in the sample, such as here for a caesium plume in igneous rock.
By subtracting one from the other , an enhanced image for that material is generated.
Summarizing this first video, we have demonstrated that tomography is a powerful technique to nondestructively image the 3-dimensional internal architecture of bodies with a high contrast that is inaccessible to standard radiographic methods.
In the next video, we will discuss two variants of tomography, namely phase-contrast tomography, and high-speed tomography.
