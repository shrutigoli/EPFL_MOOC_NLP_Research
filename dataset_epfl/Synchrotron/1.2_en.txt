In this second video of the first week of this course, we consider why are x-rays so ubiquitous in society and in scientific endeavours.
Before we answer this, a distinction should be made between x-rays of different energy ranges, as their interactions with matter vary strongly accordingly.
Typically, one speaks of soft, tender, and hard x-rays.
Soft x-rays begin after the visible and ultraviolet regime and cover a wavelength range of approximately
100 nm down to 0.6 nm; hard x-rays have wavelengths shorter than 0.3 nm.
Perhaps counterintuitively, it is soft x-rays that in general interact much more strongly with matter than do hard x-rays, and it is this property which has resulted in their distinction.
Because the transition between soft and hard x-rays is not abrupt and is anyway somewhat arbitrary, depending strongly on the material being irradiated, the concept of tender x-rays was introduced to bridge these two regimes.
Normally, however, one characterizes x-rays by their photon energy E rather than their wavelength Î».
A photon is the indivisible quantum unit of light characterized by the lightâ€™s wavelength or frequency, and was first postulated by
Albert Einstein in 1905.
The relationship between energy and wavelength is given by the Planck-Einstein relation E
= hc/Î», where h is Planckâ€™s constant = 6.63 x 10-34 J.s and c is the speed of light in vacuum = 2.9979 x 10^8 m/s.
See the supplementary table for a list of the physical constants most commonly used in this course.
Inserting these into the equation, one sees that even for the hardest (that is, the most energetic) x-rays used in synchrotron science
(which have wavelengths of the order of a picometer), photon energies are of the order of a tenth of a thousandth of a billionth of a Joule (i.e., 10-13 J).
The Joule is therefore obviously not a convenient energy unit to use when discussing x-ray photon energies - I would never tell my doctor, for example, that I weigh 4.27 x 10-29 solar masses.
Instead, we use the electronvolt.
This is the gain in kinetic energy of an electron when it is accelerated across an electric potential of 1 Volt and is equal to 1.6022 x 10-19 Joules.
Using this unit of energy, one can quickly derive this simple practical relationship between photon energy expressed in electron volts and wavelength expressed in nanometers, given by E in eV = 1239.84/lambda in nanometers.
Because many x-ray scientists prefer to use the length unit Angstrom (0.1 of a nanometer
= 10-10 m), we can also re-express the relationship as E in eV = 12398.4/lambda, where lambda is now expressed in Angstroms.
So, for example, the photon energy of one-Angstrom hard x-rays is 12.3984 keV.
We will use this expression many times in this course, so I recommend you become familiar with it.
The different x-ray regimes shown earlier are redrawn here, but now in relationship to the photon energy.
The vacuum ultraviolet and soft x-rays produced at synchrotrons begin at 10 to 20 eV and continue up to approximately 2000 eV.
Hard x-rays conventionally begin at 4 keV, while the tender regime spans the gap between
2 and 4 keV.
Hard x-rays are used at airports and in medicine primarily because of their large penetration depths through matter and changes in these according to the density of material being irradiated, as can be seen in this graph â€“ as a rule of thumb, the lighter the material, the more transparent it is to x-rays, while the shorter the x-ray wavelength (or, in other words, the higher the x-ray energy), the more penetrating it will be.
It is often said that x-rays are â€œnondestructiveâ€�.
This is true insofar that they allow one to see the inner structure and composition of an object without the need to open or slice it, though on another level, they can most certainly be harmful, due to chemical processes that are induced after their absorption.
A useful unit to describe absorption of x-rays is the Gray (Gy).
One Gray is equal to one Joule of absorbed radiation energy per kilogram.
A dose of approximately 5 Gy in one exposure
(equivalent to approximately 400 J absorbed radiation for an adult weighing 80 kg) will usually result in death within 14 days.
To put this in perspective, the same amount of deposited energy would warm a cup of tea up by about 0.5 degrees Celsius; or is equal to the sunlight absorbed by a sunbather on a sunny day after approximately half a secondâ€¦
This remarkable difference in the impact of the same amount of total absorbed energy is due to the fact that the x-ray photons directly channel their energy into the release of otherwise bound electrons, that can wreak havoc by inducing chemical reactions, often in a cascade effect, depending on the details of the absorption process.
Perhaps the best definition of hard x-rays is that they have wavelengths comparable to or shorter than typical distances between atoms (that is, the bond lengths).
The shortest bond length under normal pressure is that of the H2 molecule, at 0.74 Angstroms; while bonds between heavy elements can exceed
3 Angstroms, the wavelength of 4-keV photons.
Shown here is 10-keV x-radiation passing over carbon-carbon single, double, and triple bonds.
This property of hard x-rays makes them useful in investigating the atomic structures of materials, in techniques such as x-ray diffraction.
Lastly, hard x-rays have energies similar to bonding energies of core electrons in atoms.
In this figure, the four most tightly bound electron shells are plotted as a function of Z, the atomic number from Z = 1 (hydrogen) to Z = 92 (uranium).
The hard x-ray regime can access all elements with atomic numbers above Z = 20 (the atomic number of calcium).
This property can be exploited in hard x-ray spectroscopies and also in crystallography, as an aid to solving structures from data recorded at specially chosen photon energies.
What are then the main attributes of soft x-rays that make them useful tools in investigating the properties of matter?
The lower photon energy of x-rays means that they interact primarily with light atoms and the outer, or valence, electrons of heavier atoms.
This is exploited to investigate many different properties of materials such as, for example, the electronic properties of metals, semiconductors, and superconductors; the chemical composition of heterogeneous systems; or the imaging of magnetic domains down to the nanometer scale.
Summarising this video, we have discussed the wavelengths and photon energies associated with ultraviolet radiation, soft, and hard x-rays, how they interact with matter, and thereby provided a brief insight into hoe they might be applied in the natural sciences.
In the next video, we encounter synchrotrons for the first time - what they look like, with an overview of their components.
Four simple attributes synchrotrons are introduced as it is these that make them so popular.
From this, the concept of â€œbrillianceâ€�, or â€œbrightnessâ€� will be introduced as a figure of merit for the performance of synchrotron facilities.
A brief summary of the progress in brilliance over the last 100 years will lead us also to the two â€œnew kids on the blockâ€� in the world of x-ray science, namely x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSRs).
