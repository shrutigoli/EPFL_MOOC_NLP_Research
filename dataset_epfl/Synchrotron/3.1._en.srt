00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,240
Welcome to Week 3 of this introductory course
on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,750
This week, we will discuss fundamental features
regarding the generation of synchrotron light

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,630
and relevant aspects of machine physics.
To begin with, the forces acting on a charged

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:30,220
particle through an electric or magnetic field
are summarised. Following this, I will explain

5
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:36,820
why it is that charged particles, in our case
electrons, generate electromagnetic radiation

6
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:42,910
when they are accelerated. This leads us on
to the surprising features of light emission

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,360
from electrons moving at relativistic velocities,
such as found in synchrotron storage rings,

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,720
in particular the greatly enhanced emission
in the forward direction to produce a pencil-like

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,809
beam.
Storage rings are just that - closed rings

10
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:08,240
that maintain electrons on a closed path.
How the electrons are steered and manipulated

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,810
so that they remain on this path will take
up the remainder of this first video of the

12
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:19,240
week, including descriptions of the magnet
lattice and the energy source for the electrons

13
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,399
within the storage ring, namely the RF cavity.
More advanced aspects are discussed next week,

14
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:32,779
including an overview of the two newest kids
on the block, x-ray free-electron lasers,

15
00:01:32,779 --> 00:01:36,450
and diffraction-limited storage rings.

16
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:42,869
By convention, a linearly polarized electromagnetic
plane wave propagating in the positive z-direction

17
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:49,289
will, for an observer looking in the forward
z-direction, have its magnetic-field vector

18
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:59,240
always rotated +pi/2 (90 degrees) clockwise
relative to the electric-field vector. So,

19
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,669
for example, if the magnetic field points
in the positive y-direction, the E-field will

20
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:08,590
point in the positive x-direction.

21
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,750
In which directions do the electric- and magnetic-field
components of the electromagnetic radiation

22
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:20,310
act upon an electron? The force imparted by
an electric field on an electron (with its

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,130
negative charge) always acts perpendicular
to the direction of propagation and (because

24
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,069
of the electron’s negative charge) in the
opposite direction of the electric-field vector,

25
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:43,590
that is F_E = -little e the elementary charge,
times big E, the electric field amplitude.

26
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,959
We now discuss the magnetic Lorentz force
acting on a moving electron with velocity

27
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:54,140
v. First, you should note that the conventional
current is opposite in direction to the electron

28
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,140
motion, and that the positive direction of
the magnetic field B is defined as being from

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,909
the north to south pole. Hence, bending magnets
in synchrotron facilities in which the electrons

30
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:13,049
circulate in a clockwise sense (viewed from
above) will have the north poles above the

31
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:22,519
south poles, and vice-versa for “anticlockwise”
storage rings.

32
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:28,840
The direction of the magnetic Lorentz force
F_L acts perpendicularly to the plane defined

33
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,980
by the electron’s direction of motion and
the magnetic-field vector B. It is proportional

34
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,959
to the cross-product of v and B. If, as in
the case shown here, the electrons copropagate

35
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,269
in the same positive z-direction as the EM-field,
then the Lorentz force will have its maximum

36
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:59,139
magnitude F_L = eBv and in a direction opposite
to that of the electric force.

37
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,540
From classical electromagnetism, it emerges
that the relationship between the

38
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:15,680
magnetic-field amplitude B and the electric-field
amplitude E of an EM-wave is B = E/c and hence

39
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,049
from this and the expressions for the electric
and magnetic forces

40
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:29,640
we immediately observe that the ratio of the
two forces is simply -v/c. As a consequence,

41
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:36,650
the Lorentz force only becomes non-negligible
compared to the electric-field force for electrons

42
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,349
travelling at relativistic velocities.

43
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:45,840
We now move on by asking the question “why
does a synchrotron, which is in essence simply

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,180
a collection of electrons moving at very high
velocities around a closed path, produce electromagnetic

45
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:59,039
radiation?” First of all, it should be mentioned
that typically, the kinetic energies of the

46
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,010
electrons within a storage ring of a synchrotron
all have the same value within approximately

47
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,629
0.1% of each other, which might seem to imply
that they are not being accelerated. Don’t

48
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:18,380
forget, however, that acceleration also includes
a change in direction, even if the magnitude

49
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,330
of the velocity remains constant, such as
in the case of a ball being whirled round

50
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,670
on the end of a string. The centripetal force
always acts at right angles to the ball’s

51
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:37,169
motion, as does the associated acceleration.
So when we ask why a charged particle produces

52
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:45,039
light when accelerated, we should consider
three cases - the conventional interpretation

53
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,960
of acceleration, i.e., an increase in speed;
the opposite, that is, DEceleration; and lastly,

54
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,060
centripetal acceleration. This third case
applies to synchrotron light.

55
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:05,610
OK. we still haven’t answered our question.
Let us begin with a stationary charged particle.

56
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,740
From hereon in, I will assume for simplicity
that the charged particle is an electron.

57
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,159
The electrostatic electric field lines radiate
out from the electron equally in straight

58
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:22,560
lines in all directions and at the speed of
light. Any observer looking at the electron

59
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,180
will see no transverse component of those
electric field lines because, as I’ve just

60
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,750
said, they point directly from the electron
to the observer’s eye. But electromagnetic

61
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:42,169
radiation is a transverse wave, that is, the
electric (and magnetic) field lines are perpendicular

62
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:48,930
to the direction of motion. So we can conclude
that an observer will never see light emitted

63
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,900
from a stationary electron. For simple reasons
which I will not dwell on here, the same is

64
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,169
true of an electron moving at a constant velocity.

65
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:06,479
Now let us consider the case where the electron
bounces off a wall and reverses its direction.

66
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,470
Clearly here, it has undergone an acceleration
(or in day-to-day parlance, a sudden deceleration

67
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:20,050
and acceleration). An observer will see no
electric field until a time after the electron’s

68
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:29,389
bounce, equal to the distance between the
observer and electron, divided by the speed

69
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:36,900
of light. But at this moment, there will be
an abrupt lateral shift in the electric-field

70
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,229
lines - the observer sees a lateral component
in the electric fields, which is synonymous

71
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:48,699
with the generation of light. Note also, that
although an observer at position B sees this

72
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:55,160
pulse of light clearly, an observer at A will
continue to see nothing, because the acceleration

73
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,860
was along her line of sight. This is an important
fact to keep in mind - light generated by

74
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,770
acceleration of charged particles has zero
intensity in the direction of that acceleration.

75
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:15,740
Let us extend this idea further by allowing
the electron to bounce repeatedly back and

76
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:22,199
forth between two walls. The resultant field
lines will include abrupt lateral components

77
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,819
(light) that appear regularly after each bounce.

78
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:33,970
Now, if instead of the electron moving with
constant speed between two walls, we instead

79
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,700
drive it sinusoidally, the resulting electric
field will have the same frequency and thus

80
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:48,240
mimic the driving acceleration. So if the
driving acceleration of the electron is itself

81
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,530
caused by the electric field component of
light, the electron will re-emit light at

82
00:08:53,530 --> 00:09:04,960
exactly the same frequency. This is identical
to the elastic, or Thomson, scattering of

83
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:09,010
light by electrons we covered in last week’s
lectures. It is for this reason that metals

84
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,710
reflect visible light and therefore why mirrors
work - the essentially free conduction electrons

85
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:22,501
in the metal that allow it to conduct electricity
respond to incident light and re-emit it with

86
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:24,130
high fidelity.

87
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,530
Note once more that along the axis of acceleration,
the observer will see no light. The electric-field

88
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,321
amplitude follows the cosine of chi, the polar
angle between incident beam’s direction

89
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:44,520
of propagation and the axis of the observer,
as shown here. This is referred to a dipole

90
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,100
radiation. The light INTENSITY varies as the
square of this, that is cosine-squared chi.

91
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,810
So, how would the emitted radiation from an
electron executing a circular path look like?

92
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,600
The acceleration is towards the centre of
the circle, hence the symmetry axis of the

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,380
doughnut, or “horn torus” form of the
dipole radiation also lies in this direction.

94
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,880
This doesn’t seem to look much like the
pencil-like radiation distribution associated

95
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,399
with synchrotron light, so what’s missing?
What’s missing is relativity. Before we

96
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,480
get to this, we need to know what the typical
energies are of the electrons circulating

97
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,310
in the storage ring of synchrotrons.

98
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,510
In this graph, a selection of synchrotron
facilities has been chosen that cover the

99
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:41,451
typical range of electron energies, expressed
in GeV (billions of electron volts). As one

100
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:49,260
can see, these span about 2 to 8 GeV, and
provide photon energies over almost 5 orders

101
00:10:49,260 --> 00:11:00,910
of magnitude, from ultraviolet photons at
10 eV to almost 1 MeV. On average, the higher

102
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:08,340
the storage-ring energy, the higher the range
of photon energies.

103
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:23,140
If we were to calculate the electron velocities
using Newtonian mechanics (that is, not taking

104
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:31,450
relativistic effects into account), we would
equate the electron energy to 1/2 mv-squared,

105
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:44,640
where m = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg is the rest mass
of an electron, and would, say for 3 GeV electron,

106
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,390
obtain velocities of approximately 3.2 x 10^10
m/s, over 100 times faster than the speed

107
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,240
of light.

108
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,421
But because we know the speed of light is
Nature’s ultimate speed limit, it’s clear

109
00:11:59,421 --> 00:12:06,360
we need to apply relativity. The relationship
between the electrons’ relativistic kinetic

110
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,820
energy (given by the storage-ring energy)
and the velocity is given by the expression

111
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,730
shown here. The ratio between the electrons’
velocity and c, the speed of light is called

112
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,260
beta.

113
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,410
An important parameter, which we will use
repeatedly to determine several aspects of

114
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:31,660
synchrotron light, including its divergence,
its intensity in the forward direction, and

115
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,840
the relativistic mass of the electron, is
gamma, defined as the ratio between the electrons’

116
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,370
kinetic energy and

117
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:48,740
mc^2, the rest mass energy of the electron
(highlighted here in red).

118
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,950
In special relativity, this is the amount
of energy (other than the energy residing

119
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:02,900
in mass itself) that would be created if an
electron at rest was annihilated. If one plugs

120
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:12,160
in the known values for m and c into this,
one obtains a value for mc^2 of 82 fJ, or

121
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:23,140
511 keV. So, for example, if an electron and
positron meet, they annihilate one another,

122
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:30,330
and create two x-ray photons, each of energy
511 keV.

123
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:36,290
Because mc^2 is a constant for a given particle
type (here, an electron), we can reformulate

124
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:43,390
our expression for gamma in practical terms
as gamma = 1957 multiplied by the storage

125
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:51,270
ring energy expressed in GeV. So, for example,
a 2-GeV storage ring facility would have a

126
00:13:51,270 --> 00:14:00,920
gamma of 3914, that is, each electron has
an energy almost 4000 times its own rest-mass

127
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:07,080
energy. Remember our original expression however,
relating the electron energy to its velocity

128
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,920
(or beta = v/c).

129
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:19,100
From this, we immediately see that gamma = 1/sqrt(1
- beta^2).

130
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,540
If we square both sides of this, and perform
two trivial algebraic steps, we can instead

131
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,790
express beta, the ratio of v to c, as a function
of gamma, as shown here.

132
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,790
We can simplify this still further as follows.
We know that in general, gamma is a large

133
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:43,060
number for synchrotrons. For essentially all
synchrotrons, it assumes a value somewhere

134
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:50,250
between approximately 2000 and 16000. gamma^2
is therefore exceedingly large, of the order

135
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,790
of several million to a few hundreds of million,
and so the reciprocal of this, 1/gamma^2,

136
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,760
is tiny.
In the supplementary document listing useful

137
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,980
mathematical equations and approximations,
the Taylor expansion for (1+x)^n is provided,

138
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:20,120
and, to a very high degree of accuracy, is
equal to 1 + nx. In this instance, x = 1/gamma^2,

139
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,510
and therefore we can approximate the top equation
here being approximately equal to beta equals

140
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:36,970
1 - 1/2 gamma^2. The inaccuracy to this approximation
is about than one part in 10^15. . . accurate

141
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,660
enough, I’d say!

142
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,870
So let’s now consider what numbers emerge
for the real example of the MAX-IV facility

143
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:51,960
in Lund, Sweden, which has just come online
this Summer. From our practical expression

144
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,610
for gamma, we immediately see that this assumes
a value of approximately 5900. From this,

145
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:07,760
we obtain a value for beta, the ratio of electron
velocity to the speed of light, of 1 - 1/6.89

146
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:15,370
x 10^7, in other words, exceedingly close
to one. In fact, from this, one can directly

147
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,980
determine that the difference in velocity
of a photon and a MAX-IV electron is only

148
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,870
a little over 4 m/s.

149
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,420
To obtain a feel for this, imagine a photon
and electron in a straight out sprint race.

150
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:35,390
A little more than a second after the gun,
they have gone past the moon, and the photon

151
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:41,370
is still only about 5 meters in front of the
electron. Usain Bolt often beats his opponents

152
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,130
by this margin after less than 100 metres!

153
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,180
So, what other consequences are there related
to the weirdness of relativity? First, in

154
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,490
the frame of reference of a stationary observer,
the electron has assumed a mass of gamma m,

155
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:01,640
that is, several thousand times that at rest.
In the case of MAX-IV, this is almost equal

156
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,020
to the mass of a tritium atom. This might
still not seem much, but if I were to travel

157
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:13,909
so fast, you would see me as having approximately
the same mass as three blue whales combined.

158
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:17,579
. .
Also, importantly, space becomes distorted

159
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:23,779
- it wraps forward; things that lie in front
of you become brighter and bluer, while those

160
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:31,419
behind dim and are red-shifted. A mathematical
derivation of this special-relativistic effect

161
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:36,509
caused by time-dilation and space contraction
lies well outside the remit of this lecture

162
00:17:36,509 --> 00:17:42,440
course, so I ask you to accept this as an
admittedly very weird, but certainly true,

163
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
fact.

164
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,540
This is shown schematically here for a spaceship
travelling at small and at relativistic velocities.

165
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,360
A homogeneous distribution of stars at low
speed looks very different when travelling

166
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,740
relativistically.

167
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:03,529
Now, remember from earlier in this video the
dipole distribution sketched for an electron

168
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:08,889
moving in a circular orbit, and our concern
that this doesn’t look much like the pencil-beam

169
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:14,400
radiation of synchrotrons? Now we should understand
why fast electrons distort this.

170
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,190
For the purposes of this course, you need
not know the exact mathematical description

171
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:25,270
of the spatial distribution of dipole radiation
at relativistic velocities. Instead, it is

172
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:32,451
shown here graphically for velocities between
1% and 99% of the speed of light. Remember

173
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:37,289
that at synchrotrons, the electrons travel
only approximately one part in 10^7 less than

174
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:43,789
the speed of light, hence the forward radiation
distribution is much narrower still than that

175
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,919
shown here for the electron at 99% of c.

176
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,990
Theory tells us that the angular power density
in the forward direction scales with the sixth

177
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:01,639
power of gamma. Hence, all other parameters
being equal (in particular a = c^2/rho, the

178
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:08,720
centripetal acceleration), a doubling in gamma
will produce a 64-fold increase in power density

179
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,850
on axis.

180
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:20,280
The angular range of radiation scales as 1/gamma.
Even for medium-energy storage rings, the

181
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,720
opening angle 1/gamma in both the horizontal
and vertical planes is of the order of 1/5000

182
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,590
of a radian, or approximately 1/100th of a
degree. This means that, for a point source,

183
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:43,080
the beam will have a lateral extent of approximately
4 mm at a distance of 20 m - synchrotron radiation

184
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,789
is indeed very collimated!

185
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,840
We will see later that in reality, the divergence
of different sources at synchrotrons (in particular

186
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:59,380
bending magnets and undulators) differs somewhat
from 1/gamma for reasons we will discuss in

187
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,370
detail later.
The next topics I would like to discuss in

188
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,950
the second video are how the electrons are
maintained in a closed orbit, and will show

189
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,970
using back-of-the envelope calculations that
the use of electric fields to bend electrons

190
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,279
is impractical and that instead magnetic forces
are used. When electrons emit synchrotron

191
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:29,220
radiation, they lose energy. How this energy
is replenished via a radio-frequency cavity

192
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,299
is also explained.
