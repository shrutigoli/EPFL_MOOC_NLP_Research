Welcome to the second video of Week 6 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This video is concerned with three of the most common variations of synchrotron-based diffraction, namely single-crystal diffraction, powder diffraction, and macromolecular crystallography.
Before discussing different types of synchrotron-based diffraction experiments, it is worth to first pause and consider the myriad types of samples that can be investigated using diffraction, as an understanding of these helps in deciding the type of experiment to undertake.
We can divide sample types into three broad classifications, namely (and in increasing degree of disorder) single-crystal, textured, and powder samples.
Within each class, however, there are strikingly different manifestations.
Take, for example, single crystals.
Even the highest-quality silicon single crystal still contains crystallographic defects (including vacancies, interstitials, dislocations, and mosaic domains), hence in reality there is no such thing as a perfect single crystal.
At what level of imperfection does one begin to regard a system as being no longer a single crystal?
Of course, there is no well-defined boundary, and depending on experimental methods, preconceptions, and â€œwhat youâ€™re used toâ€�, the transition between one system and another may be quite different.
So high-quality large crystals such as diamonds, micron-sized protein crystals (which, incidentally, size-for-size, are far more valuable than diamond!), or heteroepitaxial thin films grown on single-crystal substrates and fabricated for microelectronic applications are all, in their own fields, regarded as being single crystals.
This fuzziness in boundaries extends all the way to nanocrystalline powder samples and semi-amorphous structures.
A well-known phenomenon in single crystals is that of twinning, in which two crystals share crystal lattice points at a boundary in a symmetric manner.
The resulting diffraction pattern of the twins
(there can be more than two twins, depending on the crystallographic system) becomes more complicated.
For example, each diffraction spot of an untwinned system may be split into two or more closely lying features.
One can therefore consider twinning as the first step towards disorder and eventually to powder samples.
Textured samples exhibit an intermediate degree of order, with preferred directions for certain crystallographic planes.
This may be due, for example, to a â€˜brushingâ€™ effect in the fabrication process of the sample
(such as in polymer fibre pulling), to the synthetic process, such as in natural fibres such as flax, or because of energy-minimization reasons.
Powder samples consist of crystalline grains that have no preferred orientation in space, and are significantly smaller than the illuminated volume.
For some samples, this latter condition may be only poorly met, in which case the sample can be spun, in order to record a spatially averaged signal.
Note that for undulator radiation, the focussed beam cross-section might be only of the order of a square micron, and the sampled volume may be less than 100 cubic microns.
When the characteristic size of the individual grains is reduced to only a few unit cells, such as in nanocrystals, the widths of the diffraction peaks broaden accordingly, producing diffuse ring patterns.
This lower limit in crystallinity often best represents the grim reality of â€˜realâ€™ systems, and as such is a burgeoning area of research in 21st-Century crystallography.
Synchrotrons are playing a leading role in this enterprise.
Let us begin with three different approaches to studying single crystals.
Each method is suited for different applications.
Although the majority of x-ray diffraction methods use (quasi-)monochromatic x- rays and a sample which must be rotated in space in order to satisfy the diffraction condition, it is also possible to record diffraction patterns of stationary single crystals using a broad spectrum of x-rays, a technique known as the Laue method.
Indeed, the Laue method is historically the oldest and was used in the original discovery of x-ray diffraction and is named after its founder, Max von Laue (see Figure 1.8).
After the development of monochromatic sources using characteristic radiation from x-ray tubes, Laue diffraction fell somewhat into disuse, except to orient single crystals and to determine their crystal quality.
However, with the advent of synchrotron radiation
(especially from third generation facilities), and enormous improvements in computing power and detector technology, Laue diffraction has enjoyed a renaissance as a technique which provides a fast and efficient means to record diffraction data, and is being used to great effect in dynamical studies of transient crystalline states.
Consider a diffraction pattern, that is, a regularly spaced set of diffraction maxima, or Bragg spots, in reciprocal space, with the (000) direct beam spot in the centre.
If we irradiate the crystal with a quasi-monochromatic x-ray beam, it is unlikely that the crystal will be oriented such that a diffraction spot lies on the surface of the Ewald sphere (remember, this is the pictorial representation for satisfying the Bragg condition of constructive interference).
In the case of macromolecular crystals, the density of Bragg spots is so large, with separations in reciprocal space often well over hundred times smaller than the radius of the Ewald sphere, that some spots are likely to intersect the Ewald sphere.
But, for the moment, let us ignore this and consider the more sparsely populated reciprocal space shown here.
In this case, no Bragg spot sits on the Ewald sphere, and no diffraction intensity is recorded.
Now let us consider the case where a band of photon energies irradiates the crystal, such as one can generate from bending magnets and wigglers.
The Ewald spheres of the lower and upper limits of the band of energies will have radii equal to 2 pi/lambda_max and 2 pi/lambda_min, respectively.
All diffraction spots that lie within the volume between these two spheres (which touch tangentially at the (000) direct beam) will produce diffraction signal.
Which angle will a certain Bragg spot (hkl), highlighted here in red, subtend with the incident beam?
To determine this, we need to find the Ewald sphere that meets the Bragg condition, in other words, the precise energy within the energy band.
This is a sphere which is intersects both the (000) and (hkl) spots, and is symmetric around the incident beam direction, as shown here with the dot-dashed circle . The two radii of this circle that connect with circleâ€™s centre to (000) and (hkl) subtend an angle
2-theta_(hkl).
A large subset of all the possible detected diffraction peaks can be accessed by rotating the crystal and recording the signal frame after frame.
An example of Laue diffraction is shown here, in which the video on the right shows differences in the electron density map compared to the static state after a carbon monoxyhaemoglobin crystal was irradiated with a nanosecond laser.
The laser causes the carbon monoxide molecule to photodissociate and the structure rearranges itself in response to this.
This is probed by taking single pulses from the synchrotron storage ring and varying the delay between the laser pulse pump and x-ray probe.
This experiment is made possible by the fact that the dissociation of CO is reversible, allowing the experiment to be repeated at different time delays.
In some experiments, one is interested in recording only a subset of the diffraction data, using the so-called selected Bragg-peak method.
An example might be orbital, charge (i.e., valence), or even spin ordering of electronic states in future electronic materials, which increases the crystal periodicity and thereby introduces additional (and usually very weak)
Bragg peaks at nominally non-integral positions in reciprocal space.
In such experiments, the crystal is carefully oriented to light up a certain diffraction peak.
Because these can often be weak, synchrotron radiation is normally required.
In addition, by tuning to the absorption-edge energies of the atoms responsible for the phenomenon of interest, the signal strength can be enhanced using resonant elastic scattering effects.
We have already come across the rotation method in the first video of this week.
It is only mentioned explicitly again here in order to highlight some technical improvements, although it should be mentioned that a macromolecular-crystallography experiments carried out at synchrotrons use the rotation method as well.
In the â€œold daysâ€�, a crystal would be rotated and an exposure recorded over a certain angular range of the order of a degree.
Any Bragg peaks crossing the Ewald sphere during the exposure would be recorded.
Exactly where they lay within the angular range covered was normally lost, while whether they were intense and sharp or broad but weaker was also ambiguous.
After the exposure, the recording device, normally a CCD, would read out the data, which could take several seconds to several tens of seconds.
The next angular range, starting where the previous one left off, would be recorded by slightly rewinding the crystal and ramping up the rotation rate before starting the next exposure.
In this manner, a full dat set could take several minutes to some hours, depending on the crystal type, size, and intensity of the beam.
With the advent of modern detectors, with readout times in the range of a few milliseconds, a new approach called fine phi-slicing became possible.
In this mode of operation, the exposures were over much narrower angular ranges by an order of magnitude, and the crystal was allowed to rotate continuously, as the dead time between exposures was sufficiently small.
Nowadays, a full data set can be recorded in just a few seconds, or even below a second.
Because the angles covered by each exposure are typically smaller than the angular width of the diffraction signal (in the case of macromolecular crystallography), the peak shape and position can be accurately determined using fine phi-slicing.
For some materials, it may prove to be very difficult or indeed impossible to grow macroscopic crystals of sufficient crystallographic quality to be investigated using single-crystal diffraction.
In such instances, powder diffraction (also called the â€˜Debye-Scherrerâ€™ method) is an invaluable technique.
Powder diffraction suffers from the fact that because the microcrystallites making up the powder sample are randomly oriented, the angularly separated information one obtains in single-crystal diffraction is projected on to a single coordinate, complicating the identification of the Miller indices of the Bragg peaks (so-called â€œindexingâ€�).
In addition, diffraction signals that are separated from each other in a single-crystal pattern will overlap in the powder pattern if they are associated with the same lattice spacing.
It should not be thought, however, that powder diffraction is a â€˜last resortâ€™ technique only to be used when large, high-quality, single crystals are unavailable.
Powder diffraction not only provides a rapid and nondestructive means to identify the composite parts in multicomponent mixtures or complex system in fields as disparate as metallurgy, archaeology, pharmaceutical sciences, mineralogy, catalysis, and condensed-matter physics, but is also indispensable in extreme environmental studies, where phase changes are studied as a function of temperature and/or pressure.
In such cases, information can often ONLY be extracted from powder samples, which due to the microcrystallitesâ€™ large surface area-to-volume ratio, can accommodate phase changes under these severe conditions by relaxation and propagation of crystallographic faults far better than can larger single-crystal samples, which most often degrade unacceptably, and in an anisotropic manner.
In addition, powder diffraction lends itself to time-resolved studies, whereby the projection of the crystallographic information in to one dimension can be considered in this case to be positively beneficial.
The time-resolution of such studies has been extended into the sub-millisecond regime since the advent of novel detector types such as the Mythen microstrip detector.
For example, the dynamics of self-propagating exothermic reactions in nanoscale metallic multilayers have been followed from powder diffraction patterns over a 120 degree range with 0.004 degree resolution and with a complete-pattern frame-rate of 8000 Hz.
Let us consider how powder diffraction data is generated.
Consider first a single crystal which contains a set of angularly separated Bragg maxima in reciprocal space.
Let us look at this setup from the perspective of the incident beam . It should not be a surprise that, if we rotate the crystal around the incident beamâ€™s axis, the diffraction pattern will rotate in exactly the same manner
. Now let us replace the single crystal with a large set of randomly oriented crystallites
. So now, instead of rotating the single-crystal, which would rotate the diffraction pattern, the large number of crystallites will provide all the different orientations simultaneously
- the Bragg spots are therefore swept out into rings, called Debye-Scherrer rings.
Because of the cylindrical symmetry of this method, all the necessary information can be recorded in a narrow strip of the rings, that is, along one coordinate, 2-theta.
So, in summary, the large ensemble of crystallites means that some will be coincidentally oriented such that they meet the Bragg condition for diffraction at a peak (hkl), that is, the hkl planes of those crystallites lie perpendicular to the scattering vector Q of magnitude 2 pi/d_hkl.
Due to the cylindrical symmetry of this condition, the diffraction signal forms a set of concentric cones, detected as rings on area detectors, as shown here for the calibration standard material lanthanum hexaboride.
Although powder patterns can be recorded using area detectors for certain applications, traditionally, they have been recorded using a point detector rotated around a single axis.
This can take anything from a few minutes to several hour, depending on many factors scubas the desired resolution, the powderâ€™s scattering strength, and the range of angles to be covered.
Beginning about a decade ago at the Swiss
Light Source, a new approach to powder data acquisition began, in which an entire powder pattern in one coordinate, 2-theta, could be recorded in parallel, reducing acquisition times to seconds, and in some cases, below milliseconds!
A simple example of the benefit of using a
1-D so-called â€œmicrostripâ€� detector, is highlighted here.
The powder pattern of the anaesthetic drug bupivacaine was to be recorded to investigate its level of purity.
This was performed with both a point detector
(â€œzero dimensionsâ€�) and a Mythen 1D detector, covering an angular range of 2-theta = 120 degrees.
First a short range of 2-theta was recorded at a rate of 3 minutes/degree.
This was repeated a second time , and the resulting pattern was seen to be both substantially weaker (here it is blown up in the y-axis by a factor of 5) and exhibit subtle different peak shapes and positions.
This was strongly indicative of radiation damage, a common problem with organic-based matter, with their on average relatively weak bond strengths.
A fresh sample was then exposed for only one second using the Mythen microstrip detector.
This showed clear differences in relative peak intensities and positions, even compared to the first point-detector pattern, especially in those regions highlighted here in yellow
. It in fact emerged that exposures in excess of about one minute exhibited radiation damage.
This means that a reliable pattern could only be simply recorded using the 1-D detector, as the serial acquisition of the point detector would mean that a fresh sample would need introducing every 30 seconds or thereabouts.
We finish this video with a brief description of macromolecular crystallography.
A young and ambitious student contemplating which line of research to pursue for a PhD program could do worse than choose macromolecular crystallography, or MX.
Of the 21 Nobel prizes awarded to studies or inventions involving x-rays as a tool, nine have been in the field of biomolecular structure, including all five prizes which have used synchrotron radiation.
No other discipline comes close to the recognition
MX has so rightly earned by the Nobel committee for its impact on society; it can also be argued that MX is the raison dâ€™etre synchrotrons are funded at all...
Macromolecular crystallography is the study of macromolecules such as proteins, viruses, ribosomes, and other macromolecular assemblies such as DNA and RNA, and is often also called protein crystallography, or PX, as proteins make up the majority of the types of studied structures.
The transition from â€˜small moleculesâ€™ to macromolecules is somewhat vague, but lies at around a few thousand Daltons (or atomic mass units).
Some solved macromolecular structures lie orders of magnitude above this threshold; for example, the 80S yeast ribosome is composed of 45 peptide chains and has a molecular weight of over 1.8 MDa.
It is the folding and thus the three-dimensional structure of proteins that lend them their catalytic activity that drives metabolic reactions, genetic-code replication, and the bodyâ€™s response to internal or external stimuli, among other functions.
The study of protein structure is, therefore, of paramount importance in understanding the foundations of molecular biology.
MX is a form of single-crystal diffraction which uses the rotation method.
What, therefore, is the justification for discussing this separately?
As mentioned above, the determination on an atomic scale of the three- dimensional structures of proteins and related biological molecules is fundamental to understanding biological processes at the most basic level; how macromolecules interact in a â€˜lock-and-keyâ€™ manner, and how enzymes catalyze reactions.
The economic drive to synthesize new and increasingly effective drugs based on this detailed knowledge means that MX-beamlines are the most ubiquitous in third- generation synchrotron facilities.
Despite this and the burgeoning number of facilities being built, there remains a high overbooking factor for MX experiments.
Another immediately obvious qualitative difference between MX and XRD of crystals with smaller unit cells is exactly that â€“ the complexity of the basis within the unit cell.
When the basis contains several thousand molecules, conventional approaches to solving the structure through methods such as Rietveld analysis become entirely impractical, and other more sophisticated techniques must be brought to bear on solving the phase problem.
Details of approaches to this at first seemingly insurmountable problem will be covered in the more advanced lectures towards the end of the course.
Here, it is merely mentioned that this obstacle is further compounded by the fact that, because diffraction-peak intensities scale with the square of the number of coherently illuminated unit cells, and because the unit cells in
MX can have linear dimensions up to two orders of magnitude larger than those of small inorganic structure, the signal intensity in MX is concomitantly smaller for a given crystal size.
The large unit-cell dimensions also mean that the diffraction spots in MX are separated by much smaller angles and that many more diffraction peaks will lie on the Ewald sphere and thus be detected.
For example, a protein crystal with a unit-cell size of 200 Angstroms, irradiated with 12.7 keV x-rays, will have angular separations of approximately 0.3 degrees.
As many protein crystals exhibit a mosaicity of similar magnitudes, this can lead to overlapping signals.
Finally it is mentioned that the preparation of protein crystals can be exceedingly difficult, and many proteins known to be exceedingly important in the chemistry of life, such as membrane proteins, have, to a large extent, resisted efforts to crystalline them in sufficiently large sizes and quality.
Over and above this, the high brilliance of third-generation synchrotrons and indeed, the even higher intensities associated with diffraction-limited storage rings cause these highly valuable crystals to be destroyed in seconds due to radiation damage.
The advent of XFEL radiation and the ability to detect strong signal from crystallites smaller than one cubic micron, is opening up this field enormously.
This, too, will be described in more detail towards the end of the course.
Macromolecular crystallography is the foremost method of choice when studying protein or enzyme structures â€“ indeed over 85 % of all the presently known protein structures have been solved using MX.
The growth of depositions of protein structures into the Protein Data Bank, shown here and including some of the more seminal structural discoveries over the last 60+ years, has followed an near exponential path since its inception in 1971 and shows little sign of slackening.
The molecule on the right, cathepsin B, was the first de-novo structure to be solved using
XFEL radiation.
What resolution can we expect for an MX experiment?
The maximum scattering angle 2-theta_max is given by the arctangent of the area detector radius, big R, divided by the sample-detector distance, Z_D.
From this, it is a trivial exercise to show that the maximum scattering vector Q_max, which equals 2-pi divided by the minimum detectable feature, a_min, is equal to 4pi/lambda sin theta_max, or a_min = lambda/2sin theta_max.
The smaller lambda and the larger theta_max, the better the theoretical resolution.
I sat â€œtheoreticalâ€� advisedly, as this assumes that the scattered signal strength is sufficient to be detected at the edge of the detector.
But we know that the scattering strength on average drops off with Q in a quasi-Gaussian manner and that high energies (small lambda) are associated with a high Q-value.
Letâ€™s assume for example that 2-theta_max
= 50 degrees.
For photo energies of 5-keV (the red curves on the right hand side graph), the maximum
Q-value is a little over 2 reciprocal Angstroms , equating to an a_min of approximately 3
Angstroms *****. This may be sufficient to obtain an atomic structure, though some details may be missing.
The atomic structure factor of the carbon atoms is approximately equal to 4 electrons, not far from the maximum value of Z = 6 electrons.
Now we might decide to record with a higher resolution, so we switch to 12.66 keV (this is the K-absorption edge energy of selenium, an atom often substituted for sulphur for anomalous diffraction experiments, described later in the course).
Here, the maximum accessible Q-vector is 5.4 reciprocal Angstroms, and we obtain a resolution of a little over one Angstrom, sufficient to obtain a detailed atomically-resolved structural model.
However, at 5.4 reciprocal Angstroms, the atomic form factor is less than two electrons
. Remember that the scattering intensity scales with the square of f, and hence the trade-off we have to accept for increasing the resolution is a reduction in intensity at the edges of the detector by more than a factor of four.
Hence the experimentalist must consider what resolution is necessary to obtain a full structural model.
There are several complementary methods o assist in this enterprise, such as molecular replacement, described in more detail later.
In summary, the periodic nature of crystalline systems lends them physical and electronic properties that can only be understood in terms of that periodicity and the configuration of the atoms within each period.
At the same time, this periodicity provides the necessary scattering conditions for diffraction phenomena.
X-ray diffraction is a nondestructive structural tool with unsurpassed resolution.
The primary obstacle to reconstructing structural information from diffraction data is the ubiquitous phase problem.
The approach to how this is solved essentially encapsulates the whole art of crystallography.
An impressive arsenal of tools has been developed over the last century to crack this problem, and in no more a breathtaking manner than that used in macromolecular crystallography, which nowadays can determine the structure and provide insights into the functionality of biological systems consisting of tens to hundreds of thousands of atoms.
These tools will be described detail towards then end of this course.
Diffraction techniques continue to play leading roles in modern synchrotron science.
Indeed, with the advent of the free-electron laser, scattering methods will undoubtedly enjoy a renewed prominence, particularly in the field of ultrafast time-resolved studies.
