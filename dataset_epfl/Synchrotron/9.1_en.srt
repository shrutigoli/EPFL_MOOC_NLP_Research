00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,660
Welcome to the first video of Week 9 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,530
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,310
This week, we will discuss approaches to phasing
in macromolecular crystallography.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:27,220
After some introductory remarks and a recap
of some essential tools needed to understand

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,660
this week’s topics, the methods of molecular
replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,999
will be covered in order to demonstrate general
approaches to phasing in MX, as essentially

7
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:48,120
the same mathematical approach is used also
in the further three techniques we will discuss,

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,510
namely multiwavelength anomalous diffraction,
single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, and

9
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,379
native-SAD.

10
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:03,510
We finish the week by looking at current trends
in this field.

11
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,990
So, in this first video, we begin by familiarizing
ourselves with basic concepts and approaches

12
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,090
to phasing in MX.

13
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,840
As we have already mentioned several times
earlier in this course, the interpretation

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,409
of diffraction data is hampered by the fact
that half of the information, namely the relative

15
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:33,240
phases between the diffraction components,
is lost, because one measures the intensity,

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,490
not the amplitude - this is the phase problem,
which can lead to multiple possible structural

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,881
solutions, depending on how complete the diffraction
data set is, and how complex the atomic structure

18
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:54,680
is within the unit cell.

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:01,130
In the early days of diffraction, simple structures
such as rock salt or diamond could be `relatively’

20
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:08,479
easily solved using trial-and-error approaches,
arguments of symmetry, and invoking physicochemical

21
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,040
limitations, such as known reasonable ranges
of bond lengths between atoms.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,650
A nice personal review of this by Max Perutz
can be found in the reference given here bottom

23
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,510
left.

24
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,580
As the atomic structures in the unit cells
became increasingly complex, a more systematic

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:37,030
approach was needed, in particular Fourier
analysis and so-called Patterson maps, used

26
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,480
extensively by Dorothy Hodgkin in her seminal
works, among others, on the structures of

27
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,470
penicillin and insulin.

28
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,970
The use of Patterson maps remains one of the
cornerstones of phasing in macromolecular

29
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,540
crystallography to this day.

30
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,850
An interesting approach to the phase problem
that was first developed in the 1950s by Jerome

31
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:09,920
Karle and Herbert Hauptman is that of the
so-called direct methods.

32
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,980
In general it is based on iterations that
cycle between real space and reciprocal space

33
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,490
by the actions of Fourier- and inverse-Fourier
transforms.

34
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,280
When in reciprocal space, the diffraction
amplitudes emerging from the FT are replaced

35
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,330
with the square-roots of the experimentally
determined diffraction intensities, and the

36
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,020
phases remain untouched.

37
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:46,730
Conversion of this via an inverse-FT to real
space will result in a structure which is

38
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,850
then examined for its reasonableness, using
arguments such as, for example, that the electron

39
00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:02,460
density cannot be negative anywhere, that
most electron charge is concentrated around

40
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:08,710
the nuclear core of atoms (this constraint
is called `atomicity’), and that the structure

41
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:15,510
must fit within a reasonable support and have
physically reasonable bond lengths.

42
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,820
This iterative cycling continues until self-consistency
is reached, that is, no changes need to be

43
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,690
made in either real or reciprocal space.

44
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:35,070
Direct methods succeed only up to an upper
limit of complexity, presently at around 1000

45
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:42,040
atoms, though improvements in both the quality
of diffraction data and computer power is

46
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,970
likely to push the envelope in the future.

47
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,270
For the foreseeable future, however, direct
methods and certainly trial-and-error approaches

48
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,100
will certainly fail for larger structures
such as proteins.

49
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:05,280
For example, the molecular weight of the human
ribosome 80S subunit is approximately 3.2

50
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:12,940
million Daltons, containing of the order of
200’000 atoms (excluding the hydrogen-atoms).

51
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:19,960
For these systems, novel approaches needed
to be brought to bear on the problem.

52
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:26,350
In all cases other than molecular replacement,
the two general approaches are either (a)

53
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:31,380
to change the structure in a controlled and
known manner, and observe how this induces

54
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,170
changes in the diffraction pattern, or (b)
see how the diffraction pattern changes as

55
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:45,610
a result of being close to an absorption edge
of one or more atom types within the structure.

56
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:54,061
So, in multiple isomorphous replacement, or
MIR, specific components are replaced, or

57
00:05:54,061 --> 00:06:00,590
additional material added, but for which the
structure otherwise remains invariant - in

58
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:06,780
other words, the other atom positions don’t
move and the unit-cell size remains constant

59
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:13,480
- this is the meaning of isomorphous.

60
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:20,000
Multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(MAD) works by observing changes in the diffraction

61
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,630
pattern as one varies the photon energy around
an absorption edge.

62
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,110
In single-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(SAD), differences in certain symmetry-related

63
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:42,330
diffraction maxima within the same diffraction
set are exploited to solve the structure.

64
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:49,780
All of these methods also use molecular replacement
(MR), which relies upon the existence in the

65
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,282
structure of a previously solved protein fold
which is homologous, or similar, to part of

66
00:06:56,282 --> 00:07:00,790
the structure to be solved.

67
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,800
Before we introduce the concepts of the Patterson
function and then Friedel’s law, it’s

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:15,240
worth spending a moment to recap how one uses
Argand, or complex plane diagrams.

69
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,300
Imagine a unit cell containing three atoms.

70
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:27,091
We flood this with x-rays of wavelength lambda
. Note that in the Bragg condition, the phase

71
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:33,889
at the same point in different unit cells
must experience the same phase of the x-ray

72
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:40,270
plane wave, such as shown for these three
equivalent atoms highlighted with crosses

73
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:47,520
(wait 2 secs) . The phases of scattering from
each atom can be estimated by seeing where

74
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:57,430
their centres lie relative to the incident
beam - the blue atom is at 0, the green at

75
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:08,090
pi/3, or 60 degrees, and the red atom at 3pi/2
(270 degrees).

76
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:14,240
The scattering amplitudes can therefore be
added up in an Argand diagram vectorially

77
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,560
with the appropriate angle corresponding to
the phases.

78
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,590
So scattering from the blue atom is represented
by an arrow of certain length (proportional

79
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:37,680
to the atom’s scattering strength) and at
zero degrees . The green atom is a weaker

80
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,410
scatterer with smaller scattering vector at
an angle of 60 degrees , while the scattering

81
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:52,810
vector of the large red atom points downwards,
at 270 degrees . The total structure factor

82
00:08:52,810 --> 00:09:00,730
is therefore the black arrow shown here .

83
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:04,120
We now introduce the Patterson function.

84
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,449
Even though we cannot determine the structure
of a unit cell from the diffraction pattern

85
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:17,579
intensities alone, it turns out that it can
nonetheless provide valuable information.

86
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:26,580
Arthur Patterson showed in 1935 that the inverse
Fourier transform of the diffraction-pattern

87
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:34,230
intensities yields a centrosymmetric real-space
structure consisting of peaks separated by

88
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,149
the relative positions between atoms.

89
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:51,160
In the example here of the molecule fluoroselenoformaldehyde,
SeCHF, 13 maxima are to be seen.

90
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,519
In fact, it can be shown that these relative
distances are a result of the convolution

91
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,620
of the molecule’s electron density distribution
with its inverse.

92
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,779
Let’s look at this simple example in a little
more detail in order to understand the general

93
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:17,980
properties of Patterson functions, or Patterson
maps, as they’re also known.

94
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,959
First, because the Patterson map is the convolution
of the electron density with its inverse,

95
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:34,759
it is always centrosymmetric, with equivalent
points at r_ij and -r_ij between atoms i and

96
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:44,440
j . The intensities of these maxima are proportional
to the product of their atomic numbers, Z_i

97
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:53,959
and Z_j - this means that if there are heavy
atoms in the structure, their contributions

98
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,480
will dominate.

99
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,390
The central spot is by far the most intense,
being the sum of the convolution of all the

100
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:12,270
atoms with themselves (that is, therefore,
at zero distance) . Lastly, there are N(N-1)

101
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:22,470
+ 1 maxima, which for a molecule which may
easily contain 100’000 atoms, means the

102
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:29,720
pattern is extremely crowded, containing approximately
10^10 contributions.

103
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:40,519
Needless to say, the Patterson map has, for
proteins, essentially a continuous distribution.

104
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,230
We show here some simple examples based around
the aromatic molecule benzene, and how these

105
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:57,019
change according to whether one or more hydrogen
atoms have been substituted for heavier atoms.

106
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:02,279
In this case, we substitute with bromine.

107
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,660
Benzene has a Patterson map that is highly
symmetric, with six-fold symmetry.

108
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:15,379
By substituting one hydrogen with bromine,
the symmetry is reduced , and one clearly

109
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:22,259
sees how the C6 ring is `picked’ out by
the bromine atom.

110
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:32,429
Adding another bromine opposite the first
in 1,4 dibromobenzene changes the pattern

111
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:39,660
primarily by introducing the strongest signal
(except at the central spot) at the uppermost

112
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:47,389
and lowest positions, equating to the distance
between the two bromine atoms.

113
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:57,069
Lastly, on 1,2, dibromobenzene, the pattern
changes ***** again due to the closer proximity

114
00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:00,889
of the tow bromine atoms.

115
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:10,529
Take your time in studying these in order
to get a feel for what Patterson maps provide.

116
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:17,800
We complete this first video by discussing
Frieden pairs and Friedel’s law.

117
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:26,730
Consider a Bragg maximum at (hkl) , with scattering
vector Q . The opposite Bragg peak in reciprocal

118
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:34,670
space is at (h-bar k-bar, l-bar) and the scattering
vector for this must point in the opposite

119
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,190
direction.

120
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:47,249
Now let’s consider this from the perspective
of the unit cell and the hkl-planes . Remember

121
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:56,959
too, that the phase difference between equivalent
points in adjacent unit cells has to be 2pi

122
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:06,290
for constructive interference, that is, for
the Bragg condition to be met.

123
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:13,199
For reflection off the hkl planes , the scattering
vector is, as we know, perpendicular to these

124
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:22,639
. The atomic scattering factors of the atoms
between the hkl-planes add up vectorially

125
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:34,129
in some manner to produce a structure factor
F_hkl associated with the hkl-reflection and

126
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,470
a phase phi_hkl.

127
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:42,680
Remember, the intensity is proportional to
the square of F_hkl.

128
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:53,549
The Bragg peak at h-bar k-bar l-bar is generated
by approaching the atoms from below - Q is

129
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:56,889
in the opposite direction, as required.

130
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:03,069
Now, what are the phases of the individual
scattering vectors.

131
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:08,379
Let’s first consider the blue atom.

132
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:22,699
This has a phase phi_1 relative to the upper
hkl-plane, which means its phase relative

133
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:30,639
to the lower plane is 2pi - phi_1, which is
equal to -phi_1.

134
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,480
The atomic scattering vector for the blue
atom for the h-bar k-bar l-bar reflection

135
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,689
is therefore the mirror image of that for
hkl . Obviously, the same holds true for all

136
00:15:43,689 --> 00:15:53,619
the other atoms , and therefore the magnitude
of Fhkl and Fhkl-bar is identical, and their

137
00:15:53,619 --> 00:16:02,600
phase is opposite, that is, phi_hkl-bar = -phi_hkl.

138
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:12,750
So, in summary, Friedel’s law says that
Bragg peaks at hkl and hkl-bar, known as Frieden

139
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:19,170
pairs, are equal in magnitude and their phases
are opposite in sign.

140
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,040
Diffraction patterns are therefore centrosymmetric,
though as we will see, Friedel’s law breaks

141
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:35,259
down if the pattern was recorded in the neighbourhood
of one of the atoms’ absorption edges.

142
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:43,689
Before we see why, I quickly cover the case
of centrosymmetric crystals (don’t confuse

143
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:51,889
this with centrosymmetric diffraction patterns),
as they have special properties.

144
00:16:51,889 --> 00:17:02,540
Consider the 2D cartoon of a centrosymmetric
crystal shown here.

145
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:12,630
As we know, the phase difference between the
hkl-planes needs to be 2 pi in the Bragg condition.

146
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,899
For convenience’s sake in order to make
our arguments easier to follow, we choose

147
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:30,540
to show this phase change to be from + pi
to - pi . Let’s now consider the scattering

148
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,559
contributions in an Argand diagram from pairs
of atoms which are opposite each other through

149
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,380
the centre of symmetry.

150
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:46,659
We begin with the two atoms highlighted here
and labelled `1’ . If one of these has a

151
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:56,130
phase phi_1 , then the other must have a phase
-phi_1 . Their contributions therefore cancel

152
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:03,220
out in the imaginary direction in the Argand
diagram, and their summed scattering contribution

153
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:11,549
is real . This holds true for all other pairs,
for example the green atoms labelled with

154
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:20,039
a `2’ , as shown here . If the centrosymmetric
crystal contains an atom at the centre of

155
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:29,100
symmetry, this has, by definition a phase
of zero, and is thus also real.

156
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,480
The take-home message is therefore that structure
factors of centrosymmetric crystals are real,

157
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,659
as long as they are far from absorption edges.

158
00:18:39,659 --> 00:18:48,350
OK, so let’s return to the general case
of crystals with any symmetry.

159
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:54,220
What happens to the structure factors of Frieden
pairs if one includes the correction terms

160
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:06,070
f’ and f”, which become non-negligible
near absorption edges.

161
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:17,730
So let’s begin with our uncorrected structure
factors and now add the correction terms.

162
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,330
In this cartoon, the atom with an absorption
edge close to the used photon energy is the

163
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,510
one that produces the red atomic scattering
vectors.

164
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:36,480
In the case of the hkl structure factor, the
f’ term reduces the magnitude of the red

165
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:45,519
vector by this amount , as we’ve discussed
before.

166
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:59,330
f” is then added on to this, but at an angle
of +90 degrees, or pi/2 . The vector for Fhkl

167
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:10,190
has therefore changed .
Now let’s see what happens to the hkl-bar

168
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,159
structure factor.

169
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:21,860
The f’ term needs to be subtracted from
the red vector, as before , but now, the addition

170
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:36,610
of f” is in the same sense, +90 degrees
. This means that both the magnitude of Fhkl-bar

171
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:43,679
differs from that of Fhkl , and that the phases
are no longer equal in magnitude and opposite

172
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,370
in sign.

173
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:52,820
In other words, by recording diffraction patterns
close to absorption edges, they lose their

174
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,090
centrosymmetry.

175
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:10,950
Lastly, what changes occur in centrosymmetric
crystals due to absorption?

176
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:20,179
As we argued three slides back, without the
correction terms f’ and f”, the structure

177
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:28,000
factors of centrosymmetric crystals are real
and therefore Fhkl and Fhkl-bar have the same

178
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,960
magnitude and lie along the real axis (in
other words, phi = 0).

179
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:47,110
So adding f’ and f” will change Fhkl and
Fhkl-bar identically . The structure factors

180
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:53,730
may no longer be real, but they do remain
the same both in their magnitudes and in their

181
00:21:53,730 --> 00:22:02,620
phases . In other words, centrosymmetric crystals
ALWAYS have centrosymmetric diffraction patterns,

182
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,900
independent of photon energy.

183
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,049
As we shall see in the third of the video
this week, this means that SAD experiments

184
00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:15,380
cannot be performed on centrosymmetric crystals.

185
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:23,309
Fortunately, almost no proteins produce centrosymmetric
crystal structures, due primarily to their

186
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:31,299
chiral nature (chiral structures cannot exhibit
centrosymmetry).

187
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:36,140
In summary, this first video has prepared
us by introducing the concepts of Patterson

188
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:43,659
maps and Friedel’s law, for the different
techniques used to solve complex protein structures.

189
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:51,590
In the next video, we will discuss the first
approach developed for this, pioneered by

190
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:58,500
the two Nobel-prize winners Max Perutz and
John Kendrew, namely multiple isomorphous

191
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,299
replacement, or MIR, including the construction
of Harker diagrams, which themselves use Argand

192
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,130
diagrams.

193
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:15,529
In addition we will briefly describe molecular
replacement, as this remains the `working

194
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:18,039
horse’ of solving protein structures.
