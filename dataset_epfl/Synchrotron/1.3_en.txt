So, what are synchrotrons?
Simply stated, they are very brilliant sources of light, or electromagnetic radiation.
Although some synchrotrons offer tunable radiation in the infrared and visible regimes, this is quite unusual and will not be discussed further in this course, as, from the near
IR, through the visible, to the near UV range, conventional lasers tend to dominate *******. As already mentioned, it is at higher photon energies, beginning at about 10 to 20 eV, where synchrotrons come into their own *******, providing radiation all the way up to approximately one mega-electronvolt photons.
OK, we now know qualitatively what synchrotrons provide â€“ very brilliant beams of radiation â€“ but what actually are synchrotrons?
How do they look like?
Here is a schematic of a synchrotron facility.
To put this into perspective, the larger ring structure shown here typically has a circumference of the order of a few hundred meters.
Let us break down the components of a synchrotron, beginning with a source of electrons, the so-called electron gun, which may be a heated metal filament ejecting electrons by thermionic emission.
These electrons are then accelerated in an evacuated linear accelerator, or â€œLINACâ€�
(it should be noted that, in order that they are not scattered by air molecules, the electrons always experience ultrahigh vacuum conditions, with pressures typically of the order of a thousandth of a billionth of an atmosphere or less).
The electrons then enter a so-called booster ring in which their energy is further ramped up until they attain the design energy of the main â€œstorageâ€� ring, into which they are injected and where they remain (or are stored, hence the term â€œstorage ringâ€�) and are used to generate synchrotron radiation.
The design energies of the electrons in the storage ring are typically measured in giga-electronvolts, that is, billions of electronvolts.
At these energies, the electrons are highly relativistic (that is, their velocities are exceedingly close to the speed of light), which, we will see later, has important consequences on the nature and direction of the electromagnetic radiation that is produced.
Now, in both the booster ring and the storage ring, the electrons are required to remain on a closed path (shown here in blue).
This is achieved using bending magnets, highlighted here in red.
As we shall discuss in detail later in the course, forcing electrons to execute a curved trajectory causes them to emit electromagnetic radiation â€“ this is your synchrotron light!
It is perhaps worth repeating here that the energy of even the most energetic photons produced at synchrotrons is less than a mega-electronvolt, three orders of magnitude or more smaller than the energies of the electrons that produce them.
In addition, the straight sections between the bending magnets are used to insert alternating arrays of north-south, south-north magnet dipoles, shown here in orange.
These so-called â€œinsertion devicesâ€� are even more brilliant sources of synchrotron radiation than are the bending magnets.
Tangential to the BMs and IDs are positioned the beamlines, that use the radiation (normally x-rays, and shown here as yellow and green beams) produced by the magnet devices in the storage ring.
A typical synchrotron might have anything between 10 and 50 beamlines, depending on the size of the facility.
For most experiments using x-rays, or indeed most measurements using any kind of electromagnetic radiation, four properties are in general desirable.
The beam should be intense, as monochromatic as achievable, parallel, and emanate from as small a source point as possible.
Accordingly, a figure-of-merit called â€œbrillianceâ€�, or â€œbrightnessâ€�, encapsulates these attributes and is equal to the intensity expressed in photons per second, divided by the product of the horizontal and vertical beam divergences; the source size; and the relative spectral bandwidth.
The precise definition and units are discussed later in the course.
As an example, however, it is instructive to consider the following.
A medical x-ray machine may generate as much as a kilowatt of x-radiation for radiography, some two orders of magnitude greater than that used at all the beamlines together at a typical third-generation synchrotron facility.
However, when the sourcesâ€™ sizes, divergences, and bandwidths are factored in, just a single beamline at a synchrotron will have a brilliance some 12 orders of magnitude higher than that of the medical x-ray machine!
An illustrative experimental example is shown here of a so-called x-ray powder-diffraction pattern of calcium phosphate.
The lower pattern in red was recorded over nearly three hours using a lab-based x-ray tube source, and has been expanded vertically by a factor of a thousand.
The upper trace in blue was recorded in five seconds at the Materials Science beamline at the Swiss Light Source.
The peak line widths are almost a factor of two narrower.
A direct comparison in intensity is inappropriate, as the two patterns were recorded using detectors based on different operational principles.
Nonetheless, one immediately sees that the quality of the SR-based measurement is far superior, which can be directly attributed to the differences in the sourcesâ€™ brilliances.
Since the first synchrotron-based experiments began in the 1950s, the available brilliance, which until then had more or less stagnated since shortly after the discovery of x-rays, increased meteorically by some 13 or 14 orders of magnitude over less than five decades, due to the introduction of sophisticated magnet-based sources, in particular insertion devices called wigglers, and then undulators, which we shall consider in detail later in the course.
***** More recently, beginning in 2009 at the LCLS at the SLAC facility in California, x-ray free-electron lasers began operation, while so-called diffraction-limited synchrotrons
(DLSRs) are just beginning to see first light.
***** These remarkable advances in x-ray brilliance over the last half century can be compared to the much-vaunted improvements in computer power, encapsulated in Mooreâ€™s law, which observes a two-fold gain in computer power approximately every eighteen months.
The same doubling in x-ray brilliance has occurred on average every ten months during the last three decades.
X-ray free-electron lasers, or XFELs, are new sources of x-radiation, with peak brilliances approximately ten orders of magnitude greater still than those of modern synchrotrons.
In addition, they produce trains of pulses with durations between a few femtoseconds to a few tens of femtoseconds (a femtosecond is 10-15 of a second, that is, a millionth of a billionth of a second).
This is over three orders of magnitude shorter than pulse lengths produced by synchrotrons, and sufficiently short to follow chemical reactions as they occur in real time.
Thus XFELs marry the temporal advantages of femtosecond lasers in the visible and near-visible regime with the spatial resolution associated with x-radiation.
The exceedingly high brilliance of XFELs compared to synchrotrons means that in general, changes in the approaches to experiments using XFELs compared to synchrotrons are not incremental in nature, but rather represent a completely new paradigm shift.
Synchrotrons and XFELs are thus complementary to one another and one should not think that
XFELs will replace synchrotron sources.
The architecture of XFELs is also very different from that of synchrotrons.
A short electron bunch is generated by irradiating a metallic target with a femtosecond laser pulse.
This is accelerated in a LINAC and then undergoes one or more bunch compressions to make the pulse shorter by approximately a factor of
The shortened electron pulse is then further accelerated along a long LINAC to several
GeV energy and then enters a long array of alternating north-south, south-north magnet dipoles.
As we will discuss later, this magnet array, called an â€œundulatorâ€�, is essentially identical to devices also used in the straight sections of synchrotron storage rings (the â€œinsertion devicesâ€� mentioned earlier in this video in the context of synchrotron facilities), apart from the fact that they are over an order of magnitude longer, typically several tens of meters long.
For reasons that will become apparent later in this course, this long magnet array is required in order to induce a phenomenon known as self-amplified spontaneous emission, or
SASE.
The result of SASE is that, after exiting the long undulator magnet array, the electron bunch has been altered such that it is now divided into many microbunches, each having a duration of only a few femtoseconds.
These bunches produce the femtosecond x-radiation characteristic of XFELs.
The latest development in synchrotron technology has focussed on improving the brilliance not by increasing the photon flux, but rather by reducing the source size and divergence of the beam.
**** Diffraction-limited storage rings promise approximately a further two orders of magnitude increase in brilliance compared to third-generation synchrotrons **** by gentler steering of the electrons in the storage ring - in other words, by using more bending magnets, each magnet forcing the electrons to bend through a smaller angle.
This seemingly prosaic change actually has a significant beneficial impact on the beam properties, but has only recently become possible with advances both in computer-controlled machining and in vacuum technology, which have allowed the necessary miniaturisation of components in the storage ring to achieve this goal.
To summarize the first week of this course, it should now be apparent why x-rays are such a useful tool for investigating the material world, why synchrotrons and XFELs are the premier examples of such tools, and why synchrotron science is such an interdisciplinary endeavour.
You should now be comfortable with the concept of photons, that is, that light can be described as consisting of indivisible quanta of energy, the photons, whose energy is inversely proportional to their wavelength.
According to how these photons interact with matter, in particular with regards to their wavelength compared to that of interatomic distances; and their energy compared to that of electrons bound to the atomic nuclei, different x-ray regimes are defined.
Lastly, we have qualitatively described the anatomy, or architecture of synchrotrons and
XFELs, which will prepare us for that part of the course in which we discuss machine physics.
Next week, we explore in detail how x-rays interact with matter, which will lay the foundations to understand x-ray techniques used in modern synchrotron and XFEL science.
