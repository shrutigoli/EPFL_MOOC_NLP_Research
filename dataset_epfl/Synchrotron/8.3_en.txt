Hello, and welcome to this, the final video of week 8.
In this video, we will discuss the related imaging techniques of coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, and ptychography.
Coherent x-ray diffractive imaging, also called lensless imaging, or diffraction microscopy, has many features in common with x-ray diffraction and small-angle x-ray scattering.
In XRD, the samples have translational symmetry, and as a result, the far-field scattering, or diffraction, pattern consists of a set of sharp diffraction maxima, from which the structure of the repeat unit, or unit cell, can be gleaned by solving the phase problem.
Typically many unit cells are illuminated coherently within the coherence volume.
The resolution of the atomic positions can be established with a resolution of the order of an Angstrom, or indeed much better than this in the case of small unit cells containing a modest number of atoms, while the unit cell size can often be determined with femtometer accuracy.
CXDI follows the same general principle as
XRD, though because the objects under investigations are typically larger (note that this may not be the case in so-called Bragg-CXDI of nanoscale crystallites, discussed in a moment), the scattering angles are smaller; and, in the case of noncrystalline samples, the scattering pattern is continuous, containing small grainy features collectively called â€œspeckleâ€�
. The upper limit to the size of the object that can be investigated with CXDI is given by the coherence volume of the incident radiation.
Big increases in this are expected once DLSRs come online in the immediate future.
Inhomogeneities with an irradiated object are the sources of scattered signal of the incident beam.
Interference between these scattered wavelets result in a so-called speckle pattern in the far field, which is the absolute square of the Fourier transform of the object.
By performing an inverse Fourier transform of the speckle, the real-space reconstruction of the sample is possible, once the ubiquitous phase problem has been overcome.
The ultimate resolution of the reconstruction,
Delta x, is equal to 4 lambda Z_0/D, where
Z_0 is the sample-detector distance, and D is the lateral detector size.
The resolution cannot be arbitrarily improved by increasing the detector size, as associated with this is an increase in scattering angle, or scattering vector, Q.
But, as we recall from Week 6, the scattering intensity drops off with the inverse fourth power of Q, hence in most instances, the signal towards the edge of the detector is so weak that no sensible data can be recovered here.
As we have just stated, speckle is the result of interference between wavelets produced by scattering of a beam of x-rays caused by spatial variations in the electron density within an object.
To obtain a stable speckle pattern, the object must be coherently illuminated â€“ if this is not the case, the speckles become averaged out due to fluctuations of the form of the wavefront incident on the sample.
In the forward direction around the direct beam, this incoherent signal is simply the small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) signal described in Week 6.
There are three characteristic length-scales related to speckle: the wavelength lambda of the x-rays, measured in Angstroms; the typical linear dimensions of the sample a, which should be smaller than the transverse coherent illumination cross-section (of the order of 10 to 100 Î¼m); and d, the typical length describing the variation in electron density (or distribution of â€˜particlesâ€™) within the illuminated object, which can range between approximately 10 and 1000 nm.
The x-rays are on average scattered through an angle of the order of lambda/d, which can be as small as 100 Î¼rad (less than 0.01 degrees).
The speckles arise through interference between all the scattered wavelets across the coherently illuminated area and therefore have angular separations that can be as small as lambda/a of the order of 1 Î¼rad.
Note that in order to resolve such features, a detector having 50 Î¼m-sized pixels would need to be at least 50 m downstream of the sample, for hard x-radiation in the Angstrom range.
Normally, however, the illuminated area is limited to only a few microns, and sampleâ€“detector distances of approximately 10 m are more common.
Alternatively, softer x-radiation can be used, although the increased absorption at lower photon energies sets an upper limit to the thickness of objects that can be studied.
You should note also, that because the speckles arise from interference between the scattered wavefronts from all the particles in the sample, the entire speckle pattern will change even if only one particle moves.
The speckle pattern therefore contains information on the positions of all the particles, which can be obtained by inverting the pattern, which, like I say, involves solving the phase problem.
At this point, it is worth introducing the concepts of oversampling and redundancy.
Imagine a scatter pattern that has an intrinsic spatial â€œgraininessâ€� associated with the speckle of a size Delta Q. The spatial frequency range of the signal, although it is random, will extend up to approximately f_max = 1/Delta
Q. The minimum spatial frequency of the detector recording such a pattern needs to be 2f_max, according to the so-called Nyqvist theorem.
In other words, the pixel size needs to be no bigger than half the speckle separation.
If the detector pixel size is smaller than
1/2f_max by a factor beta, one says that the signal has been oversampled by this amount. beta determines the resolution of the real-space solution.
The redundancy, on he other hand, determines how ambiguous any one solution might be.
If the experimental data provides M independent values, and the object under investigation has N unknowns (for example, N â€œvoxelsâ€� of electron density, the linear size of the voxel corresponding to the minimum spatial fluctuation of the density of the sample), then the redundancy is given by M/N. The larger the redundancy, the more likely one is to obtain the correct solution.
Note also that equating M to the number of pixels in the detector is the absolute upper limit.
In nearly all cases, the intensities towards the outside of the detector are so weak that they can be discarded.
Also, if the pixel size is significantly smaller than the typical speckle separations (relating back to the concept of oversampling) then one cannot assume that adjacent pixels record â€œindependentâ€� values.
CXDI can be used to investigate both noncrystalline and crystalline objects.
In the former case, the 3-D speckle pattern associated with the 3-D Fourier transform
(squared) of the object is recorded by rotating the object (and therefore also the scattering pattern) through 180 degrees and recording simultaneously until all of the pattern has passes through the Ewald sphere . This sets very stringent specifications on the mechanical stability of both the rotation table for the object, and the position of the incident x-ray beam.
In the case of small- or nanocrystalline objects, the crystal diffraction pattern has features to it not normally observed in larger crystalline objects.
Consider a homogeneous nanosized object, ignoring to begin with that it may be crystalline.
The scattering amplitude pattern of such an object is simply the Fourier transform of the shape of that object, called the shape function.
A cartoon of how a shape function of a cubic object may look like is shown here on the right - fringes arise due to interference of opposite faces of the cube, to produce a star-shaped object (with six stellations, of which only four are shown here in this
2-D representation).
If we now imagine that the nanocube is a single crystal, then we can expect to see Bragg peaks
- in other words a diffraction pattern.
But this diffraction pattern doesnâ€™t consist of narrow Bragg peaks, but instead, each Bragg peak exhibits the form of the shape function.
The reason for this is that in real space, the nanocrystal is the multiplication of an infinite crystal with the envelope of the nanocrystal, which, by applying the convolution theorem, means that the scattering pattern is the convolution of the Fourier transform of an infinite crystal, in other words a perfect diffraction pattern consisting of infinitely narrow Bragg peaks, convoluted with the Fourier transform of the nanocrystal shape, that is, the shape function shown in the previous slide.
This finite-size effect is also exploited in grazing-incidence small-angle scattering and in surface diffraction.
Now let us return to our experimental setup for recording CXDI data, this time for a crystalline object.
Now, instead of looking at the signal around the (000) forward scattered direct beam , one can move the detector to a Bragg peak (hkl) and record there . This so-called Bragg-CXDI method for crystalline samples has four important consequences.
First, coherent diffractive imaging can be carried out far away from the direct beam, which means one can dispense with a beamstop
(which excludes features in the reconstruction above a certain size).
Also, artefactual diffuse scattering in the forward direction produced by other sources than the sample is avoided.
Thirdly, because the Bragg peak shape is only affected by the electron density of the crystalline part of the object, it is highly sensitive to crystalline defects and strain fields.
And lastly, one need only rotate the sample through a much smaller angular range than in the case of noncrystalline samples, in order for all the features to pass through the Ewald sphere , significantly relaxing the technical specifications of the rotation stage.
We finish this last video of Week 8 with a discussion of ptychography.
Remember that in CXDI, the sample size is limited to being smaller than the coherent part of the beam.
The real-space structure is then calculated using some sort of iterative algorithm which cycles between real space and reciprocal space, varying real-space constraints in each cycle until consistency is arrived at, that is, no further changes are needed in the real-space solution in order for it to agree with the diffraction pattern in reciprocal space.
Ptychography is scanning CXDI, largely though not exclusively of noncrystalline samples.
Importantly, ptychography allows large-scale structures, many times larger than the coherence volume of the beam, to be investigated with the same resolution as offered by CXDI.
The upper limit to the size of the sample under investigation is given by technical issues, in particular the volume of data generated, the computing power needed to solve the structure, and the accuracy and reproducibility of the scanning stage of the sample.
The approach to ptychography is simple.
A coherent beam typically of the order of a few microns in diameter illuminates a part of the sample , and the speckle pattern is recorded.
The sample is then shifted to illuminate a new region , for which a different scattering pattern is recorded.
Importantly, this region should overlap with the previous spot.
This, logically, means that any correct real-space structural solution for both of these speckle patterns MUST contain a common region regarding their detailed structures where they overlapped.
This imposes a strong constraint and provides added redundancy to the algorithm used to solve the structure.
If the overlap is too large, little added information is gained and the scanning procedure is slowed down, while if there is too little overlap, the degree of ambiguity of the solution increases.
As a rule of thumb a 40% areal overlap is close to being optimal.
Ptycography and CXDI will benefit significantly from the increase in coherence of DLSRs compared to 3rd generation facilities.
This can be exploited in one of two manners
- either a reduction in exposure times to obtain the same information; or access to finer detail.
The resolution improves with Q, but the intensity drops off approximately as 1/Q^4, so a hundredfold increase in coherent intensity would allow a factor of 100^1/4, or approximately 3 in
Q, bringing the finest details down to the low nanometer regime.
Indeed, further tricks not directly associated with the increased coherent fraction of DLSRs are liable to increase the speed or accuracy of ptychography by up to another 3 orders of magnitude, through, for example, an increased bandwidth of radiation allowed through the monochromator - remember, this only affects the longitudinal coherence, and it is the lateral coherence that is of primary interest.
Secondly improvements in undulator technology, in particular magnet materials; and thirdly, more efficient optics, for example migrating from Fresnel zone plates to K-B focussing, will all contribute to significant improvements of this burgeoning imaging technique.
Imaging using x-rays is an enormously profitable enterprise, in which insights on the sub-micron to nanometer scale can often be rapidly obtained â€“ indeed, the first demonstration of the power of x-rays was made by Roentgen with his radiographs of human hands.
The impact these must have had on society can hardly be appreciated in a modern world in which medical radiographic imaging is so commonplace.
However, the detailed architectural information provided by tomography on a microscopic scale can still both surprise and delight.
The immediacy of the feedback and the relative ease of an at least qualitative interpretation supplied by x-ray imaging makes it one of the most attractive modern synchrotron techniques.
As still more powerful and coherent x-rays sources such as DLSRs begin to come online, their associated enormous power densities means that any optical components such as focussing lenses will be circumvented if they are not absolutely necessary.
Lensless imaging, in particularly CXDI and more recently ptychography, is emerging not just as an attractive alternative to conventional x-ray microscopy, but may in many cases be the only realistic approach in investigating complex and large-scale structures on a near-atomic scale.
This drive promises still more exciting developments in the near future.
