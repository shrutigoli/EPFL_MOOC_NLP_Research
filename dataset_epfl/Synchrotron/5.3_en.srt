00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,090
Welcome to the third and last video of Week
5 of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,360
and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, I will introduce you to aspects

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,260
of x-ray detector science and technology.

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,180
What do we want an x-ray detector to do? It
needs to be able to detect x-rays and convert

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:35,960
this captured signal into a form which can
be subsequently read out. The first such detector

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,800
was the photographic plate. More recently,
conversion of x-rays to visible light via

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,430
scintillator or phosphor screens meant that
the signal could be detected by scientific

8
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:57,180
devices used also for optical spectroscopy
in the visible and near visible regime. Most

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:04,350
recently, CCDs and hybrid pixel detectors
allow direct detection of x-rays via the production

10
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,750
of electrons in the x-ray absorption process.
An ideal detector would be able to resolve

11
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,260
the spatial distribution of the x-ray signal,
have a high quantum (or capture) efficiency,

12
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,620
deliver signal strengths directly proportional
to the x-ray intensity, be able to record

13
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:32,140
both weak and strong signal simultaneously
(that is, have a high dynamic range), record

14
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:38,250
data rapidly, and be devoid of internal artefacts.

15
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,860
Before describing different detector types
and technology in detail, we first cover the

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:52,931
topic of noise. Any stochastic or random process
composed of a series of discrete events, such

17
00:01:52,931 --> 00:02:03,960
as the arrival of x-ray photons on to a detector
element, is subject to statistical, or ‘Poisson’

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,369
noise. If the average number of events in
a measurement (say, the number of photons

19
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:18,360
recorded in a detector pixel after a fixed
length of exposure time) is N, then the scatter

20
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:28,510
in the data (or, more precisely, the standard
deviation) is +/- N^1/2. So, for example,

21
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,890
if the average intensity of a Bragg peak maximum
on average after many identical measurements

22
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:45,470
is 10000 counts, approximately 68 % of the
results will lie within sigma = +/- 100 counts

23
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:57,330
of this value. However, for a static (time
independent) experiment, the signal strength

24
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:04,190
itself increases linearly with exposure time.
A consequence of this is that in order to

25
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:14,640
achieve a factor X improvement in the signal-to-noise
ratio ∆N/N, one must record X^2 times as

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,630
long. The careful experimenter must therefore
decide how best to invest his or her precious

27
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:29,450
beamtime – does improving the signal-to-noise
ratio of a given signal by, say, a factor

28
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:37,220
of two, justify the necessary fourfold increase
in acquisition times, or would this time be

29
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:46,230
better invested in recording other data points?
Consider the simulated images shown here.

30
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,630
The numbers correspond to the average number
of photons/pixel across each image, which

31
00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:00,810
have been scaled linearly from black to white.
The insets are blowups of the most prominent

32
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:08,160
crater in the image, close to the edge of
the day/night shadow. Note that the image

33
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,410
quality improves significantly between the
first and fourth image (corresponding to an

34
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:29,070
increase in exposure time by a factor of 100),
while subsequent increases in exposure time

35
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:36,481
by first another factor of 25, and then a
factor of 16 (that is, a factor of 400 with

36
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:42,480
respect to the fourth image) reap only dubious
benefits.

37
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,990
What we have described so far is called shot
noise - fluctuations associated with the signal

38
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:55,050
itself. Most detectors also have another source
of noise called dark noise, which occurs even

39
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:03,180
when there is no incident signal. For example,
photosensitive diodes such as CCD pixel elements

40
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,370
exhibit dark noise, caused by crystallographic
defects in the depletion region of the diode

41
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:16,930
device. The level of dark noise can thus vary
from pixel to pixel, depending on the defect

42
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:24,470
concentration in each element. A dark-field
profile can thus be generated by recording

43
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:30,610
in the dark sufficiently long to produce a
statistically reliable response array. It

44
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:36,380
is noted that some modern area detectors have
effectively zero dark noise on account of

45
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,330
the fact that they are not based on diode
technologies.

46
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,800
Readout noise is a source of spurious signal
in CCD detectors produced in the on- chip

47
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,250
amplifier used to convert the collected charge
produced by absorption of x-rays to a voltage

48
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:03,430
(via a capacitor) in the readout process after
the exposure. This becomes particularly critical

49
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,720
when reading out very weak signals.

50
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:16,000
In general, a measured intensity I will be
composed of the signal of interest, S, plus

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,610
a background signal, B, which may be dark
noise, but might also be a real background

52
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:31,120
associated with the experiment. The noise
associated with I, S, and B, are all the square-root

53
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,550
of those values. If, then, the noise associated
with the total signal I is larger than that

54
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:49,710
associated with the signal of interest, i.e.,
the square-root of S, then the signal will

55
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:59,050
be lost in the noise. Two approaches to resolving
this are (a) reduction of B if at all possible

56
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,680
- perhaps it is caused by fluorescence of
diffuse scattering of the incident beam from

57
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,169
a chamber wall - in which case measures can
be taken to remove, or at least, reduce this.

58
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:16,050
If, however, the background is either intrinsic
or impossible to remove, the exposure needs

59
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,289
to be increased until the noise becomes smaller
than S.

60
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:26,960
Another important property of detectors which
can spatially resolve the signal is that of

61
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,600
the point-spread function, or PSF. If a detector
element has a spatial response function which

62
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,460
is not infinitely narrow, then the spatial
distribution of any signal, as recorded on

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,620
the detector, will be a convolution of the
original signal with the form of the detector-element

64
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:55,190
response function. So if the element were
used to detect a signal of zero width (or

65
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:00,900
for practical purposes, a width known to be
much smaller than the element size), then

66
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,700
the recorded signal is the detector’s point-spread
function - the name is self-explanatory - a

67
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:17,370
point is spread to a finite-sized function.
The minimum point=spread function of a 2D

68
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:28,120
pixel array is the pixel size, as within a
given pixel, any spatial variation is lost.

69
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,349
Before discussing more modern technologies,
some older solutions are mentioned here, as

70
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,300
they are still used extensively, if nowadays
more for diagnostic purposes than for actual

71
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,540
experiments.
Photographic plates were used to spatially

72
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:54,899
resolve x-ray signal for many decades until
the advent of image plates, and then CCDs.

73
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,290
They have many drawbacks, including difficulty
in obtaining quantitative relative intensities

74
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:08,140
due primarily to a nonlinear change in transparency
of the photographic plate with signal intensity;

75
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:16,560
a poor dynamic range; poor spatial resolution;
and the very long readout times.

76
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:25,930
Scintillators, such as Ce:YAG, convert x-rays
to visible light by absorbing them, and, via

77
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:33,470
a dopant rapid relaxation through non radiative
processes to low-lying energy levels, which

78
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:42,260
only then relax by emission of a visible or
near-visible photon. Scintillators can then

79
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:47,830
be installed in front of a photomultiplier
tube, which detects the visible light and

80
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:57,610
produces a signal through an avalanche process
in a cascade of dynodes.

81
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,029
Such a detector has no spatial resolution,
other than that provided by slitting down

82
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:10,980
the response area. This is a so-called point
detector.

83
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:19,800
In the central image, both a point detector
and a 1-dimensional are shown . In traditional

84
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,750
x-ray powder diffraction experiments, the
0-D point detector is scanned over an angular

85
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:32,550
range, which may only cover a few degrees,
but may also be several tens of degree, and

86
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,800
require scanning times of several minutes
to several hours. The 1-D detector shown here,

87
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:48,510
called Mythen, consists of an array of 30’720
strip detector elements, each covering an

88
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:57,420
angle of 0.004 degrees. Acquisition is in
parallel, and takes several orders of magnitude

89
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:04,700
less time to record data. This has revolutionised
powder-diffraction experiments at synchrotrons,

90
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:15,700
allowing time-resolved studies that were utterly
unthinkable before its conception.

91
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,540
Two-dimensional photon detectors are commonplace
at synchrotrons, not least at macromolecular

92
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:28,779
crystallography beamlines, such as shown here
in the right hand image.

93
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:36,600
Even larger angular ranges still are now accessible,
such as shown here for the 12-million-pixel

94
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,899
Pilatus detector developed and custom built
for low-energy protein crystallography experiments

95
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:53,089
at the I23 beamline at the Diamond Light Source.

96
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:58,279
Two different approaches to recording x-ray
intensities are summarised in this slide,

97
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:08,040
those of photon counting and integrating detectors.
Imagine a train of photons incident on a detector.

98
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,260
There are two different photon energies, due,
for example, elastic scattering of the incident

99
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:24,060
beam, and lower-energy fluorescence signal
at characteristic energies. These two different

100
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,790
photon energies are shown here as spikes of
two different heights.

101
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:37,910
The philosophy behind photon-counting detectors
is shown on the left. Each detected photon

102
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:44,790
produces a short-lived voltage spike in a
solid-state amplifier, the spike height being

103
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:52,649
proportional to the photon energy. Internal
electronics allow one to distinguish between

104
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:58,850
these photon energies by setting a threshold
voltage and comparing this to that produced

105
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:07,019
by the absorbed photon. If the comparator
registers that the photon spike is larger

106
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:14,820
than the threshold, a digital one is generated
, and sent to a counter. If the photon produces

107
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:23,640
a spike smaller than the threshold, no signal
is registered. This feature is greatly advantageous

108
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,810
in minimising fluorescence background in some
diffraction experiments.

109
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:35,339
CCDs and other integrating devices operate
by accumulating charge each time a photon

110
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:44,209
is detected. So the photons are not read off
one by one, but instead, the total generated

111
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:51,300
charge in each pixel at the end of the exposure
is converted to a digital signal using an

112
00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:01,410
analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The amount
of added charge for each incident photon is

113
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,190
proportional to the photon energy.

114
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:10,980
Let’s look at CCDs a little more closely,
as they remain the most common modern area

115
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:17,190
detector type. They have proved to be so important
and ubiquitous in both science and society

116
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:24,209
at large (there is one in every modern mobile
phone) that their inventors Willard Boyle

117
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:33,260
and George Smith would win the Nobel Prize
in physics in 2009.

118
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:40,181
One can think of CCDs as arrays of buckets,
buckets that collect electrical charge. As

119
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:45,500
already mentioned, the amount of accumulated
charge due to absorption of photons during

120
00:14:45,500 --> 00:15:00,480
the exposure time is proportional to each
photon’s energy and how many have been detected.

121
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,831
After the end of the exposure, this total
“integrated” accumulated charge is read

122
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,839
off.

123
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:17,230
Shown here is a cartoon of a 1-D array of
CCD “buckets”. After the exposure , the

124
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:27,170
charge in each bucket along the row is read
off one after the other by shifting the charge

125
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:41,699
one bucket at a time towards the read-out
ADC. A CCD is therefore a “shift register”

126
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:48,920
in the jargon of semiconductor electronics.
Associated with this shifting of charge and

127
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:57,459
reading out is a readout noise, which may
be significant.

128
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:04,130
The analogy of a CCD pixel being like a bucket
extends to the fact that, just as a bucket

129
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:11,399
can carry only a finite volume of water, a
CCD pixel can accommodate only a limited electrical

130
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:20,579
charge. If, during the exposure, a CCD pixel
is exposed to too many photons, the excess

131
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:28,970
charge spills over into adjacent buckets - this
undesirable artefact is called “blooming”,

132
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,459
which is particularly observed in the readout
direction, resulting in streaks of saturated

133
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:41,870
signal. Blooming is especially troublesome
in CCDs for experiments where weak (but important)

134
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:48,740
signal lies close to much stronger signal.

135
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,019
Photon-Counting devices have their own limitations.
The spikes generated in the amplifier decay

136
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:03,680
again in a finite time of the order of 100
ns *****. If two photons arrive within this

137
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:10,689
time, the second of these will not be registered.
But synchrotron pulses from the direct but

138
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:21,089
monochromatized direct beam contain approximately
3 x 10^4 photons over 30 ps. The average temporal

139
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:31,159
separation between photons is therefore only
about 1 fs, some 10^8 times shorter than the

140
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:38,859
recovery, or “dead”, time of the spikes.
So, for example, if the entire direct beam

141
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:45,749
is incident on just one detector pixel, it
is necessary to attenuate this using filters

142
00:17:45,749 --> 00:17:53,749
by a factor of approximately 10^8 in order
to record this with any accuracy.

143
00:17:53,749 --> 00:18:00,330
The situation is in fact still more serious,
as the arrival rate of photons is not perfectly

144
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:09,460
constant, but in fact stochastic. So although
the average rate of arrival may be N_0, this

145
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,619
will fluctuate strongly. One can correct for
the observed intensity, or number of photon

146
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:22,809
counts, N_obs, for this statistical fluctuation
using the equation shown here and plotted

147
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:29,929
on the right-hand side. For average incident
rates equal to the reciprocal of the dead

148
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:39,729
time, tau, the curve of N_obs has a gradient
of zero. Hence, in order to ensure one remains

149
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:48,330
to the left of this, the real arrival rate
N_0 should, as a rule of thumb, not exceed

150
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,429
1/(2 tau).

151
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:58,960
The relative performance of photon-counting
and integrating CCD detectors is shown here.

152
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,450
First, because photon counters count photons,
they have an intrinsic dead time. Integrating

153
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:13,710
detectors do not suffer from this limitation,
an important aspect we discuss in just a moment.

154
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:20,720
In most other aspects, including the dynamic
range, readout times, noise, photon-energy

155
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:27,070
discrimination, and the point-spread function,
photon counters perform better than integrators.

156
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:36,240
However, CCDs can presently provide smaller
pixel sizes by an order of magnitude.

157
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,169
But let us return to the issue of the dead
time of photon counters in the context of

158
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:54,520
XFELs. The instantaneous arrival rate of photons
within XFEL pulses is 11 orders of magnitude

159
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:01,710
higher still than at synchrotrons. This would
therefore require attenuation by 19 orders

160
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:08,359
of magnitude of the XFEL direct beam in order
for it to be detectable using photon-counting

161
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:17,350
technology, which would completely obviate
one of the primary features of XFEL radiation.

162
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:24,979
Photon counters cannot be used at XFELs, and
integrating devices must instead be employed,

163
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:30,019
ones with high sensitivity and a large dynamic
range.

164
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:35,549
With this in mind, the Jungfrau detector has
been recently developed. Although it is an

165
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:42,970
integrating device, it is based on the same
pixel technology of the photon counting Eiger

166
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,979
detector. The required high dynamic range
and sensitivity is achieved by the Jungfrau

167
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:54,859
automatically changing its sensitivity according
to whether the signal is weak or strong.

168
00:20:54,859 --> 00:21:02,679
This begs the question, how does this work?
No electronics is capable of reacting within

169
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:10,830
the few tens of fs of XFEL pulses. The answer
is that a buffer layer on top of the Jungfrau

170
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:18,850
pixels first absorbs the photons , after which
the generated electrons require of the order

171
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,539
of 20 ns to drift across to the pixels themselves,
plenty enough time for modern electronics

172
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:30,679
to respond.

173
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:37,580
How this is done exactly is shown here. As
the charge accumulates in a first capacitor,

174
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:45,610
the voltage increases. Once this reaches a
certain threshold, a switch is closed to include

175
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,499
a second capacitor in parallel. The total
capacitance of individual capacitors wired

176
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:59,360
in parallel is simply their sum, hence by
adding the second capacitor, the capacitance

177
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:08,450
increases, and the voltage drops according
to V = Q/C. A third range of charge is accessible

178
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,249
by the inclusion of a third capacitor.

179
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:21,970
Until now, we have discussed (if somewhat
implicitly) mainly experiments in which one

180
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:29,249
photon energy is of interest, as is normally
the case in scattering and diffraction experiments.

181
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:34,789
In many spectroscopic experiments, not least
in x-ray fluorescence, the spectrum emitted

182
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:43,429
by an irradiated sample is of interest, for
which one requires a dispersive setup. One

183
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:52,659
approach, called wavelength dispersive spectrometry
(or WDX) is to scan the energy using a crystal

184
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:59,320
and exploiting Bragg’s law - the crystal
is rotated and the diffracted intensity measured

185
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,419
using a point detector rotating at twice the
crystal rotating rate. This approach is slow

186
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:13,369
and with low sensitivity, as only a small
angular range of the emitted radiation is

187
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:21,739
captured. Its one advantage is that it has
a high resolution.

188
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:28,229
In energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDX), the
photon energies are converted into voltage

189
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:36,559
spikes with amplitudes proportional to the
photon energy within doped semiconductor devices.

190
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:43,570
Different energies can be recorded in parallel,
and the detector can capture a large angular

191
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:52,840
cross-section. EDX is thus cheap, fast, and
highly sensitive, though it has a resolution

192
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:00,780
two orders of magnitude worse than in WDX.
A comparison between EDX and WDX spectra for

193
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:05,700
a clay mineral shows this dramatic difference.

194
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:14,779
A nice example of EDX is shown here of a fossil
fish excavated from the Green Rive formation

195
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:26,059
of Fossil Lake in Wyoming. The sample was
irradiated with focussed 17.2 keV x-rays and

196
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:34,059
the fluorescence signal recorded as the fossil
sample was rastered.

197
00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:43,080
Shown here is the result of selecting a narrow
section of the EDX spectra at 12.97 keV, corresponding

198
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:50,099
to the thorium L-alpha fluorescence signal.
The high levels of thorium are are caused

199
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:59,149
by its substitution for calcium in the phosphate
mineral that composes the bone, fluorapatite.

200
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:07,059
Lastly, a modern alternative to EDX and WDX
detectors combines some of the most attractive

201
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:14,320
features of both. Von Hamos spectrometers
operate by collecting a large angular cross-section

202
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,279
of fluorescence on a cylindrically bent single
crystal. The bend radius, R_b, has its origin

203
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:29,469
on the same axis containing the sample and
a 1-D or 2-D detector. This configuration

204
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:36,119
means that von-Hamos detectors have a high
sensitivity, while the use of a 1- or 2-D

205
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:42,700
detector allows parallel acquisition of the
entire spectrum. These detectors are being

206
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,650
used increasingly for high-resolution and
time-resolved x-ray emission studies, not

207
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:55,940
least at XFELs.

208
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,779
In summary, this last video of Week 5 has
covered some basic but important aspects of

209
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:08,529
different types of x-ray detectors to complete
our discussion of beamlines and optics.

210
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:13,960
In these first five weeks, we have learned
how x-rays interact with material, how synchrotron

211
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,889
radiation is generated and what its properties
are, and in this most recent week, how this

212
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:27,369
is subsequently manipulated for synchrotron-based
experiments. In the next three weeks, we will

213
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:34,549
discuss aspects of synchrotron experiments,
including scattering and diffraction, x-ray

214
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:41,850
spectroscopies, and x-ray imaging. We begin
next week with x-ray diffraction and scattering.
