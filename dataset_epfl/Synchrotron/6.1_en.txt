Welcome to Week 6 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week is concerned with x-ray diffraction and scattering and its use at synchrotrons.
After some introductory remarks about why diffraction is attractive, particularly using synchrotron light, I will recap some basic concepts required to understand the remainder of this weekâ€™s contents.
This will be followed by three types of diffraction experiment, namely single-crystal and powder diffraction, and macromolecular crystallography
(which is actually just a certain sort of single-crystal diffraction, but of such high importance, that it is covered separately).
Lastly, small-angle x-ray scattering and x-ray reflectivity will be detailed before a brief overview of how diffraction and scattering experiments at XFELs differ from those at synchrotrons.
In this first video, we ask what is diffraction and why is it used; how diffraction at synchrotrons opens up experimental approaches excluded to lab-based sources; and then a brief review of some diffraction basic concepts.
A knowledge of the detailed atomic structure of condensed matter is exceedingly important in many fields of the natural sciences.
In many cases, a knowledge of the atomic structure leads directly to the functionality of the system, as exemplified by the now famous understatement of Watson and Crick in the penultimate paragraph of their Nobel-prize-winning Nature paper on the structure of DNA in 1953: â€œIt has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic materialâ€�.
This correlation between structure and function is not limited to biology however, and many insights to physical and chemical properties have been made in the fields of electronics, for example in the strongly-correlated electron systems based on perovskite structures; or in energy/catalysis and the role of open structures such as zeolites.
So, given the need to obtain atomic-resolution to understand the physical properties of a given system, what should be our approach?
First, it should be stressed that in order to observe features of a certain characteristic size, one needs to use a probe with a wavelength of similar dimensions.
This means, for electromagnetic radiation, x-rays.
So can we use an x-ray lens?
Letâ€™s consider how much we need to magnify an object in order to directly image it.
Interatomic spacings are of the order of a few Angstrom, while detectors presently have at best pixel sizes of a few microns, that is, 10^4 times larger, which thus defines our magnification q/p.
But no x-ray lens is capable of such a huge magnification factor, hence full-field direct imaging on the Angstrom scale is excluded.
What can we do to circumvent this problem?
The scattered x-ray signal of an object past a certain distance from that object is actually nothing more than the Fourier transform of the object . A lens refocusses this scattered light back into an image - one can thus consider a lens to perform an inverse Fourier transform on the scattered signal to regain an image of the original object.
Now, instead of using a lens, which weâ€™ve argued is anyway impractical for hard x-rays, we simply capture the scattered signal from our object using an area detector . We send this scattered signal to a computer which then performs the operation of the lens using mathematical algorithms . This is called â€œphasingâ€� the signal, as the detector measures not the signal amplitude (including the phase), but the intensity.
We have therefore lost half of the information, the phases between the individual components of the scattered signal.
Strategies for regaining these are varied and sophisticated, and we will touch on some of these later in the course.
Once phasing is completed, however, the original structure is recovered.
Diffraction and scattering experiments at synchrotrons profit from synchrotron radiation for several reasons.
The low divergence and high flux of synchrotron radiation compared to lab sources means that better angularly resolved and much higher-intensity patterns can be recorded, much facilitating the process of phasing and obtaining an atomic structure.
The two powder-diffraction patterns on the right highlight this difference - the top one was recorded in 5 seconds using synchrotron radiation and a 1-D Mythen detector, while the lower one (blown up by a factor of 1000 here) was recorded over nearly three hours at a lab-based source, and exhibits a significantly broader signal, by approximately a factor of two.
The low emittance of synchrotrons can also be exploited to obtain tight focusses, of the order of a micron, for investigation of very small crystalline samples, such as the lysozyme crystals shown in the upper image.
The low emittance can be otherwise exploited by allowing a large working distance by parallelising the beam as much as possible, in order to accommodate complex experimental setups, such as that shown here in the lower image.
High photon energies up to a mega-electronvolt are accessible at high-energy synchrotron storage rings such as the ESRF, APS, and SPring8.
The high penetration lengths of this radiation means that larger objects such as aeronautical components or large fossil specimens can be probed.
A unique property of synchrotron light is its tunability.
As we discussed in detail in the second week, the scattering amplitude and phase of a certain atom type changes abruptly and sometimes very strongly close to an absorption edge of that atom, that is, at an energy equating the binding energy of one of the atomâ€™s electrons (normally a core electron).
By recording diffraction data in this region, techniques such as multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction, MAD, and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, SAD), can unambiguously solve the phase problem mentioned a few slides previously.
MAD, which exploits the tunability are only possible at synchrotrons and XFELs.
SAD, which uses a single wavelength, can in principle be carried out using a lab source, and indeed the first ever report of SAD was using a copper K-alpha source.
However, the subtle differences between pairs of signals means that in most cases, only data from synchrotrons have sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to extract meaningful information.
The remainder of this first video will be devoted to a recap of some essential diffraction basic concepts.
This course is not a treatise on crystallography but does, in particular this week, describe crystallography experiments at synchrotrons.
As a result, some basic rules of diffraction should be explained, which include a description of crystals, the concept of reciprocal space,
Braggâ€™s law, and the Ewald sphere.
We begin with a description of crystals.
We concern ourselves here with the classical definition of crystals, invoking translational symmetry, although it should be noted that a new class of material, quasicrystals, were discovered in the 1980s, which also exhibit sharp diffraction patterns, but which never repeat themselves through translational symmetry.
A crystal is defined as consisting of a framework of evenly spaced points in space , known as the Bravais lattice, plus a so-called basis of atomic positions associated with each Bravais-lattice point, to generate a crystal.
The separation in three dimensions between adjacent Bravais-lattice points is defined by the three lattice vectors a, b, and c (of which a and b are shown here in this 2-dimensional representation).
The translational symmetry of crystals mean that they remain invariant under a translation by a vector T = the vector sum of integer multiples of the lattice vectors.
In the 2-dimensional example shown here, T
= 3a + 2b.
The volume of a unit cell, that is, the repeat unit in 3-dimensional space, is the cross product of one lattice vector (here, c) with the area defined by the scalar product of the other two vectors (here a dot b) . In this vector algebra, the relative angular orientations are implicit.
The other three lattice constants are the angles alpha, beta, and gamma, where alpha is the angle opposite a, subtended by b and c, and so forth.
Armed with this information, the unit-cell volume is given by the expression shown here.
Note that in high-symmetry cases, such as cubic or orthorhombic crystals, this expression becomes much simpler.
A lattice plane, or more accurately, a family of parallel lattice planes, intersect with the Bravais lattice at three non-colinear points that are integer fractions of the lattice vectors that define that Bravais lattice.
The integers defining these fractions are the Miller indices.
So in this first example, the (100) plane intersects a at h = 1, but never intersects b or c, which implies k and l = 0, as b/0 and c/0 equal infinity - the distance required before b and c are intersected by the (100) plane!
Using similar arguments, the top-middle and top right examples are clearly the (110) and
(111) planes, respectively.
Bottom left shows the (200), because the in the a-direction, the plane crosses a at a/2.
In the bottom middle example, the intersection points are at 1/2, 1/3, and 1, hence this is the (213) plane . The last example is the
(012) plane .
The separation between crystallographic planes is given by the lattice constants a, b, c, alpha, beta, and gamma, plus the Miller indices
(hkl) according to the expressions shown here.
Again, although these seem complex for the general case (for a so-called triclinic crystal, which exhibits the lowest symmetry), things become much simpler for those cases where one or more angles are right-angles and/or two or more of a, b, and c are equal to each other.
Examples of families of four different crystal planes in 2-dimensions are shown on the right.
Now we have described crystals, we should see how x-rays scattered from them look like.
Let us begin with a single point scatterer.
The far-field pattern (remember, this is the
Fourier transform of the object) is a modulated
Gaussian.
Interference between scattering from two adjacent spots results in interference fringes much like seen in the famous Youngsâ€™ double slit experiment. and increasing the number of evenly spaced scatterers will sharpen that interference signal, just like the maxima of a grating monochromator sharpen with the number of scattering facets, described in the second video of last week.
Extending this motif to a second dimension causes the pattern to change from being a set of fringes to being a set of spots. while the angle between scatterers is reflected at 90 degrees in the interference or diffraction pattern.
Also importantly, the larger the separation between the scatterers, the smaller their angular separation, or separation in reciprocal space, and vice versa.
Hence, crystals with small unit cells such as NaCl have widely spaced diffraction features, while protein crystals, which have characteristic repeat dimensions two orders of magnitude larger than NaCl, have very crowded diffraction patterns.
In the second week of this course, we described
Thomson scattering and the scattering vector
Q, that is the vector difference between the incoming and scattered wavevectors.
The direction of Q is ALWAYS at right-angles to the scattering planes responsible for the scattered signal in the direction of k_out, while its magnitude can be expressed in a variety of ways.
We determined Q to be equal to 4 pi/lambda sin theta, and, combining this with Braggâ€™s law, lambda = 2d sin theta, we see that Q is equal to 2 pi/d_hkl.
So, for example, Q for the Si(004) reflection has a value of 2 pi/d(004). d(004) is equal to 1.3578 Angstrom, hence
Q = 4.628 A^-1.
A convenient practical expression for Q is also given and is equal to 1.0135 (close to unity) times the photon energy in keV times sin theta.
Because the incident and scattered wavevectors have equal magnitude (we are concerned here only with elastic scattering), one can use the construct known as the Ewald sphere.
The incident beam obviously points in the
(000) direction, whereas the scattered beam, if at a Bragg peak defined by the Miller indices
(hkl), terminates on that Bragg maximum.
The orientation of the crystal that will result in the hkl Bragg peak lighting up is when this point in the diffraction pattern sits on the Ewald sphere.
Let us consider one such example to make this clearer.
Consider a crystal at some random orientation, and we are interested in looking at a certain
Bragg reflection (hkl).
We can now rotate the crystal, which will also cause the diffraction pattern to rotate in exactly the same manner.
When the rotation angle is such that the (hkl) spot sits on the Ewald sphere, in other words, when the size of the wavevector along the scattering direction is equal in magnitude to the incident wavevector, we will see the corresponding Bragg maximum.
So, by rotating a crystal around an axis while recording the pattern using an area detector, different Bragg maxima will light up and can be recorded, as shown schematically here.
This is the basic approach to most single-crystal diffraction experiments, in particular in macromolecular crystallography.
In this first video of Week 6, the arguments for the need of diffraction experiments, in particular at synchrotrons, have been laid out.
The basic rules needed to understand different types of diffraction experiments have been covered.
This leads us on in the next video to a discussion of the most common synchrotron-based diffraction methods.
