00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:10,809
Welcome to the second video of Week 4 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,280
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
This video reviews the magnet lattice and
insertion devices.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,640
The magnet lattice is responsible for keeping
the electron beam on a closed orbit, including

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,780
focusing it and chromatically correcting for
electrons of slightly different kinetic energies.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,610
The dipole bending magnets also produce synchrotron
radiation.

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:42,650
While in general being less brilliant than
insertion devices by two to three orders of

8
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:48,460
magnitude, they are still highly brilliant
sources of synchrotron radiation and are used

9
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,600
extensively in most facilities.

10
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,960
It is the insertion devices, however, which
are generally (though not exclusively) most

11
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,810
sought after.

12
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:05,600
We will finish this video by examining these
in detail.

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,409
Shown here are “mugshots” of typical bending
magnets, quadrupoles, and sextupoles at third-generation

14
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:16,170
synchrotron facilities.

15
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:23,470
They are mounted on girders and can be subtly
repositioned and realigned in order to optimise

16
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:30,460
the magnet fields relative to the electron-beam
orbit.

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:36,741
Typically, bending magnets come in pairs in
a given arc-section of the storage ring, or

18
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:40,549
sometimes in triplets, at third-generation
facilities.

19
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:48,510
It is briefly mentioned here, and discussed
in detail in the next video, that the next

20
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:55,409
generation facilities, DLSRs, are characterised
by not having pairs or triplets of bending

21
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:03,186
magnets, but clusters of five, seven, or even
nine in an arc section of the ring.

22
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:08,890
In order to understand why dipole bending
magnets are never single, we begin with the

23
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,780
simplest configuration, that of the double-bend
achromat, also called the “Chasman-Green

24
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,130
lattice”, named after its inventors.

25
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,970
Imagine electrons of different energy entering
the magnetic field of a bending magnet.

26
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,630
The energy difference, as we have already
mentioned, may be as much as a couple of thousandths

27
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,890
of their nominal storage-ring energy.

28
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:46,530
So a 3-GeV ring may have electrons with an
energy spread measured in a few MeV.

29
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:52,090
Due to this spread in energy, the electrons
will execute different paths as they travel

30
00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:01,730
through the bending magnet , the faster one
being less bent than the slower ones, which,

31
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,850
if left uncorrected, will blow up the electron-beam
in the horizontal plane by an unacceptable

32
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:12,020
degree.

33
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,890
This is resolved by placing a focussing quadrupole
magnet (FQM, described in detail shortly)

34
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,590
after the bending magnet, then a mirror image
of this bend downstream of the FQM.

35
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:37,960
This refocusses the electrons back onto a
common path and is called a double-bend achromat.

36
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:44,239
With this manipulation of the electrons is
associated a certain emittance, given by the

37
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,430
formula shown here.

38
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:54,069
Theta is the angle of a single bending magnet,
expressed in radians.

39
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:03,239
So, for example, a 10-degree turn of a bending
magnet, and a gamma-value of 4700 yields a

40
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,690
lower limit for the horizontal emittance of
approximately 3 nm.rad.

41
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,079
Note that this is significantly larger, by
almost three orders of magnitude, than the

42
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:26,180
diffraction limit of 1-Angstrom photons of
approximately 8 pm.rad.

43
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:32,370
The magnet lattice design and its optimisation
therefore largely determine the horizontal

44
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:38,690
emittance of the facility.

45
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,919
The central element of the DBA was the focussing
quadrupole.

46
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,840
We now consider quadrupoles in more detail.

47
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,100
Quadrupoles are just that - a four-pole array
of magnets, with alternating north and south

48
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,810
poles facing inwards, as shown here.

49
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,320
If we recall the Lorentz force and its sense
of direction from the first video of last

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,230
week, we can see that electrons moving out
of the screen towards you (indicated by the

51
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:19,720
blue dot and circle) will feel different forces,
depending on its position.

52
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,030
Exactly in the quadrupole centre, all the
forces cancel and the electrons should remain

53
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,570
unaffected.

54
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,650
Deviations in the electrons’ position up
or down from the central plane will cause

55
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:42,120
them to experience a restoring force to the
centre - they will be refocussed, in other

56
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
words.

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,979
In contrast, if the electrons are left or
right of the centre, the forces will accentuate

58
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:55,110
this deviation - they will be defocussed.

59
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:01,600
The action of focussing or defocussing in
the horizontal plane defines the naming convention

60
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:15,650
for quadrupole, so, the example shown here
is a defocussing, or D-quadrupole magnet (DQM).

61
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:23,259
If the array is rotated by 90 degrees, however,
the electrons are focussed horizontally and

62
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:30,681
defocussed vertically, and this configuration
is called a focussing quadrupole magnet, or

63
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,930
FQM.

64
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:43,220
By the correct placement of a FQM (here labelled
F-4) and a DQM (or D-4) after each other,

65
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:49,139
the electron beam can be focussed both vertically
and horizontally, though at different positions

66
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,509
along the central axis, according to the electrons’
energy.

67
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:02,949
This longitudinal dispersion can be subsequently
chromatically corrected using sextupole magnets,

68
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:09,660
which have focal lengths that are inversely
proportional to the distance of the electrons

69
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,550
from the central axis.

70
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,570
We now move on to a discussion of insertion
devices.

71
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,150
As has been mentioned several times already,
insertion devices are sources of synchrotron

72
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:32,860
radiation consisting of arrays of alternating
N-S, S-N dipoles placed at the straight sections

73
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,190
of the storage rings.

74
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:46,800
There are two sorts of insertion device - the
wiggler and the undulator.

75
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,250
Although at first glance they seem similar,
differences in the amplitude of the oscillatory

76
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:59,960
path executed by the electrons as they pass
along the array of magnets result in strikingly

77
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,970
different emission spectra.

78
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:12,760
The periodicity of the magnet arrays in wigglers
and undulators are lambda_w and lambda_u,

79
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:21,520
respectively, and are of the order of several
millimetres to a few tens of cm, depending

80
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,509
intimately on the magnets’ B-field and the
range of photon energies the insertion device

81
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,680
has been designed for.

82
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,249
Perhaps the parameter that best distinguishes
undulators from wigglers is the so-called

83
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,439
K-parameter.

84
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:45,869
This expresses the ratio between the maximum
angular excursion of the electrons due to

85
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:51,809
the magnet array, phi-max, to the natural
opening angle of the synchrotron radiation,

86
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:52,809
1/gamma.

87
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,610
K is therefore equal to phi-max times gamma.

88
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:03,290
It emerges from a simple calculation of the
Lorentz forces that this is equal to eB0/mck_u,w,

89
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:17,639
where k_u or w is the wavevector 2pi/lambda_u
or w, of the magnet array.

90
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:26,089
This can be expressed in practical units as
being equal to 0.934 times lambda_u or w in

91
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:34,519
cm multiplied by B0 in Tesla.

92
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:41,160
Insertion devices for which K is a large number,
that is, the electron angular excursions far

93
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,810
exceed the natural opening angle 1/gamma,
are wigglers.

94
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:57,199
Undulators have much smaller K-values, typically
somewhere between 0.3 and 3.

95
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:01,300
We begin with a description of wigglers.

96
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:07,269
One can think of a wiggler simply as a bank
of bending magnets in series.

97
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:17,149
If the wiggler consists of N periods of lambda_w,
there are 2N bending magnets.

98
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:24,549
The output power would thus be 2N times as
powerful as a single bending magnet having

99
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:27,360
the same design parameters.

100
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,829
The horizontal angular spread of radiation
emerging from wigglers is equal to phi-max

101
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,380
and is measured in a few mrad.

102
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:45,231
Also, the spectral features of wigglers are
essentially the same as from a bending magnet

103
00:10:45,231 --> 00:10:54,839
- the spectra are broadband, although the
flux is larger because of the 2N poles.

104
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:00,749
The power output from a wiggler has a very
similar form to that already provided for

105
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,540
bending magnets in the second video last week.

106
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:15,799
The factor of 0.633 is half that of that given
for bending magnets, 1.266, because in this

107
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:24,449
expression, the MAXIMUM B-field B0 is given,
and this drops to zero in between the poles,

108
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:28,429
whereas for the bending magnets, B is constant.

109
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:37,059
If one plugs in typical values for the electron
energy, magnet field strength, wiggler length,

110
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:44,819
and beam current, one obtains an output radiative
power measured in several kW, and can be an

111
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:50,949
order of magnitude higher still for the most
powerful of these devices.

112
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:58,850
Thermal management of this is therefore critical
in order to avoid optical elements downstream

113
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:05,959
of the wiggler at the beamline being destroyed.

114
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:12,550
The output power after monochromatization
is of the order of 10 mW, thus the efficiency

115
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:19,489
of wigglers when operated at a quasi-single
wavelength is of the order of 10^-6.

116
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:34,410
Their brilliance typically span a range of
10^13 to 10^17 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW.

117
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,249
How does one transition from a wiggler to
an undulator?

118
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:44,929
As already mentioned, undulators have a much
lower K-value, being close to unity.

119
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:50,249
From the expression for K, we see there are
in principle two variables we could change

120
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,399
to achieve this.

121
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,809
Either one decreases the magnetic field strength,
or otherwise, shorten the ID period, lambda_u

122
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:01,559
or w.

123
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,360
Reducing the magnetic field strength is a
bad idea, as this will be associated with

124
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,040
an unacceptable drop-off in the power output.

125
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,429
Instead, undulators generally have shorter
periods, lambda_u (though they remain still

126
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:22,889
of the order of several cm when designed to
generate soft x-rays and ultraviolet radiation,

127
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,989
as we shall see shortly).

128
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:31,509
So, although undulators may seem at first
glance to look similar to wigglers, the main

129
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:39,739
differences being in a shortening of the magnet
period and a consequent reduction in K, the

130
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:48,209
spectra look very different the wigglers produce
broadband radiation, while undulators are

131
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:58,399
characterised by narrow peaks of high intensity
at regular intervals in energy.

132
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,869
This begs the question, Why?

133
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:12,509
The reduction in K means that the emission
lobes with natural opening angle +/- 1/gamma

134
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:17,470
will now overlap.

135
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:23,369
This overlap means that they interfere with
one another, and consequently only certain

136
00:14:23,369 --> 00:14:29,860
wavelengths will interfere constructively.

137
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,959
So what is the condition for constructive
interference?

138
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,350
Consider this schematic figure.

139
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:47,189
Radiation is emitted at time t = 0 at point
A. After a time t = T’ the electron has

140
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:56,129
moved one undulation downstream to point B
along the path S, while the radiation that

141
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:04,889
originated at A has propagated a distance
cT′.

142
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:14,190
The difference in these two distances is cT′
− lambda-u, and only that radiation with

143
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:25,690
a wavelength λn equal to an integral fraction
1/n of this will interfere constructively.

144
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,669
The precise derivation for this condition
for destructive interference is straightforward

145
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:39,239
but fairly long winded - for those interested
in understanding this more deeply, it is given

146
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:45,209
step-by-step in my text book “Introduction
to Synchrotron Radiation - Techniques and

147
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:46,439
Applications”.

148
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:55,499
For now, however, the condition is given without
derivation here for radiation along the central

149
00:15:55,499 --> 00:16:00,739
axis of the undulator.

150
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:08,769
This expression can be re-expressed in practical
units, as shown here.

151
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:19,619
As a rule of thumb, for most 3rd-generation
facilities, the fraction 13.056 lambda_u/E^2

152
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:30,269
in cm/GeV^2 is close to (normally a little
larger than) unity, lets say, four, and thus

153
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:37,359
nlambda_n is approximately 4 + 2K^2.

154
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:41,899
This is only an exceedingly rough guideline,
and can change substantially depending on

155
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,569
the undulator design.

156
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,499
Let’s go with it for the time being (it’s
not a bad approximation, for example, for

157
00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:53,350
the undulator serving the Materials Science
beamline at the Swiss Light Source).

158
00:16:53,350 --> 00:17:04,130
Let us consider, for example, the fifth harmonic
(n = 5), and a K-value of 1.5.

159
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:14,730
This results in 5 times lambda_5 = 8.5, and
therefore lambda_5, the wavelength selected

160
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,130
at the fifth harmon = 1.7 Angstroms.

161
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:28,990
But this seems to imply that one can only
select very specific wavelengths.

162
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,130
If for one reason or another one wants to
access a wavelength in between the maxima,

163
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,870
shown schematically here with the yellow arrow,
or indeed if one wants to SCAN the energy

164
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:47,640
continuously, how does one go about this?

165
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,919
Again, the clue is in our expression for K.

166
00:17:51,919 --> 00:18:00,600
We cannot easily change either gamma, the
storage-ring energy, or lambda_u, the undulator

167
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,720
period, but we CAN change B0, the maximum
B-field.

168
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,390
If, for example, we increase the field by
driving the upper and lower jaws of the undulator

169
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,669
magnet array together,

170
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:20,370
K will increase.

171
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,710
The term on the right hand side of our expression
for the condition for constructive interference

172
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:35,289
also increases, and thus for a given n, lambda_n
will also increase (and the photon energy

173
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,310
will DECREASE).

174
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:45,240
We therefore need only to adjust the gap size
so that the spectrum contracts along the energy

175
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:56,110
axis until a spectral maximum lies at our
energy (or wavelength) of interest.

176
00:18:56,110 --> 00:19:02,070
Undulators are therefore tuned by varying
the gap between the poles of the magnet array.

177
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:10,950
So, for example, a gap size of 5.5 mm might
produce an undulator-spectrum such as shown

178
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:23,710
here, while decreasing this to 4.5 mm will
access a different set of maxima.

179
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,830
One cannot decrease the gap size to arbitrarily
small values.

180
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:34,480
Below a certain gap, the weak halo of electrons
that generally surround the main electron

181
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,029
beam will collide with the magnets and quickly
destroy them, and also produce a high flux

182
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:47,840
of so-called Bremsstrahlung, containing photon
energies as high as the storage-ring energy,

183
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,590
in the hard gamma-ray regime.

184
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,260
So any given undulator will have a design
minimum gap size.

185
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:06,190
In order to tune from low to high energies,
therefore, one proceeds as follows.

186
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:13,010
The gap is closed to its minimum allowed value,
here 4 mm.

187
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:19,620
In this example, the first harmonic is inaccessible
as the beamline was designed for energies

188
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,960
above about 5 keV.

189
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,950
So we begin with the second harmonic.

190
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:36,700
This will drift to higher energies from, in
this example, approximately 4 keV to 5.5 keV,

191
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,730
as the gap is opened, as shown here.

192
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:49,500
Opening the gap still further is thereafter
no longer profitable, as the energy now becomes

193
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:57,210
accessible using the next harmonic, the third
harmonic, at the smallest gap, for which the

194
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,760
power output is highest.

195
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:08,360
Thus, one jumps repeatedly from one harmonic
to the next as soon as that next harmonic

196
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,880
can access the energy with the smallest allowed
gap.

197
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,419
The photon emittance of undulators is the
narrowest of all 3rd generation sources, being

198
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:31,240
approximately equal to 1/sqrt(nN) gamma, where
small n is the harmonic number, and large

199
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,080
N is the number of periods in the undulator
array.

200
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,210
This is measured in a few microradians to
a few tens of microradian.

201
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:50,929
Don’t forget, however, that in the horizontal
plane, the emittance is much larger due to

202
00:21:50,929 --> 00:21:54,519
contributions for the electron beam.

203
00:21:54,519 --> 00:22:02,149
Even in the vertical direction, the electron
contribution will dominate, but less so.

204
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:07,429
In addition the relative spectral width of
the odd harmonics (which for subtle reasons

205
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:12,920
that lie outside the scope of this introductory
course, are more intense and narrower than

206
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:25,830
the even harmonics), is given by lambda_n/Delta
lambda_n = small n times large N.

207
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,590
The spectrally integrated power from undulators
is much less than that from wigglers, by an

208
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:39,440
order of magnitude, while their peak intensities
are generally significantly higher.

209
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,870
Undulators are, at about 10^-4, therefore
approximately 100 times more efficient than

210
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:52,480
wigglers and pose a less severe problem regarding
thermal management, though this can still

211
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,220
be significant if one considers that the beam
divergence is much smaller than for wigglers,

212
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:06,870
hence the areal power density on the first
optical elements before monochromatization

213
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,289
can be higher still than for wigglers.

214
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:24,120
The brilliance of undulators is approximately
10^18 to 10^21 ph/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW, three

215
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,330
orders of magnitude larger than for wigglers.

216
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,200
We finish this video by briefly mentioning
that the polarisation of the light produced

217
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:42,650
by undulators can be adjusted so that any
desired polarisation can be achieved regarding

218
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:49,440
both its angle around the emission axis (i.e.,
anywhere between conventional linear horizontal

219
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:58,899
polarisation and linear vertical) and its
degree of ellipticity, between linear and

220
00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,850
fully circular.

221
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,779
This is achieved using a so-called APPLE undulator.

222
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:13,830
Both the upper and lower magnet arrays are
split lengthways in two, and one subset can

223
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:19,009
be shifted longitudinally with respect to
the other.

224
00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:26,370
Shown here are just five possible configurations.
of linear horizontal (LH), linear vertical

225
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:38,299
(LV), linear tilted (LT), right-circularly
polarised (RCP) and left-circularly polarised

226
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:39,499
(LCP).

227
00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:45,440
This capability can be crucial to the success
of certain spectroscopic techniques such as,

228
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:53,509
to name just one example, in x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (XMCD).

229
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:59,669
In summary, you have learnt in this video
how electrons are steered, focussed, and squeezed

230
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:06,690
in the magnet lattice, while the physics of
insertion devices has also been described.

231
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,080
In the next and final video of this week,
the physics of diffraction-limited storage

232
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,880
rings and XFELs will be covered.
