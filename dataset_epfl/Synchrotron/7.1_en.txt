Welcome to the first video of Week 7 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week, we discuss different spectroscopies available at x-ray facilities.
Synchrotrons are unique insofar that one can tune the photon energy, allowing experiments to be performed that are excluded to lab-based x-ray sources.
In this first video, we will cover some basic concepts in x-ray spectroscopy, including energy balance considerations, and the properties of photoelectrons.
The second video is primarily concerned with absorption spectroscopies, which absolutely require the tunability of synchrotron radiation.
The third and final video is concerned with spectroscopies that probe different products resulting from the absorption process, most importantly x-ray fluorescence and photoelectrons.
So let us begin with a discussion of different spectroscopic methods and basic ideas behind spectroscopy.
We can distinguish spectroscopies of tunable x-ray sources into three main categories.
Absorption techniques require one to tune the incident radiation.
The range of photons being tuned relative to absorption edges differentiates XANES (near the absorption edge) from EXAFS (further above the absorption edge).
Standard x-ray fluorescence measurements are typically carried out at fixed incident photon energies and can be performed using other sources, including electron excitation.
Resonant x-ray inelastic scattering is a photon-in
- photon-out technique where the fluorescence spectra as a function of the incident photon energy are recorded.
Lastly, the energies of photoelectrons caused by x-ray absorption can be recorded in x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, while if the sample is a single crystal , the signal can be resolved also as a function of angle relative to the crystallographic axes of the sample in x-ray photoelectron diffraction for harder x-rays, yielding information on near surface structural conformations; and ARPES, when using ultraviolet radiation and very soft x-rays, providing insights into the electronic properties of the sample.
At the highest photon energies, hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or HAXPES, provides important information structural, chemical, and electronic information, particularly for buried structures that are normally inaccessible to techniques using lower photon energies.
Before we begin our discussions of individual spectroscopic methods, the difference between spectromicroscopies and microspectroscopies is clarified.
Spectromicroscopies image an object at chosen energies, be the energy that of the incident radiation, fluorescent signal, or Auger or photoelectrons.
Each of the 2D images in the vertical stack here are spectromicroscopy results.
In micro spectroscopy, on the other hand, the spectral response at a microscopically defined position is probed, such as at positions
S1 or S2 in the schematic figure.
Commonly, beamlines are equipped to perform both of these in a single experiment.
XANES and EXAFS are techniques that provide information on local chemistry, surface adsorbate configurations, and local structure out to a few atom-distances.
Both require synchrotron radiation.
By using tightly focussed incident beams, the response as a function of sample position can be recorded in scanning techniques.
X-ray fluorescence provides information on chemistry, and, more commonly and depending on the detection technique, elemental content.
This is also amenable to scanning methods.
XRF can be performed using lab sources, though the enhanced brilliance of synchrotron radiation opens up a much broader palette of methods and allows access to energies inaccessible to lab sources.
RIXS, for example, has only become a practicable method since the advent of high-brilliance third-generation synchrotron facilities.
Photoelectron spectroscopy is a technique used widely using lab sources.
However, by tuning the incident radiation, new variants such as resonant photoelectron spectroscopies have become available.
The difference between X-ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopies is shown here.
XAS promotes core-level electrons to unoccupied valence-state levels and thereby probes these upper states by varying the incident photon energy.
In contrast, in XPS and UPS, the electrons are directly promoted into the vacuum and their signal intensity as a function of emitted electron energy (or binding energy) is recorded for any given incident photon energy.
This yields information about the core- or valence state from which the electrons originated.
Hence, each point in an XAS spectrum includes all the possible processes occurring subsequent to absorption of a photon of energy h nu, and can thus be thought of as being the energy-integrated intensity of an XPS spectrum recorded using the photon energy associated with that point in the XAS spectrum.
Pauliâ€™s exclusion principle requires that the final quantum state Ef was unoccupied before absorption took place.
In addition, quantum mechanics shows us that the probability Pif of an optical transition by the absorption of a photon from an initial state (labelled as the state vector or ket psi i in the commonly used Dirac formalism) to a final state psi f is proportional to the square of the transition dipole matrix element shown here in both the shorthand Dirac formalism and more conventionally as an integral of the complex conjugate of the final state psi f, the dipole operator er, and the initial quantum state psi i over all volume of the electron wavefunctions.
The dipole operator allowing the transition of the electron from the original to final state is er and is antisymmetric.
The wavefunctions are either symmetric or antisymmetric, hence it should be clear that the integrand needs to be symmetric for the integral to be nonzero, which in turn requires that one wavefunction is symmetric (even parity) and the other antisymmetric (odd parity).
So, for example, the integrand 1s er 2s consists of two symmetric wavefunctions and one antisymmetric operator, and is thus itself antisymmetric, meaning that its integration over space, the probability of that transition, is equal to zero - in other words, a dipole transition between two symmetric wavefunctions is forbidden.
It is briefly mentioned that other transition operators such as the quadrupole transition operator, is itself symmetric, allowing transitions between two sates of the same symmetry.
These are, however, in general much weaker.
From a quantum-mechanical perspective, free electrons exhibit both particle- and wavelike properties.
The wavelength lambda_e of an electron, or indeed any particle with momentum p, is given by lambda_e = h/p, where h is Planckâ€™s constant equal to 6.63 x 10^-34 J.s.
This is the de Broglie wavelength.
Because the wavevector associated with a wavelength lambda is 2 pi/lambda, p is equal to hbar k, where hbar = h/2pi.
The kinetic energy of a non relativistic particle is simply 1/2 mv^2, but because p = mv, this means that the KE is equal to p^2/2m, or hbar^2k_e^2/2m_e for an electron.
But the kinetic energy of an electron is whatâ€™s left over from the photon energy after the original binding energy of the electron to the atom is subtracted.
We can rearrange these relationships to obtain an expression for lambda_e as a function of the photon energy and binding energy, as shown here.
This can be further modified to obtain the simple expressions lambda_e in Angstroms = 12.28/square root of E_e in eV, or the wavevector in inverse
Angstroms = 0.512 x square root of E_e in eV.
So, for example, an electron with a 100-eV kinetic energy, would have a de Broglie wavelength of 1.228 Angstroms.
The binding energy of an electron E_B depends on orbital it occupies and the elements atomic number (i.e., nuclear charge).
The binding energies for all the elements and for the lowest five core levels is shown here.
The soft- tender- and hard-x-ray regimes are shown in yellow, green, and blue, respectively.
Note that even the most strongly bound K-electron of uranium can be accessed at some synchrotron facilities.
An important parameter, especially in the fields of photoelectron spectroscopies and
EXAFS, is the so-called inelastic mean free path, or IMFP, which is the distance through which an electron must pass in a material before it is scattered inelastically with a probability of 1 - 1/e = 63%.
When an electron has high energies, its small de-Broglie wavelength means that it has a smaller effective cross-section and larger
IMFP.
Conversely, the dominant mechanism to induce inelastic scatter of electrons is through excitation of so-called â€œplasmonsâ€�, or collective oscillations of electrons in the
(normally metallic) material.
At energies much lower than 10 eV, the electron has insufficient energy to excite these plasmon modes, and the inelastic mean free path increases rapidly.
Between approximately 10 and a few hundred to a thousand eV, the IMFP takes on values of a few Angstroms to ten or so Angstroms.
This is of the order of the top few atomic layers of the sample, and hence techniques that record such photoelectrons are in general highly surface sensitive.
This means that such experiments have highly stringent requirements on the purity of the surface and quality of vacuum in which the experiment is performed, as we will touch on again later.
The variation of the IMFP at a given electron energy between different elements is fairly modest.
The reason for this is that it is primarily dependent on average electron-electron distances, which are proportional to the cube root of the electron density, which for most materials varies no more than a factor of approximately
The cube root of 30 is a little over three, hence the spread of data points lie all fairly comfortably within this range (note the logarithmic ordinate axes).
This is why this plot is referred to as the â€œuniversal curveâ€�.
Lastly, it should be noted that the penetration depth of photons in a material is in general significantly higher than the IMFP, and hence it is the latter that determines the depth resolution for those experiments probing the photoelectron energy.
The density of and interaction between orbitals depend on whether the system is isolated, as in a dilute noble gas, or involves inter-atomic interactions, such as in molecules and even more so in condensed matter.
The well-defined valence orbitals of an atom become less well defined in molecules due to interaction of orbitals and the formation of bonds.
When a system contains numbers of atoms similar to Avogadroâ€™s number, the valence orbitals are so densely packed that they form bands.
Just as two separated orbitals of two electrons combine together in the formation of a bond to form a bound and anti bonding state (the first being at lower energy and occupied, the latter at higher energy and unoccupied), the interaction of many, many atoms in condensed matter produce a valence (occupied) band and a conduction (unoccupied) band, at least at absolute zero temperature.
How the valence and conduction bands sit relative to one another determines whether the system is a metal, semiconductor, or insulator.
In a metal, the top of the valence band and bottom of the conduction band meet, allowing the promotion of electrons to the otherwise empty conduction band even with the tiniest of excitation energies.
In semiconductors, there exists a band gap that can be overcome by a certain fraction of the valence-band electrons, spending on the size of the gap and the temperature of the system.
In insulators, the band gap is so large that effectively no electrons can access the conduction band without heating it up so much that the material thermally breaks up.
Core orbitals, however, remain fairly inured to the â€œoutside worldâ€� and remain well-defined, even in condensed matter.
Above the K-edge, associated with the 1s lowest-energy core level, the orbitals are split into sub-levels, manifesting themselves as sub-edges, as shown here for the L-edge of Zr.
This is caused by the nonzero orbital angular momentum of some of the orbitals (such as p- or d-orbitals) coupling in different configurations with the spin angular momentum of the electrons in a process called spin-orbit coupling.
So, for example, the L-edge is composed of an unsplit 2s-orbital, plus two spin-orbit split 2p 1/2 and 2p 3/2 orbitals.
We finish this first video with a schemaitc of a generic setup for x-ray spectroscopy experiments.
Monochromatic synchrotron radiation is allowed to impinge on a sample.
X-ray absorption spectra can be performed by measuring the amount of light that passes through a thin sample.
The x-ray intensities before entering the sample (I0) and after (I) are measured using ionization chambers (IC) or other beam-intensity monitors, and is particularly suited for samples that cannot be placed in vacuum, such as in biological or catalytic experiments.
The total electron current through an ammeter between the sample and ground can also be used to indirectly determine the absorption spectrum.
In this case, the sample and detectors must be in vacuum.
X-ray fluorescence spectra can be recorded, either using a crystal monochromator (XM) in wavelength-dispersive spectra (WDX), or by using a dispersive solid-state semiconductor device (EDX).
The integrated fluorescence yield can also be used as a measure of absorption strength.
Unwanted detection of elastically scattered x-rays is best achieved by placing the detector on the polarization axis of the synchrotron radiation.
The kinetic energy of photoelectrons and Auger electrons can be determined using electron energy-dispersive analysers.
In summary, this first video has prepared us for a closer discussion of individual spectroscopic methods.
In the second video, we will concentrate on different variants of absorption spectroscopy.
