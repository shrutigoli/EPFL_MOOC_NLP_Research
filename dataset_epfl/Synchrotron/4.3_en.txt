Welcome to the third and final video of Week
4 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This video completes our discussion of synchrotron, or machine physics, with a description of the two new kids on the block, diffraction-limited storage rings, and x-ray free-electron lasers.
Diffraction-limited storage rings, or DLSRs, represent the next refinement in synchrotron performance, the â€œfourth generationâ€� facilities.
The name perhaps slightly over-eggs their performance, as none of the planned facilities will be truly diffraction limited, at least for photon energies much above a few keV.
Nonetheless, they are a major step towards this goal, and promise game-changing improvements in many techniques.
In the Summer of 2016, the first of this next generation, MAX-IV in Lund, Sweden, came on line, and others follow close behind, notably
Sirius in Brazil, and upgrades to the ESRF in Grenoble, France, and the APS at the Argonne
National Labs in Illinois.
Following these are, among others, the ALS in Berkeley, the Swiss Light Source, and SPring8 in Japan, to name just three.
So what defines a DLSR?
In simple terms, it is a significant improvement in the horizontal emittance compared to that of third-generation facilities.
Remember our discussion in the first video of this week about the relative contributions of the electron and photon beams to the emittance?
Associated with the bending magnet double-bend achromat system is a lower limit to the electron emittance in the orbital plane, which for typical bending angles of the order of 10 degrees, is about 5 nm.radians.
This is substantially larger by over an order of magnitude than that in the vertical direction, which causes the photon beam to have a very flat elliptical cross-section.
For many applications, it would be highly advantageous to have a significantly rounder beam.
A cursory glance at the equation describing the horizontal emittance of DBAs should provide a clue as to how we might achieve this.
The emittance depends on the third power of the bending angle theta associated with a single bending-magnet dipole, hence a reduction in this by a factor F would decrease the emittance by a factor F-cubed.
One can also reduce gamma, as the emittance depends on the square of this.
However, the flux increases strongly with gamma, so only a moderate reduction can be tolerated.
For example, the upgrade of the APS to a DLSR is likely to involve a reduction of the storage-ring energy from 7 to 6 GeV.
Reducing theta to improve the emittance seems such an obvious route to follow, you might wonder why this wasnâ€™t taken long ago.
The reasons for this are purely technological.
Until recently, the machining, engineering and vacuum capabilities were limited such that dividing a given arc sector from a double-bend achromat, or at best a triple-bend achromat to an arc sector containing, for example, seven dipole magnets, would have increased the length of such a sector from 10 to 20 meters to perhaps sixty or seventy, taking up valuable and expensive real-estate.
In addition, the potential for small misalignments along the storage ring with so many more elements involved would almost certainly have cancelled out any theoretical advantages.
Advances in computer numerical control of machining of magnet yokes and other metallic components, however, now mean that dipoles, quadrupoles, and sextupoles can be fabricated in a small fraction of the size previously possible, and with micron precision with regards to their relative positions.
So, instead of making separate components and joining them together, each element being independently adjustable, the sectors of DLSRs are made of just one or two components, each machined from a single block of metal, and containing several magnet-lattice elements together.
In this manner, multiple-bend achromats (MBAs) containing up to nine bend magnets per arc-sector, can now be fabricated.
The second improvement that has allowed this change in fabrication approach has been in vacuum technology.
Accompanied with miniaturisation is a reduction in pumping efficiency through side ports to vacuum pumps.
To circumvent this, many DLSRs now employ coatings on the inside of the vacuum vessels called nonevaporable getters, or NEGs, which, below a base pressure easily achieved using conventional pumping, can then obtain the desired ultimate pressures of less than a picoBar (or 10^-9 mBar) by chemically trapping the residual gas molecules.
So, many third generation facilities are now either undergoing or planning to undergo upgrades to use multiple-bend achromats, producing an improvement in horizontal emittance by one to two orders of magnitude, ***** as shown here.
An interesting figure of merit M = ehC3/E2, is plotted here as a function of storage-ring circumference, big C. From our equation describing how the emittance varies with bending radius theta (which is approximately proportional to the storage ring circumference) and the storage-ring energy, we should expect that large rings with moderate ring energies should produce the lowest horizontal emittances.
This figure of merit, M, weighs the achieved emittance by these two factors in order to â€œlevel the playing fieldâ€�.
In other words, although a large ring at moderate or low energy might have a better performance than a smaller ring with high storage-ring energies, if one factors the circumference and energy in to this, one sees how well the facility operates given its fundamental limitations.
This is shown in this graph.
So, which fields are likely to profit most from the improved emittance of DLSRs?
Although the large majority of techniques will profit at least modestly from this, some will undergo a quantum leap in performance.
The low emittance associated with DLSRs means that either the source size or the divergence can be reduced significantly, or indeed, the improvement can be divided between these two properties, as desired.
A smaller source size for a given divergence compared to 3rd generation facilities means that scanning techniques such as scanning transmission x-ray microscopy, scanning x-ray absorption spectroscopy, or scanning x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, will all profit by an amount similar to the improvement in emittance.
This will mean, however, that the optics used to focus the beam to the sample have specifications that match the beam properties - it is pointless having an almost perfectly parallel and tight beam if the optics then blow this up to values associated with third-generation facilities.
Minimising the horizontal divergence will increase the transverse coherence length in the horizontal plane by one to two orders of magnitude and increase the coherent fraction accordingly.
So techniques which exploit the coherent properties of the beam will especially profit from an upgrade to a DLSR.
In addition, because the divergence is so much smaller, the footprint of the beam on optics such as reflecting or focussing mirrors will be smaller, relaxing a little their performance specifications.
As an example of how a trade-off between divergence and spot size can sometimes be the best solution, consider the case of macromolecular crystallography.
Often protein crystals have dimensions measured in microns, demanding a tight focus of the incident beam, either resulting in flux loss if this is achieved by slitting the beam down to smaller cross-sections, or otherwise a higher divergence, which means that the diffraction pattern can become unacceptably blurred (we discuss this in more detail later in the course).
On the other hand, if one instead focusses not on the sample, but instead on the detector, in order to sharpen up the pattern, the beam may be unacceptably large at the crystal itself.
The reduced emittance of DLSRs means that both the spot size at the crystal sample and the desired small size of the diffraction maxima can be accommodated simultaneously.
We now close this, our second week on machine physics, with an overview of x-ray free-electron lasers.
Four such facilities already exist, whereby the LCLS and SACLA provide radiation down to one Angstrom.
A further three facilities that will also provide both soft and hard x-rays are under construction in Switzerland, Germany, and
South Korea.
XFELs are defined by their exceedingly high peak brilliance, some 10^9 or even 10^10 times that achievable using synchrotrons.
The pulse produced by XFELs are very short, typically between a femtosecond and 100 fs.
What is the motivation for the construction of XFELs?
X-rays provide resolution down to the Angstrom and sub-Angstrom scale, but are limited in their temporal resolution to that of the pulse width of the bunches, measured in a few tens of picosecond.
However, many fundamental and technologically important processes are known to occur at significantly shorter time-scales - many chemical reactions occur on the time scale of molecular vibrations, and these are measured in femtoseconds.
Hence the motivation to build XFELs was to combine the spatial resolution of x-rays with a temporal resolution down to the fs-scale, previously only possible using lasers in the visible, or near visible regime.
This table summarises some of the most pertinent differences between synchrotron and XFEL light.
Letâ€™s consider this line for line.
First, the repetition rate of the x-ray pulses, which is fairly constant in the case of synchrotrons at a few hundred megahertz, can take on greatly different values at XFELs.
This is because the electrons pass just once down the XFEL linac instead of being stored in a ring, so are not constrained by this condition.
So, for example, LCLS-I and SACLA have repetition rates of approximately 100 Hz, while the planned pattern for the European XFEL in Hamburg is to deliver packets of a few thousand pulses at 4.5 MHz (each packet therefore lasting
0.6 milliseconds) 10 times a second.
One of the two most important features of
XFELs, as already mentioned, is the pulse duration, which is three orders of magnitude shorter than at synchrotrons.
The average number of photons per second, and therefore the average radiant power, is fairly similar between a single harmonic peak from an undulator at a synchrotron and from the LCLS.
For many experiments, such as macromolecular crystallography at the CXI station at the
LCLS, this unfiltered radiation, with an average bandwidth of a few tens of an electronvolt for hard x-rays, is used without monochromatization.
Most experiments at synchrotrons do use monochromator, however, which cuts down the arrival rate of photons to approximately 10^13 ph/s.
For those experiments at XFELs which do monochromatize the beam, the arrival rate can vary between approximately a tenth of the unfiltered radiation to nothing at all.
This is because the bandwidth of the monochromator typically used at XFELs is typically narrower than gaps in the single-shot spectra produced by SASE at XFELs, explained a little later.
Much effort is being devoted to improving this situation in new seeding techniques and novel optics.
The second highly important difference between
XFELs and synchrotrons is the number of photons delivered per pulse, which is five orders of magnitude or greater for XFELs than for synchrotrons, even before monochromatization.
The peak power emerging from XFELs is therefore approximately 10 orders of magnitude greater than at synchrotrons.
Such enormous values mean that XFEL experiments can be fundamentally different to those at synchrotrons, as the samples are often obliterated by a single shot from the XFEL.
We discuss this in detail towards the end of the course.
Interestingly, however, XFELs are far less wasteful than synchrotrons with regards to their efficiency.
As was just mentioned, some XFEL experiments use the entire available number of photons without monochromatization, which at the LCLS-I equates to half a watt.
Even those experiments that monochromatic the XFEL beam work at up to 10% efficiency.
In contrast, the difference between the unfiltered power output from an undulator beamline, at approximately 1 kW (three orders of magnitude higher than that of the entire LCLS) and that emerging after the monochromator, approximately
30 mW, is approximately four to five orders of magnitude!
Shown here is a quick reminder of the overview of the architecture of XFELs shown in the first week of this course.
Let us discuss the most important components of this, beginning with the low-emittance gun.
Electron bunches are produced by irradiating a semiconductor or metallic surface with a femtosecond laser to produce photoemission.
The timing of this laser pulse is so chosen that the resulting electron cloud is then accelerated by an RF cavity, which reduces the impact on the emittance of space-charge effects.
The emittance emerging from this system is of the order of magnitude of 1 mm.mrad in both transverse directions, while the peak current is approximately 50 amps.
However, in order to induce SASE, the process responsible for the formation of the high-intensity femtosecond x-ray pulses, the peak electron current needs to be several kiloamperes, in other words, two orders of magnitude higher, as it enters the XFEL undulator.
This increase in current is achieved using one or more bunch compressors.
The RF phase in the first accelerator LINAC after the low-emittance gun is adjusted to allow the electrons to â€˜surfâ€™ down the slope of the sinusoidal RF field â€” the leading electrons are thus accelerated less than those electrons towards the back of the bunch (this phenomenon is referred to as â€˜chirpingâ€™).
Nonetheless, the electronsâ€™ velocities are so close to the speed of light that their differences are far too small to allow the faster electrons at the back of the bunch to catch up with the slower electrons positioned further forward and thereby squeeze the bunch length.
Instead, the bunch passes through a magnetic four-dipole chicane.
The trailing (high-energy) electrons execute a shorter path on account of their being less deviated by the magnetic field.
In this manner, they are able to catch up with the less energetic leading electrons, which are more deviated by the magnet chicane.
This compression, or compressions, depending on how many bunch compression stages are included, thus shortens the bunch length and increases n_e by a factor of approximately 100.
Once the electron beam has achieved the required peak-current, it enters the undulator.
Letâ€™s briefly recap the forces an electron will experience in the presence of an electromagnetic field.
You may recall that the ratio of these two forces is equal to -v/c, or -beta.
In this figure, the electric force is shown in red, while that of the magnetic Lorentz force is in yellow.
For the highly relativistic electrons entering the undulator, the ratio of the forces is to all intents and purposes equal to minus one.
If the electrons are moving coaxially with the beam of radiation they have produced by acceleration, the electric and magnetic forces cancel out and they will remain unperturbed.
Now letâ€™s perturb the electron beamâ€™s path by introducing the magnet array of the
XFEL undulator.
This causes the electrons to oscillate, as we have already discussed in the last video.
Now, because their trajectory is no longer exactly coaxial with the beam of radiation
(although the deviations shown here are greatly exaggerated), the electric and magnetic forces will no longer entirely cancel out.
For the case where the electric component of the electromagnetic field of the radiation points in the negative x-direction, the magnetic field is on the negative y-direction, and the forces will be as shown here while half a cycle later of the electromagnetic field, the forces are a shown here.
The consequence of these unequal forces is that the electrons begin to be bunched together to form microbunches (within the conventional bunch generated by the low-emittance gun and bunch compression), separated by a distance equal to the wavelength of the light they generate and are bathed in.
In the laboratory frame of reference, this is equal to the pole magnet periodicity divided by gamma, hence is of the order of a few microns.
Each microbunch therefore has a duration of a few femtoseconds to a few tens of femtoseconds.
FELs deliver femtosecond x-radiation.
As the microbunches begin to form, the electrons become more squeezed together, resulting in an increase in the instantaneous current.
This therefore produces a intenser undulator radiation, which in turn acts more strongly on the electrons, further enhancing the micro bunching process.
This runaway effect is called SASE - self-amplified spontaneous emission.
So why are these SASE radiation microbunches
(the XFEL pulses) so intense?
Before the SASE effect kicks in, emission from individual electrons is purely stochastic
- in other words there is no correlation between their emission regarding the phase - the system is noncoherent, just as at synchrotrons.
The total electromagnetic field amplitude is therefore a vector sum of the individual contributions, each having the same magnitude, but a completely random orientation.
From statistics, we can predict that this vector sum, the total magnitude, is proportional to the square root of the number of contributing emitters, n_e, the number of electrons in the bunch.
The INTENSITY, which is proportional to the square of the amplitude, is therefore proportional to n_e.
Now, in the case of the bunch after the SASE process has induced the formation of the microbunches, these microbunches are separated form each other by integral numbers of the radiation wavelength, hence emission is highly coherent
- the emitted wavelets are all in phase, and therefore the vector addition of these contributions all lie in a straight line - the amplitude is proportional to n_e.
The intensity is proportional to n_e squared, and is thus n_e times more intense than for the non coherent bunch.
But n_e is of the order of 10^9 or 10^10, and thus XFEL pulses are more intense by a this factor.
The performance of an XFEL is encapsulated in the dimensionless so-called Pierce parameter, or XFEL parameter, given here.
Although different XFELs might have quite disparate values for lambda_u, gamma, and
K, the one-third power dependence means that the XFEL parameter is fairly constant between facilities, at around 5 x 10^-4.
This value describes both the instantaneous bandwidth of the XFEL radiation, and the ratio of the photon-beam power to the electron-beam power.
The XFEL gain length L_G is inversely proportional to the XFEL parameter, and typically takes on values of a few meters.
It describes length along the undulator required to increase the radiative power by a factor e, or about 2.72.
As the potential total power increase before saturation of SASE begins is typically seven or so orders of magnitude, the undulator needs to be a length no shorter than the natural logarithm of 10^7 times L_G, which equates to several tens of meters!
This is nearly two orders of magnitude longer than undulatory used at synchrotrons!
Lastly, let us take a brief look at a typical
SASE spectrum.
Although the instantaneous bandwidth is, at
5 x 10^-4, similar to that provided by silicon monochromator at synchrotrons, the centre of the spectrum can jump back and forth by a few tens of eV, depending on which mode was randomly selected by the SASE process.
The time-averaged spectral width is therefore an order of magnitude larger, at around 5 x 10^-3.
So, although XFELs provide radiation with exceedingly coherent radiation in the transverse direction, due to its unmatched parallelity and small source size, the longitudinal coherence length is poor.
In summary, this video has provided some insight into the operational principles behind DLSRs and XFELs.
DLSRs promise significant jumps in performance compared to 3rd-generation synchrotrons, and may thereby also open up some entirely new experimental methods.
XFELs, because of their short pulse lengths and high intensities, represent a paradigm shift in x-ray science, and promise new experimental vistas, particularly in time-resolved studies in fields as diverse as macromolecular biology and heterogeneous catalysis.
Next week, we will discuss how synchrotron radiation is further manipulated regarding monochromatization, reflection, and focussing, plus other instrumental aspects associated with beamline design.
