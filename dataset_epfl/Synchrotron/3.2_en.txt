Welcome to the second video of Week 3 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In the first video of this week, we covered basics of the electric and magnetic fields acting on electrons, and, by heuristic arguments, showed that accelerating electrons causes them to radiate light, of which synchrotron radiation is one example. The characteristics of synchrotron light were shown to depend on several parameters, including the electron energy and the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration.
We begin the second video by investigating this aspect in more detail. The bending magnets used for this, and other elements associated with the storage ring, comprising together the so-called magnet lattice, are described in more detail. Lastly, we show how the energy lost by the electrons because of their emission of light is replenished in a radio-frequency cavity installed in the storage ring.
Letâ€™s now begin by considering how we steer electrons in a closed path. The electrons must experience a centripetal force acting at right angles to their motion in order to maintain them on a closed orbit. Note that this force need not be applied along the entirety of the storage ring, but can be broken up, with straight sections in between. Remember, indeed, that third-generation synchrotrons are defined by these straight sections, as it is here that insertion devices are placed, which provide the most intense sources. Weâ€™ll talk about these in detail next week.
For now, letâ€™s concentrate on getting those electrons on a closed path. The centripetal acceleration is a = v-squared/rho, where v can be very accurately approximated by c, the speed of light, and rho is the radius of the bending orbit. Note also, that because the electron is traveling at relativistic speeds, its mass from our perspective is gamma times its rest mass, which weâ€™ve already established typically increases the mass by several thousand. The force is therefore gamma m c^2/rho.
Two at first obvious candidates come to mind for imparting the centripetal force - an electric field, such as also used in old-fashioned cathode-ray tubes in TVs dating back to the end of the 20th Century; or magnetic fields, such as used for electric motors or loudspeakers.
Letâ€™s first consider the use of an electric field. First, donâ€™t get confused with E here, which denotes the electric-field strength, or amplitude, with E, the electronsâ€™ kinetic energy. As we will see in just a moment, we can discount the electric field as a reasonable candidate for steering electrons, so letâ€™s tolerate this slight ambiguity for the meantime.
If one plugs typical values for rho and gamma into our force equation, and using the known values for the physical constants m, c, and e, we obtain electric-field strengths which must be of the order of a billion volts per metre to do the required job. The breakdown field strength of dry air at 1 atmosphere is approximately 3 million volts/m, over two orders of magnitude weaker, while that of pure silica is up to 40 MV/m. It should therefore be clear that using electric fields as a steering mechanism is impossibly hazardous.
Which leaves us with the Lorentz force of magnetic fields. In the last video, we established that this is equal to evB, or for our highly relativistic electrons within the storage ring, approximately ecB, assuming the magnetic field points perpendicular to the electronsâ€™ motion. Equating this to gamma m c^2/rho, the centripetal force, and then rearranging this, we see that the bending radius rho equals gamma mc/eB.
But gamma mc^2 is equal to the electronsâ€™ kinetic energy E, hence rho = E/ceB. We can re-express this in practical units such that rho in metres equals 3.3 x the storage-ring energy expressed in GeV divided by B given in Tesla.
Hence an electron travelling in a horizontal plane that experiences a constant B-field acting vertically, will be steered in a circular path of radius rho. From our practical expression for rho, we see that a few-GeV storage ring containing magnets with field strengths of the order of a Tesla, will bend electrons along a path with a radius of the order of
10 meters. The fan of radiation in the horizontal plane will subtend the same angle as the arc of the bending magnet itself. Only a small angular fraction of this passes through an aperture to a bending-magnet beamline. Because the fan angle is so much larger than the typical acceptance angle of a beamline, more than one bending-magnet beamline can be served by a single bending magnet. ***** waaaaaaait.
What are typical magnetic field strengths?
The earthâ€™s magnetic field varies considerably, but is strongest close to the poles and can reach around 60 microTeslas. Indeed it is the combination of this higher field strength and energetic charged particles from the solar wind (primarily energetic electrons) that generate the aurora as these particles are funnelled by the Earthâ€™s magnetic field to the polar regions, where they collide with molecules in the upper atmosphere, causing them to fluoresce.
At a more mundane level, typical kitchen magnets have field strengths approximately three orders of magnitude stronger. The soft-iron permanent magnets used at synchrotrons bending magnets are one to two orders of magnitude stronger still, at around a Tesla. Significantly higher fields can be achieved using cryogenically cooled superconducting intermetallic compounds, such as Nb3Sn, which needs to be cooled to less than 18.3 K, in the form of coil windings in superconducting bending magnets, or â€œsuperbendsâ€�.
As we shall see very shortly, increasing the magnetic-field strength can bring substantial benefits, particularly for experiments demanding high photon energies at low- or medium-energy storage-ring facilities.
The spectrum and intensity of bending-magnet radiation depends on several parameters. Firstly, we need to know the angular frequency of the orbiting electrons, that is, how many radians per second they rotate during those times they are being redirected by a bending magnet.
To simplify the determination of this, letâ€™s assume that the orbit is perfectly circular, although even for real storage rings consisting of straight and bent sections, the result holds true. The orbitâ€™s circumference is
2 pi rho, and a relativistic electron with a velocity close to c will thus execute c/(2 pi rho) revolutions every second. But every revolution contains 2 pi radians (because there are 2 pi radians in 360 degrees), hence the number of radians swept through per second is 2 pi c/2 pi rho = c/rho. Inserting typical values into this, we obtain an angular frequency for the storage-ring electrons of the order of 10^7 to 10^8 radians per second.
The critical frequency is a value associated with the synchrotron-radiation spectrum (NOT the electrons, although it is determined by their energy and the bending radius rho!).
It emerges that this is equal to three halves gamma^3 omega_0. We can re-express this either by substituting omega_0 with c/rho, or indeed one step further, by remembering that c/rho
= eB/gamma m, which we discovered a little earlier in this video when we equated the
Lorentz and centripetal forces.
This leads us to the expression omega_c = 3/2 gamma^2 eB/m. Inserting typical values into any of these equivalent expressions yields a critical frequency of the order of 10^19 radian/sec. If we multiply this by h-bar we obtain the photon energy associated with this critical frequency. Converting this to electronvolts, we obtain a photon energy of the order of
4 keV. In actuality, this can vary strongly, due to its square dependence on gamma, the
Lorentz factor describing the storage-ring energy, plus its linear dependence on B.
To repeat, the critical energy is linearly proportional to B and varies with the square of the storage-ring energy. A practical expression for this is provided here. For a given magnetic field strength, a bending magnet at SPring8 will have a critical energy some 18 times greater than the same magnet at the ALS, as the ratio is simply the square of their storage-ring energies, that is (8 GeV/1.9 GeV), all squared.
The red dots ***** show the critical energies for two bending magnet beamlines at the two high-energy storage rings SPring8 (8 GeV) and the ESRF (6 GeV). In order to compensate for their more modest electron energies, facilities such as the Swiss Light Source (2.4 GeV) and the Advanced Light Source (1.9 GeV) have installed superbends (shown here as blue dots) in order to access higher photon energies than would otherwise be possible using normal bending magnets.
But what precisely does the critical energy describe? From our discussion so far, it is probably already clear that it is somehow linked to the bending-magnet spectrum. Before this is shown explicitly, let us have a little think about what we might expect the radiation spectrum from a bending magnet to look like, at least qualitatively.
You should remember from the first video this week that an electron undergoing sinusoidal acceleration from a harmonic driving force
(such as, for example, the electric-field component of an incident x-ray beam), will re-radiate light at the same frequency. In other words, the electron scatters the incident light elastically - it has the same frequency.
Imagine now an observer of the electron tangential to the bending magnet. From her perspective, the electron is first moving along the straight section upstream of the bending magnet with constant velocity - it is not being accelerated, so we should not expect her to see any radiation.
But once the electron enters the gap between the dipole of the bending magnet, it experiences a pulse of centripetal acceleration towards the centre of the ring due to the magnetic field. In contrast to the case of sinusoidal acceleration, this â€œpulseâ€� of acceleration cannot be described by a single frequency, but instead is composed of a continuous spectrum of frequencies, and the electron will emit this in response. For the more mathematically predisposed of you, you might recognise that the spectrum that emerges from this pulse of acceleration to be proportional to the
Fourier transform of the temporal description of that acceleration. . . For those of you less familiar with such insights, donâ€™t worry!
As a consequence, we can expect the bending-magnet spectrum to be broad. Shown here are three curves for different storage-ring energies and magnetic-field strengths. Note that the only difference between the spectra for a
1-Tesla bending magnet in a 4-GeV ring and a 4-Tesla BM in a 2 GeV ring is the intensity, which differ from each other by a factor of four. Their critical energies, highlighted as circles, are identical, as the products of the square of the storage-ring energy and magnetic field strength are equal. Note again that high-energy storage rings, such as shown in blue for a 6-GeV facility, easily access high critical energies on account of the square dependence on the storage-ring energy.
It turns out that half of the integrated radiative power produced by a bending magnet lies below the critical energy, and half above. But what we havenâ€™t yet discussed is how the spectral flux is spatially distributed.
In general, the centre of the cone of radiation is the most intense and most blue-shifted to high photon energies. As one moves off axis, the radiation becomes weaker (remember that the beam only has a width of approximately
+/- 1/gamma, of the order of 0.01 degrees) and the maximum is red-shifted to lower photon energies. Obviously, in the case of bending magnets, for which the horizontal angular spread is equal to the angle subtended by the magnet and is measured in degrees, the fan of radiation in this plane at the beamline is determined by the opening angle of the aperture to the beamline, always much smaller than the fan angle, but on the other hand, also much larger than 1/gamma.
The total integrated radiative power output of a bending magnet is given by the equation shown here, where L is the length of the electron path passing between the magnet poles. As the entire storage ring requires bending magnets to provide a closed orbit for the electrons, the entire power output of all the bending magnets together is given for a length L = 2 pi rho, where rho is the bending radius. Note again, that this is NOT equal to the storage-ring circumference, as the bending magnets are separated by straight sections. There is also radiative power production by insertion devices in the straight sections, which we will discuss next week, but here we are concerned only with the bending magnets.
So, for example, a 3-GeV storage ring using
1-Tesla bending magnets will have a bending radius rho = 9.9 m, for which 2 pi rho = 62 m. If the electron current is 0.4 amps, the total power output due to bending-magnet radiation will be 283 kW. Any one bending magnet port may only accept, for example, approximately
5 mrad of this (or less than 1/1000 of 2 pi), or in other words, 225 W. If this is further monochromatized to select a narrow band of energy, as is more often than not the case, perhaps only of the order of 10 mW may then remain. This might not seem very much, but equates to, for example, approximately 10^13
10-keV photons per second, several orders of magnitude more than can be provided by laboratory-based x-ray sources.
To finish this video, we will now consider the ratio between the power consumption caused by the generation of synchrotron radiation, which we have just calculated to be of the order of 300 kW for bending-magnet radiation alone, and might be double this when the insertion devices are also accounted for, and the stored power of the electron circulating in the storage ring.
The stored energy is simply their kinetic energy, or storage-ring energy, E, multiplied by the number of electrons within the ring at any one time. This is simply the current in amps divided by the elementary charge of the electron, multiplied by the storage-ring circumference, big C, divided by the speed of light, little c. This turns out to be of the order of 10^12 electrons, hence the stored energy is approximately a kJ. The stored power is simply E x I, which is measured in GW.
One might therefore think that the power loss through radiation is relatively slow, as the radiative power is four orders of magnitude smaller than the stored power. However, it only requires a small deviation from the nominal storage-ring energy for an electron to enter an unstable and open orbit, and crash into the walls of the vacuum chamber making up the storage ring. Hence, the electrons require a steady replenishment of this lost energy.
We finish this video by discussing this now.
Inserted in the storage ring is a radio-frequency cavity, running typically at a few hundred megahertz. Within this resonant cavity, the electric field oscillates sinusoidally from pointing in one direction to the other. Along the central axis, this means the electric field is either opposite to or in the same direction as the electron path. Remember that an electron is accelerated when the E-field points in the opposite direction to the electronâ€™s sense of motion, due to its negative charge.
Therefore an electron entering the cavity when the field points maximally in the upstream direction will cause the electron to be maximally accelerated, as shown schematically in the figure on the left.
Now letâ€™s consider two electrons, one of which (A) has a little less energy than the other (B), due perhaps to the fact that it has emitted a couple more photons in their last circuit round in the storage ring. B enters the cavity first and is accelerated by the cavityâ€™s field. Electron A enters a little later, at which point the field amplitude has increased in its sinusoidal cycle by an amount just enough to accelerate it to the same energy as electron B. If the electrons had entered the cavity at a significantly different part of the RF cycle, the acceleration, or indeed deceleration they experienced would have caused them to become still less stable in their orbit, and they would soon be lost.
From this, it should be apparent that only a very particular time window of the RF cycle is suited to bringing the electrons back to the nominal storage-ring energy. As a consequence, the electron current in a synchrotron is not continuous, but instead is composed of bunches, each separated by 1/f, the period of the RF cycle, and having a temporal width of approximately one hundredth of their separation.
It is a trivial exercise to show that the number of electrons within any one bunch is equal to the current divided by the product of the RF frequency and e, the elementary charge, which turns out to be of the order of 10^9 to 10^10 per bunch.
To summarise this second and last video of the third week, we have reasoned that only a magnetic Lorentz force is a reasonable way of steering electrons into a closed path in a storage ring. The characteristic, or critical frequency omega_c and energy E_c were determined and shown to depend on the square of the storage-ring energy and linearly with the bending-magnet field strength. The radiative power generated by bending magnets and thus by the whole storage ring (excluding other components such as insertion devices) was determined and shown to be a small fraction of the power stored within the ring. Nonetheless, losses associated with radiation production need to be replenished, and the mechanism by which this is done, namely the use of a radio-frequency cavity, results in the electron current separating out into bunches with bunch durations two orders of magnitude shorter than their separation.
Next week, we define the important photon-beam parameters of flux, emittance, and brilliance, further discuss components of the so-called magnet lattice, namely double- and multi bend achromats, quadrupoles, and sextupoles; and insertion devices, in particular undulators.
The use of multi bend achromats in so-called diffraction-limited storage rings, or DLSRs, defines the next generation of synchrotron facilities and is discussed in some detail.
Lastly, we provide an overview of XFEL physics and architecture and the radiation it produces.
