Welcome to the first video of Week 9 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week, we will discuss approaches to phasing in macromolecular crystallography.
After some introductory remarks and a recap of some essential tools needed to understand this weekâ€™s topics, the methods of molecular replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement will be covered in order to demonstrate general approaches to phasing in MX, as essentially the same mathematical approach is used also in the further three techniques we will discuss, namely multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, and native-SAD.
We finish the week by looking at current trends in this field.
So, in this first video, we begin by familiarizing ourselves with basic concepts and approaches to phasing in MX.
As we have already mentioned several times earlier in this course, the interpretation of diffraction data is hampered by the fact that half of the information, namely the relative phases between the diffraction components, is lost, because one measures the intensity, not the amplitude - this is the phase problem, which can lead to multiple possible structural solutions, depending on how complete the diffraction data set is, and how complex the atomic structure is within the unit cell.
In the early days of diffraction, simple structures such as rock salt or diamond could be `relativelyâ€™ easily solved using trial-and-error approaches, arguments of symmetry, and invoking physicochemical limitations, such as known reasonable ranges of bond lengths between atoms.
A nice personal review of this by Max Perutz can be found in the reference given here bottom left.
As the atomic structures in the unit cells became increasingly complex, a more systematic approach was needed, in particular Fourier analysis and so-called Patterson maps, used extensively by Dorothy Hodgkin in her seminal works, among others, on the structures of penicillin and insulin.
The use of Patterson maps remains one of the cornerstones of phasing in macromolecular crystallography to this day.
An interesting approach to the phase problem that was first developed in the 1950s by Jerome
Karle and Herbert Hauptman is that of the so-called direct methods.
In general it is based on iterations that cycle between real space and reciprocal space by the actions of Fourier- and inverse-Fourier transforms.
When in reciprocal space, the diffraction amplitudes emerging from the FT are replaced with the square-roots of the experimentally determined diffraction intensities, and the phases remain untouched.
Conversion of this via an inverse-FT to real space will result in a structure which is then examined for its reasonableness, using arguments such as, for example, that the electron density cannot be negative anywhere, that most electron charge is concentrated around the nuclear core of atoms (this constraint is called `atomicityâ€™), and that the structure must fit within a reasonable support and have physically reasonable bond lengths.
This iterative cycling continues until self-consistency is reached, that is, no changes need to be made in either real or reciprocal space.
Direct methods succeed only up to an upper limit of complexity, presently at around 1000 atoms, though improvements in both the quality of diffraction data and computer power is likely to push the envelope in the future.
For the foreseeable future, however, direct methods and certainly trial-and-error approaches will certainly fail for larger structures such as proteins.
For example, the molecular weight of the human ribosome 80S subunit is approximately 3.2 million Daltons, containing of the order of
200â€™000 atoms (excluding the hydrogen-atoms).
For these systems, novel approaches needed to be brought to bear on the problem.
In all cases other than molecular replacement, the two general approaches are either (a) to change the structure in a controlled and known manner, and observe how this induces changes in the diffraction pattern, or (b) see how the diffraction pattern changes as a result of being close to an absorption edge of one or more atom types within the structure.
So, in multiple isomorphous replacement, or
MIR, specific components are replaced, or additional material added, but for which the structure otherwise remains invariant - in other words, the other atom positions donâ€™t move and the unit-cell size remains constant
- this is the meaning of isomorphous.
Multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(MAD) works by observing changes in the diffraction pattern as one varies the photon energy around an absorption edge.
In single-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(SAD), differences in certain symmetry-related diffraction maxima within the same diffraction set are exploited to solve the structure.
All of these methods also use molecular replacement
(MR), which relies upon the existence in the structure of a previously solved protein fold which is homologous, or similar, to part of the structure to be solved.
Before we introduce the concepts of the Patterson function and then Friedelâ€™s law, itâ€™s worth spending a moment to recap how one uses
Argand, or complex plane diagrams.
Imagine a unit cell containing three atoms.
We flood this with x-rays of wavelength lambda
. Note that in the Bragg condition, the phase at the same point in different unit cells must experience the same phase of the x-ray plane wave, such as shown for these three equivalent atoms highlighted with crosses
(wait 2 secs) . The phases of scattering from each atom can be estimated by seeing where their centres lie relative to the incident beam - the blue atom is at 0, the green at pi/3, or 60 degrees, and the red atom at 3pi/2
(270 degrees).
The scattering amplitudes can therefore be added up in an Argand diagram vectorially with the appropriate angle corresponding to the phases.
So scattering from the blue atom is represented by an arrow of certain length (proportional to the atomâ€™s scattering strength) and at zero degrees . The green atom is a weaker scatterer with smaller scattering vector at an angle of 60 degrees , while the scattering vector of the large red atom points downwards, at 270 degrees . The total structure factor is therefore the black arrow shown here .
We now introduce the Patterson function.
Even though we cannot determine the structure of a unit cell from the diffraction pattern intensities alone, it turns out that it can nonetheless provide valuable information.
Arthur Patterson showed in 1935 that the inverse
Fourier transform of the diffraction-pattern intensities yields a centrosymmetric real-space structure consisting of peaks separated by the relative positions between atoms.
In the example here of the molecule fluoroselenoformaldehyde,
SeCHF, 13 maxima are to be seen.
In fact, it can be shown that these relative distances are a result of the convolution of the moleculeâ€™s electron density distribution with its inverse.
Letâ€™s look at this simple example in a little more detail in order to understand the general properties of Patterson functions, or Patterson maps, as theyâ€™re also known.
First, because the Patterson map is the convolution of the electron density with its inverse, it is always centrosymmetric, with equivalent points at r_ij and -r_ij between atoms i and j . The intensities of these maxima are proportional to the product of their atomic numbers, Z_i and Z_j - this means that if there are heavy atoms in the structure, their contributions will dominate.
The central spot is by far the most intense, being the sum of the convolution of all the atoms with themselves (that is, therefore, at zero distance) . Lastly, there are N(N-1)
+ 1 maxima, which for a molecule which may easily contain 100â€™000 atoms, means the pattern is extremely crowded, containing approximately
10^10 contributions.
Needless to say, the Patterson map has, for proteins, essentially a continuous distribution.
We show here some simple examples based around the aromatic molecule benzene, and how these change according to whether one or more hydrogen atoms have been substituted for heavier atoms.
In this case, we substitute with bromine.
Benzene has a Patterson map that is highly symmetric, with six-fold symmetry.
By substituting one hydrogen with bromine, the symmetry is reduced , and one clearly sees how the C6 ring is `pickedâ€™ out by the bromine atom.
Adding another bromine opposite the first in 1,4 dibromobenzene changes the pattern primarily by introducing the strongest signal
(except at the central spot) at the uppermost and lowest positions, equating to the distance between the two bromine atoms.
Lastly, on 1,2, dibromobenzene, the pattern changes ***** again due to the closer proximity of the tow bromine atoms.
Take your time in studying these in order to get a feel for what Patterson maps provide.
We complete this first video by discussing
Frieden pairs and Friedelâ€™s law.
Consider a Bragg maximum at (hkl) , with scattering vector Q . The opposite Bragg peak in reciprocal space is at (h-bar k-bar, l-bar) and the scattering vector for this must point in the opposite direction.
Now letâ€™s consider this from the perspective of the unit cell and the hkl-planes . Remember too, that the phase difference between equivalent points in adjacent unit cells has to be 2pi for constructive interference, that is, for the Bragg condition to be met.
For reflection off the hkl planes , the scattering vector is, as we know, perpendicular to these
. The atomic scattering factors of the atoms between the hkl-planes add up vectorially in some manner to produce a structure factor
F_hkl associated with the hkl-reflection and a phase phi_hkl.
Remember, the intensity is proportional to the square of F_hkl.
The Bragg peak at h-bar k-bar l-bar is generated by approaching the atoms from below - Q is in the opposite direction, as required.
Now, what are the phases of the individual scattering vectors.
Letâ€™s first consider the blue atom.
This has a phase phi_1 relative to the upper hkl-plane, which means its phase relative to the lower plane is 2pi - phi_1, which is equal to -phi_1.
The atomic scattering vector for the blue atom for the h-bar k-bar l-bar reflection is therefore the mirror image of that for hkl . Obviously, the same holds true for all the other atoms , and therefore the magnitude of Fhkl and Fhkl-bar is identical, and their phase is opposite, that is, phi_hkl-bar = -phi_hkl.
So, in summary, Friedelâ€™s law says that
Bragg peaks at hkl and hkl-bar, known as Frieden pairs, are equal in magnitude and their phases are opposite in sign.
Diffraction patterns are therefore centrosymmetric, though as we will see, Friedelâ€™s law breaks down if the pattern was recorded in the neighbourhood of one of the atomsâ€™ absorption edges.
Before we see why, I quickly cover the case of centrosymmetric crystals (donâ€™t confuse this with centrosymmetric diffraction patterns), as they have special properties.
Consider the 2D cartoon of a centrosymmetric crystal shown here.
As we know, the phase difference between the hkl-planes needs to be 2 pi in the Bragg condition.
For convenienceâ€™s sake in order to make our arguments easier to follow, we choose to show this phase change to be from + pi to - pi . Letâ€™s now consider the scattering contributions in an Argand diagram from pairs of atoms which are opposite each other through the centre of symmetry.
We begin with the two atoms highlighted here and labelled `1â€™ . If one of these has a phase phi_1 , then the other must have a phase
-phi_1 . Their contributions therefore cancel out in the imaginary direction in the Argand diagram, and their summed scattering contribution is real . This holds true for all other pairs, for example the green atoms labelled with a `2â€™ , as shown here . If the centrosymmetric crystal contains an atom at the centre of symmetry, this has, by definition a phase of zero, and is thus also real.
The take-home message is therefore that structure factors of centrosymmetric crystals are real, as long as they are far from absorption edges.
OK, so letâ€™s return to the general case of crystals with any symmetry.
What happens to the structure factors of Frieden pairs if one includes the correction terms fâ€™ and fâ€�, which become non-negligible near absorption edges.
So letâ€™s begin with our uncorrected structure factors and now add the correction terms.
In this cartoon, the atom with an absorption edge close to the used photon energy is the one that produces the red atomic scattering vectors.
In the case of the hkl structure factor, the fâ€™ term reduces the magnitude of the red vector by this amount , as weâ€™ve discussed before. fâ€� is then added on to this, but at an angle of +90 degrees, or pi/2 . The vector for Fhkl has therefore changed .
Now letâ€™s see what happens to the hkl-bar structure factor.
The fâ€™ term needs to be subtracted from the red vector, as before , but now, the addition of fâ€� is in the same sense, +90 degrees
. This means that both the magnitude of Fhkl-bar differs from that of Fhkl , and that the phases are no longer equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.
In other words, by recording diffraction patterns close to absorption edges, they lose their centrosymmetry.
Lastly, what changes occur in centrosymmetric crystals due to absorption?
As we argued three slides back, without the correction terms fâ€™ and fâ€�, the structure factors of centrosymmetric crystals are real and therefore Fhkl and Fhkl-bar have the same magnitude and lie along the real axis (in other words, phi = 0).
So adding fâ€™ and fâ€� will change Fhkl and
Fhkl-bar identically . The structure factors may no longer be real, but they do remain the same both in their magnitudes and in their phases . In other words, centrosymmetric crystals
ALWAYS have centrosymmetric diffraction patterns, independent of photon energy.
As we shall see in the third of the video this week, this means that SAD experiments cannot be performed on centrosymmetric crystals.
Fortunately, almost no proteins produce centrosymmetric crystal structures, due primarily to their chiral nature (chiral structures cannot exhibit centrosymmetry).
In summary, this first video has prepared us by introducing the concepts of Patterson maps and Friedelâ€™s law, for the different techniques used to solve complex protein structures.
In the next video, we will discuss the first approach developed for this, pioneered by the two Nobel-prize winners Max Perutz and
John Kendrew, namely multiple isomorphous replacement, or MIR, including the construction of Harker diagrams, which themselves use Argand diagrams.
In addition we will briefly describe molecular replacement, as this remains the `working horseâ€™ of solving protein structures.
