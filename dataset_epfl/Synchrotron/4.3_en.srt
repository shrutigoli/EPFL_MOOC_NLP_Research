00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:11,130
Welcome to the third and final video of Week
4 of this introductory course on synchrotrons

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,530
and x-ray free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:20,170
This video completes our discussion of synchrotron,
or machine physics, with a description of

4
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,260
the two new kids on the block, diffraction-limited
storage rings, and x-ray free-electron lasers.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,410
Diffraction-limited storage rings, or DLSRs,
represent the next refinement in synchrotron

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,699
performance, the “fourth generation” facilities.

7
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:45,300
The name perhaps slightly over-eggs their
performance, as none of the planned facilities

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,359
will be truly diffraction limited, at least
for photon energies much above a few keV.

9
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:59,429
Nonetheless, they are a major step towards
this goal, and promise game-changing improvements

10
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:02,749
in many techniques.

11
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:10,730
In the Summer of 2016, the first of this next
generation, MAX-IV in Lund, Sweden, came on

12
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:18,060
line, and others follow close behind, notably
Sirius in Brazil, and upgrades to the ESRF

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,580
in Grenoble, France, and the APS at the Argonne
National Labs in Illinois.

14
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:30,760
Following these are, among others, the ALS
in Berkeley, the Swiss Light Source, and SPring8

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,790
in Japan, to name just three.

16
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,360
So what defines a DLSR?

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,310
In simple terms, it is a significant improvement
in the horizontal emittance compared to that

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,140
of third-generation facilities.

19
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:55,970
Remember our discussion in the first video
of this week about the relative contributions

20
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,320
of the electron and photon beams to the emittance?

21
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,341
Associated with the bending magnet double-bend
achromat system is a lower limit to the electron

22
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:12,959
emittance in the orbital plane, which for
typical bending angles of the order of 10

23
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,310
degrees, is about 5 nm.radians.

24
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,890
This is substantially larger by over an order
of magnitude than that in the vertical direction,

25
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,880
which causes the photon beam to have a very
flat elliptical cross-section.

26
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,600
For many applications,

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,340
it would be highly advantageous to have a
significantly rounder beam.

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,550
A cursory glance at the equation describing
the horizontal emittance of DBAs should provide

29
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,670
a clue as to how we might achieve this.

30
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:58,330
The emittance depends on the third power of
the bending angle theta associated with a

31
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,410
single bending-magnet dipole, hence a reduction
in this by a factor F would decrease the emittance

32
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,080
by a factor F-cubed.

33
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,580
One can also reduce gamma, as the emittance
depends on the square of this.

34
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,920
However, the flux increases strongly with
gamma, so only a moderate reduction can be

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,380
tolerated.

36
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,510
For example, the upgrade of the APS to a DLSR
is likely to involve a reduction of the storage-ring

37
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:39,160
energy from 7 to 6 GeV.

38
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,830
Reducing theta to improve the emittance seems
such an obvious route to follow, you might

39
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,610
wonder why this wasn’t taken long ago.

40
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,470
The reasons for this are purely technological.

41
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:58,810
Until recently, the machining, engineering
and vacuum capabilities were limited such

42
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:05,069
that dividing a given arc sector from a double-bend
achromat, or at best a triple-bend achromat

43
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:11,110
(such as employed at the Swiss Light Source)
to an arc sector containing, for example,

44
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:17,070
seven dipole magnets, would have increased
the length of such a sector from 10 to 20

45
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:25,639
meters to perhaps sixty or seventy, taking
up valuable and expensive real-estate.

46
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:32,090
In addition, the potential for small misalignments
along the storage ring with so many more elements

47
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:41,460
involved would almost certainly have cancelled
out any theoretical advantages.

48
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,030
Advances in computer numerical control of
machining of magnet yokes and other metallic

49
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:54,250
components, however, now mean that dipoles,
quadrupoles, and sextupoles can be fabricated

50
00:04:54,250 --> 00:05:00,500
in a small fraction of the size previously
possible, and with micron precision with regards

51
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,389
to their relative positions.

52
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:10,280
So, instead of making separate components
and joining them together, each element being

53
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:18,301
independently adjustable, the sectors of DLSRs
are made of just one or two components, each

54
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:23,460
machined from a single block of metal, and
containing several magnet-lattice elements

55
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
together.

56
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:35,530
In this manner, multiple-bend achromats (MBAs)
containing up to nine bend magnets per arc-sector,

57
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:40,070
can now be fabricated.

58
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,550
The second improvement that has allowed this
change in fabrication approach has been in

59
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,700
vacuum technology.

60
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,440
Accompanied with miniaturisation is a reduction
in pumping efficiency through side ports to

61
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,340
vacuum pumps.

62
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,949
To circumvent this, many DLSRs now employ
coatings on the inside of the vacuum vessels

63
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:14,270
called nonevaporable getters, or NEGs, which,
below a base pressure easily achieved using

64
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:20,259
conventional pumping, can then obtain the
desired ultimate pressures of less than a

65
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:28,030
picoBar (or 10^-9 mBar) by chemically trapping
the residual gas molecules.

66
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,270
So, many third generation facilities are now
either undergoing or planning to undergo upgrades

67
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:40,300
to use multiple-bend achromats, producing
an improvement in horizontal emittance by

68
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:48,350
one to two orders of magnitude, ***** as shown
here.

69
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:58,669
An interesting figure of merit M = ehC3/E2,
is plotted here as a function of storage-ring

70
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:06,389
circumference, big C. From our equation describing
how the emittance varies with bending radius

71
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:12,390
theta (which is approximately proportional
to the storage ring circumference) and the

72
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:19,300
storage-ring energy, we should expect that
large rings with moderate ring energies should

73
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,039
produce the lowest horizontal emittances.

74
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,080
This figure of merit, M, weighs the achieved
emittance by these two factors in order to

75
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,740
“level the playing field”.

76
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:40,680
In other words, although a large ring at moderate
or low energy might have a better performance

77
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,570
than a smaller ring with high storage-ring
energies, if one factors the circumference

78
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:54,430
and energy in to this, one sees how well the
facility operates given its fundamental limitations.

79
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,009
This is shown in this graph.

80
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:04,949
So, which fields are likely to profit most
from the improved emittance of DLSRs?

81
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,890
Although the large majority of techniques
will profit at least modestly from this, some

82
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,530
will undergo a quantum leap in performance.

83
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:21,919
The low emittance associated with DLSRs means
that either the source size or the divergence

84
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,970
can be reduced significantly, or indeed, the
improvement can be divided between these two

85
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,199
properties, as desired.

86
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:37,389
A smaller source size for a given divergence
compared to 3rd generation facilities means

87
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:44,440
that scanning techniques such as scanning
transmission x-ray microscopy, scanning x-ray

88
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,520
absorption spectroscopy, or scanning x-ray
fluorescence spectroscopy, will all profit

89
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,920
by an amount similar to the improvement in
emittance.

90
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,510
This will mean, however, that the optics used
to focus the beam to the sample have specifications

91
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,530
that match the beam properties - it is pointless
having an almost perfectly parallel and tight

92
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:36,920
beam if the optics then blow this up to values
associated with third-generation facilities.

93
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Minimising the horizontal divergence will
increase the transverse coherence length in

94
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,110
the horizontal plane by one to two orders
of magnitude and increase the coherent fraction

95
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:50,480
accordingly.

96
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,770
So techniques which exploit the coherent properties
of the beam will especially profit from an

97
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,950
upgrade to a DLSR.

98
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:04,420
In addition, because the divergence is so
much smaller, the footprint of the beam on

99
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,910
optics such as reflecting or focussing mirrors
will be smaller, relaxing a little their performance

100
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,740
specifications.

101
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:20,600
As an example of how a trade-off between divergence
and spot size can sometimes be the best solution,

102
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,710
consider the case of macromolecular crystallography.

103
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:31,380
Often protein crystals have dimensions measured
in microns, demanding a tight focus of the

104
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:37,560
incident beam, either resulting in flux loss
if this is achieved by slitting the beam down

105
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,140
to smaller cross-sections, or otherwise a
higher divergence, which means that the diffraction

106
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:53,450
pattern can become unacceptably blurred (we
discuss this in more detail later in the course).

107
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,230
On the other hand, if one instead focusses
not on the sample, but instead on the detector,

108
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:07,200
in order to sharpen up the pattern, the beam
may be unacceptably large at the crystal itself.

109
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,820
The reduced emittance of DLSRs means that
both the spot size at the crystal sample and

110
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:25,480
the desired small size of the diffraction
maxima can be accommodated simultaneously.

111
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,630
We now close this, our second week on machine
physics, with an overview of x-ray free-electron

112
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,090
lasers.

113
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:41,149
Four such facilities already exist, whereby
the LCLS and SACLA provide radiation down

114
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:43,580
to one Angstrom.

115
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:50,680
A further three facilities that will also
provide both soft and hard x-rays are under

116
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,900
construction in Switzerland, Germany, and
South Korea.

117
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:06,350
XFELs are defined by their exceedingly high
peak brilliance, some 10^9 or even 10^10 times

118
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,420
that achievable using synchrotrons.

119
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:19,140
The pulse produced by XFELs are very short,
typically between a femtosecond and 100 fs.

120
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,779
What is the motivation for the construction
of XFELs?

121
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,550
X-rays provide resolution down to the Angstrom
and sub-Angstrom scale, but are limited in

122
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:34,890
their temporal resolution to that of the pulse
width of the bunches, measured in a few tens

123
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,640
of picosecond.

124
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,709
However, many fundamental and technologically
important processes are known to occur at

125
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:48,779
significantly shorter time-scales - many chemical
reactions occur on the time scale of molecular

126
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,320
vibrations, and these are measured in femtoseconds.

127
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,130
Hence the motivation to build XFELs was to
combine the spatial resolution of x-rays with

128
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:05,920
a temporal resolution down to the fs-scale,
previously only possible using lasers in the

129
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,820
visible, or near visible regime.

130
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:17,290
This table summarises some of the most pertinent
differences between synchrotron and XFEL light.

131
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,790
Let’s consider this line for line.

132
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:26,680
First, the repetition rate of the x-ray pulses,
which is fairly constant in the case of synchrotrons

133
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,650
at a few hundred megahertz, can take on greatly
different values at XFELs.

134
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:39,070
This is because the electrons pass just once
down the XFEL linac instead of being stored

135
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,540
in a ring, so are not constrained by this
condition.

136
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:53,120
So, for example, LCLS-I and SACLA have repetition
rates of approximately 100 Hz, while the planned

137
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,579
pattern for the European XFEL in Hamburg is
to deliver packets of a few thousand pulses

138
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:11,800
at 4.5 MHz (each packet therefore lasting
0.6 milliseconds) 10 times a second.

139
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,050
One of the two most important features of
XFELs, as already mentioned, is the pulse

140
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,399
duration, which is three orders of magnitude
shorter than at synchrotrons.

141
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,500
The average number of photons per second,
and therefore the average radiant power, is

142
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:34,800
fairly similar between a single harmonic peak
from an undulator at a synchrotron and from

143
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,550
the LCLS.

144
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:43,649
For many experiments, such as macromolecular
crystallography at the CXI station at the

145
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:50,460
LCLS, this unfiltered radiation, with an average
bandwidth of a few tens of an electronvolt

146
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:58,160
for hard x-rays, is used without monochromatization.

147
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,990
Most experiments at synchrotrons do use monochromator,
however, which cuts down the arrival rate

148
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,320
of photons to approximately 10^13 ph/s.

149
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,970
For those experiments at XFELs which do monochromatize
the beam, the arrival rate can vary between

150
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,440
approximately a tenth of the unfiltered radiation
to nothing at all.

151
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:29,350
This is because the bandwidth of the monochromator
typically used at XFELs is typically narrower

152
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:42,449
than gaps in the single-shot spectra produced
by SASE at XFELs, explained a little later.

153
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:47,510
Much effort is being devoted to improving
this situation in new seeding techniques and

154
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,770
novel optics.

155
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:56,090
The second highly important difference between
XFELs and synchrotrons is the number of photons

156
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:03,460
delivered per pulse, which is five orders
of magnitude or greater for XFELs than for

157
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,089
synchrotrons, even before monochromatization.

158
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:15,970
The peak power emerging from XFELs is therefore
approximately 10 orders of magnitude greater

159
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,640
than at synchrotrons.

160
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,209
Such enormous values mean that XFEL experiments
can be fundamentally different to those at

161
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:30,990
synchrotrons, as the samples are often obliterated
by a single shot from the XFEL.

162
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,959
We discuss this in detail towards the end
of the course.

163
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,160
Interestingly, however, XFELs are far less
wasteful than synchrotrons with regards to

164
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,800
their efficiency.

165
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,940
As was just mentioned, some XFEL experiments
use the entire available number of photons

166
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:59,300
without monochromatization, which at the LCLS-I
equates to half a watt.

167
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:06,279
Even those experiments that monochromatic
the XFEL beam work at up to 10% efficiency.

168
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,059
In contrast, the difference between the unfiltered
power output from an undulator beamline, at

169
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:18,639
approximately 1 kW (three orders of magnitude
higher than that of the entire LCLS) and that

170
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:25,519
emerging after the monochromator, approximately
30 mW, is approximately four to five orders

171
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,509
of magnitude!

172
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:38,029
Shown here is a quick reminder of the overview
of the architecture of XFELs shown in the

173
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:40,029
first week of this course.

174
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:46,989
Let us discuss the most important components
of this, beginning with the low-emittance

175
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,609
gun.

176
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:56,130
Electron bunches are produced by irradiating
a semiconductor or metallic surface with a

177
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:01,399
femtosecond laser to produce photoemission.

178
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,909
The timing of this laser pulse is so chosen
that the resulting electron cloud is then

179
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:13,350
accelerated by an RF cavity, which reduces
the impact on the emittance of space-charge

180
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,789
effects.

181
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:23,971
The emittance emerging from this system is
of the order of magnitude of 1 mm.mrad in

182
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:32,000
both transverse directions, while the peak
current is approximately 50 amps.

183
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,940
However, in order to induce SASE, the process
responsible for the formation of the high-intensity

184
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,830
femtosecond x-ray pulses, the peak electron
current needs to be several kiloamperes, in

185
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:56,919
other words, two orders of magnitude higher,
as it enters the XFEL undulator.

186
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:04,100
This increase in current is achieved using
one or more bunch compressors.

187
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,580
The RF phase in the first accelerator LINAC
after the low-emittance gun is adjusted to

188
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:20,690
allow the electrons to ‘surf’ down the
slope of the sinusoidal RF field — the leading

189
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,899
electrons are thus accelerated less than those
electrons towards the back of the bunch (this

190
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,249
phenomenon is referred to as ‘chirping’).

191
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:37,919
Nonetheless, the electrons’ velocities are
so close to the speed of light that their

192
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,649
differences are far too small to allow the
faster electrons at the back of the bunch

193
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:49,570
to catch up with the slower electrons positioned
further forward and thereby squeeze the bunch

194
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,019
length.

195
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:57,600
Instead, the bunch passes through a magnetic
four-dipole chicane.

196
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,789
The trailing (high-energy) electrons execute
a shorter path on account of their being less

197
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:07,749
deviated by the magnetic field.

198
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:13,309
In this manner, they are able to catch up
with the less energetic leading electrons,

199
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:18,700
which are more deviated by the magnet chicane.

200
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,679
This compression, or compressions, depending
on how many bunch compression stages are included,

201
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:34,470
thus shortens the bunch length and increases
n_e by a factor of approximately 100.

202
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,770
Once the electron beam has achieved the required
peak-current, it enters the undulator.

203
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:46,779
Let’s briefly recap the forces an electron
will experience in the presence of an electromagnetic

204
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,989
field.

205
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:58,419
You may recall that the ratio of these two
forces is equal to -v/c, or -beta.

206
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:03,259
In this figure, the electric force is shown
in red, while that of the magnetic Lorentz

207
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,909
force is in yellow.

208
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:12,330
For the highly relativistic electrons entering
the undulator, the ratio of the forces is

209
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:24,039
to all intents and purposes equal to minus
one.

210
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:29,830
If the electrons are moving coaxially with
the beam of radiation they have produced by

211
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:40,409
acceleration, the electric and magnetic forces
cancel out and they will remain unperturbed.

212
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:45,970
Now let’s perturb the electron beam’s
path by introducing the magnet array of the

213
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,869
XFEL undulator.

214
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:55,919
This causes the electrons to oscillate, as
we have already discussed in the last video.

215
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,190
Now, because their trajectory is no longer
exactly coaxial with the beam of radiation

216
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:09,009
(although the deviations shown here are greatly
exaggerated), the electric and magnetic forces

217
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:12,539
will no longer entirely cancel out.

218
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:18,629
For the case where the electric component
of the electromagnetic field of the radiation

219
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:25,679
points in the negative x-direction, the magnetic
field is on the negative y-direction, and

220
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,419
the forces will be as shown here

221
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:45,549
while half a cycle later of the electromagnetic
field, the forces are a shown here.

222
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:51,249
The consequence of these unequal forces is
that the electrons begin to be bunched together

223
00:22:51,249 --> 00:23:00,289
to form microbunches (within the conventional
bunch generated by the low-emittance gun and

224
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:07,279
bunch compression), separated by a distance
equal to the wavelength of the light they

225
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,749
generate and are bathed in.

226
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:17,409
In the laboratory frame of reference, this
is equal to the pole magnet periodicity divided

227
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:24,440
by gamma, hence is of the order of a few microns.

228
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:35,159
Each microbunch therefore has a duration of
a few femtoseconds to a few tens of femtoseconds.

229
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,179
FELs deliver femtosecond x-radiation.

230
00:23:39,179 --> 00:24:01,720
As the 
microbunches begin to form, the electrons

231
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:11,240
become more squeezed together, resulting in
an increase in the instantaneous current.

232
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:19,259
This therefore produces a intenser undulator
radiation, which in turn acts more strongly

233
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,879
on the electrons, further enhancing the micro
bunching process.

234
00:24:24,879 --> 00:24:37,379
This runaway effect is called SASE - self-amplified
spontaneous emission.

235
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:43,059
So why are these SASE radiation microbunches
(the XFEL pulses) so intense?

236
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:51,899
Before the SASE effect kicks in, emission
from individual electrons is purely stochastic

237
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:59,379
- in other words there is no correlation between
their emission regarding the phase - the system

238
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:06,049
is noncoherent, just as at synchrotrons.

239
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:12,210
The total electromagnetic field amplitude
is therefore a vector sum of the individual

240
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:19,080
contributions, each having the same magnitude,
but a completely random orientation.

241
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:31,429
From statistics, we can predict that this
vector sum, the total magnitude, is proportional

242
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:38,139
to the square root of the number of contributing
emitters, n_e, the number of electrons in

243
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:40,330
the bunch.

244
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:46,039
The INTENSITY, which is proportional to the
square of the amplitude, is therefore proportional

245
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,009
to n_e.

246
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:58,099
Now, in the case of the bunch after the SASE
process has induced the formation of the microbunches,

247
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:04,159
these microbunches are separated form each
other by integral numbers of the radiation

248
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:11,600
wavelength, hence emission is highly coherent
- the emitted wavelets are all in phase, and

249
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,929
therefore the vector addition of these contributions
all lie in a straight line - the amplitude

250
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:20,719
is proportional to n_e.

251
00:26:20,719 --> 00:26:28,409
The intensity is proportional to n_e squared,
and is thus n_e times more intense than for

252
00:26:28,409 --> 00:26:30,619
the non coherent bunch.

253
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:39,059
But n_e is of the order of 10^9 or 10^10,
and thus XFEL pulses are more intense by a

254
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:45,899
this factor.

255
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:53,309
The performance of an XFEL is encapsulated
in the dimensionless so-called Pierce parameter,

256
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:58,619
or XFEL parameter, given here.

257
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:04,220
Although different XFELs might have quite
disparate values for lambda_u, gamma, and

258
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,369
K, the one-third power dependence means that
the XFEL parameter is fairly constant between

259
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:18,149
facilities, at around 5 x 10^-4.

260
00:27:18,149 --> 00:27:25,289
This value describes both the instantaneous
bandwidth of the XFEL radiation, and the ratio

261
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:32,049
of the photon-beam power to the electron-beam
power.

262
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:39,279
The XFEL gain length L_G is inversely proportional
to the XFEL parameter, and typically takes

263
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,549
on values of a few meters.

264
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:49,440
It describes length along the undulator required
to increase the radiative power by a factor

265
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,279
e, or about 2.72.

266
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:00,960
As the potential total power increase before
saturation of SASE begins is typically seven

267
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,190
or so orders of magnitude, the undulator needs
to be a length no shorter than the natural

268
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:15,429
logarithm of 10^7 times L_G, which equates
to several tens of meters!

269
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:21,389
This is nearly two orders of magnitude longer
than undulatory used at synchrotrons!

270
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:30,880
Lastly, let us take a brief look at a typical
SASE spectrum.

271
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,450
Although the instantaneous bandwidth is, at
5 x 10^-4, similar to that provided by silicon

272
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,169
monochromator at synchrotrons, the centre
of the spectrum can jump back and forth by

273
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:51,339
a few tens of eV, depending on which mode
was randomly selected by the SASE process.

274
00:28:51,339 --> 00:28:57,419
The time-averaged spectral width is therefore
an order of magnitude larger, at around 5

275
00:28:57,419 --> 00:28:59,490
x 10^-3.

276
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:06,940
So, although XFELs provide radiation with
exceedingly coherent radiation in the transverse

277
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:14,299
direction, due to its unmatched parallelity
and small source size, the longitudinal coherence

278
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,259
length is poor.

279
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:23,820
In summary, this video has provided some insight
into the operational principles behind DLSRs

280
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,309
and XFELs.

281
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:31,529
DLSRs promise significant jumps in performance
compared to 3rd-generation synchrotrons, and

282
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:37,299
may thereby also open up some entirely new
experimental methods.

283
00:29:37,299 --> 00:29:43,940
XFELs, because of their short pulse lengths
and high intensities, represent a paradigm

284
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:50,080
shift in x-ray science, and promise new experimental
vistas, particularly in time-resolved studies

285
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:58,269
in fields as diverse as macromolecular biology
and heterogeneous catalysis.

286
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:02,990
Next week, we will discuss how synchrotron
radiation is further manipulated regarding

287
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:09,659
monochromatization, reflection, and focussing,
plus other instrumental aspects associated

288
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:10,929
with beamline design.
