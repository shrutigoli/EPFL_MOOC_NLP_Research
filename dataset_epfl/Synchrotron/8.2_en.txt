Hello, and welcome to this, the second video of week 8.
In this video, we will discuss important variants of synchrotron-based tomography, namely phase-contrast methods, and high-speed tomography.
Shown here are the absorption lengths of different materials at different photon energies, with representative objects corresponding to typical lengths scales shown on the right.
High-density samples absorb strongly, even for fairly high-energy photons.
Hence, for example, medical radiographs of bones or teeth use a broad band of energies, but peaking in the range of several tens of keV.
On the other hand, traditional radiography and absorption tomography, while providing invaluable information on a wide spectrum of materials and objects, runs into problems for samples which are small and/or composed of low-density material.
The attenuation length of flesh, for example, is around 2 to 3 mm at 10 keV, and an order of magnitude larger at 25 keV.
This means that some of the most scientifically interesting biological samples provide only poor contrast.
In addition, objects which absorb only weakly tend also to absorb fairly homogeneously throughout their internal structure, even if this is composed of distinct heterogeneous components.
So, a strongly absorbing object will show a clear absorption profile , while little or no observable contrast will be seen for a weakly absorbing sample . Again, this is exemplified by biological samples, where objects with quite distinct biological functions and structures become almost indistinguishable with regards to their x-ray absorption coefficients.
So, if absorption becomes an increasingly poor metric for small and weakly absorbing samples is there another phenomenon we can exploit to obtain the necessary contrast?
Well, yes, there is, namely refraction . This is exploited in phase-contrast tomography.
Remember that any material has a complex refractive index in the x-ray regime, given by n = 1
- delta + i beta.The effect of this is on the one hand, to attenuate the beam through the beta term, but also to increase the x-ray wavelength within the medium by a factor of
1/(1-delta).
The graph shown here is of the transmission, refractive-index decrement delta, and absorption index beta, of 1 mm of flesh as a function of photon energy.
Note first, that above 10 or 15 keV, the transmission rapidly approaches unity, that is, very little absorption occurs.
This is good regarding radiation damage of the soft, biological sample, but bad for absorption-contrast measurements.
Note also, that the drop-off of beta with photon energy follows a 1/hv^4 dependence, while that of delta is only 1/hv^2.
But how exactly does refraction provide the desired contrast?
We begin by assuming ray optics only, ignoring diffraction effects.
Although this does not represent reality, it does provide some insights into what we might expect to see.
Let us imagine a block of material of length
L and real part of the refractive index (that is, the part responsible for refraction) 1
- delta.
Consider two identical (i.e., coherent) plane waves, one of which passes through the block, while the other passes by it.
Although the phases of the two waves are identical as the first enters the block, refraction causes this to advance relative to the second block travelling through vacuum.
How much is this advance?
Well, the number of wavelengths associated with the second wave travelling through vacuum a distance equal to the block thickness, L, is simply L/lambda.
The number of wavelengths passing through the block, on the other hand, is L(1-delta)/lambda, hence the difference between the waves is simply L delta/lambda.
Let us consider an object that is 100 microns long, and has a value for delta of 7 x 10^-7 at 20 keV (a photon energy which equates to
0.62 Angstroms in vacuum).
The difference in the number of wavelengths is thus 1.13 periods, or 7.1 radians.
If the block presents a nonnormal surface to the incident or exit waves, refraction will bend the beam, causing it to overlap with the beam passing by the object.
A more realistic description of the effect of refraction on the transmitted beam is consider diffraction phenomena by using Huygens construction.
This states that, given a certain wavefront form, the subsequent wavefront in the direction of propagation can be constructed by adding secondary spherical wavelets of the same wavelength to each point along that wavefront.
So a plane wave will generate another plane wave, as shown here on the left.
Now, if some obstacle blocks the path of the wavefront, as shown by the black bar in the central figure, the wavelets in this region are removed, and interference between the remaining unblocked wavelets results in fringes forming as they propagate in the forward direction
- at sufficiently large distances, Z_0, this is, in fact, the diffraction pattern, or Fourier transform of the edge.
At very short distances, on the other hand, for example, if a detector butts up against the absorbing block, little or no diffraction effect is observed.
Using approximations, it is a simple exercise to show that the distance x_1 of the first minimum after the geometrical end of the absorbing block is given by the square root of Z_0 lambda/2.
Let us consider two examples of Z_0 for lambda
= 0.7 Angstrom.
For Z_0 = 10 mm, x_1 = 0.59 microns.
For Z_0 = 1 m, however, x_1 = 5.9 microns.
Any detector with a pixel size larger than about half of the fringe separation is unable to resolve this interference phenomenon.
Hence the detector would need a pixel size smaller than 0.3 microns and 3 microns, respectively, for the short and large detector distance from the object.
Why then, donâ€™t we simply move further downstream of the object until the fringes are large enough to match the detector we might be using at the time?
The problem is, that the propagated scattering pattern evolves gradually from being a more or less faithful reproduction of the absorption profile at very short distances , that is, distances much smaller than a^2/lambda, a being the typical size of fluctuations in the architecture of the sample (This absorption profile, remember, is, however, almost undetectable for weakly absorbing samples), to being the true diffraction pattern of the object at very large distances , i.e., much larger than a^2/lambda in the so-called Fraunhofer regime . It is at the sweet spot between these two limits where
Z_0 is of the order of a^2/lambda, that the sample profile is still preserved, but for which the boundaries between heterogeneous components are highlighted, not by the insignificant absorption, but by interference fringes.
This is called the Fresnel regime.
This technique of phase-contrast tomography is beautifully demonstrated by this example of prehistoric insects trapped within an opaque amber block.
In this first image, recorded at a distance of 50 mm, using 30-keV (or 0.413 Angstrom) photons, little or no detail can be discerned in this radiograph.
The first fringe separation x_1 is at a distance of one micron, whereas the detector used at the ID19 station of the ESRF had a pixel size of 5 microns and was thus incapable of respiring these fine diffraction fringes.
Increasing the distance to one metre, however, meant that the fringes are separated by a distance of approximately 5 microns, just enough to provide a one pixel-width intensity contrast.
The emergence of exquisite detail by optimising the sample-detector distance is wonderfully clear.
Phase-contrast tomography is likely to profit significantly from the emergence of 4th-generation diffraction limited storage rings.
This is because the technique exploits the coherent fraction of the synchrotron beam, which, in 3rd-generation facilities, is a small fraction of a percent.
The coherent fraction of DLSRs is inversely proportional to the emittance, and will thus increase accordingly, that is, by approximately two orders of magnitude, allowing much higher data-acquisition rates.
This leads us naturally on to the subject of high-speed tomography, in which the three-dimensional structure of an object is recorded as a function of time.
Two sorts of experiment can be performed - either irreversible processes, or cyclic ones.
The former requires that any changes during the process be recorded with sufficient speed and accuracy.
This is presently limited to ten or 20 Hz, with up to possibly another order of magnitude envisaged in the next few years.
In cyclic processes, faster frame rates are accessible by using a stroboscopic approach.
Imagine a rubber rod being repeatedly compressed and then releases to its relaxed state.
Instead of trying to record a full 180 degree rotation for each time interval Delta T during the cycle of duration big T, radiographs are recorded in one orientation only as quickly as possible over time T.
The sample is then rotated by a small amount, and the cycle repeated.
The tomogram for each time interval Delta
T is then obtained by selecting the appropriate radiograph from each set of nonrotating images.
There are, needless to say, several technical obstacles associated with high-speed tomography.
First, the exposure between frames needs to be long enough to obtain sufficiently non-noisy images.
Secondly, rapid rotations will impose significant forces on the object.
Consider, for example, a sample with a 2-mm radius rotating at 20 Hz.
The centripetal acceleration is omega^2 r, where omega = 2pi nu = 126 radian/second.
This equates to an acceleration of 31.6 m/s^2, or 3g, the acceleration experienced by astronauts on the space shuttle.
For soft or liquid samples, this might be unacceptably severe, and must be taken into consideration.
Thirdly, imagine an irreversible process being recorded at a time resolution of 50 ms (again, corresponding to 20 Hz) within which 400 angular orientations are to be recorded.
This results in a frame rate of 8000/second.
If we assume that each radiograph requires
1 Mbyte of storage, this means that data transfer, either directly, or to a buffer, must be capable of at least 8 GB/s.
An intensive beamtime can therefore produce hundreds of terabytes per day, far in excess of what a â€œstandardâ€� PC can handle.
The problem of data management looms large in tomography, and also, in ptychography, described in more detail in the third video of this week.
We finish this second video with an example of high-speed tomography, in which the flight muscles and breathing network of a blowfly are followed.
At the start of the video, the insect is facing to the left (the head is out of the field of view so appears clipped) and the attachment point of the mount on the flyâ€™s back is visible at the top of the thorax.
As the view orbits the flying insect, the deformations of the thorax are clearly visible as the wing moves up and down, in particular the pitching and heaving motions of the bristle-covered structure behind the mount.
Also visible are the beating halteres (dumbbell-shaped structures modified from the hindwings), which oscillate in a void covered by the calypteres
(semi-transparent membranous structures, with an opaque border).
At 30s, a sagittal clipping plane is introduced computationally.
This first reveals the dorsoventral flight muscles, coloured blue to purple, that power the wingbeat, along with the dorsolongitudinal flight muscles (not coloured) that become visible as the clipping plane moves further into the thorax.
An inverse threshold filter is then applied to reveal the tracheal network and other cavities within the flight muscle (shown in green).
The clipping plane then continues to move through the thorax until the steering muscles that provide fine control over the wingbeat are visible (coloured yellow to purple).
This second video has introduced you to two powerful variations of tomography.
Phase-contrast techniques are employed in order to highlight the boundaries between heterogeneous components of an object by differences not in their absorption, which can be very small, in particular for low-density biological samples, but instead by differences in the refractive index, which remains more sensitive, even for low-Z materials.
Both absorption tomography and phase-contrast tomography can be carried out at high speeds if (a) the flux is sufficiently high; and
(b) the acquisition rates are high enough to capture temporal changes in the object with suitable resolution.
This method is becoming increasingly popular in the real world where changes are the norm, not the exception.
In the final video of this week, we will discuss two techniques, coherent x-ray diffractive imaging and ptychography, which are based not on direct imaging like tomography, but instead on lensless techniques, which allow the experimenter to bridge the spatial-resolution gap between tomography and electron microscopies and crystal diffraction, while also allowing the internal structure of the sample to be probed.
