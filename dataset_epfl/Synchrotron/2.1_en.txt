Welcome to Week 2 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week, we will explore the basic features and physical description of the interaction of x-rays with matter.
We shall begin by relating cross-sections and attenuation lengths for a given process and how one can calculate one from the other.
The only three relevant physical processes concerning x-ray interactions with matter are then introduced, of which that of Compton scattering is only very briefly described, as we will not consider this further in the course.
The remainder of this, the first video of this week, will be concerned with the description of elastic scattering of x-rays by quasi-free electrons and the introduction of the concept of the atomic form factor.
In the second video, refinements of the atomic form factor are added to account for the fact that the electrons in a material are generally bound to the nucleus with well-defined binding energies.
Just as visible light is bent, or â€œrefractedâ€�, as it passes from one medium to another, x-rays are also similarly affected.
How the refractive index in the x-ray regime is related to the atomic form factor will be covered in detail.
From this, quantitative predictions can be made about refraction and reflection of x-rays.
Lastly, absorption effects resulting from excitation of electrons to unoccupied energy states, and subsequent relaxation processes will be discussed.
Just a brief note about the tone of this week
- although it contains some mathematics, none of this is complex and should be understandable even for a high-school student, so please do not feel intimidated by the introduction this week of some more mathematical expressions.
Letâ€™s now begin by discussing the concept of cross-sections and attenuation lengths.
Consider a process P (as yet undefined) occurring when x-rays pass through a block of material of depth L, containing a number density rho_a of atoms responsible for this process.
Each atom has a cross-sectional area sigma_P associated with the process P. Due to this process, the beam intensity will exponentially decay as photons are removed or scattered from the beam as it travels through the medium.
The attenuation length Lambda_P is defined as being equal to the length the beam has travelled through the medium before the original intensity I_0 has been reduced by a factor equal to the natural logarithm e = 2.718.
The relationship between this and the cross-section is simply Lambda_P = 1/(sigma_P rho_a).
In order to better understand this, let us consider the example of a 10-keV x-ray beam passing through cobalt metal.
From the density of cobalt (8.9 g/cm3) and its atomic mass (58.933), the atomic number density can be directly calculated to be 9.09 x 10^10 atoms per cubic micron.
***** The graph on the left of the photoabsorption attenuation length shows this to be 6.2 microns at 10 keV.
Using the equation from the previous slide, we obtain a photoabsorption cross-section sigma_PA of 1.77 x 10^-12 square microns.
As there are 100 million square Angstroms per square micron, this equates to 1.774 x
10^-4 square Angstroms.
An even more convenient unit to use is that of the â€œbarnâ€�, which has an area of 10^-28 square meters, or 10^-8 square Angstroms.
Cobalt therefore has a photoabsorption cross-section of 1.774 x 10^4 barn.
Incidentally, a barn is approximately equal to the capture cross-section of uranium nuclei in fission reactions - the term â€œbarnâ€� comes from the colloquialism â€œas big as a barn doorâ€�, as scientists performing wartime research into uranium fission considered this to be particularly large target (and therefore a prime candidate for development of the fission bomb).
Even more whimsically, there exist (admittedly rarely used and certainly not mentioned again in this course) related cross-sectional units, the â€œouthouseâ€� (equal to one microbarn), and the â€œshedâ€� (one yoctobarn).
So, which processes should we consider when discussing the interaction of x-rays with matter?
Nuclear- and pair production only begin to dominate at photon energies above the highest presently available at synchrotron facilities and can be entirely ignored.
This leaves Thomson and Compton scattering, and photoabsorption.
All these processes involve the electron and the electron only.
The nuclear core can be entirely disregarded due to its relatively very large mass (a single nucleon is some 1800 times heavier than an electron).
We begin with a brief description of Compton scattering.
This is a quantum-mechanical effect in which some of the energy and momentum of an incident photon is imparted to a free electron, which thereby receives a change in its momentum.
The energy lost by the inelastically scattered photon results in a lengthening of the wavelength and depends on its scattered angle psi and initial photon energy h-nu_0, given by the equation shown here.
The cluster of constants h/mc = 0.0243 Angstroms.
The relative energy loss therefore only becomes significant above a few tens of keV, and for large angles psi, as can be clearly seen in the graph to the right and only begins to dominate above approximately
100 keV.
This threshold energy is related to the rest-mass energy of an electron, mc^2 = 511 keV for electrons.
As such, we will no longer consider Compton scattering in this course, although it shouldnâ€™t be forgotten when performing high-energy-photon synchrotron experiments.
Now we have seen that it is the electron which is the only particle of interest regarding interaction with x-rays, let us begin by considering how a free electron responds in the presence of an electromagnetic field.
For nonrelativistic electron velocities, we need only consider the electric-field component of the incoming radiation.
The electron will respond to this, moving in the opposite direction to the E-field (the force is equal to MINUS the elementary charge times the electric-field amplitude).
This causes the electron to reradiate coherently with the incident beam, with the same phase and frequency, for reasons we will discuss later in the course in the beginning of the section on synchrotron physics.
The intensity of the reradiated or scattered radiation depends on the polar angle of observation chi according to cosine-squared chi, shown here.
Hence an observer viewing along the E-field vector at chi = 90 degrees will see no scattered intensity, as the E-field has zero transverse component in this direction.
Conversely, in the plane perpendicular to the electric-field direction, scattering is maximised.
Again, the reason for this spatial distribution will be made clear when we begin to discuss synchrotron, or â€œmachineâ€�, physics.
This response of the free electrons to light is the reason why, among other things, mirrors reflect, radio antenna transmit, and, importantly, synchrotrons produce light.
As I just mentioned, the reasons for this will become clear soon.
This elastic scattering by electrons, that is, with no loss in photon energy, is referred to as Thomson scattering.
Although the photon energy remains invariant, the direction, or momentum, can change.
Let us consider scattering of a photon by an angle 2-theta
The vector difference between the incident and scattered photon wavevectors (each of which have a magnitude equal to k = 2pi/lambda) is equal to Q, which is referred to as the scattering vector.
The magnitude of Q is easy to calculate as follows: Half of Q is simply equal to k sin theta.
As k equals 2pi/lambda, Q is therefore equal to 4pi/lambda sin theta.
How strongly incident radiation is scattered by a free electron is given by the Thomson scattering length.
This is determined by equating the classical electrostatic energy of a charge e at a distance equal to r-zero, the Thomson length, to the rest-mass energy of the electron, mc-squared.
The Thomson length thus turns out to be equal to 2.82 x 10^-5 Angstroms, and can be thought of as the classical radius of an electron.
The cross-section of a free electron is determined by integrating over all angles of the dipole radiation, and turns out to be equal to about
2/3 of a barn.
We now progress from the case of a free electron to scattering from an atom.
We begin by making the dubious assumption that all the electrons associated with the atom can respond entirely unhindered by the fact that they are actually bound to the atomâ€™s nuclear core.
We first consider the limit of the x-ray wavelength being significantly larger than the extent of the electron cloud around the atom.
In this case, all the scattering elements will scatter coherently (that is, in phase) because any differences in positions in space of the different cloud elements is very small compared to the wavelength.
As there are Z electrons in the cloud, the scattering cross-section is simply Z^2 sigma_T, which is independent of wavelength.
So, for example, the low-energy limit of Thomson scattering in the forward direction, shown here for barium, is 56-squared, or 3136 times the cross-section of an individual electron, which is approximately equal to 2000 barns.
As the photon energy increases and the wavelength shortens to distances comparable and then less than the size of the atom, however, scattering from the different elements dV in the electron cloud begin to interfere partially destructively, resulting in a drop-off of the scattering cross-section and intensity, which follows approximately an inverse square relationship with respect to the photon energy.
The gradual crossover from the lower-energy limit of constant scattering cross-section to that of one dropping off is at x-ray wavelengths comparable to the size of the electron cloud, of the order of 3 Angstrom, equating to an energy of about 4 keV.
The precise drop-off is given by the atomic form factor, or atomic scattering factor, f.
This describes the elastic scattering amplitude as a function of angle, wavelength, and atom type.
More accurately, f is normally expressed as a function of Q or sin theta/lambda, as this is the appropriate independent variable.
If one performs one experiment at a certain energy and one observes the scattering at a certain angle 2-theta, then if the energy is then, say, increased (lambda decreased), then the same interference (i.e., phase difference) between any two scattering elements dV of the electron cloud will be the same at shallower angles.
So, for the example shown here for phosphorus, an atomic form factor of 10 electrons will be observed at high angles for low energies and low angles for high energies.
Note also that in the forward-scattering direction, all the scattering elements in the electron cloud will scatter in phase, and the amplitude will be that of the individual electron multiplied by Z, in other words, the total charge surrounding the atom.
The intensity, proportional to the square of the amplitude, thus increases as Z-squared.
The dependence of f on Q (or sin theta/lambda) can be conveniently expressed as the sum of four Gaussians plus a constant, and values for every element for these expressions can be found in the International Tables for Crystallography.
Summarising our discussion of elastic scattering so far, we should take home the following:
The electrons respond to the electric-field component of the incident x-rays and reradiate as a consequence at the same frequency - the process is elastic.
At large wavelengths compared to the size of the atoms scattering is independent of the photon energy, as the cloud can be approximated as being a point source.
However, as the wavelength becomes smaller
(photon energy increases), scattering from the different volume elements within the electron cloud begin to be out of phase with each other, resulting in increasing destructive interference.
As an approximation, the cross-section drops off as 1/E^2, and is described in detail by the atomic form factor, f, which is normally expressed as a function of Q, or sin theta/lambda.
In the next video, we will consider how the situation changes if we account for the fact that the electrons are not entirely free to respond to the incident radiation, but are in fact bound to atoms.
This will lead to the phenomena of refraction, reflection, and absorption.
