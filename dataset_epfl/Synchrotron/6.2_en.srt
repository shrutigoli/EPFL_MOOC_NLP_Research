00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,519
Welcome to the second video of Week 6 of this
introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,440
free-electron lasers!

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,150
This video is concerned with three of the
most common variations of synchrotron-based

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:26,590
diffraction, namely single-crystal diffraction,
powder diffraction, and macromolecular crystallography.

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:34,270
Before discussing different types of synchrotron-based
diffraction experiments, it is worth to first

6
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:41,449
pause and consider the myriad types of samples
that can be investigated using diffraction,

7
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:48,800
as an understanding of these helps in deciding
the type of experiment to undertake.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,649
We can divide sample types into three broad
classifications, namely (and in increasing

9
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:06,229
degree of disorder) single-crystal, textured,
and powder samples.

10
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,700
Within each class, however, there are strikingly
different manifestations.

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,500
Take, for example, single crystals.

12
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,130
Even the highest-quality silicon single crystal
still contains crystallographic defects (including

13
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,690
vacancies, interstitials, dislocations, and
mosaic domains), hence in reality there is

14
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:35,040
no such thing as a perfect single crystal.

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,520
At what level of imperfection does one begin
to regard a system as being no longer a single

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
crystal?

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,420
Of course, there is no well-defined boundary,
and depending on experimental methods, preconceptions,

18
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,570
and “what you’re used to”, the transition
between one system and another may be quite

19
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,020
different.

20
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,990
So high-quality large crystals such as diamonds,
micron-sized protein crystals (which, incidentally,

21
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,750
size-for-size, are far more valuable than
diamond!), or heteroepitaxial thin films grown

22
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:17,349
on single-crystal substrates and fabricated
for microelectronic applications are all,

23
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:23,340
in their own fields, regarded as being single
crystals.

24
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,739
This fuzziness in boundaries extends all the
way to nanocrystalline powder samples and

25
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,549
semi-amorphous structures.

26
00:02:34,549 --> 00:02:41,540
A well-known phenomenon in single crystals
is that of twinning, in which two crystals

27
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,319
share crystal lattice points at a boundary
in a symmetric manner.

28
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,090
The resulting diffraction pattern of the twins
(there can be more than two twins, depending

29
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,019
on the crystallographic system) becomes more
complicated.

30
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:04,299
For example, each diffraction spot of an untwinned
system may be split into two or more closely

31
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:05,459
lying features.

32
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:12,499
One can therefore consider twinning as the
first step towards disorder and eventually

33
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:17,040
to powder samples.

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,480
Textured samples exhibit an intermediate degree
of order, with preferred directions for certain

35
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,250
crystallographic planes.

36
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,739
This may be due, for example, to a ‘brushing’
effect in the fabrication process of the sample

37
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:38,709
(such as in polymer fibre pulling), to the
synthetic process, such as in natural fibres

38
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:45,139
such as flax, or because of energy-minimization
reasons.

39
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:52,739
Powder samples consist of crystalline grains
that have no preferred orientation in space,

40
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,420
and are significantly smaller than the illuminated
volume.

41
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:02,909
For some samples, this latter condition may
be only poorly met, in which case the sample

42
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:09,239
can be spun, in order to record a spatially
averaged signal.

43
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,139
Note that for undulator radiation, the focussed
beam cross-section might be only of the order

44
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:22,880
of a square micron, and the sampled volume
may be less than 100 cubic microns.

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,010
When the characteristic size of the individual
grains is reduced to only a few unit cells,

46
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,980
such as in nanocrystals, the widths of the
diffraction peaks broaden accordingly, producing

47
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,850
diffuse ring patterns.

48
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,440
This lower limit in crystallinity often best
represents the grim reality of ‘real’

49
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:53,310
systems, and as such is a burgeoning area
of research in 21st-Century crystallography.

50
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,670
Synchrotrons are playing a leading role in
this enterprise.

51
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:06,160
Let us begin with three different approaches
to studying single crystals.

52
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,060
Each method is suited for different applications.

53
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,540
Although the majority of x-ray diffraction
methods use (quasi-)monochromatic x- rays

54
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:23,260
and a sample which must be rotated in space
in order to satisfy the diffraction condition,

55
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:29,550
it is also possible to record diffraction
patterns of stationary single crystals using

56
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,790
a broad spectrum of x-rays, a technique known
as the Laue method.

57
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,710
Indeed, the Laue method is historically the
oldest and was used in the original discovery

58
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:47,490
of x-ray diffraction and is named after its
founder, Max von Laue (see Figure 1.8).

59
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,910
After the development of monochromatic sources
using characteristic radiation from x-ray

60
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:58,260
tubes, Laue diffraction fell somewhat into
disuse, except to orient single crystals and

61
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,410
to determine their crystal quality.

62
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:07,900
However, with the advent of synchrotron radiation
(especially from third generation facilities),

63
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:13,390
and enormous improvements in computing power
and detector technology, Laue diffraction

64
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:19,600
has enjoyed a renaissance as a technique which
provides a fast and efficient means to record

65
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,220
diffraction data, and is being used to great
effect in dynamical studies of transient crystalline

66
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,740
states.

67
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,160
Consider a diffraction pattern, that is, a
regularly spaced set of diffraction maxima,

68
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:46,130
or Bragg spots, in reciprocal space, with
the (000) direct beam spot in the centre.

69
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:53,110
If we irradiate the crystal with a quasi-monochromatic
x-ray beam, it is unlikely that the crystal

70
00:06:53,110 --> 00:07:00,970
will be oriented such that a diffraction spot
lies on the surface of the Ewald sphere (remember,

71
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:08,310
this is the pictorial representation for satisfying
the Bragg condition of constructive interference).

72
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,180
In the case of macromolecular crystals, the
density of Bragg spots is so large, with separations

73
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,420
in reciprocal space often well over hundred
times smaller than the radius of the Ewald

74
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,560
sphere, that some spots are likely to intersect
the Ewald sphere.

75
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,940
But, for the moment, let us ignore this and
consider the more sparsely populated reciprocal

76
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:34,120
space shown here.

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:47,810
In this case, no Bragg spot sits on the Ewald
sphere, and no diffraction intensity is recorded.

78
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:53,990
Now let us consider the case where a band
of photon energies irradiates the crystal,

79
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,870
such as one can generate from bending magnets
and wigglers.

80
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:06,150
The Ewald spheres of the lower and upper limits
of the band of energies will have radii equal

81
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:13,590
to 2 pi/lambda_max and 2 pi/lambda_min, respectively.

82
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,110
All diffraction spots that lie within the
volume between these two spheres (which touch

83
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:29,870
tangentially at the (000) direct beam) will
produce diffraction signal.

84
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:36,899
Which angle will a certain Bragg spot (hkl),
highlighted here in red, subtend with the

85
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,270
incident beam?

86
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,700
To determine this, we need to find the Ewald
sphere that meets the Bragg condition, in

87
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,710
other words, the precise energy within the
energy band.

88
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:59,330
This is a sphere which is intersects both
the (000) and (hkl) spots, and is symmetric

89
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:07,960
around the incident beam direction, as shown
here with the dot-dashed circle . The two

90
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:16,310
radii of this circle that connect with circle’s
centre to (000) and (hkl) subtend an angle

91
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,480
2-theta_(hkl).

92
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,560
A large subset of all the possible detected
diffraction peaks can be accessed by rotating

93
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:36,000
the crystal and recording the signal frame
after frame.

94
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,680
An example of Laue diffraction is shown here,
in which the video on the right shows differences

95
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:50,070
in the electron density map compared to the
static state after a carbon monoxyhaemoglobin

96
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,240
crystal was irradiated with a nanosecond laser.

97
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,490
The laser causes the carbon monoxide molecule
to photodissociate and the structure rearranges

98
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,550
itself in response to this.

99
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,890
This is probed by taking single pulses from
the synchrotron storage ring and varying the

100
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:16,790
delay between the laser pulse pump and x-ray
probe.

101
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:24,980
This experiment is made possible by the fact
that the dissociation of CO is reversible,

102
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:31,650
allowing the experiment to be repeated at
different time delays.

103
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:36,279
In some experiments, one is interested in
recording only a subset of the diffraction

104
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:41,760
data, using the so-called selected Bragg-peak
method.

105
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,680
An example might be orbital, charge (i.e.,
valence), or even spin ordering of electronic

106
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,110
states in future electronic materials, which
increases the crystal periodicity and thereby

107
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:01,839
introduces additional (and usually very weak)
Bragg peaks at nominally non-integral positions

108
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,860
in reciprocal space.

109
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:12,420
In such experiments, the crystal is carefully
oriented to light up a certain diffraction

110
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,990
peak.

111
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:28,300
Because these can often be weak, synchrotron
radiation is normally required.

112
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,589
In addition, by tuning to the absorption-edge
energies of the atoms responsible for the

113
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:41,040
phenomenon of interest, the signal strength
can be enhanced using resonant elastic scattering

114
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:50,630
effects.

115
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,290
We have already come across the rotation method
in the first video of this week.

116
00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:02,160
It is only mentioned explicitly again here
in order to highlight some technical improvements,

117
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,600
although it should be mentioned that a macromolecular-crystallography
experiments carried out at synchrotrons use

118
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,250
the rotation method as well.

119
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,020
In the “old days”, a crystal would be
rotated and an exposure recorded over a certain

120
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,180
angular range of the order of a degree.

121
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:29,450
Any Bragg peaks crossing the Ewald sphere
during the exposure would be recorded.

122
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:35,560
Exactly where they lay within the angular
range covered was normally lost, while whether

123
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:42,440
they were intense and sharp or broad but weaker
was also ambiguous.

124
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:50,480
After the exposure, the recording device,
normally a CCD, would read out the data, which

125
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,640
could take several seconds to several tens
of seconds.

126
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,220
The next angular range, starting where the
previous one left off, would be recorded by

127
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:08,410
slightly rewinding the crystal and ramping
up the rotation rate before starting the next

128
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,990
exposure.

129
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,140
In this manner, a full dat set could take
several minutes to some hours, depending on

130
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:24,180
the crystal type, size, and intensity of the
beam.

131
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,330
With the advent of modern detectors, with
readout times in the range of a few milliseconds,

132
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,240
a new approach called fine phi-slicing became
possible.

133
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,480
In this mode of operation, the exposures were
over much narrower angular ranges by an order

134
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,270
of magnitude, and the crystal was allowed
to rotate continuously, as the dead time between

135
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,870
exposures was sufficiently small.

136
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:59,080
Nowadays, a full data set can be recorded
in just a few seconds, or even below a second.

137
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,870
Because the angles covered by each exposure
are typically smaller than the angular width

138
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,620
of the diffraction signal (in the case of
macromolecular crystallography), the peak

139
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,800
shape and position can be accurately determined
using fine phi-slicing.

140
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:22,290
For some materials, it may prove to be very
difficult or indeed impossible to grow macroscopic

141
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,560
crystals of sufficient crystallographic quality
to be investigated using single-crystal diffraction.

142
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,440
In such instances, powder diffraction (also
called the ‘Debye-Scherrer’ method) is

143
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,860
an invaluable technique.

144
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,770
Powder diffraction suffers from the fact that
because the microcrystallites making up the

145
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:51,550
powder sample are randomly oriented, the angularly
separated information one obtains in single-crystal

146
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:58,339
diffraction is projected on to a single coordinate,
complicating the identification of the Miller

147
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:04,279
indices of the Bragg peaks (so-called “indexing”).

148
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,660
In addition, diffraction signals that are
separated from each other in a single-crystal

149
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:15,860
pattern will overlap in the powder pattern
if they are associated with the same lattice

150
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,610
spacing.

151
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,350
It should not be thought, however, that powder
diffraction is a ‘last resort’ technique

152
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,160
only to be used when large, high-quality,
single crystals are unavailable.

153
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,649
Powder diffraction not only provides a rapid
and nondestructive means to identify the composite

154
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,620
parts in multicomponent mixtures or complex
system in fields as disparate as metallurgy,

155
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:47,930
archaeology, pharmaceutical sciences, mineralogy,
catalysis, and condensed-matter physics, but

156
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:54,390
is also indispensable in extreme environmental
studies, where phase changes are studied as

157
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,960
a function of temperature and/or pressure.

158
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:04,340
In such cases, information can often ONLY
be extracted from powder samples, which due

159
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,440
to the microcrystallites’ large surface
area-to-volume ratio, can accommodate phase

160
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:17,250
changes under these severe conditions by relaxation
and propagation of crystallographic faults

161
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:24,050
far better than can larger single-crystal
samples, which most often degrade unacceptably,

162
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,620
and in an anisotropic manner.

163
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,430
In addition, powder diffraction lends itself
to time-resolved studies, whereby the projection

164
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,620
of the crystallographic information in to
one dimension can be considered in this case

165
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,140
to be positively beneficial.

166
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,830
The time-resolution of such studies has been
extended into the sub-millisecond regime since

167
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:54,640
the advent of novel detector types such as
the Mythen microstrip detector.

168
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,100
For example, the dynamics of self-propagating
exothermic reactions in nanoscale metallic

169
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,970
multilayers have been followed from powder
diffraction patterns over a 120 degree range

170
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:15,400
with 0.004 degree resolution and with a complete-pattern
frame-rate of 8000 Hz.

171
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:23,120
Let us consider how powder diffraction data
is generated.

172
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,079
Consider first a single crystal which contains
a set of angularly separated Bragg maxima

173
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,400
in reciprocal space.

174
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:38,890
Let us look at this setup from the perspective
of the incident beam . It should not be a

175
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:46,880
surprise that, if we rotate the crystal around
the incident beam’s axis, the diffraction

176
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:57,670
pattern will rotate in exactly the same manner
. Now let us replace the single crystal with

177
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:06,240
a large set of randomly oriented crystallites
. So now, instead of rotating the single-crystal,

178
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,679
which would rotate the diffraction pattern,
the large number of crystallites will provide

179
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,640
all the different orientations simultaneously
- the Bragg spots are therefore swept out

180
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:25,710
into rings, called Debye-Scherrer rings.

181
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,530
Because of the cylindrical symmetry of this
method, all the necessary information can

182
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:41,120
be recorded in a narrow strip of the rings,
that is, along one coordinate, 2-theta.

183
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:49,890
So, in summary, the large ensemble of crystallites
means that some will be coincidentally oriented

184
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:56,400
such that they meet the Bragg condition for
diffraction at a peak (hkl), that is, the

185
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,670
hkl planes of those crystallites lie perpendicular
to the scattering vector Q of magnitude 2

186
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,930
pi/d_hkl.

187
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:12,590
Due to the cylindrical symmetry of this condition,
the diffraction signal forms a set of concentric

188
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,450
cones, detected as

189
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,160
rings on area detectors, as shown here for
the calibration standard material lanthanum

190
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,490
hexaboride.

191
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,670
Although powder patterns can be recorded using
area detectors for certain applications, traditionally,

192
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:40,460
they have been recorded using a point detector
rotated around a single axis.

193
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,679
This can take anything from a few minutes
to several hour, depending on many factors

194
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,420
scubas the desired resolution, the powder’s
scattering strength, and the range of angles

195
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,510
to be covered.

196
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:00,750
Beginning about a decade ago at the Swiss
Light Source, a new approach to powder data

197
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:07,340
acquisition began, in which an entire powder
pattern in one coordinate, 2-theta, could

198
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,620
be recorded in parallel, reducing acquisition
times to seconds, and in some cases, below

199
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,040
milliseconds!

200
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:25,230
A simple example of the benefit of using a
1-D so-called “microstrip” detector, is

201
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,230
highlighted here.

202
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:35,890
The powder pattern of the anaesthetic drug
bupivacaine was to be recorded to investigate

203
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,650
its level of purity.

204
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:46,640
This was performed with both a point detector
(“zero dimensions”) and a Mythen 1D detector,

205
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,419
covering an angular range of 2-theta = 120
degrees.

206
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:00,990
First a short range of 2-theta was recorded
at a rate of 3 minutes/degree.

207
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,419
This was repeated a second time , and the
resulting pattern was seen to be both substantially

208
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:15,570
weaker (here it is blown up in the y-axis
by a factor of 5) and exhibit subtle different

209
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,380
peak shapes and positions.

210
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,040
This was strongly indicative of radiation
damage, a common problem with organic-based

211
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,970
matter, with their on average relatively weak
bond strengths.

212
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:36,190
A fresh sample was then exposed for only one
second using the Mythen microstrip detector.

213
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:42,679
This showed clear differences in relative
peak intensities and positions, even compared

214
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,930
to the first point-detector pattern, especially
in those regions highlighted here in yellow

215
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:57,120
. It in fact emerged that exposures in excess
of about one minute exhibited radiation damage.

216
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,360
This means that a reliable pattern could only
be simply recorded using the 1-D detector,

217
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,130
as the serial acquisition of the point detector
would mean that a fresh sample would need

218
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,500
introducing every 30 seconds or thereabouts.

219
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,810
We finish this video with a brief description
of macromolecular crystallography.

220
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:25,600
A young and ambitious student contemplating
which line of research to pursue for a PhD

221
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:32,700
program could do worse than choose macromolecular
crystallography, or MX.

222
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:39,070
Of the 21 Nobel prizes awarded to studies
or inventions involving x-rays as a tool,

223
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:45,299
nine have been in the field of biomolecular
structure, including all five prizes which

224
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,460
have used synchrotron radiation.

225
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:56,799
No other discipline comes close to the recognition
MX has so rightly earned by the Nobel committee

226
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,881
for its impact on society; it can also be
argued that MX is the raison d’etre synchrotrons

227
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:08,570
are funded at all...

228
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:13,460
Macromolecular crystallography is the study
of macromolecules such as proteins, viruses,

229
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,600
ribosomes, and other macromolecular assemblies
such as DNA and RNA, and is often also called

230
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,470
protein crystallography, or PX, as proteins
make up the majority of the types of studied

231
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,640
structures.

232
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,170
The transition from ‘small molecules’
to macromolecules is somewhat vague, but lies

233
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:39,820
at around a few thousand Daltons (or atomic
mass units).

234
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,680
Some solved macromolecular structures lie
orders of magnitude above this threshold;

235
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:53,169
for example, the 80S yeast ribosome is composed
of 45 peptide chains and has a molecular weight

236
00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:55,809
of over 1.8 MDa.

237
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:01,400
It is the folding and thus the three-dimensional
structure of proteins that lend them their

238
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,910
catalytic activity that drives metabolic reactions,
genetic-code replication, and the body’s

239
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,919
response to internal or external stimuli,
among other functions.

240
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,860
The study of protein structure is, therefore,
of paramount importance in understanding the

241
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,760
foundations of molecular biology.

242
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,950
MX is a form of single-crystal diffraction
which uses the rotation method.

243
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,100
What, therefore, is the justification for
discussing this separately?

244
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,760
As mentioned above, the determination on an
atomic scale of the three- dimensional structures

245
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,360
of proteins and related biological molecules
is fundamental to understanding biological

246
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,410
processes at the most basic level; how macromolecules
interact in a ‘lock-and-key’ manner, and

247
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,630
how enzymes catalyze reactions.

248
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:59,980
The economic drive to synthesize new and increasingly
effective drugs based on this detailed knowledge

249
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:07,000
means that MX-beamlines are the most ubiquitous
in third- generation synchrotron facilities.

250
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,760
Despite this and the burgeoning number of
facilities being built, there remains a high

251
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,460
overbooking factor for MX experiments.

252
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:26,350
Another immediately obvious qualitative difference
between MX and XRD of crystals with smaller

253
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,559
unit cells is exactly that – the complexity
of the basis within the unit cell.

254
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,620
When the basis contains several thousand molecules,
conventional approaches to solving the structure

255
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:47,490
through methods such as Rietveld analysis
become entirely impractical, and other more

256
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:54,100
sophisticated techniques must be brought to
bear on solving the phase problem.

257
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,080
Details of approaches to this at first seemingly
insurmountable problem will be covered in

258
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,250
the more advanced lectures towards the end
of the course.

259
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:10,610
Here, it is merely mentioned that this obstacle
is further compounded by the fact that, because

260
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:16,900
diffraction-peak intensities scale with the
square of the number of coherently illuminated

261
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:25,690
unit cells, and because the unit cells in
MX can have linear dimensions up to two orders

262
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:35,450
of magnitude larger than those of small inorganic
structure, the signal intensity in MX is concomitantly

263
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,970
smaller for a given crystal size.

264
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:48,169
The large unit-cell dimensions also mean that
the diffraction spots in MX are separated

265
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:54,970
by much smaller angles and that many more
diffraction peaks will lie on the Ewald sphere

266
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,049
and thus be detected.

267
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:05,720
For example, a protein crystal with a unit-cell
size of 200 Angstroms, irradiated with 12.7

268
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:14,490
keV x-rays, will have angular separations
of approximately 0.3 degrees.

269
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:23,039
As many protein crystals exhibit a mosaicity
of similar magnitudes, this can lead to overlapping

270
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,700
signals.

271
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:32,480
Finally it is mentioned that the preparation
of protein crystals can be exceedingly difficult,

272
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,610
and many proteins known to be exceedingly
important in the chemistry of life, such as

273
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:44,660
membrane proteins, have, to a large extent,
resisted efforts to crystalline them in sufficiently

274
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,420
large sizes and quality.

275
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,860
Over and above this, the high brilliance of
third-generation synchrotrons and indeed,

276
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,419
the even higher intensities associated with
diffraction-limited storage rings cause these

277
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:07,500
highly valuable crystals to be destroyed in
seconds due to radiation damage.

278
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:14,330
The advent of XFEL radiation and the ability
to detect strong signal from crystallites

279
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,740
smaller than one cubic micron, is opening
up this field enormously.

280
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:29,440
This, too, will be described in more detail
towards the end of the course.

281
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,220
Macromolecular crystallography is the foremost
method of choice when studying protein or

282
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:40,520
enzyme structures – indeed over 85 % of
all the presently known protein structures

283
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,700
have been solved using MX.

284
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,809
The growth of depositions of protein structures
into the Protein Data Bank, shown here and

285
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:55,559
including some of the more seminal structural
discoveries over the last 60+ years, has followed

286
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,630
an near exponential path since its inception
in 1971 and shows little sign of slackening.

287
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:10,850
The molecule on the right, cathepsin B, was
the first de-novo structure to be solved using

288
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,900
XFEL radiation.

289
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,750
What resolution can we expect for an MX experiment?

290
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:27,090
The maximum scattering angle 2-theta_max is
given by the arctangent of the area detector

291
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:34,030
radius, big R, divided by the sample-detector
distance, Z_D.

292
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:40,049
From this, it is a trivial exercise to show
that the maximum scattering vector Q_max,

293
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:49,299
which equals 2-pi divided by the minimum detectable
feature, a_min, is equal to 4pi/lambda sin

294
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:55,250
theta_max, or a_min = lambda/2sin theta_max.

295
00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:04,700
The smaller lambda and the larger theta_max,
the better the theoretical resolution.

296
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:13,440
I sat “theoretical” advisedly, as this
assumes that the scattered signal strength

297
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,610
is sufficient to be detected at the edge of
the detector.

298
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:22,170
But we know that the scattering strength on
average drops off with Q in a quasi-Gaussian

299
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:29,460
manner and that high energies (small lambda)
are associated with a high Q-value.

300
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:36,360
Let’s assume for example that 2-theta_max
= 50 degrees.

301
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:43,669
For photo energies of 5-keV (the red curves
on the right hand side graph), the maximum

302
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:56,230
Q-value is a little over 2 reciprocal Angstroms
, equating to an a_min of approximately 3

303
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:02,480
Angstroms *****. This may be sufficient to
obtain an atomic structure, though some details

304
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,050
may be missing.

305
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:09,550
The atomic structure factor of the carbon
atoms is approximately equal to 4 electrons,

306
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:15,980
not far from the maximum value of Z = 6 electrons.

307
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:31,020
Now we might decide to record with a higher
resolution, so we switch to 12.66 keV (this

308
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:38,350
is the K-absorption edge energy of selenium,
an atom often substituted for sulphur for

309
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,730
anomalous diffraction experiments, described
later in the course).

310
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:58,480
Here, the maximum accessible Q-vector is 5.4
reciprocal Angstroms, and we obtain a resolution

311
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,150
of a little over one Angstrom, sufficient
to obtain a detailed atomically-resolved structural

312
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,510
model.

313
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:12,370
However, at 5.4 reciprocal Angstroms, the
atomic form factor is less than two electrons

314
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:19,740
. Remember that the scattering intensity scales
with the square of f, and hence the trade-off

315
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,390
we have to accept for increasing the resolution
is a reduction in intensity at the edges of

316
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:30,520
the detector by more than a factor of four.

317
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,470
Hence the experimentalist must consider what
resolution is necessary to obtain a full structural

318
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,450
model.

319
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,809
There are several complementary methods o
assist in this enterprise, such as molecular

320
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:45,919
replacement, described in more detail later.

321
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:55,650
In summary, the periodic nature of crystalline
systems lends them physical and electronic

322
00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,950
properties that can only be understood in
terms of that periodicity and the configuration

323
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,820
of the atoms within each period.

324
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:12,120
At the same time, this periodicity provides
the necessary scattering conditions for diffraction

325
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,680
phenomena.

326
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,020
X-ray diffraction is a nondestructive structural
tool with unsurpassed resolution.

327
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,390
The primary obstacle to reconstructing structural
information from diffraction data is the ubiquitous

328
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,930
phase problem.

329
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:33,710
The approach to how this is solved essentially
encapsulates the whole art of crystallography.

330
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:38,809
An impressive arsenal of tools has been developed
over the last century to crack this problem,

331
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:43,990
and in no more a breathtaking manner than
that used in macromolecular crystallography,

332
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:49,120
which nowadays can determine the structure
and provide insights into the functionality

333
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,309
of biological systems consisting of tens to
hundreds of thousands of atoms.

334
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:03,549
These tools will be described detail towards
then end of this course.

335
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:07,370
Diffraction techniques continue to play leading
roles in modern synchrotron science.

336
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,069
Indeed, with the advent of the free-electron
laser, scattering methods will undoubtedly

337
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:17,440
enjoy a renewed prominence, particularly in
the field of ultrafast time-resolved studies.
