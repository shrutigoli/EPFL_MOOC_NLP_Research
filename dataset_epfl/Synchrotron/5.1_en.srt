00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:13,690
Welcome to Week 5 of this introductory course
on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:20,170
Last week, we finished our discussion of the
generation of synchrotron light and its properties.

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:26,029
This radiation as it emerges from the source,
be that a bending magnet or an insertion device,

4
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:32,419
is, to a greater or lesser extent both divergent
and polychromatic.

5
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,590
This week, we discuss how we manipulate this
radiation at beamlines, including the role

6
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,460
of the so-called “front end”; mirrors
and other focussing optics; monochromators,

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:53,610
including the suppression of harmonics; and
finally different types of photon detectors.

8
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,300
This first video is primarily concerned with
the most important features of the front end;

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,370
and then a discussion of mirrors and other
focussing optics.

10
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:09,672
So, let us begin with an overview of elements
of a beamline.

11
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:19,360
The generic setup shown schematically here
is just one possible configuration, but most

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,000
beamlines follow this concept in general terms.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,009
In the discussions this week, we divide up
the beamline into the front end,

14
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:39,520
primary optics, including mirrors and monochromators,

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,080
and beamline instrumentation, in other words,
those components most commonly (though not

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:54,060
necessarily always) found in the experimental
hutch, the furthest point downstream of the

17
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,430
beamline.

18
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:03,240
The purpose of the front end is to “clean
up” the source radiation before it impinges

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,950
on the primary optics and other components.

20
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,900
Its primary functions include monitoring the
position of the x-ray beam, normally at two

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:18,760
or more positions, so that the position can
be triangulated and the stability monitored,

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,750
also allowing feedback to improve this, if
necessary.

23
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,340
In most cases, very high-energy gamma radiation
up to the energy of the electrons within the

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,230
storage ring is produced as an inevitable
consequence of the electrons occasionally

25
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:42,940
colliding with the residual gas molecules
that remain even at pressures as low as 10^-10

26
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,870
mbar.

27
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,280
This radiation, although only generating a
total power measured in a few tens of mW throughout

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,950
the entire facility, is highly ionising and
must be blocked.

29
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,960
Due to the very high energies, Bremsstrahlung
is not deflected by, for example, the first

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,030
reflecting mirror, but simply passes through
it.

31
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,700
So the desired synchrotron radiation (with
photon energies typically well over three

32
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,430
orders of magnitude lower) IS deflected by
the mirror, so the Bremsstrahlung blocker

33
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,980
can be placed behind this.

34
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:24,879
This needs to be made of a block of heavy
metal (typically tungsten) with a thickness

35
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,330
measured in several tens of centimetre.

36
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,680
Only such a dense obstacle is sufficient to
absorb Bremsstrahlung.

37
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,180
The acceptance angle of the beamline is defined
by a beam-defining apertures, discussed in

38
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,270
a little more detail shortly.

39
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,990
Radiation in an unwanted spectral region can
also be removed using filters.

40
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,860
Finally, in many, but not all, instances a
window that is transparent to the x-rays of

41
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,510
interest for the beamline is placed as one
of the final components of the front end,

42
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,860
in order to protect and isolate the storage
ring in case the vacuum at the beamline suddenly

43
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,530
fails, thereby preventing the entire ring
from venting, which would result in the entire

44
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,760
facility being out of operation for days.

45
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,700
Beam-position monitors can come in various
shapes, sizes, and working principle.

46
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,690
The simplest is simply a thin wire that can
be traversed across the beam, which generates

47
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,850
a photocurrent proportional to the beam intensity.

48
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:42,690
This provides one coordinate of the beam position;
the orthogonal coordinate can be obtained

49
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,420
by placing a second wire monitor at 90 degrees
to the first.

50
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,730
Both x- and y- coordinates can be simultaneously
determined using four blades in a configuration

51
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,510
as shown here.

52
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,480
The beam halo is sufficiently intense to generate
a photocurrent in the blades.

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:12,160
By moving the four blades together left/right
and up/down, the difference in the photocurrent

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,660
between oppositely facing pairs can be equalised
using comparator electronics, and the beam

55
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,000
position thereby determined.

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,130
Lastly, a more modern approach is to use thin
transparent windows (often diamond) coated

57
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:34,350
with an array of ultrathin metallic pads.

58
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:42,160
This delivers not only directly the beam position,
but also the profile of the beam.

59
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,030
The acceptance angle of the source needs to
be defined.

60
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:51,220
This is obvious in the case of bending-magnet
sources, as they sweep angles far larger than

61
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,020
typically desired for experiments, as we discussed
last week.

62
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:01,190
Even for undulators, however, the radiation
does not immediately fall to zero outside

63
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:08,650
the angles +/-1/gamma, but instead contains
a substantial amount of radiation, especially

64
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,550
of softer x-rays.

65
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:17,280
Remember, it is the soft x-rays that interact
most strongly with matter, so often (at least

66
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,990
in the case of hard x-ray beamlines), the
aperture cuts this out.

67
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,120
In order to cope with the high heat load associated
with this, the aperture is normally conical,

68
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,880
thereby spreading the absorbed energy over
a larger area, and is water cooled.

69
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,130
Nonetheless, the central part of the beam
that passes through the aperture may still

70
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:49,730
contain an unacceptably large fraction of
unwanted x-rays (usually soft x-rays) that

71
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,050
need to be removed.

72
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,770
This can only be performed using a high-pass
absorption filter.

73
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:04,970
The specifications for this are strict - it
should efficiently absorb soft x-rays (typically

74
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:11,430
up to approximately 5 keV), and will thus
heat up substantially, meaning the filter

75
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:18,500
must have a high melting temperature and remain
mechanically robust.

76
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,750
This heat also needs to be efficiently dissipated,
requiring good thermal conductivity.

77
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:33,770
Essentially there is only one material that
fits all these requirements - diamond (which,

78
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:41,190
incidentally is the best known heat conductor,
even surpassing copper or silver).

79
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:47,350
Thin, artificially grown, diamond windows
are commercially available, and can be brazed

80
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,740
onto a water-cooled vacuum flange, as shown
here.

81
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,440
Obviously, this high-pass filter is not used
for beamlines operating in the tender or soft

82
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,710
x-ray regime.

83
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,660
We now turn our attention to the primary optics
and other focussing elements.

84
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,540
For the remainder of this video, we will discuss
x-ray mirrors and x-ray focussing elements.

85
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:19,610
The topic of monochromator will be dealt with
separately in the next video.

86
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,790
The primary optics typically include one or
more mirrors which may or may not also focus,

87
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:32,110
plus a dispersive instrument, the monochromator,
used to select a certain, normally narrow,

88
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,300
range of wavelengths.

89
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,440
In the second week of this course, we established
that at sufficiently shallow incident angles,

90
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,290
x-rays can be made to reflect off a flat surface
via total external reflection.

91
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:56,020
The upper limit to the incident angle, you
will remember, is given by the critical angle,

92
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:02,900
alpha_c, which is equal to the square-root
of 2 delta, where delta is the refractive-index

93
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,720
decrement.

94
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,260
delta is itself directly proportional to the
electron density rho of the reflecting material

95
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,001
and to the square of the x-ray wavelength
(and thus inversely proportional to the square

96
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,390
of the wave vector or photon energy).

97
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:29,300
So alpha_c decreases as 1/the photon energy
and increases with the square root of the

98
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,050
electron density.

99
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,170
Even the most collimated synchrotron beam
has a finite cross-section, with a height

100
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:44,490
typically of the order of a millimetre at
the primary optics, which may be 20 m or further

101
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,560
downstream of the source.

102
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,700
This means, as the photon energy increases,
the critical angle gets smaller, and the footprint

103
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,970
of the beam becomes longer and longer as one
is forced to reduce the incident angle.

104
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,530
Below an angle (given in radians) equal to
the beam height divided by the length of the

105
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:12,550
mirror (normally measured in a few tens of
centimetres), in other words, a few milliradians,

106
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:20,080
or between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees, a substantial
fraction of the beam will spill over the ends

107
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,710
of the mirror.

108
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:30,500
Normally, fabrication of the x-ray mirror
is limited to approximately a metre or less.

109
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:36,750
This overspill problem is resolved not by
making longer and longer mirrors, but instead

110
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:44,390
by coating the mirror (made almost always
either from silicon or fused silica glass)

111
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:53,060
with a layer of high-density material, most
commonly rhodium and/or platinum, in order

112
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,261
to bump up the critical angle, which, we’ve
just reiterated, is proportional to the square

113
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:03,790
root of the electron density.

114
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:10,360
Mirrors thus commonly have stripes of coatings
of different density, so by a simple lateral

115
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:16,030
movement of them, one can switch from one
material to another.

116
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:24,390
So, for example, the uncoated part of a silicon
mirror has a critical angle approximately

117
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:33,410
3 times smaller than that part coated with
a platinum layer.

118
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:39,880
This aspect of the energy-dependence of the
critical angle can be used to advantage.

119
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,690
When one selects a certain photon energy,
h-nu, using a monochromator at a beamline,

120
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:56,730
harmonics of this radiation, that is, at 2
h-nu, 3 h-nu, etc, will also be selected.

121
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,430
Radiation from synchrotrons is polychromatic
- in the case of bending magnets and wigglers,

122
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:09,860
it is broad band, but also even for undulators,
the maxima are integer multiples (m) of the

123
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,900
fundamental energy.

124
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,680
Therefore, harmonic signal will also pass
through to the beamline unless measures are

125
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,430
taken to circumvent this.

126
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:27,310
Some other strategies are detailed in the
second video this week, but one of the most

127
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:33,580
effective ways to achieve harmonic suppression
is explained here in the context of mirror

128
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,960
reflectivity.

129
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,530
Let us consider a particular photon energy,
highlighted here with the red arrow.

130
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:49,290
If we set the incident angle to be only marginally
below the critical angle for the mirror at

131
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:56,100
this photon energy, then the double of this
energy, i.e., the second harmonic, . . .

132
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,640
(shown here in green) will have its critical
angle BELOW the incident angle and will be

133
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,570
only inefficiently reflected.

134
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,680
The 3rd harmonic (here shown in blue) will
be still less reflected.

135
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:21,520
As an example, a silicon mirror tilted at
an angle of 0.2 degrees will efficiently reflect

136
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,940
8-keV radiation, for which the critical angle
is 0.23 degrees.

137
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:41,600
However, the critical angles for the second
harmonic at 16 keV and third at 24 keV are

138
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:51,240
0.114 and 0.076 degrees respectively, both
above the incident angle.

139
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:01,940
Their reflectivities are, approximately 8
x 10^-3 and 1.4 x 10^-3, respectively.

140
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,400
In some instances, such as in most diffraction
experiments, a still higher degree of harmonic

141
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,500
rejection is required.

142
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:18,540
One commonly-used approach is to allow the
radiation to bounce off a second mirror at

143
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:25,750
the same angle, thus squaring the degree of
reflectivity, which in this instance would

144
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:36,560
be 6.4 x 10^-5 and 2 x 10^-6, respectively.

145
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,990
Before we move on to discuss aspects of focussing,
it is briefly mentioned here that the reason

146
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,730
that mirrors are not fabricated with lengths
much more than a metre is because their quality

147
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,890
deteriorates.

148
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,510
The two main properties defining mirror quality
are the so-called “slope error”, i.e.,

149
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,800
the amount of wobbliness of the surface over
macroscopic distances (typically measured

150
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:16,230
in microradians); and the atomic roughness,
measured in a few Angstroms.

151
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:23,080
This does not mean the surface needs to be
atomically flat without any imperfections

152
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,940
along the entire length of the mirror, but
it should maintain on average the desired

153
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,670
specifications within at least one or two
multiples of the coherence lengths of the

154
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,839
radiation being reflected, which can thus
be of the order of several hundred microns

155
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,640
in the case of transverse coherence.

156
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,910
We now turn to aspects of x-ray focussing.

157
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,610
Before we discuss specific examples, some
fundamental features need to be clarified.

158
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:06,010
The two shapes of primary concern for us will
be the ellipse and the parabola, and, in a

159
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,560
moment, their spherical or cylindrical approximations.

160
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,470
Ellipses and parabolas are conic sections.

161
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,600
An ellipse is a section for which the sectional
plane subtends an angle greater than phi with

162
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,750
the cone axis, where phi is the opening half
angle of the cone.

163
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:35,480
A parabola is described by the intersection
between a cone and a plane for which the cone-axis

164
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,800
- plane angle is exactly phi.

165
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,960
Their mathematical equations are shown here.

166
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,930
Ellipses and parabolas are interesting because,
when using ray optics, they can focus to an

167
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,540
exact point.

168
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,600
Note that ray optics do not represent reality,
as diffraction effects (i.e., wave optics)

169
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,880
means that no focal spot can be of zero size.

170
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,360
Nonetheless, diffraction effects excluded,
these shapes are in principle aberration-free.

171
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,540
An ellipse will focus a point source to a
point focus if the source lies on one of the

172
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:25,910
foci of the ellipse, +/- f’ (the prime is
used here, as this is NOT the same as the

173
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:30,929
focal length, denoted by f).

174
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,530
The distance defined by the reflected rays
between the source and image are all equal

175
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:41,850
in length (Indeed, you might remember that
one can draw an ellipse by pinning down a

176
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,550
piece of string at two point which then define
the foci, and then putting the string under

177
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:54,510
tension with a pencil, and moving this from
one end to the other).

178
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,210
Consider the symmetrical path between the
foci, highlighted here in red.

179
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:06,429
***** This path subtends the shallowest angle
with the ellipse where it is reflected.

180
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:14,940
This angle is equal to the arctangent of b/f’
and needs to be shallower than the critical

181
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,500
angle for total external reflection.

182
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:24,410
It is therefore clear that b must be much
smaller than f’, by about three orders of

183
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,080
magnitude.

184
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:34,980
In this case, f’ is approximately equal
to a, the semi-major axis - in other words,

185
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,670
the foci are exceedingly close to the left
and right hand apexes of the ellipse, and

186
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:49,670
the ellipse is much, MUCH wider than it is
high.

187
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:55,870
Ellipses are therefore excellent shapes for
refocussing a small source via reflection.

188
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:03,240
Parabolas, on the other hand, focus PARALLEL
light to a point, as shown here on the right

189
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,390
hand side.

190
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,370
Although some optics are indeed manufactured
to have either an elliptical or parabolic

191
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:18,910
profile, especially secondary optical elements,
it is technologically very demanding to fabricate

192
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,640
mirrors and larger focussing elements with
exactly these shapes.

193
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,650
Instead, one often approximates the surface
of ellipses and parabolas with that of a circle

194
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:35,740
(or sphere for two-dimensionally focussing
elements).

195
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:46,500
It can be shown, for example, that a cylindrical
surface with a radius R_m equal to a^2/b ***** has

196
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,320
only a very marginal deviation from the elliptical
surface at the symmetrical reflection point,

197
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,650
which was shown in red in the last slide.

198
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:06,930
Similarly, a circle with radius 2f ***** closely
approximates the profile of a parabola of

199
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:14,720
the form x^2/a at its apex.

200
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,520
The geometric ray optics described until now,
in which a point source can be perfectly focussed

201
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,940
to another point, are, unsurprisingly, unachievable.

202
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,650
Due to diffraction, no beam with a Gaussian
profile can be focussed to a perfect point

203
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:40,970
with no physical extent, but instead will
have a minimum beam ‘waist’ diameter 2w_0,

204
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,700
shown here.

205
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:51,580
The Rayleigh length z_R is the distance along
the propagation direction (z) between this

206
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:59,930
waist and where the beam’s linear extent
is larger by a factor of square-root of 2

207
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:10,090
(i.e., where the beam cross-section increases
by a factor of two), and is given by z_R = pi

208
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:19,200
w_0^2/lambda, where lambda is the beam’s
wavelength.

209
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,400
The validity of this equation assumes w_0
remains significantly larger than lambda,

210
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,530
which certainly holds true for hard x-radiation
of wavelengths of the order of an Angstrom.

211
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,549
The depth of field is twice z_R.

212
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:52,780
The beam radius w_z at a distance z from the
beam waist is given by w_z = w_0 x sqrt(1

213
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,090
+ (z/z_R)^2),

214
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:05,210
From this, it can be demonstrated that the
FWHM divergence, big Theta, is related to

215
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:14,870
w_0 and z_R by Theta = 2w_0/z_r.

216
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:21,470
Using this relationship, and substituting
for either z_R or w_0, their relationship

217
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,190
to the beam divergence can be derived, as
shown here.

218
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:33,890
The more focussed the beam (large Theta),
the smaller the focal spot, and the shorter

219
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,200
the depth of field.

220
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,860
As an example, a Gaussian beam of 1-Angstrom
radiation, focussed using parabolic optics

221
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:56,220
with Θ = 10 mrad (0.57 degrees), will produce
a spot size of 6.4 nm with a depth of field

222
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,470
of 2.55 μm.

223
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:11,990
A ten-times more gentle focus of Θ = 1 mrad
can only be focussed to 64 nm, although the

224
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:19,549
DOF will increase a hundredfold to 255 μm.

225
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:26,490
The cost of strong demagnification is thus
an accompanying rapid (inverse square) reduction

226
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,920
in the depth of field.

227
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:38,020
The lensmaker equation states that the reciprocal
of the focus of a lens, 1/f, equals the sum

228
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:46,500
of the reciprocals of the source - lens distance
p and lens - image distance q.

229
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:53,990
The degree of magnification is q/p - hence
values greater than unity will blow up the

230
00:23:53,990 --> 00:24:02,610
image size compared to the source, while demagnification
with q/p less than one, will focus down the

231
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,540
image to sizes smaller than the source.

232
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:17,430
Note also that an m-fold demagnification (q/p
= 1/m) will be accompanied by an m-fold increase

233
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,690
in beam divergence, and vice-versa.

234
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:28,960
This is merely a restatement of the fact that
the beam emittance will remain constant.

235
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:39,070
The Coddington equations relate p, q and f,
with the bending radii R_m and R_s.

236
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:47,450
R_m is the “meridional” bending radius
in the plane perpendicular to the mirror or

237
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:53,140
reflecting element (including, for example,
a diffracting crystal) which also includes

238
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,980
the beam axis.

239
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:02,040
R_m thus focusses in the transverse plane
perpendicular to the bending plane, which

240
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,360
in the case shown here is the vertical direction.

241
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:14,190
R_s is the sagittal bending radius required
to focus in the direction perpendicular to

242
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,320
the meridional focussing, here horizontally.

243
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:29,540
As we should now know, theta is in general
small for mirrors, as will be sine theta.

244
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,559
Hence R_m for mirrors are typically measured
in kilometres, while R_s, which is directly

245
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,600
proportional to sine theta, may only be a
few centimetres.

246
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,890
Focussing can also be achieved by bending
gratings or crystals in monochromators, as

247
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,940
we will see in the next video.

248
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,471
In general, the incident angles on dispersive
monochromator elements is larger, and the

249
00:25:57,471 --> 00:26:05,220
meridional and sagittal radii less radically
different from each other.

250
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,320
A convenient shape for achieving sagittal
and meridional focussing in one element is

251
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,070
the toroidal mirror.

252
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:24,110
This is a cap-section of a ring torus with
ring radius R_s and torus outer radius R_m,

253
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,750
as shown here.

254
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:32,441
As R_m is in general significantly larger
than R_s, particularly for mirrors, the ring

255
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:38,170
torus is very thin, much like a bicycle inner
tube.

256
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:44,300
In general, toroidal mirrors have fixed surfaces
machined out of a solid block of material,

257
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:49,460
that is, neither R_m or R_s can be varied.

258
00:26:49,460 --> 00:27:00,640
Kirkpatrick-Baez, or K-B, mirrors provide
independent orthogonal focussing using two

259
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,210
cylindrically bent surfaces.

260
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,040
This has the advantage that vertical and horizontal
focussing are decoupled.

261
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:17,100
Indeed, it is possible to dynamically bend
the mirrors using a flexor system, thus allowing

262
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,660
adjustment of the position of the focal spot.

263
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:30,370
The separation of focussing into two stages
does, however, make K-B mirrors more bulky.

264
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:38,250
We finish this video with a discussion of
refractive and diffractive focussing elements.

265
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:45,090
Compound refractive lenses, or CRLs, in their
simplest form, consist of holes drilled out

266
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:51,910
of transparent material such as beryllium.

267
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:57,990
The focal length is given by the hole radius
R divided by 2 times the number of holes,

268
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,260
n_h, and the refractive-index decrement, delta.

269
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:11,760
This last parameter is equal to about 2 × 10−6
for Be at 12 keV.

270
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:20,020
Hence a CRL consisting of an array of thirty
200 μm-diameter holes has a focal length

271
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,820
of approximately 70 cm.

272
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:31,210
CRLs have the advantage that they are easy
to align in the x-ray beam, they do not divert

273
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:37,320
the beam axis, and elements can be stacked
after one another to change the focal length.

274
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:44,020
Their main disadvantages are (a) that the
focal length is proportional to the square

275
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:51,450
of the x-ray photon energy, which means that
they must be repositioned, restacked, or replaced

276
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:58,780
if the photon energy is changed; and (b) that
the transmission is in general fairly poor.

277
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:06,630
A 100-hole CRL made of Be, with walls of 100
μm thickness separating adjacent holes has

278
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,929
a transmission of 0.5 at 12 keV.

279
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:19,809
In addition, because refraction of x-rays
is so weak, the hole diameter R needs to be

280
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:25,110
quite small in order to achieve a reasonably
short focal length.

281
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,559
But this can often mean that the beam propagates
through the sides of the holes, where the

282
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:36,970
deviations from a parabola are large, resulting
in significant optical aberrations.

283
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:43,370
Much effort has been made in recent years
to fabricate CRLs with parabolic surfaces,

284
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:48,679
using sophisticated mechanical milling, or
even focussed ion-beam milling.

285
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:55,669
Lastly, the choice of material depends on
the photon energy range for which the CRL

286
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:01,510
is being manufactured, the required focal
length, and the acceptable loss in flux due

287
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,900
to absorption.

288
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:13,010
So, for example, although the attenuation
length of diamond at e.g., 15 keV, is 5 times

289
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:21,860
smaller than for beryllium, its refractive-index
decrement is more than double that of Be.

290
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:28,460
Fresnel zone plates, or FZPs, are diffractive
focussing lenses consisting of a set of concentric

291
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,500
rings.

292
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,520
These rings can either be opaque, in which
case light passes through the gaps in between

293
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,650
them, or, in the case of so-called phase-FZPs,
have a specific height for the thicker rings,

294
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:49,890
in order to enhance diffractive effects by
adjustment of the optical path length.

295
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:55,900
The general approach of FZPs is to design
them so that light being scattered as it passes

296
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,720
through different parts of the FZP will always
have an integer number of wavelengths path

297
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,450
difference at the focal spot.

298
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:13,490
So, in the figure shown here, light passing
along path P_n+2 will be longer than that

299
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,720
passing through P_n by an integer number of
wavelengths.

300
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,270
The conditions for constructive interference
and thus the radii of the rings in an FZP

301
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:27,280
are given here.

302
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,710
See also the website given at the bottom for
a more detailed description.

303
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:39,659
The width of the outermost ring, Delta r_N,
is equal to the square-root of the wavelength

304
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:45,130
times the focal length/divided by large N,
the total number of rings.

305
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:55,039
An FZP of diameter r_N = 100 microns, consisting
of 4000 rings will have an outer ring thickness

306
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,799
of 50 nm.

307
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,600
Such a delicate structure is synthesized by
electron-beam lithography.

308
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,340
Note also that the ultimate resolution of
an FZP is determined by Delta r_N, the outer-ring

309
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:20,299
thickness, and is equal to a value a little
more than this, by a factor of 1.22.

310
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:26,590
FZPs are used when requiring the tightest
focus, and values in the range of a few tens

311
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:32,580
of nm for hard x-rays has been recently achieved.

312
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:39,030
Lastly, it should be note that the inverse
dependence of the focal length on lambda implies

313
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,420
a linear dependence with photon energy.

314
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:50,300
This is less severe than the square dependence
of CRLs with energy, which can make FZPs more

315
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:56,590
attractive for use with unmonochromatized
XFEL radiation, which can have a substantial

316
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:58,440
bandwidth.

317
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,240
The efficiency of FZPs is in general only
moderate.

318
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,510
The theoretical equation for this is given
here for phase-FZPs, where nu is the ratio

319
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:19,930
between the absorption index beta and refractive-index
decrement delta and phi - 2 pi delta t/lambda

320
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:27,520
is the phase shift induced by the x-rays passing
through a ring of thickness t.

321
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,890
The actually achieved efficient is in general
lower than this, as this equation has assumed

322
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,720
that the thin rings of the FZP have zero thickness.

323
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Summarising this first video of week 5, we
have covered the function of the front end;

324
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,429
features of both reflecting an focussing mirrors;
plus a description of compound refractive

325
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:51,740
lenses and Fresnel zone plates.

326
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:59,330
In the next video, we cover monochromatization
of synchrotrons using gratings, crystal, or

327
00:33:59,330 --> 00:33:59,980
multilayers.
