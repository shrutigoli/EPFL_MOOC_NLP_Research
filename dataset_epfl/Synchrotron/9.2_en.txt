Welcome to the second video of Week 9 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we will describe in some detail the methods of molecular replacement and multiple isomorphous replacement, the latter also setting the foundations for how the phase problem is solved in the two more modern methods discussed in the last video of this week, namely multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction, and single-wavelength anomalous diffraction.
Molecular replacement is an approach to solving the structure of a protein by taking chunks of protein structures that have already been solved and testing them out to see if they might be part of the unsolved structure under investigation.
A protein fold is the manner in which so-called secondary structures order themselves in space.
Secondary structures are the helices and sheets commonly seen in depictions of proteins. In the snippet of a protein shown here, I have coloured the alpha-helices gold, and the beta-sheets blue. Although one fold may look very similar or essentially identical to another, this does not necessarily mean it has the same chemistry, that is, the same amino-acid sequence
- two such folds are said to be homologous.
Despite Natureâ€™s seemingly infinite variety, it seems that she creates using a limited collection of building blocks. 1400 protein folds have to date been discovered, and the last of these was in 2008. Although the possibility remains that there could be many more still to discover, for example in the relatively unexplored class of membrane proteins, this seemingly rather circumscribed selection of folds thus lends itself to the approach of molecular replacement. As a rule of thumb,
MR is often relatively straightforward if the unsolved structure shares 40% or more sequence identity (that is, the amino-acid sequence) with the known structure.
So, if one suspects that a structure might contain a certain fold, how does one go about testing this, and also finding out where exactly the fold might sit and in which orientation?
The approach is one of â€œdivide and conquerâ€�, and it uses the Patterson map to achieve this.
Consider the cartoon on the right. A block of a solved structure is suspected to be also present in some unknown position and orientation in an unknown protein structure for which a set of diffraction patterns has been recorded.
In principle, one could then directly compare this pattern to that of the known structure for all possible orientations and positions of that structure within the unit cell. A good best match between the two would provide valuable information about the unknown structure.
Such a procedure, however, would require varying three rotational and three translational parameters with sufficient resolution (given, respectively, by the rotation angles between diffraction images in the data set, and by the resolution of the electron- density map of the known structure). This six-dimensional search is, for anything other than the smallest structures, computationally too demanding.
Instead, we exploit the fact that Patterson maps provide information on the relative distances and directions between atom pairs. We define â€œintrachunkâ€� signal in the Patterson map as being between atoms within the known molecular motif that is being tested, and â€œextrachunkâ€� signal as lying at distances outside this, that is, outside the circle with a radius equal to the largest extent of the molecular chunk.
Importantly, the intrachunk signal depends only on the orientation of the motif being tested, and not on its position in the unit cell. This will mostly affect the centre of the Patterson map out to the intrachunk radius.
It is therefore this central part of the Patterson map that is optimised between the test and unknown structures in order to determine the angular orientation. This only involves varying the three rotational degrees of freedom.
In contrast, extrachunk vectors between atoms inside and outside the protein fold depend both on its orientation and on its position relative to the rest of the structure. So, in the second step, the extrachunk vectors can be exploited in the outer parts of the
Patterson map to determine the translation vector.
By exploiting this property of Patterson maps, the six-parameter search can thus be reduced to two independent, three-dimensional searches of first a rotational operation, and then a translation within the bounds of the unit cell. It is important to appreciate just how beneficial this simplification is. Critically, the complexity of optimization search routines increases not linearly with the number of parameters, but exponentially. As an example, if a one-parameter search spanning one hundred values of that parameter requires one second of CPU time, adding a second parameter with the same range of values increases the CPU time to 100 seconds. A similar six-parameter search would require three hundred years!
In contrast, two three-parameters searches would be complete after only six hours.
The power of modern computers and the ever-growing database of high-quality, atomic-resolution protein structures means that the majority of protein structures are at least partly solved using MR. Indeed, this predominance of MR is likely to increase with computing power, the introduction of novel software tools to automatically perform the rotational searches, and, in a self-fulfilling process, the expanding volume of reliable structural data.
We now describe multiple isomorphous replacement, the historically first approach to determine the structure by observing how the diffraction pattern changes when controlled structural changes are made to it.
Letâ€™s consider a protein-crystal unit cell.
This produces a certain diffraction pattern with its own set of intensities. Now imagine the same unit cell , but in which a heavy atom has either been added or which has substituted a native atom or small molecular chunk. This new structure containing the heavy atom produces its own diffraction pattern , which will differ from the original native structure.
So letâ€™s concentrate on one particular Bragg peak of the original structure, highlighted here . The Argand diagram consists of many vector contributions, one each from each atom in the native structure. We add all these up vectorially to produce F_P, the native proteinâ€™s structure factor for that particular reflection, proportional to the square root of the Bragg-peak intensity . Now, what about the same Bragg peak for the derivative structure containing the heavy atom? Apart from the addition of this atom, the rest of the structure should remain unchanged (this is the â€œisomorphousâ€� aspect, and cannot always be guaranteed).
So we can add on the vector for the structure factor of the heavy atom F_H, to produce the structure factor of the derivative structure
F_PH, proportional to the square root of the
Bragg peak intensity in the derivativeâ€™s diffraction pattern.
OK, now letâ€™s look at this structure factor of the derivative heavy-atom structure. We can rearrange the vectors like this without removing the generality of our arguments.
F_P, F_H, and F_PH all remain the same regarding both their phase angles and magnitudes.
So, the structure factor of the native structure
F_P lies somewhere on the blue circle shown here - its actual phase angle is given here, but we donâ€™t know what this is (thatâ€™s the problem with the phase problem!!) We now add the vector F_H , from which we can construct
F_PH , which lies somewhere on the orange circle shown here. There are therefore two possible orientations of F_P (and also F_PH, not shown here in order to keep things uncluttered).
But which of these is correct? In order to determine this unambiguously, a second derivative structure must be prepared and the diffraction pattern recorded. We can then draw a third green circle with a radius corresponding to the square root of the intensity of this particular
Bragg peak |F_PH2|^2. This will overlap only one of the two possible solutions obtained from the first two diffraction patterns, thereby removing the ambiguity .
Now, the more critical of you might have noticed that the arguments given here are predicated on knowing the amplitudes and phases of the two heavy-atom contributions F_H and F_H2, in other words their magnitudes and angles in the Argand diagram. How do we get these?
We discuss this briefly now.
We redraw the vector addition of F_P with
F_H to produce F_PH once more, including the phase angles . 
We define |Delta F|_iso as being equal to the difference in magnitude between the square-roots of the intensities of F_PH and F_H at the diffraction spot. The angle between F_H and
F_PH is simply phi_H - phi_PH . Now if we draw a line from the end of F_P to F_PH, perpendicular to F_PH, we immediately see that the difference between F_PH and F_P is approximately given by F_H cos(phi_H = phi_PH). This is valid if both F_P and F_PH are significantly larger than F_H, and is also approximately true for relatively large F_H, as long as phi_H - phi_PH is small. For most instances, one or both of these approximations hold fairly well.
So, what next? First, we take our approximate equation for |Delta F|_iso and square both sides. Next , we use the trigonometric identity that the square of the cosine of an angle is equal to the cosine of double that angle plus one, all divided by two. Substituting this into the top equation yields DeltaF_iso^2
= F_H^2/2 + F_H^2/2 times cosine(2(phi_H - phi_PH)).
But phi_H and phi_PH are not correlated, which means the cosine of the second term can take on any value and therefore the second term produces only background noise. This leaves us with the first term F_H^2/2. This is a usable Fourier component. By doing this calculation for all recorded Bragg spots, one can therefore generate a â€œdifferenceâ€� Patterson map of the heavy atom, or atoms, only!!
So, in conclusion, by performing the above straightforward mathematical manipulations, we can obtain the Patterson map of the heavy atoms and obtain the phase angle and magnitude of F_H. This was the necessary information that we needed in the previous slide (which might now seem a long time ago. Sorry!) in order to obtain the phases of the original notice protein structure phi_P.
Letâ€™s now work out a â€œtypicalâ€� order of magnitude for differences in Bragg-peak intensities as a consequence of introducing a heavy atom. I say â€œtypicalâ€�, but this can of course vary hugely, according to how many heavy atoms one can introduce in a unit cell, and how heavy the total native structure is. In this particular example, we assume a molecular mass of the native protein of
50 kDa, while the derivative structure contains a single mercury atom.
As we said already, there is no apriori correlation between the phase of the total structure factor
F_P of the native protein and that of the heavy atom, so F_H will sit anywhere on a circle centered on the end of F_P and having a radius equal to the magnitude of F_H. One possible outcome is, for example, here. The limits of the values F_PH can assume is therefore between FP _ F_H and F_P + F_H .
We show a plot on the left of the atomic form factors of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, and mercury as a function of scattering vector Q. Note that the heavier the atom, the more slowly it drops off as a function of Q. The form factor for carbon at seven reciprocal angstroms is about 28% the value at Q = 0, while for mercury, it is still about
56%. This means that the relative contribution of the heavy atom increases with increasing
Q - larger relative differences in the diffraction pattern Bragg-peak intensities are to be seen further out in the pattern, even if the absolute intensities drop off.
We also assume an â€œaverageâ€� protein chemical composition as shown here.
For reasons which will become clearer in the third and last video of this week, the average structure factor of the native protein can therefore be calculated using this equation.
This is a statistically averaged result based on the assumption that the positions of the atomic form factors of each atom are entirely uncorrelated with the incident x-radiation
- it would be a remarkable and very odd situation if this were not so! In actuality, the real structure factor magnitudes will vary around this value (like I say, the equation is a statistical average). Using this equation for F_P, we can either add or subtract F_H, then square this up to get the upper and lower limits of the derivative intensities. As you can see, this can be large, up to +/- a few tens of percent and therefore very easy to detect. Like I say, though, a larger protein with a lighter heavy-atom substitute or addition will produce weaker effects, while the opposite is true for smaller proteins and/or heavier atom substitutes, or for the case that there are more than one heavy atom per unit cell.
In summary, multiple isomorphous replacement functions by changing the Bragg-peak intensities by addition or substitution of one or more heavy metals in the unit cell. The validity of the approach depends on the heavy atom being able to be inserted into the structure and that this does not disrupt the size or shape of the remainder of the protein structure, that is, the native part. Famous successful examples of using MIR that won the users of this technique the Nobel prize include insulin and penicillin by Dorothy Hodgkin, and myoglobin and haemoglobin by John Kendrew and Max Perutz, respectively.
MIR needs at least two derivative structures, and this aspect could often represent an insurmountable obstacle. Interestingly, when Martha Teeter and Wayne Hendrickson attempted to use MIR in the protein crambin in the 1970s, they were unable to produce any reasonable derivatives.
In desperation, they tried to see if they could identify any differences in intensities between Friedel pairs in the diffraction pattern of the native structure, and serendipitously thereby invented the technique of single-wavelength anomalous diffraction, covered in the next video. It was this, and initially in particular multiwavelength anomalous diffraction, both of which are based on anomalous effects, that would supersede MIR, especially once the use of synchrotron radiation became more widespread.
We discuss these two methods in the next video.
