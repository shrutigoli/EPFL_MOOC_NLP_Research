Welcome to the the second video of Week 5 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we will familiarise ourselves with monochromators and the handling of harmonic signal.
What are monochromators and why do we need them?
Monochromator, often called â€œmonosâ€� for short select a certain bandwidth, or set of bandwidths, of frequencies from synchrotron-radiation sources.
Bending magnets and wigglers provide very broadband radiation, and for the large majority of experiments, only a small fraction of this in the form of a narrow range of energies, is used.
Even the bandwidths of undulator spectral peaks as they emerge is more often than not insufficient for many types of experiments and require further monochromatization.
For example, x-ray absorption spectra contain subtle features that can provide invaluable chemical and orientational information.
The pre-peak in the XANES spectrum of copper at its K-absorption edge, highlighted here with an asterisk, provides information on the oxidation state.
The width of this peak is approximately 1.7 eV, in other words, approximately one five hundredth of its energy.
In order to resolve such features, the spectral bandwidth Delta nu/nu must be better than this.
On the right a typical macromolecular diffraction pattern is shown.
If we blow up a portion of this we see that diffraction spots are only very slightly angularly separated, and would overlap if the degree of monochromacity were an order of magnitude worse.
Depending on the photon-energy range of the beamline and the demands for flux, different monochromator types are used.
Soft x-ray beamlines use gratings, while most hard x-ray beamlines employ monos based on crystal diffraction.
The tender x-ray regime is also mostly served by crystal monos, though can use so-called multilayer monochromators as well.
Multilayer monos are also employed fairly extensively in the medium hard x-ray regime as a means to obtain more flux through their intrinsically larger bandwidths.
A selection of different but representative monochromator types from synchrotrons around the world is shown here as a function of photon energy and periodic spacing, d.
One sees immediately the strong correlation between photon energy and d-spacing.
This should come as no surprise - a high photon energy is associated with short wavelengths, for which one needs a diffraction element of similar periodic dimensions.
How do grating and crystal monochromator differ from each other?
Gratings can come in various flavours regarding their groove profiles, of which three examples are shown here.
Gratings are typically fabricated via advanced lithographic and etching techniques on glass substrates.
Scattering off grating features leads, at certain angles, to constructive interference when the difference in the optical path difference , d(sin theta_i - sin theta_r) is equal to an integer number of wavelengths.
As we saw in the previous slide, typical grating periodicities are anywhere between a couple of hundred nanometers to a few microns.
In the case of a crystal, for which d is a few Angstroms, interference of hard x-rays is between successive layers of atomic planes perpendicular to the scattering vector , which therefore follows the famous Bragg law .
How is the performance of grating monochromators affected by the number of illuminated facets
N_f.
To understand this better, we resort to the use of Argand diagrams again.
We assume that illumination of each facet is the same, and that therefore the scattering amplitude is the same.
How these scattered wavelets add up depends on their relative phase, in other words, how they interfere with each other.
Let us consider first the case of illumination of four facets.
If the optical path difference between scattering off adjacent facets is an integer multiple of wavelengths, the phase difference will be an integer multiple of 2 pi, and the scattering amplitudes will all add up in one direction to produce a total amplitude four times the length of the individual scattering amplitude from one facet . Now let us change the incident and/or exit angle so that the phase difference between adjacent facets is pi/12, or 15 degrees.
The vector addition of the four contribution will begin to curl round on itself and the total amplitude will decrease . 
We see this is still more pronounced for a phase difference of pi/6, or 30 degrees . Indeed, at a phase difference of 90 degrees (pi/2), the vectors will form four sides of a square, and cancel each other out entirely, shown here . 
At pi and 3pi/2, the same complete destructive interference will occur, until after a shift in phase of 2 pi, a maximum is again reached.
Using the same arguments, a similar situation arises when 8 facets are illuminated.
But now, for a given phase difference, the degree of destructive interference increases more rapidly as one moves away from a phase difference of 2 pi, as more individual scattering amplitudes are involved and the vector addition curls round on itself more - the position and size of the total amplitude as a function of phase difference between 0 and 2 pi is shown in the animation in the centre for 8 facets.
The result is that the condition for constructive interference becomes stricter and consequently the interference maxima become narrower.
Indeed it can be shown that the relative bandwidth lambda/Delta lambda is directly proportional to the number of illuminated facets, N_f.
In modern soft-x-ray monochromators, N_f can easily be several thousand and bandwidths comparable and often superior to those demonstrated by crystals such as silicon, can be achieved.
As was briefly mentioned in the first video of this week, it is possible to bend dispersive elements in order to simultaneously disperse the radiation (monochromatize) and to focus it.
In spherical-grating monochromator (SGMs) the grating surface has a concave spherical form with a radius R_b.
The grating grooves, or lines, are perpendicular to the so-called Rowland circle, which lies tangential to the centre of the grating and has a radius R_R half that of the spherical grating.
Any source lying somewhere on the Rowland circle will select a certain wavelength and refocus it at another position on the Rowland circle.
Different energies can be selected by moving the source around the Rowland circle.
Crystal monochromators use single crystals to select a given energy using Bragg diffraction.
The most common crystal material is silicon.
Silicon has a reasonable thermal conductivity, and can be efficiently cooled by liquid nitrogen, in order to minimize the mechanical strain induced by a local thermal â€˜bumpâ€™, where the incoming, polychromatic, beam impinges on the crystal surface.
Importantly, Si can be produced as a near-perfect single crystal with linear dimensions up to tens of centimetres, thanks to its ubiquitous use in the semiconductor industry, where large and exceedingly perfect wafers are produced en masse.
The most common crystallographic orientation is the (111).
Braggâ€™s law predicts that if one were to have a perfect, non-absorbing and very weakly scattering crystal of infinite depth, and a perfectly collimated incoming polychromatic beam, the bandwidth of the selected radiation would be infinitely narrow.
However, there is always some residual beam divergence, slightly misaligned crystallites making up the (imperfect) single crystal (this is referred to as the â€˜mosaicityâ€™), and finite absorption and extinction depths.
These all contribute to a given crystal always selecting a bandwidth Delta lambda greater than zero.
In the case of silicon, the contribution that normally dominates is due to the finite extinction depth, resulting in a so-called â€œDarwin widthâ€� of the Bragg reflection, which results in a relative spectral bandwidth a little larger than 10^-4.
Hence 1-Angstrom radiation, with an energy of 12.398 keV, has a minimum bandwidth of approximately 1.7 eV.
Note that the corresponding width in theta, the Bragg angle is Delta lambda/lambda x tan theta, and thus the crystal also accepts a fine angular range, of the order of a thousandth of a degree.
This leads us to the concept of dispersive or nondispersive configurations in monochromator.
We have already argued that the incoming radiation is polychromatic and divergent to a certain degree, and that the crystal thus selects a band of wavelengths from this incoming beam.
We would therefore expect a range of photon energies to be reflected off the crystal, the lower-energy photons being selected at steeper angles, and those with higher-energy at shallower angles, according to Braggâ€™s law.
These will be reflected specularly with respect to the diffracting planes . If we now place an identical crystal in the path of the reflected rays, we can adjust its orientation so that all of those wavelengths selected by the first crystal are preserved after reflection of the second crystal.
This is a nondispersive configuration.
Now let us consider an alternative setup.
We concentrate to begin with on the central energy, shown here in green . In the previous slide, this was intercepted by the second crystal and reflected back parallel to its initial direction . But we could also reflect the beam in the opposite sense, shown here
Now, what about the other energies?
In this new setup, these no longer impinge on the surface of the second crystal at the same angle as on the first crystal , and as a result, they will be lost or strongly attenuated
. This is a dispersive setup, as a narrower range of wavelengths is selected by the second crystal than by the first.
This configuration is therefore more monochromatic, but at the cost of flux.
A similar effect can be achieved by using a different crystal type or crystal orientation for the second element.
This is succinctly explained using so-called â€œDu-Mondâ€� diagrams, for which I direct you to the reference given here.
There are different types of crystal monos.
A common configuration is the double-crystal monochromator, using two identical crystals in the nondisperive mode.
This not only provides greater flux, but also allows the beam to emerge from the mono parallel to the incident beam.
If the offset in the monochromatized beam is to remain constant for all photon energies, not only do both crystals have to rotate to the Bragg angle, but also one of them (in this figure, the second) must be translated along the beam axis.
Channel-cut monos are fabricated using just one single crystal which has had a central channel milled out.
The adds simplicity and speed to changing the photon energy, requiring a single rotation stage, a definite advantage when performing rapid energy scans in certain types of spectroscopic experiments where physical and/or chemical changes are to be followed rapidly, with as many as 40 energy scans per second in modern beamlines.
The disadvantage is that the exit beamâ€™s height will change as the CCM is rotated, though this can be made to be minimal by making the channel width D to be as small as possible, and scanning over a not too large range of photon energies (which in turn determines the angular range of theta).
Lastly, the problem of a varying exit-beam height can be overcome by using a four-bounce configuration, shown here on the right.
Here, the disadvantage is that this is a dispersive setup, associated with a certain loss in flux.
Finally, we discuss multilayer monochromators.
Crystals diffract x-rays through scattering of planes of atoms - it is a 3-dimensional system, exploiting the periodicity in the direction parallel to the scattering vector.
In the case of multilayers, scattering is produced by a contrast in electron density at the interfaces between heavy â€œreflectionâ€� layers and lighter â€œspacerâ€� layers.
The only required periodicity is in one direction.
Indeed, in many instances, on an atomic level, the materials which make up the reflection and spacer layers may be amorphous, with no periodicity at this spatial scale of Angstroms.
What motivates a beamline scientist to use a multilayer monochromator?
First, the reflectivity can be very high.
This, coupled with a bandwidth which may typically be 100 times larger than that provided by single crystals, means that the flux output from multilayer monos can be very high.
Techniques such as x-ray computed tomography profit from this, as in few cases does a narrow bandwidth bring advantages, while rapid data acquisition can access morphological changes on the sub-second, or even the few-ms time scale.
Lastly, we will also see that the larger periodicity of multilayers compared to crystals by an order of magnitude can lead to refraction effects that can be exploited in suppressing harmonic contamination.
There are several design parameters which determine the performance of a multilayer mono.
We have already mentioned that one requires heavy reflecting layers made of heavy metals such as Ru or tungsten, separated by low-Z spacer layers made of boron, carbon, or a combination of these.
The strength of the reflection is determined partly by the ratio of thicknesses of the thick to thin layer.
Too thick layers means that the x-rays cannot penetrate deep enough into the multilayer, while too thin layers reduces the reflected intensity.
A common ratio of thicknesses is 0.4:0.6 heavy to light , though this can vary, depending on the applications.
The total periodicity big Lambda is typically measured in a few nanometers, while the number of layers is commonly of the order of one hundred.
The total thickness of the multilayer structure is equal to N Lambda.
Making this too large means that the x-rays cannot penetrate to the bottom of the structure, obviating any advantages.
Lastly, the layers should have atomically smooth interfaces in order to perform properly.
The wavelengths that are selected are approximately given by the equation shown here, that is, small lambda, the photon wavelength = 2 times big Lambda, the multilayer periodicity divided by m, the order of the reflection, times sine theta.
This is in essence identical to the Bragg equation used for crystals.
An example of a multilayer installed at the
ESRF BM5 beamline is shown here.
The reflectivity at an incident angle of 1.15 degrees is shown on the right.
Because the reflection and spacer layers are of equal thickness, all even harmonic reflections are suppressed (this phenomenon is called a systematic absence, outside the remit of this course, but an important feature of crystallography).
The first harmonic is at 8.01 keV . The 3rd harmonic, however, is not at three times this value, 24.03 keV, as we might have expected from our equation shown in the previous slide, but instead at 23.27 keV, 760 eV lower . The reason for this is, as I just mentioned, the previous equation is an approximation.
The exact equation is shown here, where the second, correction, term in the brackets,
K Lambda^2/m^2 accounts for refraction effects.
One might ask why this is not also employed for the â€œnormalâ€� Bragg equation for crystals.
First, in some cases requiring the highest accuracy, it actually is.
However, the deviations are much smaller, and this is due to the fact that the wavelengths being selected in multilayers are very much smaller than the periodicity, resulting in shallow angles and a larger refractive effect, in other words, a larger change in angle of the x-rays as they cross the interface between spacer and reflecting layer.
This phenomenon means that multilayers can be used to suppress higher harmonics.
This brings us to the last topic of this video, that of harmonic suppression strategies.
In most experiments, we would like to suppress integer multiples of the photon-energy of interest, though because both the undulator and the monochromator harmonics are spaced evenly in energy, this cannot be done by normal monochromatization alone .
Although we have seen how this can be done using a multilayer, and also, in the last video, by one or more reflections off mirrors, what other possibilities are there?
One simple approach is to use crystals which suppress certain higher energies because the associated reflections are forbidden, in so-called systematic absences.
For example, for reasons of symmetry, the reflections highlighted in red for Si(111) and Si(001) crystals are all nominally forbidden.
I say â€œnominallyâ€�, as their complete suppression assumes that the electron cloud surrounding the atoms have perfectly spherical symmetry, which we know not to be 100% valid - for example, the electrons associated with covalent bonding are far from spherically distributed.
Hence, these reflections tend to be very weak, but not ENTIRELY absent.
Another approach, is to slightly detune the monochromator.
The width (the Darwin width) of each reflection in the family m(hkl) (for example, the (111), is given by w_D = K/m^2 times F. F falls off with increasing m, hence the Darwin width gets rapidly narrower with m.
So only a moderate detuning (and modest loss of flux) of the mono at the fundamental (m
= 1) will mean that the higher harmonics are much more detuned.
Monochromators are the heart of x-ray optics.
This video has been devoted to their description.
We have now covered the generation of synchrotron light over the previous two weeks; and its filtering, focussing, and monochromatization in the first two videos of this week.
We complete this weekâ€™s videos in the third instalment, by discussing x-ray detectors.
