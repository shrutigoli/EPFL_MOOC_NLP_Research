00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,590
Welcome to this module on how to
operate the composting process.

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,520
In this module, you will learn
some more practical or hands-on

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,430
aspects necessary to run
a composting plant.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,840
These are for example: how to get
a good mix of materials,

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,700
why the carbon nitrogen ratio is 
important or how to avoid foul odors.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,880
Let's start.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,050
Composting not always turns
out to be satisfactory.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,700
The process can smell bad, take
too long, attract pests and

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,400
even pollute surface waters when
it is not properly managed.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,870
Several operational parameters
need to be considered in order

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,970
to avoid these problems. The
most important ones are carbon

12
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,700
nitrogen ratio, particle size
and porosity, moisture content,

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,590
temperature and pH. Let's
briefly describe and mention

14
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,250
why these parameters are important.

15
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,240
Carbon nitrogen ratio: all organic
materials contain carbon and nitrogen.

16
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,310
However the relative proportion
of these nutrients is different

17
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,090
for each material. The ratio of
the mass of carbon to the mass

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:20,640
of nitrogen in a feedstock is called
carbon-to-nitrogen ratio or CN ratio.

19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,610
The ideal CN ratio ranges
between 25 to 1 and 35 to 1.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,010
What happens if the ratio is
greater than 20 to 1?

21
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:36,040
In carbon rich materials such as hay,
straw, wood chips, cornstalks,

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,950
sawdust, paper, cardboard, etc.

23
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,040
microbes will deplete the nitrogen
using it for their own metabolic needs.

24
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,470
But what happens if the ratio is
lower than 20 to 1 instead?

25
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,100
In nitrogen rich materials such
as manures, vegetable wastes,

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,380
coffee grounds, grass
clippings, food waste, etc.

27
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,880
there is a surplus of nitrogen and
it can be lost to the atmosphere

28
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,410
as ammonia gas and
cause other problems.

29
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,940
In order to determine the amount of
these 2 nutrients, when available,

30
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,960
an elementary analyzer can be used.

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,610
This gives directly the percentage
by weight of both nutrients.

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,540
The next parameter is the
particle size of the feedstock.

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,500
This is a very important parameter
because it will affect the

34
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
porosity and consequently airflow
within the pile, influencing

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,710
the oxygen level which is key
for the microbial activity.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,430
Porosity is defined as a volume
of pores divided by the total

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,040
volume of compost. Some of those
pores will be filled with air

38
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,090
and the rest with water.

39
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,910
During the composting process,
the volume of a pile is normally

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,990
reduced by compaction and size
reduction, reducing the pore

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,560
size and consequently
the airfield porosity.

42
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,750
These will restrict the airflow
within the pile and consequently

43
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,180
the oxygen level. Therefore, it is
recommended to have an initial

44
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,720
airfield porosity of 45 to 60%
and keep it higher than 35%,

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,330
especially during the active
phase when oxygen is required.

46
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,050
Porosity can be increased by adding
what is called "structuring

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,090
materials" such as branches,
hard fruit shells, etc.

48
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,120
In the supplementary material,
you will find a quick method

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,960
to determine porosity.

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,330
Moisture is the next important
parameter of the list.

51
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,360
The ideal moisture content of
the compost pile is between 46

52
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,690
and 60% by weight. The material
should hold together but not

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,030
exclude excess water when you squeeze
a handful of blended feedstocks.

54
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,630
It should feel moist to the touch.

55
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,510
Low moisture content will slow the
composting process as microbes

56
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:54,100
need a moist environment. However
moisture content in excess

57
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,410
of 60% means that pores spaces in
the compost pile will be filled

58
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,370
with water rather than air
leading to anaerobic conditions.

59
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:07,010
Under anaerobic conditions, oxygen
is depleted and consequently

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,180
anaerobic bacteria start decomposing
the feedstock which creates

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,760
bad odors and generates methane
which is a greenhouse gas.

62
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,630
A pile should always have at
least 5 to 10% of oxygen in the

63
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,880
airfield cavities. This can be
monitored with oxygen sensors

64
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,880
which tend to be expensive. Therefore
we recommend you to trust your nose.

65
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,150
Odors are a clear indication
of something going bad.

66
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,810
How can this be avoided?

67
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,790
Easy. Blend materials with different
moisture contents to achieve

68
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,500
the ideal moisture content.

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,570
Bulky and dry carbon rich
materials can be used to increase

70
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,940
porosity and air cavities. Remember
the active phase when temperatures

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,070
are high. During this phase,
water will evaporate.

72
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,630
What should you do then?

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,280
The simplest rule is to touch and
feel the moisture of the pile.

74
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,590
That will always give you an
indication of its humidity.

75
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,710
If it's dry and if you're turning
piles, you can add water as you turn.

76
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,200
If you don't turn the materials,
such as with passively and

77
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,110
forced aerated windrows,
it is more complicated.

78
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,190
The best is to make initial
material blends on the wet site.

79
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,030
That means 60, 70% moisture
content by weight.

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,140
So that when water vapor is lost,
there will still be enough

81
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,410
moisture to keep micros active.

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,790
In the supplementary material,
you will find a quick method

83
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,660
on how to determine moisture content.

84
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,100
The next parameter
in our list is pH.

85
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,130
The acidity, pH lower than 7,
or alkalinity, pH higher

86
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,430
than 7, of the organic materials affects
the growth of microorganisms

87
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,870
and the ammonia loss
via volatilization.

88
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:56,540
Bacterial decomposers prefer
a pH range between 6 and 7.

89
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,940
5 while fungal decomposers
prefer a pH range of 5.

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,080
5 to 8. Gases losses of ammonia
are more likely to occur

91
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,670
if the compost pH exceeds 7.

92
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,890
5-8. Certain materials such as
lime, potassium carbonate,

93
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,890
dairy manure can raise pH while 
other material such as food process

94
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:25,400
in waste, decomposed tree leaves or
pine needles can lower the pH.

95
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,360
Our last parameter is temperature.

96
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,160
Ambient temperatures affect
microbial growth and activity

97
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,220
in the compost pile and hence the rate
at which the raw materials decompose.

98
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,290
In tropical climates, as in
Indonesia shown here, composting

99
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,950
can take place throughout
the whole year.

100
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,920
In temperate climates, however,
composting is fastest in spring,

101
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,910
summer and fall months and it is most
likely to stop in winter months.

102
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,550
There is however a trick on how
to keep micros ongoing in cold

103
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:01,560
seasons and that is to increase
the pile size or covering it

104
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,790
with matured compost. Then, they
can retain heat and remain active.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,520
Now you know what parameters
you need to pay attention to

106
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,440
in order to produce good compost.

107
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,170
However, what kind of environmental
impacts that composting presents?

108
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,620
That is what we're going to see now.

109
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,490
There are 3 main issues with
composting: foul odors, ammonia

110
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,020
emissions and leachate.

111
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,090
Although bad odors can origin
naturally from the feedstocks

112
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,050
such as rotted food, manure or sewage
sludge, we saw that anaerobic

113
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,310
conditions can play
a big deal as well.

114
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,280
Remember that these occurred due to
too much moisture, too compact

115
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,810
piles or depletion of oxygen.

116
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,560
Replenishing oxygen is often enough
to eliminate these bad odors.

117
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,030
Ammonia emissions which have
a characteristic smell, more

118
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,870
or less like when people pee in a
corner, can be due to 2 things:

119
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:06,190
either there's too much nitrogen
in the material and consequently

120
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,970
we're dealing with a material with
a low CN ratio, or the balance

121
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,350
between ammonium, which is
dissolved in water, and ammonia,

122
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,320
which is volatile, is shifted
towards the ammonia side.

123
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,200
This happens when temperatures
are high or, as shown in the

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,610
figure on the right,
when pH is above 8.

125
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,250
See how the relative concentration of
ammonia increases for higher pH values.

126
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,200
Leachate is a liquid containing high
amounts of soluble nutrients.

127
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,120
This liquid can penetrate soils and
pollute surface and groundwater

128
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,130
bodies, often causing
eutrophication conditions.

129
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,860
Leachate is generated when piles
have an excess of moisture

130
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,870
or when they are not covered
and are exposed to the rain.

131
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,840
In order to avoid leachate, the
location of compost installations

132
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,430
is an important aspect to consider.

133
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,910
RoWSS is  the acronym that will 
help you remember the four

134
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:05,570
things you need to keep in mind:
first, considered providing

135
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,010
roofs to divert precipitation
and keeps stored compost dry.

136
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,610
Second, the site should be several
feet above the sustainably

137
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,820
high water table. Third, consider
the slope of the site in order

138
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,100
to avoid water running into the compost
piles during storms or snow melt.

139
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:27,880
And last, but not least, choose
a soil with low permeability.

140
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,920
If still leachate is generated,
the best is to collect it and

141
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,590
to moist the piles with it.

142
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,900
We arrive to the
end of the module.

143
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,340
In this module you learned more
hands-on aspects about composting.

144
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,690
We covered the most important
parameters that need to be monitored

145
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,280
during composting, as well as the
potential environmental impacts

146
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,440
and how to avoid them.

147
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,040
You should now be ready to give it
a try at home, in your school,

148
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,820
in your university or
your working place.

149
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,770
We would like to ask you to upload
pictures of composting plants

150
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,600
that you have around you.

151
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,860
Try to identify what type of
composting technology it is and

152
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:08,500
make a rough diagnosis of the
quality of the process.

153
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,760
Does it smell bad? Is it the
right mix of materials?

154
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,270
Is the location adequate?

155
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,380
Post your comments in the forum.

156
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,550
In the next modules, you will see several
real case composting installations.

157
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm sure you will find
it very interesting.

158
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,160
For those interested in more
details on composting, we strongly

159
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,960
recommend you to consult the user
manual Decentralized Composting

160
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,210
For Cities of Low And Middle
Income Countries, downloadable

161
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,320
from the Sandec website for free.

162
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,090
This module also got a lot of
input from the second literature

163
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,610
mentioned here, The Art and
Science of Composting.
