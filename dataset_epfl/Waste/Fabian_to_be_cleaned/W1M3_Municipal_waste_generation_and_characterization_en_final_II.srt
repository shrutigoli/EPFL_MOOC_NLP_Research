00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,250
Hi! Welcome to this module on the waste
generation and characterization.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,020
This is the outline of the module on the
things I would like to share with you.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,680
First of all we'll discuss
why do we need this data

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,270
and what do we do with it?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Then we'll look at a waste generation
in different countries across the globe.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,050
Then we'll also look at key properties
of waste, especially composition,

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,360
then we'll look at moisture,
density and also calorific value.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,440
Finally we'll conclude by thinking about
how can we measure these parameters

9
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,100
and what are the important
things to consider.

10
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,940
So first, we need to ask the question:

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,440
what do we want to
know about waste and why?

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,670
You might remember this
graph from previous modules.

13
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,600
That shows the different physical elements
of the waste management stream.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,270
Now, if our question is:

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,300
what measures do we want to introduce
for waste prevention and reduction?

16
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,510
It is, of course, important to know
what's is generated in the household,

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,200
and what can be achieved
with such measures.

18
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,760
If it's important to
know what the capacity

19
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,350
and the number of collection
vehicles that are necessary,

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,140
then it's also important to know
what waste is generated in the household

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,750
which needs to be removed
and collected by vehicles.

22
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,020
However, we want to
assess feasibility,

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,420
and the scale of a treatment option.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,560
Then it's rather important to know

25
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,370
what's entering the
treatment station at this point

26
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,280
in the waste management stream,

27
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,200
and what needs to be processed.

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,550
If our interest is in
identifying recycling opportunities,

29
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,900
then of course we need
to know the composition

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,990
and the value of the waste generated.

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,590
Finally, if we want to estimate
the life span of the landfill,

32
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,020
then it's important to
measure waste amounts

33
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,640
that are reaching the landfill.

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
On waste generation,

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,330
let's look at this graph from the
global waste management outlook.

36
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,640
What we see here is waste
generation per capita, per year,

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,910
and on the x axis we see gross
national income per capita.

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,210
What is clearly visible is
that, with increasing income,

39
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,520
we have increasing
waste generation rates.

40
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,560
Poor countries generate less waste,

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,390
rich countries generate more waste.

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,580
Another way of showing
this is on the global map,

43
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,530
shown with different colors,

44
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,020
low waste generation and high
waste generation in a darker blue.

45
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,780
What you clearly see is
the African sub-continent,

46
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,150
which generally has low waste
generation rates per person.

47
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:23,270
Also, South Asia has quite
low generation rates per person.

48
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,240
So what influences generation rates?

49
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,620
The evidence is not so clear, but what
is certain is that it's lifestyle,

50
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:40,610
degree of urbanization, and what we have
just seen previously, income level.

51
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,620
Let me give you an
example of lifestyle.

52
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,230
People that tend to not eat at home,
and eat outside of their home,

53
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,120
they tend to generate
less waste at their house.

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,580
That's a typical
phenomenon of lifestyle.

55
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:03,110
More information on city generation
rates is available in this document:

56
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,660
"What a waste a global
review of solid waste management",

57
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,590
which can be found on the internet

58
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,800
and can be downloaded free of charge.

59
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,250
What's exciting in this
graph is a projection for 2025

60
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,670
in categories of low
income, middle income,

61
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,420
and higher income countries.

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,580
What you can see clearly
here is that the increase

63
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,450
will be mostly pronounced in
the lower middle income countries.

64
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,860
This is mainly due to a
large population increase

65
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,820
projected for 2025
in these countries.

66
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,810
Now, let's look at
municipal solid waste composition.

67
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,820
These pie charts show the different
fractions in municipal solid waste.

68
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,760
What we are showing are
4 different pie charts,

69
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,630
for 4 different income groups:

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,200
low income countries,
lower middle income countries,

71
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,530
upper middle income
countries, and high income countries.

72
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,510
What we need to highlight is
that in low income countries,

73
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,680
the organic fraction,
is significantly higher

74
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,340
than the organic fraction
in high income countries.

75
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,520
On the other hand,

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,120
packaging waste, paper and
plastic in high income countries

77
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,170
is much higher than it is
in low income countries.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,450
Remember that waste
composition may vary quite significantly,

79
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,760
depending on the location.

80
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,690
You see here the same pie chart from
the lower and middle income countries,

81
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,800
and on the right hand side,

82
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,370
you see the composition from
Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania.

83
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,270
What is astonishing
is that in Nouakchott,

84
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:02,340
only 5% of waste is organic.

85
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:11,190
And typically in the lower middle
income countries, it's 53%.

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,250
So, why is this?

87
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,480
In Nouakchott in Mauritania,
many households have goats

88
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,330
or they have friends that have goats.

89
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,680
And most of the organic material,
kitchen scraps from the households

90
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,350
are fed to these goats.

91
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:35,410
That's why the organic fraction in the
residue waste for collection is only 5%.

92
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,390
On the other hand, there is a
significant amount of "others",

93
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,060
which is mostly sand and stones given
the desert area of Mauritania.

94
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,260
Another example is
this one from China,

95
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,990
where we differentiate
between households using gas,

96
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,330
and households using coal.

97
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:07,250
And you see, the difference is
predominantly in the fraction of "others",

98
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,020
which is mainly ash from using coal,

99
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,910
which then, ends up
in the waste stream.

100
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,350
This example shows how waste
composition affects collection.

101
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,480
This is an example from
Indonesia where waste at the household

102
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,990
has quite a large
fraction of sand and stones.

103
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:38,030
Here the waste collection vehicle was
adapted by applying these mesh walls,

104
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,240
which act as a sieve during transport,

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,080
to let the sand fall out of
the waste collection cart.

106
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,930
Now, let's look at other properties
of municipal waste, again,

107
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,670
by low, middle, and
high income country.

108
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,020
What you see clearly
is the moisture content,

109
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,530
so the amount of water in waste

110
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,490
which is significantly
higher in low income countries

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,310
than in high income countries.

112
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,230
Also, the density of waste
which is due to the moisture

113
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,770
is significantly higher in low income
countries than in high income countries.

114
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,810
Finally the lower calorific value
is lower in low income countries,

115
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,550
and much higher in
high income countries.

116
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,260
So why is this important?

117
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,460
Let's focus on density.

118
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,500
If we use such compactor
trucks as is shown here,

119
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,910
these compactor
trucks compact the waste

120
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,250
up to a specification of
500 kilograms per cubic meter.

121
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,360
Now using such a truck,
under such conditions,

122
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,730
does not really fulfill any purpose.

123
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,220
Because the waste is already so dense.

124
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:12,050
This truck however is very useful
in high income country conditions,

125
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,560
where the waste is very
bulky and needs to be compacted

126
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,700
to efficiently transport the waste.

127
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,520
Finally let's look at another
property of municipal solid waste,

128
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,260
the lower calorific value.

129
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,700
This is a very rough formula

130
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,810
to estimate the lower
calorific value of your waste

131
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,210
based on the
composition of your waste.

132
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,620
What's important is that the
result gives us an indication

133
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,720
if the waste will burn or not.

134
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,210
So for incineration
without adding fuel,

135
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,970
we require a lower calorific value of at
least 1000 kilocalories per kilogram.

136
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,080
If we want to incinerate
and recover energy,

137
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,000
then we will require a
lower calorific value

138
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,020
of at least 1500
kilocalories per kilogram.

139
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:21,470
In this formula, you see how the
different composition of wastes equate.

140
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,920
Plastic equates quite strongly
in raising the calorific value,

141
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,960
while the moisture
content, the water content,

142
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,410
of course will negatively
influence the calorific value.

143
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,250
As an example, now let's plug in the
numbers for a low income country.

144
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:55,120
We have 6% paper,
2% textiles,

145
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,870
and 53% biowaste,

146
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,760
which would be the sum of
wooden leaves and food waste.

147
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:17,710
Then we compute 90 times the 7% of
plastic minus 46 times 60% moisture,

148
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,740
which is a typical
moisture content of such waste.

149
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:30,410
If you calculate this, the result
is a 310 kilocalories per kilogram.

150
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,010
This tells us that this kind
of waste here would not burn,

151
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,520
and we would have to
add additional fuel

152
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,030
if we would want
to incinerate it.

153
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,680
Or, another option would
be to significantly dry it

154
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,410
and lower the moisture
content in the waste.

155
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,230
Before concluding, now let's
think of where and how to measure.

156
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,070
In this module I won't give
you the necessary information

157
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,030
for a measurement campaign.

158
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,320
However I do want to
highlight a few main issues.

159
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,870
First of all, you need to think.

160
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,420
If you want to divide into sub-areas,

161
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,820
that's important if
you want to understand

162
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,980
how the different income
groups affect waste generation.

163
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,300
What you will also need
to decide is on properties

164
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,760
that you want to measure.

165
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,960
What is always important,
is to ensure random sampling.

166
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,740
To get the variation
of waste generation,

167
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,730
we need to sample
over at least a week,

168
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,530
and if possible, we should also
ensure multi seasonal sampling,

169
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,430
to capture the seasonal variation.

170
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,310
So let's summarize what
we've heard about in this module.

171
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,530
We discussed the importance of
understanding what your questions are,

172
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,160
before developing a
measurement campaign.

173
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,420
Then we looked at waste generation,

174
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,220
and showed how it
varies by country, by city,

175
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,920
and how it correlates
to income and lifestyle.

176
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,530
We also looked at composition.

177
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,770
And the general rule is that low
income will have high organics,

178
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,660
high moisture, and high
density, and low calorific value.

179
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,650
And finally, we looked at
some key issues

180
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:43,860
in the measurement of waste
characterization and generation,

181
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:49,830
which is capturing the variation
in the week and in the season,

182
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,090
and ensuring random sampling.

183
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,100
So thanks for listening.
