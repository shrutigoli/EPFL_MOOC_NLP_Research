00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:04,900
Hi.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,170
Today we will talk about the most
frequent solution of waste

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,440
treatment which are
dumpsites and landfills.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,120
Landfill is not a
sustainable solution.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,450
We don't really treat the waste but we
just store it in safe conditions.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,720
Landfill will create long
term effects on the water.

7
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,070
So the surface water or the groundwater,
we transfer to our children

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:39,350
the responsibility and cost to
manage our present waste

9
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:41,610
and to manage this water in the long term.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,440
But the reality is that in most
cases there are no other solutions

11
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,880
and landfill is the only affordable
solution for the next years

12
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,140
and we have to build and operate
good landfill in order to protect

13
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,240
human health and environment
as much as possible.

14
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,790
In most cases after treatment
and even after incineration,

15
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,990
we still need landfill to store
the residues of the treatments

16
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,050
in every countries.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,620
These are not landfills but just
dumpsites; here in Albania,

18
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:27,950
in Peru, in Sao Tome, in
Morocco or in India.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,360
We have the same problems everywhere:
we have fire, water contamination,

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,300
noxious smokes, strong odors, health
danger for humans and animals.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,400
Stability hazards and
environment destruction.

22
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:53,120
Such open dumpsites are still the
world's most common disposal method.

23
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,010
This has to be stopped
and can be stopped.

24
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,400
The first measure to take for a
good operation is to close the

25
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,750
sites and limit access.

26
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,780
It is important that nobody can come
and the animals can't enter the sites.

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,830
Recycling should be made and
organized upstreams in the town

28
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,750
and not in the dumpsites for
health and security reasons.

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,930
Another point is to reduce the
surface of dumping of the waste.

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,890
Every area which is not use has
to be covered and we have

31
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,860
to limit the working area to
a very limited zone.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,630
This will avoid the presence of
animals, reduce their water

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,950
infiltration and reduce the
production of leachate.

34
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,650
Cover of non-active zone is
important, can be done with inert

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,150
material or earthen material.

36
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,670
In any case a water evacuation
system should be realized

37
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,230
in order to reduce as much as possible
the infiltration of rainwater.

38
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,850
Compaction is a key element
for economy and the ecology.

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:11,560
Compaction allows to gain in
volume in the landfill and this

40
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,300
is also a cost reduction.

41
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,760
But compaction also allows to stop
the presence of oxygen in the waste.

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,410
This is the best solution to avoid
fire and limit the presence

43
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,050
of animals like rats or
insects in the waste.

44
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,870
No fire, no smoke, no air, no animals.

45
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,660
Compaction will also reduce
the flight of the waste.

46
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,370
The best for this is to use
specialized trucks like this one

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,220
but the type of each is strongly
depending on the waste composition

48
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:48,860
and climate.

49
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,620
Compaction can also be done with
a choice of the trucks path

50
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,810
in the surface of the landfill.

51
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:02,370
For the environment dumping in
high elevation will reduce

52
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,410
the quantity of waste water or leachate.

53
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,540
The quantity of water going
through the waste is depending on

54
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,160
the surface but not on the height
of the waste so if we are

55
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,140
higher we will produce proportionately
less lixiviate waste.

56
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,100
For that, we have to ensure a
slope stability with a slope of

57
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,530
one vertical to three horizontal
like this: one to three,

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,430
for having a good stability in
the outer flank of the landfill.

59
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,320
It is also preferable to begin each
floor by building an external

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,610
dyke and it is cover like this.

61
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,360
First we will build this dyke,
we can cover it and then we begin

62
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,320
to dump the waste without to be seen from outside.

63
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,590
This will also limit a little
bit the flight of the waste.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,550
Another important point is to reduce
the flight of plastic and light waste.

65
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,250
This is possible by stretching
high vertical nets around the

66
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,230
dumpsite like here.

67
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,690
Or like here.

68
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,600
For dumpsites as well as for landfill
it is possible and necessary

69
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,040
to build gas vertical
drainage, gas flue.

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,760
This allowed to burn the gas at
the surface of the landfill.

71
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:47,580
This can be done very simply
using stones and metallic tubes

72
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,920
which can be elevated step
by step with a waste.

73
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:59,030
Gas drainage system allowed to catch
the methane gas and to burn it.

74
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,350
By burning the gas you also
eliminate the very bad smell and

75
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,310
reduce the greenhouse effect
of CH4, the methane.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,830
It's not perfect but very efficient
to reduce odors and air impact.

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,890
Drainage of the water is an important
point as well as for landfills

78
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,040
and for dumpsites.

79
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,870
There are two very simple and
important drainage systems to

80
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,550
be build, even if not perfect.

81
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
Why is drainage so important
in dumpsites and landfills?

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,140
The reason is simple and geomechanic.

83
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,510
If water accumulates into the
body of the waste it creates

84
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,010
a danger of landslides or wasteslides.

85
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,970
This with terrible possible
downstream dangers.

86
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,040
The first drainage is for catching
the rainwater runoff upstream

87
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,290
of the landfill all around in order
to avoid that a big quantity

88
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,040
of water enter the waste.

89
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,530
The second drainage is on
the bottom of the landfill.

90
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:08,580
The simple horizontal drainage 
in the waste every three

91
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,620
or four meters of elevation in
order to avoid the accumulation

92
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,350
of water and risks of landslides.

93
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,460
These drainage can be made easily
with stones or construction waste.

94
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,300
It's also possible to combine the
water drainage with a gas drainage.

95
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,910
Realizing such dumpsite operations
will largely reduce the impacts

96
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,080
but requires two conditions.

97
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,100
Firstly you need a certain amount
of money for that operation,

98
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,830
machines and manpower and you need
to define an engineer responsible

99
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,300
of the site operation.

100
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:55,170
In a summary, we can say that the
first priority is to organize

101
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,590
and improve the operation of the
landfill or the dumpsite in

102
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,940
order to close the site and stop fire.

103
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:08,310
This needs to name and train a
head of site operator and

104
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,000
to decide a certain budget for
dumpsite or landfill operations.
