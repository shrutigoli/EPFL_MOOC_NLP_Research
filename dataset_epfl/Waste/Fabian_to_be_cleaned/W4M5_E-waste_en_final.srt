1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:12,020
E-waste. What is e-waste? Does it ring a
bell? Did you ever hear that term? 

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,129
E-waste is used to cover all electrical and
electronic equipment and its parts, that

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:22,340
had been discarded by its owner as waste,
without any intent of use. It is also

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
referred to as WEEE, 

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,510
from Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment or electronic waste or e-scrap, 

6
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,950
depending on the region.
Electrical and electronic equipment and

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,040
therefore also e-waste, can be classified
into the following six categories.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:46,649
Temperature exchange equipment, such as
refrigerators or air conditioners,

9
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:55,760
screens and monitors, lambs, large equipment,
such as washing machines, heating systems,

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,510
electric stoves, photovoltaic panels, etc.

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:07,670
Small equipment such as vacuum cleaners, 
microwaves, toasters, radios, etc. And small

12
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,469
IT and communication equipment, such as
cellphones. 

13
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:17,999
Considering the numerous applications of all electronic items, it
is not hard to imagine that the

14
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:22,999
composition of e-waste is very divers. In
general, it is characterized by

15
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:39,860
containing a combination of metals, such
as steel or aluminum, plastics,

16
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:51,659
chemicals for example as batteries, glass

17
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,350
or other substances and materials or
even mix of materials, such as this

18
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:05,350
orange part called flexible PCB or this
green part with many little, small parts

19
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,330
where the green part is called FR4. 
And all the little small parts

20
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:16,980
consist of copper, gold and many other
materials such as silicon, glass, etc.

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,180
Among the substances of particular interests
are a very wide range of metals,

22
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,440
including rare earth metals, such as
lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium. 

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:34,480
Precious metals such as gold, silver and
platinum or other metals such as copper,

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,140
aluminum or iron, which have together
with plastics of the used covers, a high

25
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,480
intrinsic value. In addition, e-waste also
contains many hazardous materials, heavy

26
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,660
metals for example,

27
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:54,390
such as arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, etc.
And chemicals such as

28
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,599
chlorofluorocarbons used in cooling
units, polyvinyl chloride used as cable

29
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,109
insulator or various flame retardants,
such as polybrominated biphenyls.

30
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:14,340
This table shows the material composition of
four e-waste categories in percentage. 

31
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,380
In fact, up to 60 elements from the periodic
table can be found in complex

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,019
electronics. In spite of many of them
being scarce and recoverable, recycling

33
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:25,630
rates are very low,

34
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,180
often due to the current high economic
costs. So, this of course

35
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,900
represents a threat to restore security
over the long term. By now, you might be

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,859
wondering how much e-waste is generated in
the world. E-waste is the fastest growing waste

37
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:48,000
fraction. According to the United Nations
University, the global quantity of e-waste

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,019
generation in 2010 was around 33.8 million tonnes.

39
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,000
Only four years later this value had
increased to 41.8 million tonnes,

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,109
representing approximately 2% of the total global

41
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,350
waste generation.

42
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:13,580
That means an increase of 25% only
in four years. So now, I would like to ask

43
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,720
you to match the generated amounts per
year

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,420
per e-waste type. Can you guess which of the
e-waste types amounts to 12.8 million

45
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:29,370
tons per year? Or which one amounts to
one million tonnes per year?

46
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,620
Let me help you a bit on this. 12.8 million
tons of small equipment are generated

47
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:44,670
per year. Whereas 1 million tonne of
lamps are generated per year. The other

48
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:50,620
e-waste types correspond to the amounts as
shown with the numbers. From the 41.8

49
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,910
million tonnes generated in 2014, only
6.5 million tonnes were reported as

50
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,590
formerly recycled. That represents 15.5%
of the total generated amount. 

51
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,410
The collection and management of e-waste
heavily depends on the legislation of

52
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
each country. However, developing nations
often lack the legislation on this type

53
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,600
of waste, infrastructure needed for
handling it properly or treatment standards,

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,370
which leads to improper
practices, as we will see later.

55
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,330
An important legislative document that also
affects e-waste is the Basel 

56
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:33,160
Convention effective since 1992. The
Basel Convention was designed to reduce

57
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,620
the movements of hazardous waste between
nations and specially to prevent

58
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,140
developed countries from illegally
dumping waste in developing countries,

59
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:46,750
where recycling infrastructure is
typically absent. Depending on the

60
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,560
constituents and materials of e-waste,
this can fall under the scope of the

61
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,610
Basel Convention and be categorized as a
type of hazardous waste. Thanks to this

62
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,020
convention, trading of second hand
equipment and e-waste containing

63
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,860
hazardous materials is legal only if it
is allowed by both, sending and receiving

64
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,060
countries. Plenty of information on the
Basel convention is available on the internet.

65
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:23,290
So, what happens currently with e-waste?
We distinguish these four practices: The first

66
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:29,910
practice consists of official take back
systems. In this case, e-waste is mostly

67
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,120
collected by municipal collection
services, retailers such as stores or

68
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,380
supermarkets or commercial pick-up
services. The collected waste in this

69
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,290
case goes to state of the art treatment
facilities which recover the valuable

70
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,880
materials in an environmentally sound
way and reduce the negative impacts. 

71
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,450
Here, we see the percentages of the total
generated e-waste that is annually handled

72
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:01,470
like this in several countries. This
picture shows an operator in a

73
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:07,139
collection point for e-waste in
Switzerland, whereas in this second

74
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:13,430
picture, we see the operators of an e-waste
recycling company in Bolivia. 

75
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,600
The second practice involves disposing of e-waste in
mixed residual waste, such as shown here in this bin

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,580
full of paper, plastics and e-waste.
Small equipment, such as lambs, USB sticks,

77
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,200
phones, electronic toothbrushes, etc., are
often thrown into the normal dustbins. 

78
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,870
Often this trash is brought to a landfill
or incineration plants leading to a loss

79
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,610
of potential resources and negative
environmental impacts. It is estimated that

80
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,340
0.7 million tonnes of e-waste are 
handled like this in the

81
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,900
European Union. The amount of e-waste
that is disposed of in waste bins is

82
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,510
unknown for other regions. The third
practice involves collecting e-waste

83
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:04,130
outside of official take back systems. In
developed countries e-waste is also

84
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,550
collected by individual waste dealers or
companies and then traded through

85
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,590
various channels. This waste is usually
not reported and it is often not treated

86
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,980
appropriately and possibly it is shipped
off to developing countries.

87
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:26,060
The export of e-waste is motivated
mainly by two reasons. Often inexpensive

88
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,010
second hand equipment and raw materials
are demanded in less developed regions.

89
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,690
However, as the cost of waste disposal
skyrocketed in developed countries,

90
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:41,520
shipping e-waste to regions with less
stringent environmental regulations is

91
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,770
cheaper. Many countries in Africa and
China have been common destinations for

92
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:54,530
such exports. When these trades occur
with material subject to control under

93
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,420
the Basel Convention, this could be
classified as waste trafficking or waste

94
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:05,090
crime, rather than legitimate trade.
Delivered missclassification of waste

95
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,490
types and false declarations of
waste products as reusable products are

96
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:17,230
typical fraudulent examples. This map
shows the main intercontinental exports

97
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:17,610
of e-waste.

98
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:24,060
If you happen to be living in any of
these countries and you witnessed one of

99
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,670
these e-waste sites next to your homes or in your
neighborhood,

100
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,110
why don't you share it with us? Take some
pictures and post them on the forum.

101
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,550
I'm sure it will be very interesting for all
your colleagues or other colleagues

102
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:42,180
following the course. Once this exported
e-waste reaches the shore it is

103
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,830
typically dumped indiscriminately,
spilled accidentally or managed

104
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:51,730
improperly, causing severe health
problems, even death and poisoning the

105
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,960
land, water and air for decades or
centuries. The fourth and last practice

106
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,300
involves informal collection and
recycling of e-waste in developing 

107
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,000
countries.

108
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,540
A big portion of this waste that is
imported into developing countries, as

109
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,810
well as the small amounts of e-waste
generated within this countries is

110
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,960
recycled informally through backyard
recycling. Such backyard recycling

111
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,540
techniques include open burning to
extracting metals, acid leaching for

112
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,600
precious metals unprotected melting of
plastics and direct dumping of hazardous

113
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,370
residuals.

114
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,430
These practices expose workers to
dangerous working conditions that pose

115
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,440
great risks to their health and caused
serious environmental pollution. Lacking

116
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,430
legislation, treatment standards,
environmental protection measures and

117
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,750
recycling infrastructure are the main
reasons that e-waste is recycled in a

118
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:57,290
crude minor. Let's mention a well-known
example: The Agbogbloshie dump

119
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,600
in Accra Ghana is one of the 50 biggest
dumpsites in the world and perhaps the

120
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,140
world's largest e-waste dump. It
receives around 192000 tons of

121
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,820
e-waste annually.

122
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,529
Much of it imported and pollutes soil, air
and water and causes serious health

123
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,460
problems in the lives of 10,000 informal
sector workers, gaining their livelihood

124
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,230
from sorting and recycling. From the
resource perspective. E-waste

125
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,529
is a potential urban mine that could
provide a great amount of secondary

126
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:39,440
resources for remanufacture,
refurbishment and recycling. For instance

127
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:48,459
the gold content from e-waste in 2014 is
roughly 300 tons. This represents 11%

128
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:53,900
of the global gold production
from mines in 2013, which amounted to

129
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:02,930
2,770 tons. Recovery of such valuable
materials requires both, high collection

130
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:09,709
rates through formal take back systems
and high recycling efficiency. 

131
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,980
In order to exploit the opportunities and
simultaneously mitigate pollution, good

132
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,800
policies are needed. These policies
should facilitate the creation of an

133
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,930
infrastructure, treatment standards and
should also contribute to create green

134
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:32,070
employment opportunities. In this model
we learned about e-waste, we saw the

135
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,230
different types and compositions of this
type of waste, as well as the current

136
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,880
generated amounts worldwide.

137
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,860
On the second half of the module, we
covered the four existing practices

138
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,990
regarding e-waste management. Finally, we
mentioned the opportunity that e-waste represents as

139
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,490
an urban mine for recovery of secondary
resource. For those interested in deepening

140
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:01,000
more on the topic, we strongly recommend
the literature shown here, from which

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,140
many insights were taken for this module.
