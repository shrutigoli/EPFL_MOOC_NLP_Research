1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,430
Welcome!

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,820
In many cities of the
developing countries,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,760
the informal sector
plays a crucial role

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,470
in managing municipal solid waste.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,270
In this module, we should look at
that more into depth on this role,

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,710
and also, see how a city can
make use of this opportunity

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,280
to integrate the informal sector

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,800
into the municipal
waste management sector.

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,120
I was helped a lot in this
module by Dr Sunjai Gupta.

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,100
Informal sector waste
workers are defined as individuals,

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,000
or small enterprises, that
intervene in waste management.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,780
They are not formally registered,

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,010
and are not formally mandated

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,520
with providing waste
management services.

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,250
Their predominant activity
is in recycling materials

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,570
from the waste stream.

17
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,840
In the recovery recycables,

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,600
they are active throughout
the waste management chain.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,300
Starting at the household

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,110
as well as scavenging
through garbage bins,

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,170
collection points, or disposal sites.

22
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,670
They extract, process
and sell those materials

23
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,940
that have a high intrinsic value,

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,030
on which they can make some profit.

25
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,380
But sometimes, they also
provide collection services.

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,790
The informal recycling sector
is structured like a pyramid.

27
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,990
At the bottom of the waste
trade pyramid are the waste pickers

28
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,710
who engage in the
free collection of waste

29
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,420
from municipal garbage bins,
streets, and disposal site.

30
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,760
They're often subject to
high occupational risk,

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,780
but also socially stigmatized.

32
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,580
Above them are the scrap buyers,

33
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,860
who purchase or
collect small quantities

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,570
of recyclable waste
materials from households.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,510
Or small shops that buy
materials from waste pickers.

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,960
A new trend for
instance are waste banks,

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,520
where residents can
bring their recyclables

38
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,740
for a price or a voucher.

39
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,150
Above this level are then
different levels of traders,

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,980
including retailers,
stockists and wholesalers.

41
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,950
Many of whom are also informal
and not registered as businesses.

42
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,430
The materials recovered by
this informal valorization sector

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,600
are sold into the larger
industrial value chain.

44
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,500
A smaller amount may be
processed directly by smaller businesses

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,040
or cottage industry, to new products.

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,200
The trade gets more
specialized as it moves up the pyramid.

47
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,470
At every successive level,
waste is sorted more specifically,

48
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,000
and further processed,
here by adding more value.

49
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,570
Here are some examples of these
different types of informal waste workers,

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,720
starting with the waste pickers.

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,210
Scavenging materials at the roadside,

52
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,460
or from the trucks
delivering to the disposal site.

53
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,520
It becomes obvious from these pictures

54
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,610
that this is a quite a high
risk and hazardous activity.

55
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,910
On the other hand, they are also the
collectors of recyclables at the household,

56
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:22,774
often they are equipped 
with their own vehicle.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,940
Such is this example from Thailand

58
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,280
that collects recyclables 
at household level.

59
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,360
And finally, the junk shop, a
trading station for these recyclers,

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,650
but also the location where
recyclables are sorted further,

61
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,010
stored, and then sold to
the next level of trader

62
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,240
in larger bulk amounts.

63
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,480
What is actually quite typical,

64
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,110
besides the collection of
recycled at the household level,

65
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,250
are also formal employees of
the waste collection service,

66
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,630
that informally practice the
recovery of recycled materials

67
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,660
during their collection duties.

68
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,490
As shown here, where you can see
the baskets attached to the trucks,

69
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,410
where materials are collected.

70
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,290
The collectors remove items of value,

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,120
from the mixed waste stream,

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,160
and store them in these baskets.

73
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,550
A study by the collaborative
working group on solid waste management,

74
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,800
in collaboration
with the German Society

75
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,620
for International Corporation GIZ,

76
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,130
conducted a detailed study,
in different cities worldwide,

77
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,880
to assess the importance and
contribution of the informal sector.

78
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,080
Here is a graph, on the average
cost savings for each municipality,

79
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,230
showing 6 major cities.

80
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,130
You can see that
depending on the city,

81
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,650
the cost savings for the municipality

82
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,070
range between 1 and 16
million euro per year.

83
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,500
Major savings relate to the
effect of recycling before collection.

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,820
The savings by
recycling at the landfill

85
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,310
are mostly related to space saving,

86
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,690
and extending the life
span of the landfill.

87
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,090
Then there are also
other cost savings,

88
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,490
which are a bit more
difficult to monitorize,

89
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:18,650
such as the savings due to
substitution of raw materials.

90
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,220
Estimates of these
savings in externalities

91
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,290
are shown here for 3 cities

92
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,670
ranging from 2,4 million
in Quezon city Philippines,

93
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,160
up to 7,2 million for Lima, Peru.

94
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,000
And lastly, it's important to state

95
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,120
that outsourcing to waste pickers cooperatives,

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,480
wherever they exist,

97
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,900
is often cheaper than involving
formal private public partnerships,

98
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,670
or private sector involvement.

99
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,310
Study from Mumbai showed
that the informal sector

100
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,160
is 20% cheaper than
the municipal services,

101
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,000
while the private
sector is only 6% cheaper.

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,790
Besides the cost savings for
the municipality, of course,

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,530
the informal sector is an
important source of livelihood

104
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,030
for millions of people.

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,890
It is estimated that worldwide,

106
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:21,120
nearly 15 million people work in
the informal waste management sector.

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,100
This graph shows the number
of informal waste workers,

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,210
as compared to those
employed in the formal sector

109
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,040
for some selected cities.

110
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,390
Of course, variations can be
quite large depending on the city,

111
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,570
and on the context.

112
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,350
But just look at Cairo, as an example,

113
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,740
where 33000 people are
working in the informal sector,

114
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,570
as compared to 8800
in the formal sector.

115
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,550
This is a factor of 3,7.

116
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,140
This informal sector recovers
significant amounts of the waste stream.

117
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,070
Earnings of this informal
sector can vary significantly,

118
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,900
depending on the type of
activity, the people engaged in.

119
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,340
Typically though, waste picking is the
lowest paid part of the recycling chain.

120
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,580
But even here, like in
this example from Brazil,

121
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,950
a study showed that 1/3 of the waste pickers earn the minimum wage,

122
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:28,430
or slightly above, while more than half
earn up to 4 times the minimum wage.

123
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,520
Attitudes of municipal authorities 
towards the informal sector

124
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,640
differ from place to place.

125
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,830
In some places there is hostility, in
others indifference, and in some places,

126
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,500
they are regarded as a useful
part of the waste management system,

127
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,170
and are given the opportunity
to enhance their livelihoods.

128
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,360
The role of the
municipality is critical,

129
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,970
to mobilizing the informal sector,
and organizing the recycling sector.

130
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,120
The first way to
upgrade the informal sector

131
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,720
would be to integrate them
into the city's masterplan.

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,260
But also integrate them into
collecting waste at source,

133
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,800
with the right over recyclables,

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,050
and a guarantee of
regular access to waste.

135
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,260
In a recent development,
waste picker cooperatives

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,800
had been formed by the informal
sector, workers, in many countries,

137
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,770
with the help of
non-governmental organization,

138
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,610
municipalities, and donor agencies.

139
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,830
These workers undertake
some formal work under contract

140
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:43,020
to municipal authorities, while also
being involved in informal recycling.

141
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,110
Thus in this respect
making their roles semi-formal.

142
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,490
Now let's look at some examples how
the informal sector was integrated.

143
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,530
Brazil is one of the
world's most progressive countries

144
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,330
in integrating waste pickers in
solid waste management system.

145
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:04,750
And Belo Horizonte has
led the way in this effort.

146
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,760
Already back in 1993,
the city put a focus

147
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,280
on promoting
segregation at the source,

148
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,000
and started integrating 
the informal sector,

149
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,800
by helping to develop cooperatives, 
and guide them throughout,

150
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,880
towards material recovery 
close to the household,

151
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,400
instead of waste
scavenging at the landfill.

152
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,320
In Belo Horizonte, there are an estimated
2700 informal waste workers in the city.

153
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,730
With the assistance
of the municipality,

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,490
8 different cooperatives were created.

155
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,320
For these cooperatives, warehouses
are provided by the municipality.

156
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,160
Here, the materials are processed,
before moving up the recycling chain.

157
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,190
All cooperatives were
provided with scales,

158
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,840
personal protection equipment, 
and big bags for storage.

159
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:08,140
Since 2001 Brazil has even included
"catador de material reciclado".

160
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,700
Sorry for that terrible
Portuguese pronunciation,

161
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,370
which stands for
collector of recyclables,

162
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,340
as a formal profession in the
Brazilian occupation classification.

163
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,900
Another example of a successful
integration of the informal sector

164
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,050
is the SWACH cooperative in Pune, India.

165
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,500
SWACH is a wholly owned
cooporative of waste pickers.

166
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,940
It started off as a 2 year
pilot project from 2005 to 2007

167
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,000
that carefully tested and
established the workability of this model.

168
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,230
Then, in 2008 SWACH then entered
into a memorandum of understanding,

169
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,500
with the Pune municipal corporation, 
to collect waste, door to door,

170
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,100
and this was an important
milestone for the waste pickers.

171
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,650
The scope of SWACH
includes collection,

172
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,430
resource recovery,
trade and waste processing.

173
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,290
And it is conceived as an
autonomous social enterprise.

174
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,900
It is in close contact with the clients
and residents by providing this service,

175
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,250
and it also operates a
helpline for feedback and complaints.

176
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,060
Currently, through its 1867 members,

177
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,280
with 80% of the members being women,

178
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,450
it provides service to the
1,5 million people of Pune.

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,730
The cooperative is overseen 
by a governing board

180
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,890
that has 14 waste picker 
members on the board,

181
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,860
2 representatives of the
Pune municipal corporation,

182
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,610
and 2 members of the
trade union of waste pickers.

183
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,340
Data has shown that
waste reaching the landfill

184
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:04,490
has been reduced by more
than 55%, or 320 tons per day.

185
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,410
So let me summarize what we
have covered in this module.

186
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,710
We have looked at the
significant role of the informal sector

187
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,020
recovering up to 30%
of the waste stream.

188
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,400
We also looked at the cost
savings for the municipality,

189
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,280
up to 16 million euro per year
for the example of Lima, Peru.

190
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,090
Waste recycling provides up
to 2% source of livelihood

191
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,290
for the urban poor.

192
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,990
And recycling happens
all along the waste chain.

193
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,960
One can estimate one job
for each ton recovered.

194
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,470
What's also important is
that work conditions and income

195
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:52,680
improve when recycling is closer
to the source of waste generation

196
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,700
or formalized, for instance, 
through cooperatives.

197
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,080
Thank you for listening.
