00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,810
Hi and welcome to this module on 
thermochemical conversion of biomass!

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:13,360
In this module we will introduce the most
common thermochemical processes used to

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,460
treat biomass. These are pyrolysis, gasification
and combustion. These technologies can be

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,269
technically complex and expensive.
However, we will focus only on cases and

5
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:31,439
examples that are existing in
developing countries. So, what is a

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,370
thermochemical conversion. Thermochemical
conversion implies exposing biomass to

7
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,110
high temperatures between 200 and 1500
degrees Celsius. These high temperatures

8
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:48,000
together with other parameters such as
oxygen supply, use of catalysts, time and

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,870
pressure decompose and depolymerize
biomass into either intermediaries, which

10
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,239
are used later to synthesize
more complex products or into its

11
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,040
simplest constituents such as water and
CO2. Let's briefly describe some basics

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,890
of each technology. We will start with
drying, although drying is not a

13
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,190
thermochemical processes on its own.
Feedstocks need to be dried before being

14
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:20,630
processed. This occurs at temperatures
up to 100 degrees. Pyrolysis is not only

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,520
an independent process but the core
reaction of all thermal processes. It is

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,520
the first step in the gasification and
combustion process. Pyrolysis occures

17
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,510
when biomass is thermally decomposed at
temperatures between 300 and 600 in the

18
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:41,670
absence of oxygen. The absence of oxygen
can also be explained by lambda which is

19
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,550
the little figure that you see there. 
Lambda is the ratio between the oxygen supply

20
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,280
to the thermal process and the oxygen
required for complete

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,160
combustion of all organic compounds. In this
case, therefore, lambda is 0. Broadly

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,090
speaking, two types of pyrolysis can be
distinguished slow pyrolysis and fast

23
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:09,489
pyrolysis. These vary on several
process conditions: Retention times for

24
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,600
instance are around one second for fast
pyrolysis and can last several days for

25
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,280
slow pyrolysis. 

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,760
The process results into solids, namely
char, liquids called bio-oil and a

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,500
mixture of gases, some of which are
fuel-gases also called pyrogas and

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,069
some of which are combustion gases, such
as CO2 and water vapor. The relative

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:36,890
proportion of the output materials
depends on the process conditions. In

30
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:42,690
slow pyrolysis approximately 35% of the
input is turned into char. 30%

31
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:49,640
into bio-oil and 35% into gases.
Whereas fast pyrolysis obtains much

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,590
more liquids.

33
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:56,090
Around 75% of the input, and lower solid
and gases 12 and 30%

34
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,630
respectively.

35
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:03,930
The reaction after reaching 280 degrees
Celsius becomes exothermic and generates

36
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,410
heat. Torrefaction is a form of mild
pyrolysis, which occures at 

37
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,700
290 degrees Celsius and lasts for 10
to 60 minutes. 80% of the

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,100
input is turned into a solid product of
higher homogeneity and increased energy

39
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:25,540
density compared to the input material.
The rest becomes gas. Let's move forward.

40
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,850
Gasification is our next process on the
list. This thermal conversion of organic

41
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,900
material takes place at elevated
temperatures, above 750 degrees Celsius

42
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:42,500
with a partial supply of oxygen. Lambda
ranging between 0.2 and 0.5. Retention

43
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,750
times are short, ranging between seconds
and minutes. In this process,

44
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,890
85% of the input material is 
then converted into a

45
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,239
mixture of permanent gases. Carbon
monoxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen,

46
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,100
also called syngas or producer gas.
Char would represent only 10% of the

47
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,359
output, whereas liquids would only be
5% consisting mainly of water

48
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:12,220
and condesables as minor products.
Combustion is our last process.

49
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,690
Combustion occures at higher temperatures
over 700 degrees Celsius in the presence

50
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,789
of oxygen being lambda higher than one.
Burning is how you and me would normally

51
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,020
refer to this process.

52
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,670
Combustion is the oldest way of using
biomass and accounts for over

53
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,760
97% of the world's bioenergy production. 
During combustion,

54
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,270
organic matter is decomposed to produce
mainly gases carbon dioxide and water

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,390
vapor, as well as ashes. The chemical
energy is released as heat. In the ternary

56
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,120
diagram, we can see how thermochemical
processes shift materials in different

57
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,640
directions based on the relative content
of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. We see

58
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,030
where biomass is located here in the middle.
Slow pyrolysis for instance

59
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,400
increases the relative carbon content
shifting the biomass towards the black

60
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,330
area. Char is a solid product. On the other
hand, oxidation or combustion mainly yield

61
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,880
gaseous products such as CO2 and water,
which can also be seen here in the diagram. 

62
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,500
Time for some clarification: We saw that
char is one of the output products of

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:30,940
these processes. But char, charcoal, 
biochar. Did you ever hear these terms? 

64
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:36,240
Do you actually know what they mean? Let's
see what are their differences. The

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,290
term char is generally used for the 
solid product obtained from the thermal

66
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,490
decomposition of any biomass, which has a
higher heating value of approximately 25

67
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,860
to 28 megajoules per kilogram. When
char is obtained from less bulky 

68
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,390
biomass, such as leaves, small branches,
plant seeds, coconut shells, etc.,

69
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,650
the final output might be too dusty to
be burnt directly, as the one seen 

70
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,690
in the movie. And therefore it requires
briquetting. Briquettes have a lower calorific

71
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:12,610
value due to binding materials used. When
the biomass is wood, the material

72
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,840
obtained through the same process, is
called charcoal. Charcoal is mainly used

73
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,650
as fuel for cooking or industrial
processes, as it has a high heating value

74
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,350
of 31 to 33 megajoules per kilogram,
much higher than the others. Most of the times

75
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,120


76
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,190
charcoal does not require any
post-processing. Char can also be used

77
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:39,880
as soil-amendment, in which case it's called
biochar. This is the core idea of the

78
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,689
Terra Petra Movement.

79
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:48,369
So, what products can we obtain from
these thermochemical processes? We've

80
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:52,360
seen that the primary products are
char, bio-oil, fuel, gas and heat.

81
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,349
For char, we talked about 3 market
products that we can obtain: charcoal,

82
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:02,349
briquettes and biochar. Char can also
be refined into biofuel or other

83
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,389
chemicals. Bio-oil and fuel gases can be
upgraded through refinery in order to

84
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:14,110
synthesize other chemical compounds, or 
to be used as biofuels. They could also

85
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,449
be consumed in turbines engines or
boilers and produce electricity and heat.

86
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,169
The heat obtained from combustion can be
used in boilers to obtain electricity or

87
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,629
directly commercialized. Thermochemical
conversions are therefore promising,

88
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:33,360
considering the growing challenge of
waste disposal and fossil fuels.

89
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,809
Being aware that biomass represents the
biggest waste fraction in developing

90
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:43,459
countries, these processes might represent 
opportunities to valorize it.

91
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:46,909
How are these processes currently being used
to treat waste in developing countries?

92
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,639
From the ones explained before, we will
mainly focus on two: slow pyrolysis and

93
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,969
combustion, since they are the ones that
are being used. Let's have a closer look to them. 

94
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:04,809
Did you know that carbonization or char
making is a slow pyrolysis process?

95
00:08:04,809 --> 00:08:09,779
We humans have produced char since the
dawn of civilization. In developing countries

96
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:10,599


97
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:14,999
this is still a very extended practice
as it consists the main source for

98
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:20,569
cooking fuel. 80 to 90% of
urban households in sub-saharan Africa

99
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:26,649
for instance use charcoal for cooking
and heating. Charcoal production in

100
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:33,550
Africa was 29 million tons in 2011. This
table here shows some big charcoal

101
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,629
producers in the world. Although urban
biowaste represents a potential feedstock

102
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:43,979
for charcoal production, the majority of the
charcoal is derived from wood, which

103
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,339
substantially contributes to deforestation.
Let's have a closer look to the

104
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:51,030
charring process.

105
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,560
This figure here illustrates the changes
in weight, volume and heating value after

106
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,970
slow pyrolysis of wood to charcoal. We see
that the weight is reduced to 20%,

107
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:09,310
the volume to 50% and heating value is
doubled. During carbonization, materials

108
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,210
are dehydrated and deoxygenated,
resulting in a decrease of the hydrogen

109
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:20,480
carbon ratio and oxygen carbon ratio.
The Van Krevelen diagram is used to

110
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,030
depict this. On the horizontal axis, we see
the oxygen to carbon ratio and on the

111
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:31,420
vertical axis the hydrogen carbon ratio. 
These areas show where biomass and

112
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,680
other solid fuels are located according
to these ratios. Carbonization will

113
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,210
shift the values of the regional
biomass in this direction. The length

114
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,760
of the arrow between input and output
ratios indicates the intensity of the

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,800
process. The bigger the intensity, the
more oxygen and hydrogen that are lost,

116
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,680
lowering the ratios and the better fuel
properties that output material has. 

117
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,870
This graph shows the impact of temperature on
a solid yield. The lower the temperature,

118
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,690
the higher the solid yield, which is partly due
to higher volatile matter content. 

119
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,580
With higher temperatures more volatile matter
is degraded, reducing the solid yield,

120
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,120
but obtaining a cleaner and preferable
fuel. High content of volatile matter

121
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,370
in char, over 40%, is
undesirable. Volatile matter facilitates

122
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:29,740
ignition but produces noxious fumes
when burnt. The input requirements depend

123
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,520
on the final use of the product. Either
if it's for domestic use or industrial use.

124
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,940
In any case, having moisture content
lower than 10% is a requirement, which

125
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,230
means that fresh biomass often needs to
be dried beforehand. Feedstocks with high

126
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,100
fixed carbon content are preferred, as
fixed carbon provides an approximation

127
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,860
of the possible char yield that we're going to
get. While feedstocks with a high ash

128
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,210
content like rice husks for example or
contaminated with inert material such as

129
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,500
sand, produce char with very high ash
content.

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,830
And this lowers the heating value of the char.
How do we know when the reaction is

131
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,030
finished? Look at the smoke. In
traditional charcoal making, three stages

132
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:18,330
can be characterized based on the color
of the smoke emitted. Drying white smoke,

133
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,540
pyrolysis yellow smoke, and process
completion of char or combustion blue smoke.

134
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,170
Pyrolysis technology can look very fancy but
actually the vast majority of the

135
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,390
reactors in developing countries are
simple and functional. In this video we

136
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:39,850
see how cardboard is carbonized in a drum. 
The drum is closed after igniting 

137
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:44,250
the material. Part of the material will
be combusted to provide the heat

138
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,120
required to pyrolyze the rest. At the end,
we can appreciate the volume reduction

139
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,570
and the carbonized cardboard at the bottom
of the drum. Ok, so we are finished with

140
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:59,480
pyrolysis. Let's say now a couple of
words about combustion. Combustion is a

141
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,800
waste management method spread out
all around the world.

142
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,730
Incineration plants for example will
combust waste in order to reduce its

143
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,280
volume and obtain energy from it.

144
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,540
However, open burning of waste is a very
common practice, especially in low and

145
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,400
middle-income countries. Open burning is any
open flame exposed to the environment,

146
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,260
where pollutants produced from the fire
are emitted directly into the

147
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,260
surrounding air. Many people in
developing countries have burned

148
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,280
trash for generations. People often burn
because there is no other way to get rid of their trash. 

149
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,350
In this module we learned the 
three main thermochemical

150
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,660
processes, which are: pyrolysis,
gasification and combustion. We also had

151
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,300
a closer look, especially on slow
pyrolysis, but also a bit on open burning

152
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,530
as two common waste practices in
developing countries. 

153
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,450
For those interested in getting more insights
about carbonization in low- and

154
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,680
middle-income countries, we recommend
this report, which is available for free

155
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,190
on the internet.
