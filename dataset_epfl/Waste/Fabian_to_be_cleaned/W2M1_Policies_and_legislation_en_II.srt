00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,520
Hi, and welcome to the
second week of modules

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,560
on municipal solid waste
management in developing countries.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,010
In the second week, we will be
covering the governance aspects

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:17,330
of the integrated sustainable
waste management framework.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,580
This graph shows a simplified
overview of the various stakeholders,

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,390
and the functions in the
waste management system.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,410
In this first module, we will start
with the issues around policy making,

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,580
legislation, and regulation.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,930
If you're a lawyer, you
will really enjoy this.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,570
If you're an engineer,
go fetch a coffee!

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,000
For municipal waste governance,

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,970
formulation of policies
and their translation

13
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:49,884
into legislation
and regulations,

14
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,054
are the backbone of
waste management.

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,400
Policies are based on
goals and guiding principles.

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,560
For waste management, the general
goals behind the policy formulation

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,230
include the protection of
public health and the environment,

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,170
as well as the recovery
of resource value

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:11,280
from discarded products
and waste materials.

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,940
The guiding principles in
the waste policies may vary,

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,150
and may include several of
the following in this list.

22
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,330
These guiding principles may not
necessarily be mutually consistent

23
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,420
or compatible among each other.

24
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,810
Hence, translating this into
instruments may require more clarification

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,040
and further setting of priorities.

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,390
One example is the concept
of the waste hierarchy,

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,690
which highlights the most preferred
action at the top, avoiding waste,

28
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:50,240
then down to the least preferred
action, of disposal in landfills.

29
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,101
Policies and strategies
are given flesh

30
00:01:54,326 --> 00:01:56,980
through their translation
into legislation.

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,370
But laws and regulations
and their enforcement

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,090
are just one way to support
implementation of policy strategies.

33
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,180
Other instruments for example,
that can help support implementation,

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,480
are instruments of social
mobilization, or economic instruments,

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,600
such as incentives or disincentives.

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,530
Depending on the goal, a mix of
these instruments can be used.

37
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,760
Typical social instruments
are awareness raising,

38
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,690
for instance used to combat littering,

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,180
or in general to change
perceptions and behavior.

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,240
Also economic instruments can be
used to achieve certain policy goals.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,873
In Bangladesh for instance,

42
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:47,440
the government developed
3 economic instruments:

43
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,770
the first is tax holidays for 5 to 10 years
for all formal waste treatment facilities.

44
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,190
Second, less important duties on
relevant waste management equipment,

45
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,890
and third, no VAT or sales
tax on the sales of compost.

46
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,170
All such policy instruments
are prepared or implemented

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,580
by various governmental agencies.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,570
An inclusive governance
system however,

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,490
seeks agreement to plant processes
and practices with all stakeholders

50
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,120
in a participatory
decision-making process.

51
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,780
Legislation and regulation
can be used to give effect

52
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,510
to any aspect of a
waste management policy.

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,113
Usually, the bottom line is set

54
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:39,780
as to protect human health and
the environment.

55
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,220
Here, we can distinguish
between 2 approaches,

56
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,350
either regulate
specification or function.

57
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,390
Let me explain this briefly.

58
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,330
Regulating by specification
may only define, for instance,

59
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,620
accepted technologies
of waste treatment,

60
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,300
or define specific ways of
how a waste treatment facility

61
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,670
must be constructed or operated.

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,380
For instance, what type of landfill
liner needs to be used in landfills.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,970
The other approach is
to regulate by function,

64
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,030
which prescribes standards to
which a technology has to perform.

65
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,119
In the case of the
landfill liner,

66
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:26,180
it is not the type of landfill
liner that is defined,

67
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,710
but rather the required
permeability of the liner,

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,590
leaving flexibility to
what technology is used.

69
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,110
And just staying on the issue
of landfill design and operation,

70
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,610
let me share with you this very
interesting example from South Africa.

71
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,875
South Africa established
minimum requirements

72
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,398
for waste
disposal by landfill,

73
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,870
and you see the document
shown here,

74
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:56,840
which facilitate the enforcement
of the landfill permitting system,

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,830
as provided in the
Environment Conservation Act.

76
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,320
The basic rule decides on
the minimum requirement,

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,190
but what is interesting, is that since
site specific conditions may vary,

78
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:16,150
provision is made for a defensible
flexibility in the requirements.

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,610
A classification system was developed,

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,750
where landfills can be
differentiated into different classes.

81
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,380
This is the table of landfill classes.

82
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:31,360
You see distinction of
2 types of landfills:

83
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,020
general waste and hazardous waste.

84
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,040
Then, in the class of general waste,

85
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,250
a further classification is
based on the size of the landfill.

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,300
And then, in each of these sizes,

87
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,680
there is further classification
of leachate production,

88
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,840
which derives from an
estimation of the factor B,

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,810
which is the climatic water balance,

90
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,750
which is the difference
between rainfall and evaporation,

91
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,790
for the wet season of
the wettest year on record.

92
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:09,000
Based on this classification, one can then
determine the requirements here shown,

93
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:13,010
for instance, if the landfill
requires a responsible person,

94
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,130
if boreholes are required, or if leachate
management or daily cover is required.

95
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,600
Similar tables and requirements were
also developed for siting landfills,

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,540
required site investigations,
landfill design,

97
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,110
liner components,

98
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,470
landfill operation closure and so on.

99
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,360
These minimum requirements for waste
disposal by landfill of South Africa

100
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,470
have been used as a
basis in other countries,

101
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,120
for example for the
Botswana landfill guidelines,

102
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,320
or for the standards in
Namibia and Swaziland.

103
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,470
Another important role of
legislation and regulation

104
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,240
is a clear allocation of authority.

105
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,520
Legislation established
duties and authorities

106
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,470
of appropriate government
agencies and organization at all levels,

107
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,190
starting from the
various national ministries,

108
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,110
down to provincial institutions
and municipal authorities.

109
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,570
This is shown nicely if you
take a look at the municipal

110
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,350
solid waste management rules of India,

111
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,970
which you can google on the
internet, either the rules of 2000,

112
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,640
or the recent draft rules of 2015.

113
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,500
When looking at the rules of 2000,

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,200
you will also see a section
specifying that slum and squatter areas

115
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,930
need to be serviced
with waste collection.

116
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,730
This reflects nicely the principle
of universal service coverage.

117
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,200
Another aspect that
legislation can regulate

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,070
is how a specific
waste fraction is managed.

119
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,050
In the case of India for
instance, the rules restrict landfilling

120
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,210
only for non-biodegradable waste,

121
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,000
while they define specific
organic waste treatment technologies

122
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,970
for the biodegradable fraction.

123
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,550
What we should however not forget is
that a regulation must also be enforced,

124
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,000
and in fact this seems to be
not so easy in many countries.

125
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,680
This requires capacity to measure,

126
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,060
as well as the power and
independence to then penalize.

127
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,890
Another example of the role
of legislation is for instance

128
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,740
to ban certain materials or
certain substances in materials.

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,290
A typical example is the ban
of cadmium or mercury batteries.

130
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,290
This example however, shows
an exciting case from Rwanda,

131
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,210
where legislation of 2008 has
prohibited manufacturing,

132
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,730
importation, use and
sale of polythene bags.

133
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,140
If you ever travel to Rwanda,
you will notice that upon arrival,

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,280
your luggage is screened for
plastic bags and if you have any,

135
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,470
these are taken away and
replaced with paper bags.

136
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,820
Also in markets, you
will only find paper bags.

137
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,520
This ban is tough to enforce,
but Rwanda is managing quite well,

138
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,110
and has taken up this step
mostly in the realization

139
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,330
that they do not have the capacity,

140
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,940
and the facilities to manage this
critical fraction of solid waste.

141
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,080
Finally, my last example
of the role of legislation

142
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,520
is when a specific country has
committed to some international agreement

143
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,170
and then needs to implement a strategy

144
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,270
to comply with this
international obligation.

145
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,170
For instance, the Basel Convention

146
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,540
on the Transboundary
Movement of Hazardous Waste,

147
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,710
or the Kyoto Protocol for
greenhouse gas emission reduction.

148
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,850
This example from Bangladesh
shows the wide range of policies,

149
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,480
rules, acts and so on,
affecting solid waste management.

150
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,420
This also shows the complexity of
the legal and institutional matrix,

151
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,250
and maybe that is why we
have so many lawyers worldwide,

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,470
but what I want to
highlight here, in this context,

153
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,940
is that Bangladesh has
developed one specific strategy,

154
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,410
which guides the country to fulfill
the global climate mitigation efforts:

155
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,230
the National Clean Development
Mechanism strategy of 2005.

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,460
We will talk more about CDM and
greenhouse gases in later modules.

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,500
Now, let me summarize the
key issues of this module.

158
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,280
We have talked about how
formulation of policies and strategies,

159
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,510
and their translation into
legislation and regulations

160
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,150
are the backbone of waste management.

161
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,090
All policies and strategies start
with a clear definition of goals,

162
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,190
and are based on certain principles
that we as a society want to adhere to.

163
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,930
Regulation and enforcement,
although important,

164
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,890
are however not the only
instruments to implement policies.

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,500
As shown in this graph, there are
also instruments of social mobilization

166
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,680
or economic instruments, like
incentives or disincentives.

167
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,520
Then we also looked at some
examples from across the world.

168
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,810
In a legal and regulatory framework,

169
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,250
it is crucial to define the roles and
responsibilities of all stakeholders,

170
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,910
for instance of the different
levels in agencies in government.

171
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,300
However, not only legislation must be
clear, it must also be enforceable.

172
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:36,250
This requires adequate legitimacy,
political support, skills,

173
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,300
and institutional capacity
and respective financing.
