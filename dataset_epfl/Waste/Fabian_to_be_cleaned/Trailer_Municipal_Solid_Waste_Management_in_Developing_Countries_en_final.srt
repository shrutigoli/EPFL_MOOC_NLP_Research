1
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:10,730
What is gonna happen with this
after I throw it away?

2
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,694
Do these pictures look familiar?

3
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:20,814
Piles of garbage 
in neighborhoods and streets,

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,550
or smelly, burning and polluting
waste disposal-sites.

5
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,391
Unfortunately, this is 
a frequent situation

6
00:00:27,398 --> 00:00:29,528
in low andd middle-income countries,

7
00:00:29,528 --> 00:00:32,028
especially in towns and urban centers.

8
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:34,925
Do you want to understand 
the complex interaction

9
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:37,405
between stakeholders,

10
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,930
technical solutions

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,390
and governments?

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,730
And how this can contribute to improve
municipal solid waste management?

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,552
Then, this course is for you.

14
00:00:46,552 --> 00:00:49,332
Sandec is partnering with EPFL

15
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:52,192
to bring you a series of online courses.

16
00:00:53,244 --> 00:00:55,164
This is the Sandec webpage,

17
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:56,974
for more information on the series

18
00:00:56,974 --> 00:01:00,244
Sanitation, Water 
and Solid Waste for Development.

19
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:04,316
This course is dedicated
to municipal solid waste management.

20
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,883
Hi, hola, bonjour!

21
00:01:06,883 --> 00:01:09,415
I'm Chris Zurbrügg.

22
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,841
I'm a research scientist at Eawag,
at the department Sandec.

23
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:16,548
I specialize in solid waste management
in low and middle income countries.

24
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:18,096
I will conduct this course

25
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,862
together with me colleague 
Imanol Zabaleta.

26
00:01:20,862 --> 00:01:23,393
In this course, we will cover 
the two dimensions

27
00:01:23,393 --> 00:01:25,001
of solid waste management.

28
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,921
The first invovles understanding
the physical components

29
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,963
of a municipal 
solid waste management service.

30
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,872
We will discuss aspects
of the whole chain,

31
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:37,507
starting from generation of waste

32
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,839
to collection of waste,

33
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:41,715
treatment and disposal.

34
00:01:41,715 --> 00:01:46,282
The second dimension analyzes
the governace aspects;

35
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:50,035
these include the roles 
and responsabilities of stakeholders,

36
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,233
the financing mechanisms,

37
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:54,712
legislation and policies,

38
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:57,336
as well as socio-cultural aspects.

39
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,667
When analyzing the stakeholders,

40
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:03,312
we will present examples
of non governamental organizations,

41
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,922
the informal sector,

42
00:02:04,922 --> 00:02:06,557
private enterprises,

43
00:02:06,557 --> 00:02:09,121
as well as different government agencies

44
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:12,112
or even the role 
of external funding agencies.

45
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,960
Throughout the course,
we will be covering issues

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,241
around recycling 
and creating value from waste.

47
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,229
We shall put a special focus

48
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,545
on treatment options for biowaste

49
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:24,916
because in low and middle income countries

50
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,600
most often, more than half
of the municipal waste

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,910
consists of biowaste,

52
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,534
in other words, 
waste which is biodegradable.

53
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,099
We will look 
at more conventional approaches,

54
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,050
such as composting,

55
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,567
but also, at vermicomposting,
or anaerobic digestion.

56
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:43,063
What is the science 
behind these processes?

57
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:46,623
What kind of challenges
do such projects face?

58
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:49,964
What are they a success
or why did they fail?

59
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:53,554
Did you know that there are
actually other innovative approaches

60
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:55,929
which are just in the phase of research,

61
00:02:55,929 --> 00:02:59,733
or just recently being implemented
to treat this biowaste?

62
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:03,283
For instance, producing protein
from biowaste.

63
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,728
We will cover these and more issues

64
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,716
together with guess lectures,

65
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:10,273
who will present experiences
from the field,

66
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,234
for instance Félix Schmidt,
from CSD Consulting,

67
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:18,119
and Sanjay Gupta,
a waste management expert,

68
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,714
working for SKAT Consulting.

69
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,751
How is municipal solid waste managed

70
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,065
in your neighborhood and city?

71
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:28,181
What do you observe?
What do you contribute?

72
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,762
Why don't you share this with us?

73
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:33,240
We want you 
to actively participate in our course

74
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,814
by sharing your experience

75
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:40,357
and get involved
in solid waste management.

76
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:43,593
We look forward to working with you!

77
00:03:43,593 --> 00:03:45,626
