Hi and welcome to

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,990
this new module on comparing cities
performance in municipal solid waste

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,790
management. This topic will be presented
by Dr. Ljiljana Rodic, who is an expert in

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,349
this field.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:20,079
Her most recent work includes the Global
Waste Management Outlook Report, that she

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,689
prepared with colleagues for UNEP. In
this course we have taken various

7
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,220
insights from this report.

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,570
Welcome Ljiljana, the floor is yours!

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,949
Thank you very much Imanol. It is a pleasure to
be here and share my experiences with

10
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:41,309
you. If we look at the cities around the
world, most have some form of solid waste

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,339
management services. In fact, some perform
very well, while others still face

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:52,720
numerous challenges as we have seen
throughout this course. But how do you

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,839
know, whether it all works, whether it
achieves its objectives on public health

14
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:01,180
and environmental protection,

15
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:07,720
whether it meets the needs of the city's
residence. For example, is this good or

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:16,900
bad? How do we know? And why do we care to
know?

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,730
So, in municipal solid waste management
practice, we make decisions how things

18
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,400
will be done either deliberately and
putting them down in strategic planning

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:35,090
documents or we make them as we go along,
as day-to-day operations require, and

20
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:43,010
then react upon these decisions. But then
it is wise to take some time to observe

21
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:48,490
or monitor how the system is actually
functioning, whether the plan works in

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:55,360
practice. And then we reflect on these
observations to see whether some changes

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,570
would be appropriate. If we identify some
shortcomings and possibilities for

24
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:10,429
improvements we adapt our plans or make
new ones and another cycle begins.

25
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, measuring the performance of our solid
waste management system and even

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,700
comparing it with that of our peers can
be very beneficial. Some of the major

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:30,239
benefits are listed here. It is very
important to check our gut feeling

28
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,430
against the facts. It is also very
beneficial to identify the existing

29
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:44,030
strengths, which are often overlooked.
And such a measurement is very beneficial

30
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:50,310
for the learning cycle that we have seen
in the previous slide. Traditionally,

31
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,870
performance of urban waste management
systems is measured by means of

32
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,870
numerical quantitative indicators, such
as percentage of households that receive

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,830
waste collection services or percentage
of waste that is taken to recycling

34
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:14,530
facilities. However, it has been said that
"Not everything that counts, can be

35
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:21,620
counted, and not everything that can be
counted counts". Accordingly, there are

36
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:27,030
aspects of waste management that do not
lend themselves to quantification, they 

37
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,110
simply cannot be expressed by numbers,

38
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:35,090
but they are very important for a 
well-functioning system. Among various sets of

39
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,290
indicators that have been proposed, one
is particularly comprehensive in this sense,

40
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,150
as it includes both,
quantitative and qualitative indicators

41
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,680
to measure, describe and enable
comparison of performance of solid waste

42
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:59,500
management systems. It is the Wasteaware 
indicator set. It consists of two groups

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:06,810
of indicators related to physical
components and governance aspects of a

44
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,520
solid waste management system. As you
know, physical components of the system

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,989
describe what happens with waste,
starting from waste generation,

46
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:23,750
segregation at source, collection and transfer,
sorting, transport, recycling, energy

47
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,650
recovery and disposal. Governance
indicators address how things are done,

48
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:39,169
considering three essential aspects:
institutions, finances and inclusivity of

49
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:45,160
important stakeholders. Physical
components are measured by four

50
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,070
quantitative indicators and three
qualitative indicators, whereas governance

51
00:04:52,070 --> 00:05:00,430
aspects are measured by five qualitative
indicators. The Wasteaware indicator

52
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:08,390
set includes four quantitative indicators
for physical components of the system.

53
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,180
Two of them pertain to waste collection:
One is waste collection coverage, which

54
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,580
is percentage of households that receive
services and waste captured by the

55
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:25,919
system, which is percentage of the waste
generated. The third quantitative indicator

56
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,810
pertains to control treatment and
disposal, which is percentage of waste

57
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:39,560
destined for treatment or disposal that
goes to controlled facilities. And

58
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,449
finally, we have a recycling rate and
that is percentage

59
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:51,029
of waste generated. That is included in
recycling and valorization of organic

60
00:05:51,029 --> 00:06:00,749
waste. Now, I will give you examples of
three of those indicators. For protection

61
00:06:00,749 --> 00:06:02,199
of public health

62
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,960
it is essential, that collection coverage
is complete. In other words, that hundred

63
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,580
percent of people receive waste
collection services. This is indeed the

64
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,150
case in high-income countries, as well as
in many east block countries and in many

65
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,529
cities in People's Republic of China.
Waste collection coverage varies between

66
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:30,610
60% and 100% in the middle
income countries, as we can see here on

67
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:39,830
the examples of Buenos Aires and Delhi.
And it varies between 35 and 85% in

68
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:48,370
low-income countries. For environmental
protection, it is essential that waste

69
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:57,259
that is collected gets to the facilities
that are controlled. Here we see very

70
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:03,169
high percentages in high-income
countries and the full range of

71
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:10,039
variation from O to 100%
in middle-income countries. In low-income

72
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:19,069
countries this range is also very broad,
from 0 to 85%. As you have seen in

73
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:24,849
previous modules, resource value is
recovered from waste. Interestingly

74
00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:30,999
unlike the previous two indicators
recycling rates are not really related

75
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:37,439
to the income level. Some high-income
countries score rather low in this

76
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:43,770
indicator, while lower-income countries
score high. We do have Adelaide here

77
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:50,139
with 55%, but some other cities in
Europe, for example, score 20 to 25%.

78
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:56,169
Middle-income countries recycle in some
cases

79
00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:06,279
up to 50% of their waste and low-income
countries up to 30%. In addition to such

80
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:11,650
quantitative indicators, Wasteaware set
includes three qualitative indicators

81
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,039
for performance of physical components.
Each of these indicators consists of

82
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:27,349
five or six criteria. In here, I just give
a few examples of these criteria. For

83
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:34,919
example, criterion 1C.1 pertaining to
collection, describes appearance of waste

84
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:40,169
collection points. And you can clearly
see the difference between two collection

85
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:50,920
points, both in Bolivia. Or for example
criterion 2E.3 that describes the

86
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,699
quality of treatment and disposal. It is
the criterion monitoring and

87
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:03,529
verification of environmental controls.
On the left, you see an open dump with

88
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:10,300
open fires and all kinds of emissions
and no controls in this case in one of

89
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,890
the Balkan countries in Europe. And on
the right, you can see an engineered

90
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,519
landfill with all the measures of
environmental controls for leachate and

91
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,260
landfill gas in People's Republic of
China. As an example of a criterion under

92
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,320
the recycling qualitative indicator, you
can see here

93
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,220
occupational health and safety of the
workers who are involved in sorting and

94
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,550
recycling activities. In both pictures we
can see the informal sector, on the left is a 

95
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,959
transfer station in Nepal, and on the
right it is plastic recycling in India.

96
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,639
For governance aspects, Wasteaware set 
includes five qualitative indicators.

97
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:04,130
They're listed here. They pertain to
inclusivity of stakeholders. In this

98
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,570
case, service users and service providers, 
Then, there is one indicator 

99
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,390
on financial sustainability and two
indicators on institutions and policies:

100
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:22,030
one at national level on solid waste
management framework and one at local level,

101
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:30,220
which deals with local institutions. Here
are also some examples of the criteria

102
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:39,440
that comprise the main indicator. One of
the criteria under the indicator user

103
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,680
inclusivity. We have this criterion
which pertains to public awareness and

104
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,140
education. And here you can see a poster
for waste segregation at source in

105
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:58,240
Bangalore India. Under the indicator
national policy framework, we have a

106
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,460
criterion that pertains to existence of
appropriate implementation documents.

107
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,110
So, once you have strategies and legislation
also documents are needed to help

108
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,710
practitioners to implement indeed such
documents in practice. In here, we have an

109
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:22,460
example of such a document from Costa
Rica. Under the indicator on local

110
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:27,830
institutions, there is a criterion, a very
important one, on capacity of local

111
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:33,290
institutions which as we know from
practice is often a bottleneck in many

112
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:40,090
countries. And now, we will see some
examples of cities where Wasteaware

113
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:46,920
indicators have been applied. These
cities are spread across different

114
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,900
levels of income and you can look at the
numbers later. On here you will also find

115
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:03,700
references to some relevant literature.
Until now Wasteaware indicators

116
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,210
have been applied in around 40 cities on
six continents.

117
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,900
So, here we are at the end of this
presentation. First we saw the benefits

118
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,150
of knowing about the performance of
solid waste management systems. 

119
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,660
We distinguished between quantitative

120
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:29,009
and qualitative indicators and we saw in
what way Wasteaware indicators address

121
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:36,800
both of this. The experience is in 40 cities
around the world. Why not try it in your

122
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,009
own city? Should you have any questions
or comments, do not hesitate to contact
