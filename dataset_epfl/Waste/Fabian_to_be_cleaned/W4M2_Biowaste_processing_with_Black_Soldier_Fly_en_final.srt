00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,150
Hi. Welcome back. In this module,
we'll try to give you a glimpse

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,810
of a quite innovative biological
treatment process which

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,990
is feeding biowaste to insect larvae
and then harvesting the larvae as

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,080
protein source. For this, let me
introduce you to Stefan Diener.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,960
Stefan has been researching this
process for a number of years

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,920
and he's really the ideal
person to give this overview.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:34,330
Stefan, welcome, and
the floor is yours.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,110
Thank you, Chris, and thank you
very much for giving me 

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,480
the chance to help you with this
module, but, first of all,

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,630
let me also introduced the main actors of
this module: the black soldier flies.

11
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,610
Are you already excited about
them or still grossed out?

12
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,560
Here is the outline of this module.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,530
First of all, I'll tell you something
about the life cycle because

14
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,680
we need to know the biology before
we can go into the treatment.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,920
Then, we'll look at the rearing and
then the treatment technology itself.

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,430
And at the end, we will take a
look at the conversion products,

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,710
which are key for this technology.

18
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,200
To put it in a nutshell, fly larvae
composting converts different

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,890
organic sources into valuable
end-products which come as nutrient

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:45,250
rich larvae which can be used as animal
feed or nutrient rich soil amendments.

21
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,320
In this process, we make use of
the black soldier fly larvae's

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,100
voracious appetite. They not only
process with large amounts of

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,030
organic material, they do that very
fast as well, watch closely.

24
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,330
In this clip, you see them
feeding on to rainbow trout.

25
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,880
One on the right is cooked and
the one on the left is raw and,

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,790
as you can see, in a period of about
7 hours, both fish are devoured.

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,390
Once the larvae have processed
the material and gained a lot

28
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,710
of weight, they can be
harvested as you can see here.

29
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,850
Thereafter, they can be fed to
animals, here we fed them

30
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,400
to piglets and you see here
how they love the larvae.

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,220
Now, let us take a closer look at the
life cycle of the black soldier fly.

32
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,730
This will help us to understand why
this particular fly is suitable

33
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,390
for organic waste management.

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,390
The organism of our interest is the black
soldier fly, Hermetia illucens.

35
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,770
It has its origin in the Americas
but has been spread over the

36
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,290
world by the transport of goods
and can, nowadays, be found

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,220
in the temperate and tropical areas.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,580
It's quite a big fly compared to the
house fly, it's about 10 times heavier.

39
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,800
And its adult lives only
for about a week.

40
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,170
During this time, it doesn't take
up food, that means, it does

41
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,500
not hop from one food source to
the other and therefore cannot

42
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,360
spread diseases. Its main activity, during
the adult stage, is pretty simple.

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,510
It just has to find a
mate and reproduce.

44
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,600
Now, this is how it works: an
adult fly lives for about a week

45
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,440
and during this time it mates and
the female lays about a 1,000

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,740
eggs close to a suitable feed source.

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,920
This can be a wide variety of
organic material, such as food,

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,890
market waste, animal manure, slaughterhouse
waste, or even human excreta.

49
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,560
The eggs take about 3 days to
hatch and small larvae emerge.

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,530
At this moment, they're only
about one millimeter in size.

51
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,320
These tiny larvae search now for
food and feed on it for over

52
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,450
a period of 14 days. During this
time, they grow from 1 millimeter

53
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,400
to around 2. 5 centimeters length and
finally weigh about 200 milligrams.

54
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,890
They go through 5 larval stages
before they molt a last time

55
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,610
and become the so-called prepupa.

56
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,480
These prepupae search for a dry,
dark location to pupate,

57
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,180
and thus usually crawl out
of the waste source.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,220
Pupation takes about 3 weeks and
results in the emergent fly.

59
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,100
Now this was the natural life cycle.

60
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,780
We want to use this knowledge now
to design a treatment facility.

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,610
First, we want to manage a breeding
and rearing facility which

62
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,920
guarantees us a constant supply of fresh
young larvae to add to the waste.

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,870
To reach this, you need to provide
the flies with an environment

64
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,340
which makes them happy and
stimulates them to mate.

65
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:27,750
This means enough light, space and
humidity or even a water source.

66
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:34,080
In this picture, you see a couple of
cages which meet these conditions.

67
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,200
We call them love cages.

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,410
Within the love cage, we
provide the female with a medium

69
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,770
into which they like to lay eggs, like
this sheet of corrugated cardboard.

70
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,480
It's placed above a substrate
which gives off a strong smell

71
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,730
or, you can also say, it stinks.

72
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,740
Females are attracted by the smell
and fill the holes with eggs.

73
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,960
Here you see a few females which
are just about to place their

74
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,680
eggs into the openings. On the
right picture, we see the egg

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,910
packages that fill the holes,
for example here and here.

76
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,990
Each package contains
800 to 1,000 eggs.

77
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,910
Once the larvae have hatched, we
keep them in the nursery for

78
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,280
5 days before adding
them to the biowaste.

79
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,360
Ideally, you prepare the waste by
grinding it up so that

80
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,910
the larvae can feed easier on it.

81
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,040
Typically, we add a defined amount of
larvae to a given amount of biowaste.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,580
The ratio however varies
depending on the substrate.

83
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:46,890
For food waste, for example, we
need about 8,000 larvae to treat

84
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,410
1 kilogram per day. After they
have fed for about 2 weeks,

85
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,240
the larvae are ready to be harvested.

86
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,340
By the time we harvest, the wet
waste has been reduced by 80% to 90%.

87
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,070
Although this approach can be
considered quite new, if you search

88
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,580
the Internet you will find a lot
of videos, pictures and small

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,150
scale systems that people have
experimented with or are even for sale.

90
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,470
Most of them make use of the
prepupae's habit to crawl out of

91
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,820
the material and offered therefore
some sort of ramp to harvest

92
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,660
the protein rich prepupae.

93
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,480
In most of these systems, you do
not maintain a separate colony

94
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,750
or nursery like I described
before, but you rely on natural

95
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,680
reproduction and assume that
females are attracted by the smell

96
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,740
of the waste and lay enough eggs
to keep the process running.

97
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,350
On the other end of the spectrum,
there are a few large facilities

98
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,650
operating in different
parts of the world.

99
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,340
They are all designed to process more
than 60 tons of waste per day.

100
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,320
For some of them, revenue comes not
only from selling the harvested

101
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,460
larvae but also from the treatment
feed, meaning that they are

102
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,760
paid for taking the waste from
the one who generates it.

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,010
But you may ask, why are people
so eager to use this fly?

104
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,110
Of course, the waste reduction is
impressive. The process in general

105
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,470
is fascinating but honestly, it's
all about the products:

106
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,840
the residue and the larvae. The residue
is similar to vermicompost,

107
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:37,140
you get about the 100 to 200
kilograms per ton input, but

108
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,050
you have to keep in mind that the
BSF process does not kill all

109
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,260
the pathogens that are
present in the waste.

110
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,450
That means, if we have an input
source which is contaminated,

111
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,460
we need a sanitizing post-treatment
step for the residue.

112
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,660
This also applies for the
larvae, our second product.

113
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,530
Depending on the input source, you can
harvest 100 to 200 kilograms per ton.

114
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,110
The larvae, they consist of
40% protein and 30% fat.

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,380
This makes them an attractive
feed source for animal and

116
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,020
they can replace the fish meal
nowadays used in animal feed.

117
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,160
In the chart, you see the
development of the prize for fish

118
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,360
meal over the past 15 years.

119
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,990
As you can see, it tripled
in the past 10 years.

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,010
The reason is: the demand has
increased because there is much

121
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,220
more aquaculture today than ever
before, and the wild fish population

122
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,320
on the other hand is depleting.

123
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,160
With increasing fish meal prizes,
the larvae become an interesting

124
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,640
option for both, the animal feed
producer on one hand, but also

125
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,810
for the waste manager because
selling the larvae at a good price

126
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
helps covering to treatment costs.

127
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,520
Let me summarize what we just learned.

128
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,660
Just like it's the case with worms
in vermicomposting or bacteria

129
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,270
in anaerobic digestion, we have
to know the life cycle and

130
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,140
the preferences of our target organism
in order to optimize

131
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,880
the treatment technology. So we learned
about their huge appetite,

132
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,370
which leads to the reduction of
about 80%, but it's not only

133
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,680
about the waste reduction, it's
also about the larvae production.

134
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,310
Meaning that from one ton of
waste we can harvest up to 200

135
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:32,020
kilograms of larvae. They replace
fish meal in animal feed and

136
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,680
there are existing backyard applications
and some large scale operations.

137
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,410
I hope your disgust has now
transformed into ecstasy.

138
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,510
Thanks for watching and goodbye.
