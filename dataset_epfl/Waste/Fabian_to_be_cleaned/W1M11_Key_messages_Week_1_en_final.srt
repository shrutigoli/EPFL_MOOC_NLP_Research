1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,550
Congratulations and well done!

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,500
You have made it through
the first week.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,240
I hope this week has been
inspiring and exciting for you.

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,310
In this first week, we started
by giving an overview of the

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,840
course content, before diving
straight into the specific issues

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,330
and the current waste situation
in developing countries,

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,610
and by this, explaining the relevance
and the importance of proper

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,270
and sustainable solid
waste management.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,800
We looked at population growth
and urbanisation trends,

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,850
and explained how growth influences
waste generation and how this

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,470
growth is particularly pronounced
in Asia and Africa,

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,090
where in fact, many low-income
countries are.

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,820
More people typically
means more waste.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,480
And the problems augment in large
cities or regions with high

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,820
population density.

16
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,910
Besides generation of waste, we
also looked at composition of

17
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,110
municipal waste, looking at
average percentages of different

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,770
waste fractions, grouped by
country income levels.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,940
In general, the trend is obvious:
the lower the income,

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,720
the higher the organic fraction. 
We however also highlighted

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,520
the large variability depending on the
specific local city or country

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,220
context, and the specific
waste practices.

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,240
There is no way around it: you
need to assess this for your

24
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,100
specific local situation. A key
message is that knowing

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,390
the properties of your urban waste is
very important, as these properties

26
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,470
influence appropriate solutions,
be that in the collection,

27
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,420
transport or treatment.

28
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,120
We also pointed out that not only
spatial but also variations

29
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,430
in time need to be considered when
designing a waste generation

30
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,910
or composition sampling plan.

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,770
Then, we moved to collection,
highlighting this key function

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,530
in municipal solid waste management,
crucial for the protection

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,050
of human and environmental health.

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,140
We showed how municipalities in
developing countries often spend

35
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,310
a large share of the available
municipal budget on solid waste

36
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,640
management - collection, but
unfortunately often only managed

37
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,270
to serve less than half of the urban
population with collection services.

38
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,570
And it is the poorest that suffer
most from this lack of service.

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,440
We showed that improvements in
collection can be achieved on

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,840
different levels, and there is
a large scope in optimisation

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,070
and improving cost efficiency.

42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,270
We also presented the potential
for cost reduction in collection,

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,160
while keeping workers'safety in mind.

44
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,950
We also discussed a common
feature in developing countries,

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,650
which is the split between primary
collection service

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,730
and the secondary collection scheme.

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,920
The primary collection which allows
the service for neighbourhoods,

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,430
which are else impossible to service
with a typical waste collection

49
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:21,230
truck, and we pointed out the
complementary distinctive advantages

50
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,000
of each, also indicating that
cooperation and coordination between

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,550
both collection schemes
is very important.

52
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,660
After presenting some main facts
on recycling of paper, glass,

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,370
plastic and metal, we then
covered three highly complex

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,850
and high-cost options, typically in
operation in high income countries:

55
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,180
incineration, mechanical biological
treatment and refuse-derived fuel.

56
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,910
We looked at the underlying objective
of implementing such technologies,

57
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,820
but also discussed their drawbacks,
especially in the low-income

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:05,360
context, and highlighted the need for
waste separation before treatment.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,970
We then ended the week by
looking at landfill disposal.

60
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,550
Unfortunately, the way this is
practised in low-income countries

61
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,810
is typically unsustainable,
and often severely polluting.

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,540
We looked at key issues that help
in moving from a dump towards

63
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,160
a sanitary and well-engineered
landfill, where negative impacts

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,530
can be reduced to a minimum.

65
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,290
We highlighted the importance of
good site selection, and some

66
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,680
key operational principles and tasks.

67
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,620
And we ended by showing that also
easy step-wise improvements

68
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:46,710
can help us upgrade existing dumps.

69
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,060
Well, and that was all for this week.

70
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,440
I invite you to use the forum and
paste your views and personal

71
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,870
experiences, or even to discuss
certain points we have raised

72
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,660
during this first week with
your fellow students.

73
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,790
It would be great if you would
stay with us and join us for

74
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,770
the next week modules, where we
shall be covering various groups

75
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,910
of stakeholders and their roles,
as well as issues regarding

76
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,560
legislation, public awareness and
financing of waste management.

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,990
Stay connected!
