1
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,100
Now, let's speak about
landfill construction.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,270
We will see some important elements
to be considered for building

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,040
a new landfill.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,840
It is usually very difficult to find
a new landfill site, especially

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,580
near the big cities, for different
technical and political reasons.

6
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,510
It is often impossible to find a site
which meets all the environmental

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,120
and economic criteria.

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,650
For that reason, a lot of cities
have transformed progressively

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,170
their dumpsite in controlled landfill.

10
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,160
This is the case of Rio de Janeiro,
but also of Geneva, for example.

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,140
Along all the criteria required
for a new landfill, I will focus

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,850
on a limited number of unusual ones.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,350
First, geological quality and natural
protection of the underground

14
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,740
water resources is certainly the main
environmental and known criteria.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,920
Another criteria is the site
position in the service region.

16
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,070
In terms of traffic, as we
mentioned before, the best place

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,770
for a landfill is the center
of gravity of the region.

18
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,350
Each kilometer away from this
center represents, in average,

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,270
two more kilometers for each
truck all along the year.

20
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,320
This has an impact on the
environment and on the cost.

21
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,550
An important criteria is to have
a big surface and a long-term

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,990
available volume.

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,950
It is important to build a
landfill for 30 or 50 years.

24
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,320
For that, it is necessary to build
the first steps and to have

25
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:54,900
another possibility to create
future cells for the next years.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:01,080
Other point is to have a local
availability of earthen material

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,640
for covering the works or for covering
the different steps of the landfill.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,820
Landfills need a very big volume of
such material to cover the waste.

29
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,860
For that, it is eventually partially
possible to use inert construction

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:27,180
materials but also local quarries are
necessary to have the required material.

31
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,260
These local quarries can be the
next cells of the landfill.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,260
Otherwise, the transport cost will
be too high to make a good job.

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,710
Impermeable base layer is important
to reduce the infiltration

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,490
of wastewater in the ground.

35
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,080
Many European norms are proposing
plastic impermeable layers.

36
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,150
These plastic solutions are
expensive, extremely fragile in

37
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,130
the construction and
the operation phases.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,310
Here, in an example in Albania, we
can see holes made by machines

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,160
during the construction or the
first months of operation.

40
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,380
To make such plastic layer needs a high
technical experience and control.

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,430
But why to spend so much money
for this plastic technology if

42
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,260
then the plastic layer
is full of holes?

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,650
I'm largely in favor of using mineral
layers using local materials

44
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,450
available locally.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,000
This needs some geotechnical
knowledge in order to find in the

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,180
region a good material that can be
compacted, with a high density

47
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,490
and a low permeability.

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,910
Normally, we need to mix different
proportions of sandy material

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:02,010
with clay and to strongly compact
it in two or three layers

50
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,280
of twenty or thirty centimeters.

51
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:12,350
Here, in this example, we can see
a mineral layer made by natural

52
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,990
local material mixed
with clay material.

53
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,450
These technologies are not very
far from the road construction

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,800
techniques and you definitely need
a good geotechnical engineer

55
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,220
to conduct the operation.

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,400
But, mineral layers will give
you a very long term, good and

57
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,920
stable impermeable system.

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,400
And remember: if we have petrol
today, it's due to the impermeable

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,590
quality of clay.

60
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,680
The rainwater flowing through the
waste becomes highly polluted.

61
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,770
We call that substance the leachate.

62
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,170
It is very important to have a
very good drainage system of

63
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,430
this leachate on the
bottom of the waste.

64
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,430
Here, we have the bottom of the
waste with the impervious system

65
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,540
and here the drainage system.

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,130
This drainage system is
important for two reasons.

67
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,450
First, the leachate quantity then
can flow through in the nature

68
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,330
through the impervious layer is
directly proportional of the

69
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,060
height of the water on the top
of the bottom of the landfill.

70
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,850
If we have a good drainage, we
reduce this height to a very

71
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:33,420
limited level and then reduce
infiltration in the nature.

72
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,070
Second reason, as we mentioned
before, the accumulation of water

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,760
on the bottom of the landfill will
increase the risk of instability

74
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,990
and, for this reason, it is very
important to take this water

75
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,200
out of the waste.

76
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,770
The leachate has generally a high
potential of clogging the drainage.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,980
To avoid that, the leachate drainage
is realized through a continuous

78
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,460
drainage layer of twenty or thirty
centimeters of pervious material.

79
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,730
It is possible to use inner-construction
waste for that – like

80
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,260
bricks or concrete waste.

81
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:20,440
The best is to add drainage tubes
with a design allowing a future

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,630
access from outside for possible control
and cleaning of the main tubes.

83
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:36,050
A slope of a minimum 3 percent,
2-3 percent, must be considered.

84
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:43,280
All around the landfill, a big
drainage system must be constructed

85
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,780
in order to avoid that the
water enters the waste.

86
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,150
Additionally, it is also important
to capture and evacuate the

87
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:02,280
rainwater coming in the top of the
landfill and to avoid a possible

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,030
erosion effect of the covered top.

89
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,170
The degradation of the organic
matter without oxygen produces

90
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:17,030
methane as well as little proportion
of other gases producing

91
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,310
very bad odors for the human nose.

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,700
Methane production has, moreover,
a very high contribution to

93
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,350
the greenhouse effect on climate.

94
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,420
Then, the gas drainage and burning
has two important functions:

95
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,970
reduce the bad odors for the population;
reduce the greenhouse effects.

96
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,060
These are different techniques
for gas drainage.

97
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,630
As we saw, the most common are
to realize stone stack during

98
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,300
the development of the landfill.

99
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,590
This can be done through a simple
accumulation of stones or

100
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,190
inner-materials – inner-metallic tube
– which is elevated layer by layer.

101
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,170
The accumulation of stones creates
a continuous vertical drainage

102
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,380
stack and the metallic tubes 

103
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,400


104
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,230
can be used very easily 
to fire the gas coming from the waste.

105
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
This gas represent a huge
energetic potential.

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,360
In the second step, the gas can
be collected through a pumping

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:23,690
system to a motor-generator that will
produce a continuous production

108
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,880
of electricity.

109
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,490
These technologies exist
and are very efficient.

110
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,310
The economic interest of this
electricity production is strongly

111
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,030
dependent of the price of the
electricity but, important to

112
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,690
mention, is that such system
requires a high technology as well

113
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,500
for the gas drainage system as for the
preventive maintenance of the motor.

114
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,420
The design of the tube collecting
the gas to the pumping station

115
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,840
should be done considering a high
settlement of the waste during

116
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,000
the life of the landfill.

117
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,060
This will create some technical
problems but can be solved.

118
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,320
Honestly, the landfill leachates
are very difficult to be treated.

119
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,760
Usual biological process for urban
wastewater have a very limited

120
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,860
efficiency on that kind of water.

121
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,690
On another hand, it makes no sense
to build and pay an expensive

122
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,820
impermeable layer in plastic or
mineral at the base of the landfill

123
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,880
if the leachates are just collected
and then discharged in the

124
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,400
environment downstream the
landfill and without treatment.

125
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,690
Depending on the climate, the
best solution is often to store

126
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,840
the drained leachate in big basin
and then to pump it and to

127
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,940
recycle it in the waste system.

128
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,270
This needs to have a pumping system
and an infiltration system

129
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,650
with drains that allow the leachate
to enter again in the waste.

130
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,390
This storage and recirculation
have many beneficial effects.

131
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,820
First, it will treat and partially
evaporate the leachate water.

132
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,050
Secondly, it will increase the gas
production and then the electric

133
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,870
production in cases of a
gas-to-energy system is in place.

134
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,090
It will generate an important
volume reduction of the waste;

135
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,650
the production of gas will reduce
organic composition of the

136
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,670
waste and this gain in volume will
give an interesting economic

137
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,920
value and increase the landfill life.

138
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,340
The volume of the leachate basin
has to be defined according

139
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,600
to local climate conditions
along the years.

140
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:04,500
Main points of landfill construction
are to use local material,

141
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:11,100
implicate geotechnical engineer,
control the water, capture and burn gas.
