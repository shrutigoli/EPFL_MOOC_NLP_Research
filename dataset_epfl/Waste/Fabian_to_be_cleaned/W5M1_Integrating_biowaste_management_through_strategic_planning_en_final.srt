00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,769
In this module I want to share with you
some thoughts about strategic planning

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:13,639
in waste management, and specifically
with regard to integrating biowaste

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,940
management into the municipal system. So,
why biowaste management? Let me briefly repeat

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:24,860
what we have learned so far on biowaste
management. Biowaste is the largest

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:30,170
fraction, with over half of all municipal
waste consisting of biowaste. 

6
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,059
When collected and disposed of in
neighborhood, biowaste may impact

7
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:39,610
negatively on the environment, while
degrading. It may generate methane, a potent

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:45,380
greenhouse gas. Biowaste is also an
environmental threat. Leachate from biowaste

9
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,170
pollutes groundwater and surface
water and biowaste may attract or even

10
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,220
promote disease-carrying vectors, like
flies or rodents. It is also an

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:03,399
underutilized resource, whereas
recyclables like glas, metal, paper

12
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,630
and even some fractions of plastic
already have a quite well established

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:14,719
recycling market, biowaste is still
struggling. However, treatment

14
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,090
technologies exist.

15
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,259
You've heard about them in the previous
modules and municipalities are slowly

16
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,179
but surely becoming more and more aware
of the potential to manage biowaste as a

17
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:34,850
separate fraction and make use of this
resource. But how to go about this in a

18
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,889
well planned and systematic way? What to
choose?

19
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:46,590
Often decisions are taken like: Oh, what
should we do? Or, what do the donors

20
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,340
suggests? Ok, we'll just do composting at
the landfill and that might work.

21
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:00,109
Actually and unfortunately it will
probably not work. In this module I

22
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:03,549
should try to guide you through some
planning steps, to come up with some

23
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,750
informed decision on what to do with biowaste.
The planning steps we shall go

24
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,150
through are those typical of any project
planning cycle as you see in this graph.

25
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,700
Something you might have come across already. 
The first step is identifying

26
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,879
problems and needs based on an
assessment of the existing situation.

27
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,989
Then, developing goals, generating, weighting
objectives and elaborating on potential

28
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,530
actions to meet these objectives.

29
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,840
The next step is then preparing
scenarios that address the alternative

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,549
futures in biowaste management comparing
each scenarios impact, costs and

31
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:51,879
constraints and examining stakeholders
willingness to pay for or cooperate. Then

32
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,560
developing and reaching a consensus on
both selection criteria and the choice

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,769
among scenarios that best address the
objectives. And then finally, following

34
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,930
through with implementation, operation,
monitoring, evaluation and adaptation,

35
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:17,730
summarized in these boxes. The first step
involves a preparation and initiation

36
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,879
of the planning process.As well as
framing the problem. You want to make

37
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,680
sure to have support of key stakeholders,
typically the local authorities, but also

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,510
ensuring enough human and financial
resources to conduct the process. This

39
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,930
will include a professional facilitator as
well as technical experts for the

40
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,840
appraisal of options later. Then, the next
step is to identify the relevant

41
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,690
stakeholders for this participatory
process. A subsequent task is to then

42
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:03,379
frame the decision problem. This means
defining the area of concern, assessing

43
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,590
waste types and amounts, as the origins 
of the waste and the

44
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:17,810
accessibility to the waste. What you see
in this table is an example of different

45
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,279
types of biowaste. In the columns you can
then see the descriptor of original

46
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:26,490
generation

47
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,490
the amounts, the variations over the year,
but what is also essential information, is

48
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:41,240
to know, how the waste type is currently
being managed, if at all. If a recovery

49
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,130
and recycling pathway is already
established, it makes little sense to

50
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:52,020
disrupt this. An example is the case of
certain types of vegetable waste, from

51
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,849
the markets that are already sold or
left to farmers for feeding livestock.

52
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:03,159
The next step in the cycle is defining
the goals and objectives with the

53
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:10,620
respective sub objectives. An example is
shown here in this objective tree. 

54
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,150
This objective tree can be validated or even
adapted in a participatory process.

55
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,710
During this process

56
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,620
different objectives can also be
weighted, depending on the perceived

57
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:29,430
importance. This example shows some
predefined sub objectives grouped under

58
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:35,370
different headers which were developed
by expert consultation. There is the

59
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:43,710
issue of technical reliability, social
acceptance, the aspects of environmental

60
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:52,199
pollution, of high hygiene and health
protection, and finally the aspect of economic sustainability.

61
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,650
Then, the next step is to select the various

62
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:05,479
alternatives and assess their performance
with regard to the objectives we want to achieve.

63
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:11,800
Here is the list of different biowaste
treatment options as we have

64
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,840
heard about them in the previous modules.
We can now assess their suitability

65
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:24,639
regarding all those performance criteria
we had in the objective hierarchy. 

66
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,380
Here are some examples. For instance the waste
type, which is in the technical objective.

67
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:38,750
Or the availability of skilled people.
Also in the technical objective. 

68
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,409
Or the market

69
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:45,929
of the products, which is one under the
economic objective. So, let me say a few

70
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:51,860
things more about this economic
objective. Given our experience, we have

71
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,669
noticed that many municipalities feel

72
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:59,809
that making for instance compost will solve
all their problems and they might even

73
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:05,019
make a lot of money. Typically this is
not so without a very well-planned

74
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,959
distribution and marketing approach.
Maybe at the end the compost is then used

75
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,029
as cover material at the disposal site
and this would be fine and makes a lot

76
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,309
of sense.

77
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:21,839
The main point is that it is thought
through at the onset of the planning.

78
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:28,039
This aspect of economic sustainability
not only necessitates a good

79
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:35,599
understanding of the costs but also of
the expected revenues. So, the potential

80
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,539
value of the product being made from
biowaste,

81
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:47,050
be it gas, protein or soil amendment. In 
biowaste management, it is in fact this

82
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,619
aspect, which is currently most difficult
to assess, as the databases for making

83
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:58,469
such estimations is quite weak. We, at Sandec, 
are putting a lot of effort in

84
00:07:58,469 --> 00:08:03,269
trying to quantify treatment costs for
the different options or we could also

85
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:10,169
say production costs for that specific
product that we make from biowaste.

86
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,189
If you have such information from your
specific context, please post it to the

87
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,269
forum and we will compile it and use it
for our reports and even future lessons.

88
00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:28,329
When assessing the alternatives, we come
up with scores on how they perform

89
00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:34,610
towards certain objectives. It is
important to discuss this performance of

90
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:42,169
alternatives to look at scores and
discuss trade-offs. Then, we might find a

91
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:49,209
consensus of the best practicable
alternative. This then needs

92
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,730
a detailed feasibility assessment.
Detailed, because we start defining

93
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:01,970
scale, we start defining location and
even the logistics around it. 

94
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:07,929
All our experience from biowaste management
shows that is best to have a pure

95
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:15,809
biowaste stream. This ensures high-quality
product and, of course, minimizes costs of

96
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:23,230
sorting. Sometimes it is best to start
with easy waste. Waste which is not

97
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,369
contaminated by none-degradable

98
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:32,499
fractions, like waste from
vegetable markets or pre-consumer waste

99
00:09:32,499 --> 00:09:39,540
or waste from food processing
industries or restaurants. If we want to

100
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:47,850
target household waste, it is crucial that
we first mobilize and incentivize waste

101
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:55,129
segregation at the household level. So, in
summary, strategic planning of biowaste

102
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:01,160
management includes the process of
assessing alternatives in biowaste

103
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,679
management, deciding on the objectives
that we want to achieve, assessing the

104
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:14,199
different waste types and the source and
validating the performance of the

105
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:22,049
alternatives versus the objectives. And
one key realization is that segregation

106
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:28,249
is really a key step for all future
biowaste management. Thank you for listening.
