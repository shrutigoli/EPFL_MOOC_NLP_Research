1
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,779
Why is this course important?

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,909
Let's see if I can convince you.

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,047
Provision of good solid waste management

4
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,438
is a tremendous challenge 
all over the world,

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,906
but specially in developing countries.

6
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,968
Our society needs knowledge
in solid waste management

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,687
since we need solutions 
in the coming decades.

8
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:27,517
Some of you might still be doubting
whether to follow this course or not.

9
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,044
If you worry about the following facts,

10
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:35,334
or if you think that they deserve
some attention, then join us.

11
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,274
It is time to bring 
solid waste management

12
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:39,384
to the attention of the general public.

13
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,372
Did you know that there are 
two billion people

14
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:45,645
whose waste is not collected 
from their homes and neighborhoods?

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,830
Or that three billion people lack access
 to controlled disposal facilities?

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,230
Many communities, city dwellers, 
living organisms and ecosystems

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,034
are direct victims of environmental 
and health impacts of this situation.

18
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,542
Let me point out two sad stories.

19
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,995
The first one is about 
the city of Surat in India.

20
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:11,015
In 1994, the city of Surat 
suffered an outbreak of plague

21
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,729
like disease caused by major flooding,

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,789
as a consequence of uncollected waste
 blocking the drains.

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,230
The outbreak resulted in 56 deaths,

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,337
0.3 million people migrated in two days,

25
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:27,768
and the country suffered 
as much as two billion US dollars

26
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,138
in economic losses.

27
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:33,813
The good side of the story 
is that they learned from their mistake.

28
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,498
In the next 18 months,

29
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,633
the city administration 
transformed the city

30
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:40,238
into one of the cleanest in the region

31
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:42,705
winning the Best City Award

32
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:47,475
in the Annual Survey 
of India's City-Systems in 2013.

33
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:52,214
The second story is about 
the municipal dumpsite in Quezon City,

34
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:53,724
in the Phillippines.

35
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,652
In July of 2000,

36
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,861
after ten consecutive days
 of heavy rain,

37
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,101
a slope of the dumpsite 
collapsed on a slum community.

38
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,264
The landslide killed 
nearly 300 people

39
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:09,744
and left hundreds of families homeless
 and without a source of livelihood.

40
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:14,454
The slope failure was the result 
of a bad management of the dumpsite.

41
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:17,099
No daily cover, no compaction,

42
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,429
too steep slopes, 
no [leach] collection, etc.

43
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,098
Can we do it better?

44
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,384
We must!

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,453
Currently, it is estimated 
that we generate

46
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:31,093
around seven to 10 billion tons
 of urban waste per year.

47
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,777
Can you imagine?

48
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,507
And predictions do not forecast
 a much better future.

49
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:37,790
By the end of the century,

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,151
global population is predicted
 to rise up to nine to 11 billion people.

51
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,090
90% of this growth 
will take place in Africa,

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,584
and 83% of the world population

53
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,474
will be concentrated 
in Asia and Africa alone.

54
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:54,924
Right where most of the developing 
countries we're targeting are located.

55
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,737
Of course, more people 
automatically implies more waste.

56
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,584
Besides, it is also interesting 
to mention that waste generation

57
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:06,336
is significantly greater 
in urban than in rural areas.

58
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,466
And how the urbanization trends look like?

59
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,832
Let's have a look.

60
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,944
Have a look at this map.

61
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,237
See how the percentage 
of people living in cities grows

62
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,513
almost in every country of the world.

63
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:21,675
The darker the color, 
the higher the percentage of people

64
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,103
living in urban areas or cities.

65
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:28,313
At the same time, the size of cities
 is also rapidly growing.

66
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:31,797
In 1970, there were only
 three mega cities,

67
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,174
cities with more 
than ten million inhabitants.

68
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:37,944
All of them in the north, 
in Japan and the United States.

69
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:40,708
By now, there are 28,

70
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,633
and by 2030, the number
 will have rised to 40.

71
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,349
32 of these will be in the global south.

72
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,798
And of course, this will have 
serious implications

73
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,178
on resource consumption
and waste generation.

74
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:59,001
Now that we mention
 resources, look.

75
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,480
Have a quick glance
 to this infographic.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,505
Check first the diagram in the center.

77
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:08,002
It shows the number of years 
we have left of different resources

78
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:11,080
considering the global 
current consumption rate,

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,190
and half of the consumption rate
of an average US citizen.

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,485
On the right side,

81
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,488
we see the proportion of consumption

82
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,828
that is met by recycled materials 
in percentage.

83
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:26,448
The infographic shows 
some astonishing predictions.

84
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,710
Did you know that, 
if consumption rates keep equal,

85
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,110
we will soon run out of indium,
required for LCD screens?

86
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,756
And almost not recycled nowadays.

87
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:41,626
Or that phosphorus reserves are predicted
to deplete in a few centuries?

88
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:43,663
These might sound quite a lot,

89
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,426
but notice that our agriculture production

90
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,773
depends heavily on phosphorus
 subtracted from mines.

91
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,830
No phosphorus means 
lower food production,

92
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,650
and who knows what problems
 we will then face.

93
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,045
Silver is left for nine to 29 years, 
tin 17 to 40 years,

94
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:03,975
copper 38 to 61 years,

95
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,575
and not high recycling rates 
for these resources

96
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,230
are achieved currently.

97
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,119
Much of them are just being dumped.

98
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,249
We might want to start 
doing something about this.

99
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,975
The world is in need 
of well-prepared waste managers.

100
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,345
Unfortunately many waste-related decisions
are taken without much thought.

101
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:28,585
Obsolete, abandoned, non-functional 
and mismanaged technologies,

102
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,769
such as this drum composter 
in Kathmandu, Nepal 

103
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,999
are common place in many low 
and middle income countries.

104
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,069
In this particular case, 
the installation was too technical.

105
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,546
It had a rotating drum, 
conveyor belts, etc.

106
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,635
and all of them broke down
 and needed replacements.

107
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,515
Besides, as usual, there was no market
 or demand for compost.

108
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,865
So in the end, the whole activity 
was too expensive

109
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,385
to maintain and operate

110
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,025
and now it is used to store motorbikes.

111
00:05:56,785 --> 00:06:00,290
There are infinite reasons 
why these technologies fail.

112
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,570
And many of them could be avoided
by having a proper assessment

113
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,650
of the characteristics 
and needs of each location.

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,182
This course intends to bring
some light to these issues.

115
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:13,242
Do you also think that we need
to start looking for solutions

116
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,762
to the previous issues?

117
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:17,292
We need everybody to take part in this.

118
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,282
We need as many people as possible 
who are not only dedicated

119
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:22,602
and motivated to solve 
the waste problem,

120
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:25,142
but who also understand 
the complexity of the system,

121
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:27,412
and have the tools to improve it.

122
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,855
Tell your friends, colleagues, 
or anybody who's interested

123
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,515
or involved in solid waste management
to join the course.

124
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:36,015
Understanding solid waste 
management systems

125
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,515
is definitely a preliminary pre-condition

126
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:42,175
and hopefully this course 
will contribute to cover that gap.
