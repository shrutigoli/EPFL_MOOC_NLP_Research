00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:05,918
Hi.

2
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:09,332
This week, we'll talk about
anaerobic digestion technologies

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,519
and their practical operation.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,793
Remember, you can download the book

5
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:15,376
for free, from our webpage,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,161
if you want more detailed information

7
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:18,975
on anaerobic digestion.

8
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:21,277
This diagram looks really scary,

9
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,918
but don't worry, it isn’t.

10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:27,323
It's a classification of different types
of AD technologies.

11
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:31,124
We can differentiate
between dry and wet systems,

12
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,291
between batch and continuous systems,

13
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:38,375
between thermophilic
and mesophilic operating systems

14
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:42,168
and between one-stage
and multi-stage technologies.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,116
What I would like to go through

16
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:47,007
together with you in this module,

17
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:51,051
is I would like to look
at wet, continuous,

18
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:54,470
mesophilic, and one-stage reactors.

19
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,955
The examples that we will be discussing

20
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:03,668
are floating-drum, fixed-dome,
and balloon-type digestors.

21
00:01:04,513 --> 00:01:07,292
Continuous actually means

22
00:01:07,293 --> 00:01:12,472
that we are feeding
at a regular interval, at the same time,

23
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:15,124
an equivalent volume that enters,

24
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,876
an equivalent volume
will also leave the digestor.

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,960
Wet means that we'll be operating

26
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,430
with the total solid content
of 16% or less,

27
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:30,169
so low TS.

28
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,188
So, now, let's look at these digestors,

29
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,479
Let me start by showing you
the wet, continuous, mesophilic

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,180
fixed-dome reactor.

31
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:46,543
This is a brick-built
and gas-tight plastered structure,

32
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:48,920
which is often put underground.

33
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:50,791
It has an inlet pipe,

34
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,179
where the waste material is fed
into the digestor.

35
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:58,584
It has a digestor,
with a volume of slurry,

36
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:03,128
and then, it has
the gas-holder storage space.

37
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:06,259
What it further has is an outlet,

38
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:09,496
or what we also call
compensation chamber,

39
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,836
and the overflow.

40
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:13,266
You might also see here

41
00:02:13,267 --> 00:02:16,816
that the gas pipe is at the highest point,

42
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,817
with a valve to open
or close the gas flow.

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,809
There are different designs
of fixed-dome digestors,

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,420
and sizes can vary.

45
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:31,576
This is the most common
reactor-type in developing countries.

46
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:35,171
When starting the reactor
for the first time,

47
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:40,167
it is important to inoculate the reactor
with methanogenic bacteria.

48
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,863
The easiest way to do this
is by adding cow manure,

49
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,773
and water, with the ratio of 1:1,

50
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:51,251
or, even easier, use digestate
from another reactor.

51
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:55,661
A rule of thumb is
that it needs about 10%

52
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,120
of the reactor volume as cow manure

53
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:00,791
to start the process.

54
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:03,284
But more is also fine, or even better.

55
00:03:05,154 --> 00:03:08,072
In this animation, we can see
how this works.

56
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,125
The waste material is mixed with water

57
00:03:11,126 --> 00:03:12,965
and enters the reactor,

58
00:03:13,913 --> 00:03:16,811
and mixes with the material
already in the reactor

59
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,385
undergoing degradation.

60
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,584
Bio-gas is generated in the slurry

61
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:23,672
through anaerobic digestion.

62
00:03:24,243 --> 00:03:27,193
The gas bubbles then move
to the top part of the reactor

63
00:03:27,897 --> 00:03:29,697
where gas accumulates

64
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:32,094
and starts to build up pressure

65
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,144
if the valve is closed.

66
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:36,170
When the valve is closed,

67
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,040
the gas pressure will increase,

68
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,749
and push down the slurry
in the reactor,

69
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,828
and up into the overflow chamber.

70
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:46,352
When then the gas is used,

71
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,288
the gas pressure drops,

72
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:50,176
and the slurry level balances out

73
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:51,721
to a new equilibrium.

74
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:55,681
Here, you see a sequence of pictures

75
00:03:56,448 --> 00:03:59,967
of the construction
of a fixed-dome reactor in Lesotho

76
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,521
during the building
of the structure and the dome.

77
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:08,265
Here, the dome is just about finished.

78
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,133
And here, it's being plastered.

79
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,565
This is another example from Indonesia.

80
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:22,012
What you see here is that the bottom part

81
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,149
is built with concrete,

82
00:04:24,428 --> 00:04:28,428
and the dome part
is just starting to be built with bricks.

83
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:34,691
Here is a summary of some advantages
and some disadvantages.

84
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,121
For the advantages,
let me highlight three:

85
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:40,429
long life span,

86
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:43,161
absence of moving parts,

87
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,639
and the underground construction

88
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,190
which saves space.

89
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,283
There are also disadvantages.

90
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,596
I'll also highlight a few:

91
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,150
one is that it needs
specific technical skills,

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,909
it also needs a special sealant

93
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,200
to make sure that's gas-tight,

94
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:08,263
and another disadvantage
is the fluctuating gas pressure

95
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:11,783
depending on the volume
of the stored gas,

96
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:12,934
and its use.

97
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:17,819
A second type
is the floating-drum digestor.

98
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,737
You see this in this picture.

99
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,347
It has similar features:

100
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:26,347
the inlet, the digestor for the slurry,

101
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,888
the outlet, and the overflow.

102
00:05:29,755 --> 00:05:32,405
But here now, the gas holder

103
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:35,016
is not a fixed unit

104
00:05:35,017 --> 00:05:36,967
but is a moving unit.

105
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:40,491
Here it's floating on a water jacket,

106
00:05:40,492 --> 00:05:44,492
in some cases, it could also be floating
directly on the slurry.

107
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:47,498
With increasing gas pressure,

108
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:50,668
this floating gas holder moves upwards,

109
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:52,828
and when gas is used,

110
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,029
the weight of the drum
pushes it back down.

111
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,922
The gas drum is typically made of metal,

112
00:06:00,391 --> 00:06:02,731
painted to protect it from corrosion.

113
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,958
It can also be made out of
fiber glass reinforced plastic,

114
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,749
or galvanized sheet metal.

115
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,220
In this design,

116
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:12,840
there is also a guiding pole

117
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:16,841
to make sure to stabilize it
while it's going up and down.

118
00:06:18,302 --> 00:06:20,231
There is also a divider wall

119
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:23,651
which helps to avoid
short circuiting of the slurry

120
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:25,591
from the inlet to the outlet.

121
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:26,962
You see it here.

122
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:30,869
The digestor is often placed
below the ground

123
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,693
while the gas holder drum is above ground.

124
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:39,549
Here is an example
of such floating drum digestors

125
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,803
from India

126
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,218
with the metal floating gas holders.

127
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,355
Or here, another; also, from India.

128
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,343
Here are examples of small household units

129
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:54,751
made out of fiber glass
reinforced plastic.

130
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:57,335
The brown part on the top

131
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,926
is the floating drum.

132
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:03,107
Or here, another example from Tanzania

133
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:07,835
made by using
the typical water tanks out of plastic

134
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,803
and some plastic piping.

135
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:16,059
Here are some advantages and disadvantages
of the floating-drum reactors.

136
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:20,796
Advantages are: that it's simple
and easy to operate;

137
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:26,718
one big advantage is that the volume
of gas is directly visible

138
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:30,066
and that means we know
if the system is working or not;

139
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,803
we also have constant gas pressure,

140
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:35,494
or we can increase this pressure

141
00:07:35,494 --> 00:07:38,134
by adding some weight 
on the gas holder tank.

142
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:42,426
Some disadvantages are
the high material costs

143
00:07:42,426 --> 00:07:44,101
for the steel drum,

144
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:47,693
and that these steel parts
are susceptible to corrosion.

145
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:52,203
There are also regular
maintenance costs that arise,

146
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,381
from keeping this corrosion at bay.

147
00:07:55,885 --> 00:07:58,523
The third digestor type
I would like to show you

148
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:00,324
is the tubular digestor,

149
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:02,593
like this one in Costa Rica.

150
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,896
These are quite common
in the Latin American region.

151
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:09,587
These are long horizontal line
tubes or balloons,

152
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,936
made out of plastic and rubber.

153
00:08:11,936 --> 00:08:16,451
The inlet and outlet are attached
directly to the skin of the balloon.

154
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,696
You see this here in this schematic:

155
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,713
the balloon, the inlet, and the outlet,

156
00:08:23,713 --> 00:08:27,030
and the gas pipe on the top.

157
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,974
These balloons usually need
some protection

158
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:33,596
from the top, as well as from the bottom,

159
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,495
what we usually have
as a compacted backfill.

160
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:41,369
Some advantages are:
low construction costs,

161
00:08:41,369 --> 00:08:43,894
very simple to install,

162
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:46,537
easy to construct,

163
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:48,794
but some disadvantages are:

164
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,812
a relative short life span,

165
00:08:50,812 --> 00:08:53,624
and susceptible to mechanical damage.

166
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,597
So, those were the three types
of technologies

167
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:00,912
that I wanted to share with you.

168
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,433
There are a lot of variations in design.

169
00:09:03,433 --> 00:09:07,733
For instance, this combination
of a fixed structure for the digestate,

170
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,539
and then a balloon for the gas storage.

171
00:09:10,539 --> 00:09:12,684
This is an example from Germany.

172
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,190
Why don't you share with us

173
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,717
what kind of systems
you might have encountered

174
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:19,457
in your region or during your travels?

175
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,899
Submit them into our forum.

176
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,351
So let me summarize
what we covered in this module:

177
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:28,790
we looked at three different types
of digestors,

178
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,145
we looked at their design features
and some examples.

179
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:36,170
For each, we listed some advantages
and disadvantages.

180
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,330
In the next module, we'll focus
on maintaining the digestor in operation

181
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,014
and at the product chain,
the gas, and the digestate.

182
00:09:45,014 --> 00:09:46,544
Thanks very much.
