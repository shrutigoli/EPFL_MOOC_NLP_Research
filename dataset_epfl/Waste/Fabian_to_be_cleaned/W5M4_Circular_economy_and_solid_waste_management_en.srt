00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:09,420
Hi and welcome again! In this module we
will introduce the hot topic of circular

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,190
economy and its relation to solid waste
management. Dr. Ljiljana Rodic is with us again.

3
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,350
She has pioneered university
education on this topic in the

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,570
Netherlands.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,080
Ljiljana, welcome again! The floor is yours.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,140
Thank you very much Imanol. It is a
pleasure to be here again.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,470
Nowadays, we often hear or read in the
media about circular economy. In this

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:35,420
lecture I will introduce this term, 

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:41,180
explain briefly different meanings in
which it is used and discuss potential

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,310
place of solid waste management in
circular economy. How did you hear the

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:51,740
term circular economy? You may have heard
about the circular economy promotion law,

12
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,620
the milestone legislation of the
People's Republic of China adopted in

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,250
2008 to promote the circular economy as
a national strategy for sustainable

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:08,880
development. Or you may have come across
reports towards a circular economy

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,730
prepared for the Ellen MacArthur
Foundation. But what is it all about?

16
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,630
Since the industrial revolution our
economies have grown following a linear

17
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,710
pattern of use of natural resources

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:33,420
consisting basically of take, make, use,
discard steps. This was based on a

19
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,650
false premise that the resources are
infinitely available and accessible at

20
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,860
an affordable cost, both in terms of
money and in terms of environmental

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,990
impacts. However, such a pattern simply
cannot be sustained by the earth system. On the

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,950
one hand the sources of materials are
finite and on the other hand, there are

23
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,610
limits to the ability of Earth's
ecosystems to recover from habitat

24
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:08,799
degradation and pollution by various
hazardous and other chemicals. But if you

25
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:14,659
look at nature and natural ecosystems,
how they use natural resources around them,

26
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:17,319
we see that nature functions

27
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,499
in a circular pattern. Starting from
plants as producers, including several

28
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:25,939
levels of consumers and when they die

29
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:31,260
decomposers get to work to convert them
into soil nutrients, which in turn serve

30
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,519
as food for the producers again.

31
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:41,599
Circular economy envisages a similar
system, where after make and use stages,

32
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,599
materials are recovered and processed into
a new cycle of production and use.

33
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,599
For materials to be recovered and returned
to the next cycle of production, they

34
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,719
need to be clearly defined in circular
economy. Materials can be defined either

35
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,859
as biological materials or technical
materials. Biological materials are used

36
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:11,859
to make the so-called consumption
products, which get consumed during use,

37
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:17,120
such as a soap or shampoo or wear off
during use, such as clothes or shoes.

38
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,790
These are designed to be safe for human
health and the environment and as such

39
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:28,060
they can safely return to the natural
biological cycle. Here, we have an example

40
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,979
of biological material: food. Technical
materials are used to make service

41
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:41,470
products, such as computer, telephone,
washing machine, a car. As they are

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,139
non-renewable and often hazardous to
human health and the environment,

43
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,180
these are kept within the industrial
technical cycle, where they will be used

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,509
to make new products,

45
00:03:52,509 --> 00:04:00,009
time and again. At that some materials lend
themselves perfectly for cascading use.

46
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:06,310
This is usually the case with biological
materials, wood and textiles are very

47
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:13,409
good examples. Biological materials can
be used in defined cascades where the

48
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,979
quality deteriorates from one
application to the next, but both, along

49
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:23,820
the way and at the end, the material can
be fully returned to the biological

50
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,680
cycle with no harm to human health or
the environment. In the end, they can be
 
51
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,490
processed,

52
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,300
by for example, aerobic composting or
anaerobic digestion to recover resources

53
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:44,020
such as organic matter nutrients and
energy. Of course, products user stages can

54
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,810
be extended through reuse and repair.
Also, after this assembly parts can be

55
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,650
used for refurbishment and manufacture
of the products. Here, you see an example

56
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:06,380
of complete disassembly into the part
and their corresponding materials.

57
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:12,150
As you know, recycling is usually downcycling,
whereby materials loose their quality in

58
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,370
each cycle. However, it is possible for
recycling to actually be upcycling, 

59
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,870
whereby quality improves in each cycle.
Here, we have an example of a packaging

60
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:32,419
that is made out of 100% PET 
bottles, and from the PET material

61
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:38,880
during recycling antimony is removed,
which was there originally. 

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,800
So, this material is now better quality than it
used to be.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,020
It often makes sense to explore
possibilities of closing material cycles

64
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,810
together with energy and water cycles.
For example, closing metal cycles saves a

65
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:03,430
lot of energy, if we close water cycles. It
allows recovery of nutrients. 

66
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:08,860
Also, for renewable energy it is important to
consider materials used for such

67
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,840
technologies, as they often contain rare
and hazardous materials. For a fully

68
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,319
circular economy a lot of innovation
will be needed in various disciplines in

69
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,210
various fields. For example, in material
sciences, well-defined materials are

70
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,229
particularly important. Also, for the
design, end of use stage need to be taken

71
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,529
into consideration: How easy the product
is to be repaired, to be refurbished, to

72
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:43,760
be disassembled, to be remanufactured.

73
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:49,400
Also of particular importance are the new
business models, where a lot of

74
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,820
innovation is needed, so that services
are sold and not necessarily the

75
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:01,310
products. This also includes our
relationship to ownership. Do we actually

76
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,880
need to possess and own a product or are we
perfectly happy with the service it

77
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,990
provides us? This also means that new
relationships or new types of

78
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,850
relationships are needed along the
supply chain, where trust among partners

79
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,470
has a prominent role, because it is about
sharing proprietary information about

80
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:32,850
materials and parts. This also means that
citizens have a new role and that is

81
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,280
that they have to make sure that these
materials indeed do return into the next

82
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,680
production cycle. And government has also a
role because it can provide supportive

83
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,460
policies, legislation and incentives to
enable support such developments in

84
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:59,010
society. You may have seen in literature
that the role of the design is very

85
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,130
important for circular economy. It is
indeed, because it is the design stage

86
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:09,410
when all the decisions are made about
the material, about assembly methods,

87
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:17,110
about the usage. However, solid waste
management has an equally important role in

88
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,680
circular economy, because it makes the
other half of the cycle complete. It makes

89
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,070
sure that the materials after usage
will indeed return to the next

90
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:36,470
production cycles. Circular economy is
currently in the focus of political and

91
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:44,700
public debate and its importance is only
going to increase. While it begins with

92
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,270
the design of products,

93
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:52,120
everybody has a role to play and
everybody can contribute. Not the least,

94
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,370
us citizens, as consumers to choose

95
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,470
buy and discard the products.However,
solid waste management has a very

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,820
prominent role as it makes sure that the
materials actually return into the

97
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,580
next production cycle. Should you have
any questions or comments, do not
