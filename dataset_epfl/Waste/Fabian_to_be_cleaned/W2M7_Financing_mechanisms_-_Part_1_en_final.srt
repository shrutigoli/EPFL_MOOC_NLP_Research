00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:10,019
Hi. This module and the next one will deal about
money. Did you ever ask yourself which

2
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,799
money flows in solid waste management
systems exist? In this first module we

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,390
will learn and we will discuss the main
costs of solid waste management services

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,820
and various methods to finance
investment costs. Whereas in the next

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:28,080
module we will mainly talk about
operation and maintenance costs. The very

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,330
first thing, the main responsible for the
solid waste management service of the

7
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:36,150
city needs to know in order to take cost
effective decisions, are the total costs

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,160
of providing a good service,

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,600
considering all the physical elements.
Based on this, we can assess how to

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,320
improve the cost efficiency and what it
might cost to improve the service.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:01:01,059
Unfortunately very rarely are the costs fully known. 
Often the costs are shared by multiple actors

12
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,909
or there is not a separate municipal
budget for solid waste management costs

13
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,100
and money comes from different sources.
Or part of the allotted budget is used

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,590
for other expenses. In any case, in solid
waste management we distinguish two

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,900
types of costs: investment costs also
called capital costs and operation and

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,080
maintenance costs also called recurrent
costs. There are however externalities

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,810
which are often not quantified in
economic terms that are also considered

18
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,820
hidden costs. What are these
externalities? If there is inadequate or

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,640
no solid waste management, there are also
costs and these are called externalities.

20
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,600
For instance, the death of animals eating
waste or grazing on contaminated land.

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,210
Public health impacts: The externalities can be
associated to the cost of

22
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,840
buying medicine or visiting the doctor
or even the loss of revenues by not

23
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,210
being able to work,

24
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,729
water contamination and the costs of
having to clean that water or the costs

25
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:12,440
of finding another more expensive clean
water source, impact on tourism and

26
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,300
economy in general.

27
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,230
According to the recently published 
"Global Waste Management Outlook Report",

28
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:26,190
the cost of these externalities can 
represent 20 to 50$ per capita

29
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,900
per year or even more. Expanding waste
collection coverage or upgrading

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,480
disposal facilities costs are a fraction of
that. It is cheaper for the society 

31
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,890
to manage its waste now in an
environmentally sound manner than to carry on

32
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,880
polluting the environment and then trying to
clean it up later. If that is even

33
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,140
possible. 

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,660
Ok. But now back to the costs in terms of
expenditures by the municipality or the

35
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,860
organization providing the service of
solid waste management, which are

36
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,780
investment costs and operation and
maintenance costs. These costs are paid

37
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,920
from different money sources. Let's have
a look to each of them separately. What

38
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,520
do we mean by investment costs?
Investment costs, also called capital

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,490
costs, are all those related to
developing and constructing

40
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,510
infrastructure or large equipment. There
are five main financial sources for this

41
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:30,050
costs. These are national government,
local government, local or international

42
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,160
financial institutions, which are most of
the times

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:47,950
banks or the private sector, donors, or a
combination of this. The money received

44
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:54,830
can either be a grant, which are non-repairable
funds or loans, which need to

45
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:00,570
be paid back. Let's briefly describe each
of these options.

46
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,220
National government funding is a very
important source of investment finances.

47
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,950
For example, for the People's Republic of
China, municipal solid waste management

48
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:15,060
infrastructure has been a priority since
2000. Or in India the Jawaharlal

49
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,620
National Urban Renewal Mission launched
by the central government and envisages 

50
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,350
an investment of 20 billion US$. 
Local governments can also invest in

51
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,180
solid wastes management services, after
raising funds from

52
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,490
local sources of income. These could be
taxes such as the property tax fees such

53
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,639
as parking fees or reserves for
instance. Reserves are portions of

54
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:42,600
current revenues, which were saved for
financing future investment. Ideally, 

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,270
most investment costs should be financed
through this use of reserves. However,

56
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,090
this is not the case, as it requires good
planning. Another way to obtain finances

57
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,720
for capital investments is to raise
funds through the issuance of bonds.

58
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,440
Often local and national governments
have other priorities than providing

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,580
waste services for the limited budgets.
So municipalities often need borrowings,

60
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,979
also called loans, which are lend by
local banks or international financial

61
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,099
institutions. Some of the most active
international financial institutions in

62
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:23,020
solid waste management investments are
the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and

63
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,699
the Inter American Development Bank which
many of you might have heard of. For you

64
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:33,409
to have an idea of the amounts that are
being invested here, it may be helpful to

65
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,169
know that 4 billion US$ were 
invested in solid waste management

66
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:45,210
services between 2003 and 2012 globally.
This might sound like a lot. However it

67
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,900
represents approximately 0.3% of
the overall development finance. It's a

68
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:57,169
tiny portion. In terms of the population
of the countries receiving Solid Waste

69
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:03,849
Management Development Finance in 2012,
this equates 0.09$ per

70
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:11,169
capita. Much less than per capita levels
of 2.43$ in the water and

71
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:18,530
sanitation sector and 31$ of
development finance overall. Not every

72
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,030
municipality is eligible for these loans.
The World Bank for instance estimates

73
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:29,080
that of the 500 largest cities in the
developing world, only 4% are credit worthy.

74
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,050
in international capital markets.
Grant-funded support is the other key

75
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,610
element of Development Cooperation
amounting to an estimated 1.2 billion 

76
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,320
dollars between 2003

77
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,460
and 2012. These funds are free of interest
costs. However, the donor financing often

78
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,940
comes with requirements such as
achieving full cost recovery or using

79
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,280
public-private partnerships or other
private financing schemes. Experience

80
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,900
also shows that free money also has
risks that cities need to be aware of.

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,630
When money comes easily, facilities are
often oversized, affecting considerably

82
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,600
the operation and maintenance costs. Or
investments are made into technologies

83
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:15,630
which do not fit with the local climate
condition or waste characteristics. For

84
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,830
instance, building an incineration plant
where municipal solid waste management

85
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:25,130
is predominantly wet and has low calorific
value or obtaining compactor trucks for

86
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,770
a city with unpaved and narrow streets
with high waste density. The cost of 

87
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,170
operating and maintaining these three
vehicles is often several

88
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:40,130
times higher than operating a more
appropriate but maybe not sophisticated vehicle,

89
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,200
such as the one shown on the right. 
When will the private sector be involved in

90
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,220
investing? They will only do this if they
can recover their investments and earn

91
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,500
profit or if they can use the secondary
products and/or energy obtained from

92
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,270
waste. Let me give you two examples: in
2008, the industry group called the

93
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,620
Indian Tobacco Company based in
Coimbatore invested in waste collection

94
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,950
in order to secure reliable supplies for
paper. Or the second example is based in

95
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,050
Cape Town, where due to the demand for
compost from source separated green

96
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,930
waste on behalf of the farms, a farmer runs
still the biggest existing composting installation.

97
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:25,040
 

98
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,700
In this module we learned about the total 
cost ofproviding solid waste management services.

99
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:34,479
Knowing this cost is really important.
These are investment costs, operation and

100
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,820
maintenance costs, which will be covered
in the next module, and externalities.

101
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,480
Furthermore, we also saw the most common
sources that exist to cover investment

102
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,530
costs, which are coming from national
government, local governments, local and

103
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,680
international financing institutions,
donors and the private sector. 

104
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,540
For those interested in deepening
the topic, we recommend

105
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,170
these two key readings, which are
downloadable for free from the internet.
