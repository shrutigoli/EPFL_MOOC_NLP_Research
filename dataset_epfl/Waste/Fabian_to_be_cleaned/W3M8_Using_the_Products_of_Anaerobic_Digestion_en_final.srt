00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,059
Hi again! In this last module on anaerobic
digestion, we'll talk about using the

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,260
product of AD. The gas and the 
digestate. I will try to explain what needs

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,500
to be considered so that a biogas
facility can be sustained and maintained.

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,419
Before we do this however, let me quickly
sum up what we have heard about AD until

5
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:32,340
now. So, we have looked at some issues of
the substrate chain, we have talked about

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,640
particle size, we had talked about
volatile solids of different waste

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,660
materials I also described the
biochemical process stages and the main

8
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,809
parameters, which are contained in here
and some typical digester technologies.

9
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:58,109
So, what now is left to do, is to cover
the product chain. The gas and the

10
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,010
digestate. We will also discuss the
issues around sustaining the whole

11
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,720
system and answering the question, when
can anaerobic digestion be an

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,110
appropriate treatment option for waste
management. And when not. So, now with an

13
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,410
appropriate digester and in good
operating conditions the reactor will

14
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:25,430
produce biogas. This biogas is
saturated with water vapor and in the

15
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,000
first instance the water vapor moving
through the pipes will condensate and

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,200
moisture will collect as water in the
pipes. We will need to remove this

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,310
moisture. We call this dewatering. We can
remove the water at the lowest point in

18
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,850
the pipes. If this water is not removed,
it can block the pipes, hindering flow of

19
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,120
gas. That is why you will need to install
a water trap at the lowest point in the

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,620
gas lines. There are different types of
water traps you can install. Here are two

21
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,290
examples: an automatic one and a manual one.
Both have T-joints at the lowest

22
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:11,260
point in the gas pipes and  a water storage
unit below the T-joint, where the

23
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,390
condensate can flow into. The automatic
trap

24
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:22,740
empties itself, when full, by using a
U-bend overflow, whereas the manual water trap

25
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,319
is emptied by opening a valve. The biogas
produced in the reactor will vary during

26
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:34,020
the day according to feeding patterns
and also ambient temperature changes.

27
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,510
Biogas production also continues during
night time when less gas is used and

28
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,819
therefore there are periods when the gas
has to be stored. This can either be in

29
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:51,400
the digester itself as in the top part
of the fixed dome digesters, as we had seen

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,269
before, or in bags or balloons like in
this unit in Indonesia. Gas can also be

31
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,540
stored with medium or high pressure in
gas tanks.This can be done with

32
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,540
compressors, but of course this requires
energy. The Indian Institute of

33
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,860
Technology in Delhi is engaged in
research on bottling of biogas. For use

34
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,560
as fuel in three wheeled vehicles. They
combine conditioning and cleaning of biogas

35
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,840
and compression. In an uncompressed form,
the energy content of one cubic meter of

36
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,930
biogas corresponds to around a half a
litre of diesel. As a rough rule of thumb,

37
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,489
about 10 kilograms of biowaste are needed
to produce this one cubic meter of

38
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:54,090
biogas. For all use in machines, engines
or generators, biogas needs to be

39
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,930
conditioned. We could also call this
cleaned. The goal is to remove water

40
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,090
vapor, which we've already talked about, but more
importantly also hydrogen sulfide, which

41
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,980
is very corrosive and CO2, which has no
energy value. Removing hydrogen sulfide

42
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,700
is what we call desulphurisation. 
We can do this with ferrous oxide, which

43
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:24,510
then transform the hydrogen sulfide
into iron sulfide. We can also do this

44
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,639
with water scrubbers which at the same
time also can remove CO2.

45
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,400
If we think about biogas application
and appliances, actually the most simple

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,610
way is to use the biogas close to the
anaerobic digestion facility for direct

47
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,460
combustion. For this purpose,

48
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,629
conditioning of biogas is not necessary. 
A household cooking stove only needs

49
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,469
20 to around 450 litres per hour.

50
00:04:55,469 --> 00:05:02,159
Frequently, when no direct use of gas is
obvious, methane is fed into gas

51
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:07,889
generators to produce electricity. 
However, with the conversion losses we

52
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,860
can only retain about 30 percent of the
energy as electricity, the remaining is

53
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,879
lost as heat. Besides the gas, another
product from anaerobic digestion is the

54
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,729
digestate. In wet digestion systems,
this is a nutritious slurry with

55
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:32,210
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, as well as
trace elements. 50% of this nitrogen is

56
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,779
available as ammonium nitrogen that can be
directly assimilated by plants. So, all in

57
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:42,379
all, it's a good fertilizer, that can be
used in agriculture. But remember if it's

58
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,819
in the mesophilic range, we're not having
high temperatures, so if we have

59
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:54,370
pathogenic substances these are not
hygienisized. If it is not possible to use

60
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,759
this digestate in agriculture, then
the digestate has to be treated before

61
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:04,949
disposal, as it still has a high organic
load and based on regulations would not

62
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,560
be allowed for discharge into surface
waters. Remember no system works without

63
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,460
maintenance and care. What does that mean
for biogas systems? We need to regularly

64
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,399
check for leaks.

65
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:27,810
We can do this with a pressure test,
looking if the gas pipes are ok. We also

66
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,800
need to check and unblock pipes if
required. We don't need to forget, to

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:40,680
empty water traps and we need to
regularly observe the slurry level in

68
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,220
the outlet chamber.

69
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:49,840
It gives us a lot of information on the
processes. Remember to not overload the

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,570
digester, otherwise we will have
acidification. And now and then we need to

71
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,140
desludge the digester. Typically
recommended is every 5 to 10 years

72
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:07,610
and this will be mostly sand and grit
which accumulates at the bottom of the

73
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,570
digester. So, now we've heard a lot about
anaerobic digestion as an option for

74
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:19,250
waste management. But when should we
actually choose this option?

75
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,980
Well, one aspect is that we need access
to a well-sorted organic waste source.

76
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,680
What we also need to think about is that
we need local skills and experience in

77
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:39,480
construction and operation. Then need and
demand for gas is a requirement. Or we

78
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,020
need to have a small power grid which we
can feed into. We also need a competitive

79
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,390
chance to compete with other energy
sources. And this is an economic issue.

80
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,830
Finally, we need an institutional
environment allowing feeding into the

81
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:05,690
grid, especially for converting gas to
electricity. And ideally we need a demand

82
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:11,800
for the digestate for reuse in
agriculture. So let me summarize what we

83
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,860
covered in this module. We looked at
biogas dewatering and conditioning. We

84
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:25,729
looked at biogas storage options, we
looked at gas use and energy content, we

85
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:32,169
discussed what issues are necessary to
maintain the system. And finally, we also

86
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,729
looked at criteria favoring the choice
of using anaerobic digestion for organic

87
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:40,020
solid waste treatment. Thanks for
listening
