1
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,779
Why is this course important?

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,909
Let's see if I can convince you.

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:12,047
Provision of good solid waste management

4
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,438
is a tremendous challenge 
all over the world,

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:16,906
but specially in developing countries.

6
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:19,968
Our society needs knowledge
in solid waste management

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,687
since we need solutions 
in the coming decades.

8
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:27,517
Some of you might still be doubting
whether to follow this course or not.

9
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:31,044
If you worry about the following facts,

10
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:35,334
or if you think that they deserve
some attention, then join us.

11
00:00:35,334 --> 00:00:37,274
It is time to bring 
solid waste management

12
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:39,384
to the attention of the general public.

13
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:42,372
<i>Did you know that there are 
two billion people</i>

14
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:45,645
<i>whose waste is not collected 
from their homes and neighborhoods?</i>

15
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:50,830
<i>Or that three billion people lack access
 to controlled disposal facilities?</i>

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:55,230
<i>Many communities, city dwellers, 
living organisms and ecosystems</i>

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,034
<i>are direct victims of environmental 
and health impacts of this situation.</i>

18
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,542
Let me point out two sad stories.

19
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:06,995
<i>The first one is about 
the city of Surat in India.</i>

20
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:11,015
<i>In 1994, the city of Surat 
suffered an outbreak of plague</i>

21
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:13,729
<i>like disease caused by major flooding,</i>

22
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:17,789
<i>as a consequence of uncollected waste
 blocking the drains.</i>

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:21,230
<i>The outbreak resulted in 56 deaths,</i>

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,337
<i>0.3 million people migrated in two days,</i>

25
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:27,768
<i>and the country suffered 
as much as two billion US dollars</i>

26
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:29,138
<i>in economic losses.</i>

27
00:01:29,813 --> 00:01:33,813
<i>The good side of the story 
is that they learned from their mistake.</i>

28
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,498
<i>In the next 18 months,</i>

29
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,633
<i>the city administration 
transformed the city</i>

30
00:01:37,633 --> 00:01:40,238
<i>into one of the cleanest in the region</i>

31
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:42,705
<i>winning the Best City Award</i>

32
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:47,475
<i>in the Annual Survey 
of India's City-Systems in 2013.</i>

33
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:52,214
<i>The second story is about 
the municipal dumpsite in Quezon City,</i>

34
00:01:52,214 --> 00:01:53,724
<i>in the Phillipines.</i>

35
00:01:53,724 --> 00:01:55,652
<i>In July of 2000,</i>

36
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:58,861
<i>after ten consecutive days
 of heavy rain,</i>

37
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,101
<i>a slope of the dumpside 
collapsed on a slum community.</i>

38
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:05,264
<i>The landslide killed 
nearly 300 people</i>

39
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:09,744
<i>and left hundreds of families homeless
 and without a source of livelihood.</i>

40
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:14,454
<i>The slope failure was the result 
of a bad management of the dumpsite.</i>

41
00:02:14,454 --> 00:02:17,099
<i>No daily cover, no compaction,</i>

42
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,429
<i>too steep slopes, 
no [leach] collection, etc.</i>

43
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,098
<i>Can we do it better?</i>

44
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:24,384
<i>We must!</i>

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,453
<i>Currently, it is estimated 
that we generate</i>

46
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:31,093
<i>around seven to 10 billion tons
 of urban waste per year.</i>

47
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:32,777
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

48
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:36,507
<i>And predictions do not forecast
 a much better future.</i>

49
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:37,790
<i>By the end of the century,</i>

50
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,151
<i>global population is predicted
 to rise up to nine to 11 billion people.</i>

51
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:45,090
<i>90% of this growth 
will take place in Africa,</i>

52
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,584
<i>and 83% of the world population</i>

53
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,474
<i>will be concentrated 
in Asia and Africa alone.</i>

54
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>Right where most of the developing 
countries we're targeting are located.</i>

55
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,737
<i>Of course, more people 
automatically implies more waste.</i>

56
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:02,584
Besides, it is also interesting 
to mention that waste generation

57
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:06,336
is significantly greater 
in urban than in rural areas.

58
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,466
And how the urbanization trends look like?

59
00:03:09,466 --> 00:03:10,832
Let's have a look.

60
00:03:10,832 --> 00:03:12,944
<i>Have a look at this map.</i>

61
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,237
<i>See how the percentage 
of people living in cities grows</i>

62
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,513
<i>almost in every country of the world.</i>

63
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:21,675
<i>The darker the color, 
the higher the percentage of people</i>

64
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:24,103
<i>living in urban areas or cities.</i>

65
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:28,313
<i>At the same time, the size of cities
 is also rapidly growing.</i>

66
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:31,797
<i>In 1970, there were only
 three mega cities,</i>

67
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,174
<i>cities with more 
than ten million inhabitants.</i>

68
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:37,944
<i>All of them in the north, 
in Japan and the United States.</i>

69
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:40,708
<i>By now, there are 28,</i>

70
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:44,633
<i>and by 2030, the number
 will have rised to 40.</i>

71
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:48,349
<i>32 of these will be in the global south.</i>

72
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:52,798
And of course, this will have 
serious implications

73
00:03:52,798 --> 00:03:55,178
on resource consumption
and waste generation.

74
00:03:56,344 --> 00:03:59,001
<i>Now that we mention
 resources, look.</i>

75
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,480
<i>Have a quick glance
 to this infographic.</i>

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,505
<i>Check first the diagram in the center.</i>

77
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:08,002
<i>It shows the number of years 
we have left of different resources</i>

78
00:04:08,002 --> 00:04:11,080
<i>considering the global 
current consumption rate,</i>

79
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,190
<i>and health of the consumption rate
 of an average US citizen.</i>

80
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,485
<i>On the right side,</i>

81
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,488
<i>we see the proportion of consumption</i>

82
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,828
<i>that is met by recycled materials
 in percentage.</i>

83
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:26,448
<i>The infographic shows 
some astonishing predictions.</i>

84
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:29,710
<i>Did you know that, 
if consumption rates keep equal,</i>

85
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,110
<i>we will soon run out of indium,
 required for LCD screens?</i>

86
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,756
<i>And almost no recycled nowadays.</i>

87
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:41,626
<i>Or that phosphorus reserves are predicted
 to deplete in a few centuries?</i>

88
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:43,663
<i>These might sound quite a lot,</i>

89
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:46,426
<i>but notice that our agriculture production</i>

90
00:04:46,426 --> 00:04:49,773
<i>depends heavily on phosphosrus
 subtracted from mines.</i>

91
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,830
<i>No phosphorus means 
lower food production,</i>

92
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:55,650
<i>and who knows what problems
 we will then face.</i>

93
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,045
<i>Silver is left for nine to 29 years, 
tin 17 to 40 years,</i>

94
00:05:01,045 --> 00:05:03,975
<i>copper 38 to 61 years,</i>

95
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:07,575
<i>and not high recycling rates
 for these resources</i>

96
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:09,230
<i>are achieved currently.</i>

97
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,119
<i>Much of them are just being dumped.</i>

98
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:15,249
<i>We might want to start 
doing something about this.</i>

99
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:18,975
The world is in need 
of well prepared waste managers.

100
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,345
Unfortunately many waste-related decisions
are taken without much thought.

101
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:28,585
<i>Obsolete, abandoned, non-functional
 and mismanaged technologies,</i>

102
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:31,769
<i>such as this drum composter 
in Kathmandu, Nepal </i>

103
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,999
<i>are common place in many low 
and middle income countries.</i>

104
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:38,069
<i>In this particular case, 
the installation was too technical.</i>

105
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,546
<i>It had a rotating drum, 
conveyor belts, etc.</i>

106
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:44,635
<i>and all of them broke down
 and needed replacements.</i>

107
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,515
<i>Besides, as usual, there was no market
 or demand for compost.</i>

108
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,865
<i>So in the end, the whole activity
 was too expensive</i>

109
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,385
<i>to maintain and operate</i>

110
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,025
<i>and now it is used to store motorbikes.</i>

111
00:05:56,785 --> 00:06:00,290
There are infinite reasons 
why these technologies fail.

112
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,570
And many of them could be avoided
by having a proper assessment

113
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,650
of the characteristics 
and needs of each location.

114
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,182
This course intends to bring
some light to these issues.

115
00:06:10,182 --> 00:06:13,242
Do you also think that we need
to start looking for solutions

116
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,762
to the previous issues?

117
00:06:14,762 --> 00:06:17,292
We need everybody to take part in this.

118
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:20,282
We need as many people as possible 
who are not only dedicated

119
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:22,602
and motivated to solve 
the waste problem,

120
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:25,142
but who also understand 
the complexity of the system,

121
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:27,412
and have the tools to improve it.

122
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,855
Tell your friends, colleagues, 
or anybody who's interested

123
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:33,515
or involved in solid waste management
to join the course.

124
00:06:33,515 --> 00:06:36,015
Understanding solid waste 
management systems

125
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:38,515
is definitely a preliminary pre-condition

126
00:06:38,515 --> 00:06:42,175
and hopefully this course 
will contribute to cover that doubt.
