00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:04,810
Hi.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:10,150
Last time, we saw the main elements
of waste collection and transport.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,800
Today, we will see a little bit
more in detail as a possibility

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,030
of optimization and how to proceed.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,550
Why is waste collection
so important in fact?

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,990
It's firstly a question of quality
of life for the population.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,790
People have a strong requirement to live
in a clean city and clean streets.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:36,370
One has a better self-respect
living in a clean area.

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,870
Waste collection is a basic service
for the population but it's

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,810
also a question of health protection
and of long term environmental

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,040
protection. Waste collection is
also a short term question of

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,790
protection against natural hazards.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,910
The accumulation of waste in canals
and water pipes will strongly

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,820
increase the floods in the
city and their effects.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,700
In the last lecture, we saw how much
waste collection and transport

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,790
are important in the cost structure
of waste management because

17
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,780
optimization is also a key factor
to improve the sustainability

18
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,250
of the waste management service.

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,200
The organization of waste
collection is also a typical case

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,580
for introducing good practices
in municipal governance.

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,440
The optimization of waste collection
will have two main objectives.

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,040
First, to improve the quality of
the service to the population.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,420
Secondly, to reduce the cost.

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,730
As we saw, it is possible
and yes, we can do it.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,020
What we learnt from
different European cities.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,970
Some years ago, we made a comparison
of the efficiency of the

27
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,520
waste collection system between
 seventeen different middle cities

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,680
of Europe, from 50,000 to
600,000 inhabitants.

29
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,630
Using simple street area, we were
very surprised by the results.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,150
As you can see, we noted a huge
difference in efficiency between

31
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,040
different cities from one to
three or from one to seven.

32
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,620
In Switzerland, also, we found
some similar big variation

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,850
with collection costs varying from
one to ten by inhabitant or by

34
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,440
town between 80 communes.

35
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,730
Why are these differences so big
between cities having a similar

36
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,960
level of services?

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,740
The cities having the better
efficiency had generally, first,

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,890
accepted to analyze the reality;
secondly, accepted to change

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:08,730
their habits; thirdly, to make
clear choice; and finally, worked

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,070
on a good organization and
supervision of the work.

41
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,890
At the opposite, the cities having
a low efficiency are usually

42
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,120
working as they always did; the
city has changed, but this system

43
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,340
stayed on the same old level.

44
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,080
This important variability shows
once again the potential of

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,200
cost reduction that exists
in most of cities.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,080
So, how to proceed?

47
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,600
First of all, it is necessary to
collect and analyze data to

48
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,810
know your city and to analyze
the present service as it is in

49
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,810
order to have clear data on
what we're speaking about.

50
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,090
After analyzing the data, we have
to develop a new strategy.

51
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,150
For that, we have to develop a
collection strategy in order

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,810
to reduce loading time and the
time of heating the truck.

53
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,800
For that, we will increase the
number of containers – they are

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,930
much cheaper than trucks.

55
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,040
We will introduce bigger and
standardized containers.

56
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,390
We will introduce also, perhaps, some
bigger containers in strategic

57
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,060
places – like markets
or shopping centers.

58
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,320
We will introduce bigger trucks as
much as possible, technological

59
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,800
trucks with loading system
and compacting systems.

60
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,740
We will reorganize routes and
timetable in order to avoid the

61
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,470
peak hours of traffic. And, for
example, we will collect the

62
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,320
city center in the night and
the suburbs in the day.

63
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,400
As a second point, we want to reduce
the distance travelled by the trucks.

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,770
For that, we will optimize the
collection routes in order to

65
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,610
have all trucks full at one
hundred percent at the end of the

66
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,740
route and to reduce
time and kilometers.

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,630
We want also to try to limit the
waste collection in main streets,

68
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,070
to reduce the number of collection
points, avoiding a full door-to-door

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,570
collection system and defining a
maximum distance for the citizen

70
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,110
to reach the bins – for
example 100 or 200 meters.

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,180
After, we will optimize the
time of use of the trucks.

72
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,840
For that, we have to organize a
preventive maintenance of the

73
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,490
trucks and of the bins in order
to reduce the frequency and

74
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,120
the duration of breakdowns.

75
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:50,450
We have also to operate in two
or three shifts per day – it's

76
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,260
a decision – or six or seven
days per week, for example.

77
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,520
We can also decide to operate
out of the city centers in the

78
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,540
peak hours or to create a transfer
station for long transports

79
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,500
and organize a transport with bigger
and cheaper forty-ton trucks.

80
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,600
The next point is to improve
the management of the service.

81
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,070
For that, we have to define a
new rule system, defining tasks

82
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,220
to the citizen, tasks of the
businesses, of the construction

83
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,390
company who is producing waste,
but also the collection team.

84
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,470
The important point is to organize
a good supervision of the

85
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,670
service, night and day, with an
adequate reporting of older

86
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,260
data and use of this data
to improve the service.

87
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,470
We have to organize a training
of the staff: the drivers,

88
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,480
the workers and the supervisors. We
have to organize a communication

89
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,180
campaign in order to inform the
population about the new service,

90
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,080
about the timetable of the service,
the new rules, the tasks

91
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,020
of the citizen, the tariffs, etc.

92
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,450
Sometimes, the service can be made
by a public company or sometimes

93
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,150
by a private company but, in any
case, the task of introducing

94
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,850
planning and supervision
are more or less the same.

95
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,670
Here is an example of an optimization we
made in Shkodër, in North of Albania.

96
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,790
The previous situation was very
bad and only part of the city

97
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,300
was covered by the service.

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,910
Introducing a reasonable solution,
we can improve the service

99
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:38,900
to one hundred percent of the
population and reduce by forty

100
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,650
percent the cost of the service.

101
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,180
The challenge was to organize
a service and the supervision

102
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,970
and to introduce new bins in
sufficient quantities and good

103
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,890
position and to organize the
maintenance of trucks and bins.

104
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,200
In this second example, we see
how we can work on the timetable

105
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,720
of the use of the
trucks and the teams.

106
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,320
In this analysis, we can see what
times are used for each activity

107
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,340
of the trucks in the day; and
with this analysis, we can show

108
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:26,780
where we could try to reduce
useless time taken by the trucks

109
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,800
in order to increase the collection
time of the trucks and make

110
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,680
it more efficient. The idea is
that trucks should work most

111
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,760
of the time of the day and that,
at the end of the route,

112
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,410
they are one percent full before
to go to the landfill.

113
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,710
Together, with routine analysis,
the time analysis allowed step

114
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:57,870
by step to reorganize the truck
use in order to maximize the

115
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,200
collection time for each truck.

116
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,590
After analysis of the data of
your city, you have to propose

117
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,340
a clear strategy and perhaps
different scenario, and make it

118
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,640
approved by the authorities. Be
clear on private or public services

119
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,580
frequencies, type of containers,
maximum distances of the service

120
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,540
for the population.

121
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,220
It's important to avoid the
multiplication of different services

122
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,140
but to focus on basic service
at lower cost as possible.

123
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,890
Also, it's important to avoid
beautiful solution or containers

124
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:43,250
as they are proposed in the
market but to develop a step by

125
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,220
step approach in line with
available finances of the commune.

126
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,600
It's important also to develop
a cost calculation and annual

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,240
budget so that the authorities
take decisions in line with

128
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,920
the financial possibilities
of the municipality.

129
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,390
We will see how to make a cost
calculation in another course.

130
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,270
After, we have to define the
tariff and the tariff collection

131
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,180
system because it's crucial to
define how to collect the money

132
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,540
– the financial resources which
are necessary to finance the

133
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,360
investment and the operation
of the service day by day.

134
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,520
Warning: don't think it's easy.

135
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,600
Buying trucks is only one little
step but more difficult is

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,850
to organize, make function, supervise
the system of collection and transport.

137
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,020
And, warning 2: changes are
difficult everywhere, so for change

138
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:54,200
management you need a
strong political support.

139
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,480
As a summary, we can see that cost
reduction in collection

140
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,340
and transport is generally
everywhere possible.
