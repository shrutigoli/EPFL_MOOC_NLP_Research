00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,590
In the past modules we have heard
about the high costs of collection.

00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:14,000
But also of the high optimization 
potential with vehicle types,

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,450
loading, and routing strategies.

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,650
However, we want to ensure
collection services to all,

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,160
and for this sometimes it is
necessary to use approaches

00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,060
which remain non-optimized, but achieve
the objective of service provision.

00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,200
Why? Because sustaining
a hygienic environment,

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,020
and ensuring public health are key
functions of municipal waste collection.

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,300
It is a main driver to ensure
that waste management services

00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,690
are provided to all,

00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,390
independent of the cost.

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,370
Not having collection service
would affect the wider public,

00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,850
and thus counteract the
objective of the service.

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,770
Collection in certain areas
can be extremely challenging.

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,460
Let us look at these few examples.

00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,900
Here is an example from Mumbai, India.

00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:11,000
Just by looking at
the settlement pattern,

00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,160
this extremely high population density
with very limited road infrastructure,

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,230
you can easily imagine that
it is impossible to move around

00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,960
in this neighborhood with
a waste collection truck.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Or this example from a
neighborhood in Caracas, Venezuela,

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,390
located on a very steep slope,

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,170
making access for waste
collection trucks very difficult.

00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,310
It is in fact quite typical
in many cities of the world,

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,510
that the low-income
neighborhoods are exactly in those areas,

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,770
which are so difficult to access.

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,710
They have very limited road
infrastructure, narrow lanes,

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,640
which are often
unsealed or even washed out.

00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,840
Solutions for waste collection
in such areas of difficult access

00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,180
is a split of waste
collection into 2 steps:

00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,330
primary collection, which
provides services in the neighborhood

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,240
with smaller vehicles or
more simple technology;

00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,800
then the transport of this
collected waste to a collection point,

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,660
where it is stored in
larger containers,

00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:20,111
and then secondary collection,
which removes this waste regularly

00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:23,844
for transport to the treatment
or disposal facility.

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,660
Primary collection can
have different variations.

00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,860
The first is shown here:
actually not a collection,

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,590
as it relies on the residents
themselves bringing the waste

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,750
to the collection point.

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,058
Another approach can be that
the people bring their waste

00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:45,810
to the collection vehicle when
summoned, for instance, by a bell.

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,712
The other approach shown
here is a curbside service,

00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,059
or even a door-to-door service,

00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:58,640
by a primary collection service
using a simple collection vehicle,

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,250
which can be human powered,
animal powered, or even motorized.

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,060
Let us look at a few examples of
such primary collection vehicles.

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,590
Here is an example of a very
simple collection by wheelbarrows

00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,480
in a slum of Karachi, Pakistan.

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,010
You might notice the boards,

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,540
which are used to increase the
loading capacity of the wheelbarrow.

00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,610
Or this handcart, in an example
of primary collection in Indonesia.

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,580
Here is an example from the
handcart in Abidjan, in Côte d'Ivoire.

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,470
Notice how one sidewall can be removed
for easier emptying of the vehicle,

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,590
and also notice the wide tires,

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,470
that are better suited for the
very sandy roads in this neighborhood.

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,830
Here is an example of a
bicycle cart from Warangal, India.

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,010
What you see here is a design that
allows collection of segregated waste.

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,900
Or here, a bicycle collection
cart from Bangalore in India.

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,010
A special feature of this
collection vehicle are these blue bins,

00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,290
which on one hand allow
collection of segregated waste,

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,240
but also allow easy emptying 
of the collection vehicle,

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,740
as each bin can be removed 
separately and emptied.

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,740
Or here from India, a motorized option,
using a three wheel transporter.

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,500
Or here, an improved
version from Managua, Nicaragua,

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,910
which allows tipping of
waste for easy emptying.

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,210
So, remember, sometimes
to ensure waste collection

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,640
in areas that are difficult to access,

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,040
the option of primary
collection is a good solution,

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,280
although it may not
really be cost-optimized.

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,000
Primary collection has the advantage
that it is typically a simple approach

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,180
and it can be easily adapted to
the specific local, topographic,

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,460
or road or lane conditions.

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,250
This service is very close
to the clients, the people,

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,020
and often the residents pay
for this collection service.

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,950
Remember however, that primary
collection, given the type of vehicles,

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,710
is limited in transport distance.

00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,330
Waste is delivered
to a collection point,

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,710
which then needs to be emptied
by a secondary collection system.

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,340
Given this interaction
between 2 collection systems,

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,620
coordination is essential.

00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,010
So that was all for
primary collection.

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:38,470
Thank you for listening.
