00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,250
Hi! Welcome to this module on the waste
generation and characterization.

00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,020
This is the outline of the module on the
things I would like to share with you.

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,680
First of all we'll discuss
why do we need this data

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,270
and what do we do with it?

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Then we'll look at a waste generation
in different countries across the globe.

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,050
Then we'll also look at key properties
of waste, especially composition,

00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,360
then we'll look at moisture,
density and also calorific value.

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,440
Finally we'll conclude by thinking about
how can we measure these parameters

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,100
and what are the important
things to consider.

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,940
So first, we need to ask the question:

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,440
what do we want to
know about waste and why?

00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,670
You might remember this
graph from previous modules.

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,600
That shows the different physical elements
of the waste management stream.

00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,270
Now, if our question is:

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,300
what measures do we want to introduce
for waste prevention and reduction?

00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,510
It is, of course, important to know
what's is generated in the household,

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,200
and what can be achieved
with such measures.

00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,760
If it's important to
know what the capacity

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,350
and the number of collection
vehicles that are necessary,

00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,140
then it's also important to know
what waste is generated in the household

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,750
which needs to be removed
and collected by vehicles.

00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,020
However, we want to
assess feasibility,

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,420
and the scale of a treatment option.

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,560
Then it's rather important to know

00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,370
what's entering the
treatment station at this point

00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,280
in the waste management stream,

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,200
and what needs to be processed.

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,550
If our interest is in
identifying recycling opportunities,

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,900
then of course we need
to know the composition

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,990
and the value of the waste generated.

00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,590
Finally, if we want to estimate
the life span of the landfill,

00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,020
then it's important to
measure waste amounts

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,640
that are reaching the landfill.

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,450
On waste generation,

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,330
let's look at this graph from the
global waste management outlook.

00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:27,645
What we see here is waste
generation per capita, per year,

00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:34,916
and on the x axis we see gross
national income per capita.

00:02:35,926 --> 00:02:40,216
What is clearly visible is
that, with increasing income,

00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:44,526
we have increasing
waste generation rates.

00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,566
Poor countries generate less waste,

00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:52,396
rich countries generate more waste.

00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:57,586
Another way of showing
this is on the global map,

00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:00,536
shown with different colors,

00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:06,026
low waste generation and high
waste generation in a darker blue.

00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:10,786
What you clearly see is
the African sub-continent,

00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:16,156
which generally has low waste
generation rates per person.

00:03:17,076 --> 00:03:23,276
Also, South Asia has quite
low generation rates per person.

00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,246
So what influences generation rates?

00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:33,626
The evidence is not so clear, but what
is certain is that it's lifestyle,

00:03:34,576 --> 00:03:40,616
degree of urbanization, and what we have
just seen previously, income level.

00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:43,626
Let me give you an
example of lifestyle.

00:03:44,216 --> 00:03:49,236
People that tend to not eat at home,
and eat outside of their home,

00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:53,126
they tend to generate
less waste at their house.

00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:56,586
That's a typical
phenomenon of lifestyle.

00:03:57,466 --> 00:04:03,116
More information on city generation
rates is available in this document:

00:04:03,316 --> 00:04:06,666
"What a waste a global
review of solid waste management",

00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,596
which can be found on the internet

00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,806
and can be downloaded free of charge.

00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:17,256
What's exciting in this
graph is a projection for 2025

00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:21,676
in categories of low
income, middle income,

00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:23,426
and higher income countries.

00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:29,586
What you can see clearly
here is that the increase

00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:34,456
will be mostly pronounced in
the lower middle income countries.

00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:39,866
This is mainly due to a
large population increase

00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:44,826
projected for 2025
in these countries.

00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,816
Now, let's look at
municipal solid waste composition.

00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:55,826
These pie charts show the different
fractions in municipal solid waste.

00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,766
What we are showing are
4 different pie charts,

00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,636
for 4 different income groups:

00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:06,206
low income countries,
lower middle income countries,

00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:09,536
upper middle income
countries, and high income countries.

00:05:10,326 --> 00:05:14,516
What we need to highlight is
that in low income countries,

00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:18,686
the organic fraction,
is significantly higher

00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:22,346
than the organic fraction
in high income countries.

00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:24,526
On the other hand,

00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:30,126
packaging waste, paper and
plastic in high income countries

00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:34,176
is much higher than it is
in low income countries.

00:05:36,646 --> 00:05:40,456
Remember that waste
composition may vary quite significantly,

00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:42,766
depending on the location.

00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,696
You see here the same pie chart from
the lower and middle income countries,

00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:48,806
and on the right hand side,

00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:53,376
you see the composition from
Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania.

00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:57,276
What is astonishing
is that in Nouakchott,

00:05:57,576 --> 00:06:02,346
only 5% of waste is organic.

00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:11,196
And typically in the lower middle
income countries, it's 53%.

00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,256
So, why is this?

00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:18,486
In Nouakchott in Mauritania, 
many households have goats

00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:21,336
or they have friends that have goats.

00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:26,686
And most of the organic material,
kitchen scraps from the households

00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,356
are fed to these goats.

00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:35,416
That's why the organic fraction in the
residue waste for collection is only 5%.

00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:40,396
On the other hand, there is a
significant amount of "others",

00:06:40,856 --> 00:06:47,066
which is mostly sand and stones given
the desert area of Mauritania.

00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:52,266
Another example is
this one from China,

00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:56,996
where we differentiate
between households using gas,

00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,336
and households using coal.

00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:07,256
And you see, the difference is
predominantly in the fraction of "others",

00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:12,026
which is mainly ash from using coal,

00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:14,916
which then, ends up
in the waste stream.

00:07:16,946 --> 00:07:22,356
This example shows how waste
composition affects collection.

00:07:22,796 --> 00:07:27,486
This is an example from
Indonesia where waste at the household

00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:30,996
has quite a large
fraction of sand and stones.

00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:38,036
Here the waste collection vehicle was
adapted by applying these mesh walls,

00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:41,246
which act as a sieve during transport,

00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:47,086
to let the sand fall out of
the waste collection cart.

00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:54,936
Now, let's look at other properties
of municipal waste, again,

00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:59,676
by low, middle, and
high income country.

00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:04,026
What you see clearly
is the moisture content,

00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:06,536
so the amount of water in waste

00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:10,496
which is significantly
higher in low income countries

00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,316
than in high income countries.

00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:18,236
Also, the density of waste
which is due to the moisture

00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:23,776
is significantly higher in low income
countries than in high income countries.

00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:30,816
Finally the lower calorific value
is lower in low income countries,

00:08:31,366 --> 00:08:33,556
and much higher in
high income countries.

00:08:34,636 --> 00:08:36,266
So why is this important?

00:08:36,856 --> 00:08:38,466
Let's focus on density.

00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:43,506
If we use such compactor
trucks as is shown here,

00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:48,916
these compactor
trucks compact the waste

00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:54,256
up to a specification of
500 kilograms per cubic meter.

00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:59,366
Now using such a truck,
under such conditions,

00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:02,736
does not really fulfill any purpose.

00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:06,226
Because the waste is already so dense.

00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:12,056
This truck however is very useful
in high income country conditions,

00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:17,566
where the waste is very
bulky and needs to be compacted

00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:21,706
to efficiently transport the waste.

00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:27,526
Finally let's look at another
property of municipal solid waste,

00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:29,266
the lower calorific value.

00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:32,706
This is a very rough formula

00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:36,816
to estimate the lower
calorific value of your waste

00:09:37,236 --> 00:09:41,216
based on the
composition of your waste.

00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:46,626
What's important is that the
result gives us an indication

00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:49,726
if the waste will burn or not.

00:09:50,466 --> 00:09:54,216
So for incineration
without adding fuel,

00:09:54,976 --> 00:10:00,976
we require a lower calorific value of at
least 1000 kilocalories per kilogram.

00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:05,086
If we want to incinerate 
and recover energy,

00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,006
then we will require a
lower calorific value

00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:13,026
of at least 1500
kilocalories per kilogram.

00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:21,476
In this formula, you see how the
different composition of wastes equate.

00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:28,926
Plastic equates quite strongly
in raising the calorific value,

00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:32,966
while the moisture
content, the water content,

00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:37,416
of course will negatively
influence the calorific value.

00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:45,256
As an example, now let's plug in the
numbers for a low income country.

00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:55,126
We have 6% paper,
2% textiles,

00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:59,876
and 53% biowaste,

00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:04,766
which would be the sum of
wooden leaves and food waste.

00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:17,716
Then we compute 90 times the 7% of
plastic minus 46 times 60% moisture,

00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:21,746
which is a typical
moisture content of such waste.

00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:30,416
If you calculate this, the result
is a 310 kilocalories per kilogram.

00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:36,016
This tells us that this kind
of waste here would not burn,

00:11:36,726 --> 00:11:39,524
and we would have to
add additional fuel

00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,030
if we would want
to incinerate it.

00:11:42,556 --> 00:11:46,686
Or, another option would
be to significantly dry it

00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:50,416
and lower the moisture
content in the waste.

00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:57,236
Before concluding, now let's
think of where and how to measure.

00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:02,076
In this module I won't give
you the necessary information

00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,036
for a measurement campaign.

00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:08,326
However I do want to
highlight a few main issues.

00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,876
First of all, you need to think.

00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:14,426
If you want to divide into sub-areas,

00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:17,826
that's important if
you want to understand

00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:21,986
how the different income
groups affect waste generation.

00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:26,306
What you will also need
to decide is on properties

00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:27,766
that you want to measure.

00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:32,966
What is always important,
is to ensure random sampling.

00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:37,746
To get the variation
of waste generation,

00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:42,736
we need to sample
over at least a week,

00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:48,536
and if possible, we should also
ensure multi seasonal sampling,

00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,436
to capture the seasonal variation.

00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:57,316
So let's summarize what
we've heard about in this module.

00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:03,536
We discussed the importance of
understanding what your questions are,

00:13:04,056 --> 00:13:07,166
before developing a
measurement campaign.

00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:10,426
Then we looked at waste generation,

00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:14,226
and showed how it
varies by country, by city,

00:13:15,356 --> 00:13:17,926
and how it correlates
to income and lifestyle.

00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,536
We also looked at composition.

00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:27,776
And the general rule is that low
income will have high organics,

00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:32,666
high moisture, and high
density, and low calorific value.

00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:37,656
And finally, we looked at 
some key issues

00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:43,866
in the measurement of waste
characterization and generation,

00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:49,836
which is capturing the variation
in the week and in the season,

00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:52,096
and ensuring random sampling.

00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:54,106
So thanks for listening.
