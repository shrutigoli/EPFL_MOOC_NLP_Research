00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:08,560
Hello and welcome to this course on
municipal solid waste management

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,170
in developing countries.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,260
My name is Chris ZurbrÃ¼gg, I
am a researcher at Eawag.

4
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,470
Eawag is the Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Science and Technology.

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,890
At Eawag, I work in the department
of Sanitation, Water and

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,570
Solid Waste for Development
abbreviated by Sandec.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:33,320
I have over 18 years of research
and practical experience on

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,350
various issues involving the
topic of solid waste management

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,580
in low income countries. 
This course is the third in a series

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,480
of e-learning initiatives jointly developed
by Sandec at the Eawag and EPFL.

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,840
The series covers the full range
of Sandec research activities.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,650
For more information on other
courses, please visit our website.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,580
With this first short introductory
module, I would like to introduce

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,750
you to the 5-week course program on
municipal solid waste management

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,230
in developing countries.

16
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,090
And on the way, we would like to
present it to you in a series

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:17,570
of video lectures, in video
quizzes and exercises.

18
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,470
We designed this course for
quite a broad audience.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,500
The main requirement for taking
this course is that you are

20
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,170
excited and passionate
about this topic.

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,180
You might be a student or a
practitioner working in an NGO

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,610
or as a consultant or even in
national or local government.

23
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,550
Our hope is that with this course,
you, wherever you are and

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,480
whatever you do, can make
a change for the better.

25
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,260
This change is desperately needed.

26
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,420
Increasing population and urbanization
results in increasing waste generation.

27
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,070
Most cities are finding it difficult
not only to cope with

28
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,700
the existing situation but also to
anticipate future trends and

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,860
prepare and plan for this.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,100
No or unreliable waste collection
results in waste accumulating

31
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,040
in neighborhoods and in
dangerous public health.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,420
Deficient treatment or disposal
severely pollutes the environment

33
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,650
and contributes to global warming.

34
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,990
Before describing the program, let
us first look at the learning

35
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,420
objectives of this course.

36
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,020
We hope that, after this course,
you understand the current

37
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,910
situation and relevance of
municipal solid waste management.

38
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,830
Remember, this course focuses on
low and middle income countries

39
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,510
and does not provide much information
regarding waste management

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,250
in OECD countries. Besides this
overall understanding, at

41
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,400
the end of the course, you should
be able to comprehend the key

42
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,760
issues of waste management, which
on one hand covers the physical

43
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,020
elements, starting with waste
generation collection transport

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,900
treatment and/or recycling, and
landfill disposal as well as

45
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,090
the role of stakeholders, key
management issues, as well as

46
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,530
governments and financial aspects.

47
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,190
Besides understanding the challenges,
you will learn about appropriate

48
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,280
and already applied solutions
through selected case studies.

49
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,400
So at the end of the course, you
should also know what can be

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,670
done and how to improve the situation.

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:34,050
The course will give a lot of
space to organic waste treatment.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,040
And after the various modules on
organic waste treatment,

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,180
you should know about the basic
principles of each and have a good

54
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,310
understanding of the pros
and cons of each option.

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,920
Finally you should be able to understand
some selected broader issues.

56
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,430
Now I shall pass the word to
Imanol Zabaleta to introduce

57
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,250
you to the concepts that underlie
the framework of this course.

58
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,240
Thanks Chris. Hi, my name
is Imanol Zabaleta.

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,570
I'm a researcher and project
coordinator at Eawag working together

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:15,430
with Chris at Sandec and also
dealing with issues pertaining

61
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,850
to solid waste management
in developing countries.

62
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,300
As Chris mentioned, waste 
management does not only involve

63
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,530
the waste related services
and infrastructure.

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,510
It also involves people, their
behavior and interactions, money,

65
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,230
laws and other aspects which are
often overlooked or neglected.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,650
Having a comprehensive and
well-structured overview of all aspects

67
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,790
involved in solid waste management
and their interactions

68
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,220
is therefore of utmost importance.

69
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,020
The integrated sustainable ways
management framework shown here

70
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,690
behind me provides such an overview.

71
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,280
This framework which was developed
in the 80's has been iteratively

72
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,340
improved since then.

73
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,320
The most recent version of the
framework, shown here, consists

74
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,560
of two overlapping triangles that
represent two sides of a solid

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,290
waste management system: the hardware
of the system, also called

76
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:20,120
physical components, and the software of
the system, the governance aspects.

77
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,620
This framework is becoming the norm
in discussion and assessment

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,960
of solid waste management systems
in different countries but

79
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,520
especially in low and
middle income countries.

80
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,760
We will use this framework throughout
the course as our backbone.

81
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,130
We adapted it into this
animated figure.

82
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,730
In week 1, after discussing
the relevance and importance

83
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,490
of this course, we will focus on
the physical elements

84
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,730
in the municipal solid waste
management chain.

85
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,620
That covers generation, collection,
treatment, tripollar components,

86
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,760
(phon) reduce and
recycle and disposal.

87
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,360
Week 2, we will then focus on
the governance aspects covering

88
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,890
various stakeholders involved with
their roles and responsibilities,

89
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,930
financial mechanisms as well as
institutional and policy aspects.

90
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,630
Week 3 and 4, we will then tackle
the different options for

91
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,410
treating organic waste. Throughout
the course, we will also

92
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,730
refer to it as biowaste, organic
material and biodegradable waste.

93
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,690
And finally week 5, we will
conclude with modules on selected

94
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,670
broader issues such as circular
economy, strategic planning,

95
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,460
performance benchmarking and the link
between the waste and climate change.

96
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,410
Given the time available, these
courses will not be able

97
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,750
to provide a larger level of details
on the wide range of topics

98
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,570
in municipal solid waste management.

99
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,950
Our goal is to get you really excited
about the topic and wanting much more.

100
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,540
In the various video modules
therefore we will refer to readings

101
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,160
on specific subjects which
typically can be downloaded on

102
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,800
the internet for free or else are
available on our website.

103
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,620
And remember that learning is fun,
and when sharing with others

104
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,870
then the added value of learning
significantly increases.

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,580
In that sense, we really
welcome you to join the forum.

106
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,720
In the forum, you can share your
experiences from your hometown,

107
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,470
from your travels and discuss
these issues together with other

108
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,570
colleagues enrolled in the course.

109
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,350
The course has quizzes during the
videos and homework quizzes.

110
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,460
Take these to test your learning.

111
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,400
We look forward to working
with you on this course.
