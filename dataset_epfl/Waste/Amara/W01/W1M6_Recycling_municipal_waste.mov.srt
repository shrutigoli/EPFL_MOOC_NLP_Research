1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,160
Hi, and welcome to
this module on recycling.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,240
Recycling is one of
the three components

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,720
of the resource
recovery aspect, or triple R.

4
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,670
This includes:
Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,100
Reduction is mainly
achieved by policy interventions.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,950
As an example, we can mention
the prohibition of plastic bags

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,000
by the government of Zanzibar in 2011.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,850
Whereas reuse of waste is
practiced every day all around the world,

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,740
and it is easy to
understand what it means.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,810
Here you see a picture of how
electronic waste can be reused

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,440
to make beautiful jewelry.

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,080
Reduce and reuse, are
pretty straightforward terms.

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,500
Consequently, this module
will focus on recycling.

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,400
We will see how 4
of the main municipal

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,040
solid waste fractions are recycled:

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,260
these are paper and
cardboard, glass, plastics and metal.

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,460
We will see all this
with real case examples

18
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:03,940
from low- and middle-income countries.

19
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,710
Let's start with paper.

20
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,420
Paper and cardboard,
which are produced from pulp,

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,080
derived from plant
fibers, primarily wood,

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,190
are used for many different products

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,640
such as for packaging material,
newsprint, and advertisements.

24
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,130
Most of these products
have very short lifetimes,

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,410
and thus constitute a
major fraction of most waste.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,600
We distinguish 3 types of waste paper:

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,830
post-consumer paper, these are for
example newspapers and magazines;

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,330
corrugated board, most of the
times obtained from commerce;

29
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,350
and high-grade paper,
printing paper for instance,

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,960
often coming from businesses.

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,290
The paper recycling
process involves several steps.

32
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,320
Let's have a look to
some Asian examples.

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,580
The very first step is
sorting and removing impurities.

34
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,310
Waste paper has different prices,

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,180
depending on its color and thickness.

36
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,140
These 2 women in Philippines are
breaking books apart, page by page,

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,100
and sorting them
according to their color.

38
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,610
The next step is
repulping or grinding,

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,210
which can be done mechanically,

40
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,920
as shown in this plant of
Campul in India, or chemically.

41
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,240
Mechanical repulping yields lower
quality paper than chemical repulping.

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,810
After repulping, the paper is
mixed with water to produce a slurry.

43
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,370
This slurry is then
thickened before being pressed.

44
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,090
Bleaching or whitening is optional.

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,300
After being pressed,
the paper is dried,

46
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,140
and is then ready to be
sold as sheets or rolled.

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,920
Recycling of paper will never
be able to close the loop fully.

48
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,070
This is due to 2 reasons:

49
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,550
first, paper mass is being lost by
the storage of paper in archives,

50
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,070
offices, in building materials etc.

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,920
And second, the shortening
of fibers during repulping

52
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,820
induces to a quality loss, in
particular with respect to strength.

53
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,320
To compensate, recycled paper
should weigh 5 to 15% more per area,

54
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,430
or should be mixed with virgin pulp.

55
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,340
Let's mention some interesting
figures about paper production

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,440
and trade in the world.

57
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,920
Total world consumption of
paper and paperboard in 2012

58
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,540
was around 400 million tons,

59
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,600
to which Asia
contributed 45%, almost half.

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,040
Europe contributed 26%
and North America 21%.

61
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,220
But now, how much of all this
amount is actually recycled?

62
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,100
Hard to tell.

63
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,760
It seems that the majority of
paper worldwide is landfilled.

64
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,820
Although, it is also
true that recycled paper

65
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,000
is an important part
of the raw material

66
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,840
used in the pulp and paper industry,

67
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,830
and is traded on a
market that is global.

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,430
Transboundary trade totals 40
to 50 million tons per year,

69
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,010
around 10% of the total production.

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,440
This trade is now dominated by
the People's Republic of China,

71
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,400
who imported a net quantity
of 30 million tons in 2012.

72
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,820
This is around 70% of
all transboundary trade.

73
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,800
Okay.

74
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,040
But, how beneficial is
recycling paper for the environment?

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,890
This table here shows
us the inputs needed

76
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,750
in terms of wood
for example, or water,

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,440
and electricity, and
the residues and emissions

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,900
generated in the
production of 1 ton of newspaper.

79
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,240
However, we compare how much
it would cost to produce it

80
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,610
from virgin materials and
from recycled materials.

81
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,120
And then the last column
shows us the comparison.

82
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,290
Here we see that actually the
production from recycled materials

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,370
is able to reduce wood consumption,

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,030
as well as water and
electricity consumption.

85
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,760
However it increases
considerably the energy consumption,

86
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,500
as well as the residues
and emissions emitted.

87
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,370
In any case, according to
several life cycle assessment studies,

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,390
recycling has a better
environmental performance

89
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,800
than landfilling and
incineration of paper.

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,980
Especially, when the logs
not needed due to recycling,

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,320
continue in the natural
cycle acting as carbon sinks.

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,550
Finished with paper.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
Now, what is all
about glass recycling?

94
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,150
Glass is used for many purposes,

95
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,060
but in the waste, system
glass is predominantly found

96
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,850
in terms of beverage
and food containers.

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,530
There are 3 types of glass:

98
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,960
soda-lime glass is used for
bottles, jars, drinking glasses etc.

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,700
It is produced in 3 different colors:

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,430
clear as in the
picture, green, and brown.

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,690
The second type is crystal glass,

102
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,680
which is used for high quality
drinking glasses, vases and art.

103
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:03,280
And finally, we have
borosilicate glass, also called Pyrex,

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,890
which is used for
laboratory glassware.

105
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,780
This one is corrosion
and temperature resistant.

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,060
Only soda-lime glass matters
in waste, due to its big amounts

107
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,920
and it is the only one that
can be recycled by re-melting.

108
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,530
Should not be of course mixed
with the other 2 glass fractions.

109
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,840
Glass can either be
reused, which will be ideal,

110
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,960
or recycled in 2 different ways.

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,840
Glass can be broken, and then
this broken glass is called "cullet",

112
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,390
and it is remelted and used for
the production of new bottles.

113
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,630
But glass can also be used as
substitute of other building materials,

114
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,490
such as gravel and fillers.

115
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's have a closer look to a glass
recycling plant in Manila, Philippines.

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,230
First, the cullet is
obtained from storage,

117
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,490
and it is manually
separated and washed.

118
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,980
Then, this broken glass is
introduced in the furnace, to be remelted.

119
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,210
The melted glass is just
for production of new bottles

120
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,020
which are later sold again.

121
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,480
Cullet has advantage that
it prolongs furnace life,

122
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,200
as it melts at lower temperatures.

123
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,410
As long as contaminants are removed,

124
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,460
there is no quality loss of
glass in the recycling process.

125
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,430
Once colored cullet is mixed
however, the quality degrades.

126
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,000
Compared to paper,
that we already saw,

127
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,500
or plastic and metals,
that we will see later,

128
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,130
the global market of
glass is not so big.

129
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,200
Virgin materials are
abundant and accessible

130
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,590
in most parts of the
world at a reasonable price.

131
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,770
Here again, we have a similar
table comparing the production of glass

132
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,860
from virgin materials
and from recycled glass.

133
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,670
We see the different amounts
of inputs that are required,

134
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,130
and the different amounts
of waste water and emissions

135
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,980
that are generated.

136
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,720
The results show that, actually,
recycling reduces most of these inputs

137
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,120
and also the outputs
in considerable amounts,

138
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,260
meaning that recycling glass
has environmental benefits.

139
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,930
Let's now talk about plastics.

140
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,460
Plastic is produced from fossil oil.

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,910
As a curiosity,
about 4% of the petroleum

142
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,550
consumed worldwide each
year is used to make plastic.

143
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,660
And another 4% is just to power
plastic manufacturing processes.

144
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,360
Plastic is used for
many different products,

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,930
many of which have
very short lifetimes

146
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,410
and thus constitute a
major fraction of waste.

147
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,110
In plastic production, fossil
oil is distilled to fractions

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,430
containing a mixture
of hydrocarbon chains.

149
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,370
These are cracked into repeating
molecular units, called monomers.

150
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,580
The monomers are
synthesized into polymers,

151
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,220
forming the base material,
for example granulate or powder.

152
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,270
Based on their chemical difference,

153
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,310
we distinguish
different types of plastics,

154
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,260
which are shown here with their names

155
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,320
according to the Plastic
Industry Trade Association.

156
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,630
Plastic recycling presents 2 problems:

157
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,020
on the first hand, it
contains plenty of foreign items

158
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,360
and contaminants,
such as organic waste.

159
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,810
On the second hand,

160
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,680
different plastic types
are often mixed together.

161
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,070
When mixed plastics
are recycled together,

162
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,390
the material loses
its cardinal feature,

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,060
which is great strength and
flexibility at small dimensions.

164
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,470
In any case, plastic recovery can
be divided into 2 overall classes:

165
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,210
energy recovery and material recovery.

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,050
Energy can be recovered in the
form of heat and electricity.

167
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,840
Material recovery can be
done in 2 different ways:

168
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
either chemical recycling,
also called feedstock recycling,

169
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,400
or mechanical recycling.

170
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,750
Chemical recycling breaks down
the plastic into its monomers,

171
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,480
and then these monomers are used in
refineries to produce new plastics.

172
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,270
Whereas in mechanical recycling,
we distinguish the following steps:

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,250
the first step is sorting.

174
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,240
These operators in Bangkok are
sorting different plastic colors and types.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,700
Then, sometimes material needs
to be prepared for transportation,

176
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,500
and that requires compacting.

177
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,080
This can be done with a truck, as
shown in this movie from the Philippines.

178
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,130
Once the material arrives to the
installation, it needs to be washed,

179
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,020
in order to remove organic
waste remains and impurities.

180
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,420
The washed plastics are later dried.

181
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,220
Once they are dried, the
plastic is cut into chips.

182
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,170
The chips are then
ready for extrusion.

183
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,340
When mixed colored chips
of plastic are extruded,

184
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,130
we obtain a black
plastic as shown in the movie.

185
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,000
This finalized plastic is
then ready to be palletized.

186
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,640
Some global facts:

187
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,820
the plastic global production
in 2014, was of 300 million tons.

188
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,640
40% by weight of world
production takes place in Asia.

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,120
China on its own, produces
25% of the world production.

190
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,340
North America and
Europe cover each 20%.

191
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,200
The annual volume of globally
traded waste plastics is around

192
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,160
15 million tons,

193
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,670
less than 5% of the
new plastic production.

194
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,710
This shows that recycling of
post-consumer plastic waste is

195
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,830
still in its infancy.

196
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,940
Is it better to burn
plastics or to recycle plastics?

197
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,710
Depending on the plastic type,

198
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,260
the production of plastic
containing 1 unit of energy as materials

199
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,030
can take approximately 1.

200
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,340
8 units of energy to produce.

201
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,000
Therefore, the environmental
benefits of incineration of plastic

202
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,630
in global terms should be questioned.

203
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,760
Here again, we have one table
comparing the environmental impacts

204
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,640
of producing 1 ton of high
density polyethylene granulates,

205
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,540
both from virgin materials
and from recycled materials.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,050
Except for solid residues,
which are increased considerably,

207
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,340
the production used
in recycled materials

208
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,370
reduces all the other
environmental parameters measured here,

209
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,800
in very big amounts.

210
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,000
This concludes that
recycling plastics has in general

211
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,620
more environmental benefits
than not recycling plastic.

212
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,310
Our last fraction for
this module is metal waste.

213
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,320
Iron and aluminum and the
main metals found in waste.

214
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,780
They are produced from mineral ore
and used for a range of products,

215
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,490
some having very short
lifetimes such as packaging of cans,

216
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,580
foils and containers and
others having a very long lifetimes,

217
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
such as materials in
buildings and construction.

218
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,200
The types of steel and aluminum that
are being recycled are metal scrap,

219
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,060
originated in industries,
constructions and demolitions,

220
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,600
end of life vehicles, and
post-consumer waste, mainly

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,570
packaging.

222
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,270
This last fraction is
the least attractive

223
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,290
because it is very
mixed and not clean.

224
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,180
The recycling process of
metal involves several steps.

225
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,790
The very first is
cleaning the material;

226
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,000
this might involve the
tinning, the coating,

227
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,400
and the oiling.

228
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,830
Once the material is
cleaned and sorted,

229
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,170
this is introduced in the
furnace and is smelted again.

230
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,500
In this video we see
how operators in Bangkok

231
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
introduce metal scrap in the furnace.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,270
The smelted metal is then
used to generate new products.

233
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,880
It is interesting to point
out that a clean metal scrap

234
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,260
can be recycled
without loss of quality.

235
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,920
Recycling of post-consumer
metals has a long history.

236
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
More than a third of all the aluminum,

237
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,550
as well as of all the steel
currently produced globally,

238
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,620
originates from old
traded and new scrap.

239
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,510
The trading market of scrap is global

240
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,180
but it's again
concentrated mainly in Asia.

241
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,450
Approximately 50% of all the
recycling plants existing in the world

242
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,670
are located in the Asian continent.

243
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,280
17% are located in Europe and
20% are located in North America.

244
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,570
One of the environmental
impacts of metal recycling:

245
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,080
the virgin materials for steel
and aluminum production are limited

246
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,560
and are not easily
accessible and have high energy costs.

247
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,770
Re-melting the scrap
saves a lot of energy,

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,740
making room even for long
distance bulk transportation

249
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,240
around the world for its recycling.

250
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,310
Once more here we see the
comparative table of producing steel

251
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,770
from virgin materials
and recycled materials.

252
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,670
We see that in this case, except
for the amounts of scrap consumed,

253
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,260
which obviously increase for the
productions based on recycled materials,

254
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,340
all the other parameters
again will reduce considerably,

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,670
both emissions and input materials.

256
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,300
This means that, obviously,

257
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,340
recycling still has
more environmental benefits

258
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,450
than producing it
from virgin materials.

259
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,050
Now that we saw how
materials are recycled,

260
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,060
let's have a look to the
recycling rates of 39 different cities

261
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,020
around the world.

262
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,710
This data covers both dry
recyclables and organics and,

263
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,550
where possible, rejected
amounts were corrected.

264
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,780
The figures show no clear relationship

265
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,140
between recycling
rates and income levels.

266
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,940
Indeed, the highest
recycling rates are achieved

267
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,620
in high-income countries.

268
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,060
But many middle- and low-income
countries also achieve high recycling rates.

269
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,760
This is the end of the module.

270
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,040
In this module we learned
recycling of municipal waste.

271
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,560
We mainly focused the module on
4 very common waste fractions.

272
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,590
Those are paper,
glass, plastic, and metals.

273
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,840
We covered some production data,

274
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,380
we also saw the recycling
process of each waste fraction,

275
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,180
we saw some interesting
global facts about each one,

276
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,070
and we also mentioned some
important environmental aspects.

277
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,920
For those interested in getting
more information about the topic,

278
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:06,180
we recommend to consult
the following key readings.

279
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,040
Much of information used in this
module was also taken from here.
