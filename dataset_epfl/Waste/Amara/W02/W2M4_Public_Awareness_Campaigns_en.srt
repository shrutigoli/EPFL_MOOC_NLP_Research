00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:05,931
Hi!

2
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:07,866
It's my pleasure 
to introduce Sanjay Gupta.

3
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:12,758
In this module, he will present the case
of a public awareness campaign in India.

4
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:15,082
Sanjay Gupta, the floor is yours!

5
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,557
Thanks, Chris.

6
00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:18,300
This is the story of a campaign

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:21,483
in a 1 million plus city
called Coimbatore in India,

8
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:24,449
where a mass awareness program
was organized

9
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,240
for improving segregation and recycling
using the Guinness Record as motivation.

10
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:32,880
My name is Dr. Sanjay K. Gupta

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,321
and I work with the [Start Consulting]
in Switzerland,

12
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:38,079
and I provided the key
conceptual and strategic guidelines

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,987
for conducting this campaign.

14
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:41,696
Most of us know

15
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:46,010
that getting people to participate
in segregation and recycling practices

16
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,260
is often a big challenge.

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,800
We also know that typically,
awareness campaigns are activities

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,669
organized and [inaudible]
by either municipalities

19
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:57,050
or NGOs as a one-time affair.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,722
So, there are awareness campaigns
for [inaudible]

21
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:04,451
and there are awareness campaigns
which sell [inaudible] to entire community.

22
00:01:05,323 --> 00:01:10,050
In this module, I would like to present
an example of such a campaign

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,765
where a reason was shared
with a large community.

24
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:16,973
It is called the Coimbatore Guinness
Championship Campaign 2015.

25
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:18,742
The attempt was made

26
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,808
as part of achieving
the Guinness World Record

27
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,928
for largest recycling lesson

28
00:01:22,928 --> 00:01:24,092
at a single venue.

29
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,902
As I stated, Coimbatore region in India

30
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:31,295
is one of the most industrialized
cities in South India.

31
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:35,606
It is the second largest city
and urban agglomeration

32
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:38,786
in the state of Tamil Nadu,
which is the eleventh largest state

33
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,937
and the second largest economy in India.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,900
Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation,
or CCMC as it is popularly called,

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,596
has taken several steps to improve
solid waste resource management system

36
00:01:51,596 --> 00:01:54,920
in compliance with the municipal
waste management and handling rules.

37
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:59,744
Though CCMC has good infrastructure
for waste management,

38
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:03,602
it did not spark
resource segregation and recycling.

39
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:06,118
Resource recovery watch
are a mere six persons

40
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,622
due to lack of awareness,
training of LX&Q

41
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:11,717
and absence
of appropriate collection methods.

42
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:18,117
As the world is moving toward 3R principles
of reduce, reuse, and recycle,

43
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:23,043
CCMC envisioned a unique campaign
to bring awareness and capacity building

44
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,001
of all stakeholders
including municipal staff,

45
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,333
citizens, civil society organizations,

46
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,863
with a key emphasis on students
at the schools and colleges.

47
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,046
Its objective was to create

48
00:02:34,046 --> 00:02:36,455
a more sustainable
solid waste management system

49
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,773
focusing on resource recovery 
and recycling

50
00:02:39,773 --> 00:02:44,339
and Guinness Book of World Records
was used as an attraction and motivation

51
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,615
for the community
to be part of this history,

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,674
and it mainly targeted the next generation

53
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:53,510
of ten to 18 year old students
as the change agents;

54
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,079
and it was an attempt

55
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:57,884
at a culture and behavior
change initiative

56
00:02:57,884 --> 00:03:00,231
to get community stakeholders aligned

57
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:03,011
with the new waste management
system of the city.

58
00:03:03,865 --> 00:03:06,730
As you can see, the campaign organizers

59
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,321
shared the vision [inaudible]
with the stakeholders.

60
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:13,151
You can see all the logos
of those organizers which were part of it,

61
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,980
ranging from elected representatives
to industry, market associations,

62
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,139
resident associations, local NGOs,

63
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:24,092
and they were able to garner
the maximum support.

64
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,312
Many of them also pitched in
financial contributions

65
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:31,367
to support the campaign besides
their own time and voluntary work,

66
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:34,198
and many of these had never
partnered with municipality

67
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:37,936
or contributed financially,
but this time they did

68
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:41,959
after setting the regional
waste management services for the city.

69
00:03:43,086 --> 00:03:47,574
The Guinness campaign event was 
widely publicized through various media

70
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:53,394
including print, banners, leaflets,
radio, local television, website,

71
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:59,256
SMS, Whatsapp group, mobile missed calls,
on and offline registration forms.

72
00:03:59,917 --> 00:04:04,662
Whatsapp group messages and radio
turned out to be very effective mediums

73
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,136
to make people aware on what is going on.

74
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:11,645
As the campaign got closer,
the publicity was intensified

75
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,641
to capture the attention of the public,

76
00:04:13,641 --> 00:04:15,399
again using the same mediums

77
00:04:15,966 --> 00:04:21,160
and constant and consistent reminders
were sent to SMS and Whatsapp messages

78
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,830
and also it included mobile vans
that went around the city

79
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,080
informing the public about this campaign.

80
00:04:30,653 --> 00:04:35,264
Here we see the commissioner of Coimbatore
explaining the rules for setting up

81
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,318
this Guinness Book of World Records.

82
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:41,572
The event was conducted
as per the stringent rules

83
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,331
of the Guinness Book of World Records

84
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,759
through video recording of all evidences.

85
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,340
It had also an independent team
of qualified auditors

86
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,015
for physically verifying
each and every aspect of the attempt

87
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:55,049
before declaring the results.

88
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,660
Here we see a massive turnout
of students and participants

89
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,386
queuing up to enter the hall,
to attend the recycling lesson session.

90
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:06,639
The participants' entry was video recorded

91
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,528
with electronic barcode machines
and mobile labs

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,121
and the final electronic count
of participants stood at 12,994.

93
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:18,353
The lesson plan was designed
for 45 minutes

94
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:21,149
divided into four distinct
interactive sessions.

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,823
These are some of the snapshots
of the largest recycling lesson

96
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,395
in progress.

97
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:29,041
The methodology included
visual slide presentations

98
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:33,668
on large LED screens,
verbal instructions from facilitators,

99
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:36,792
and demonstrations
which were live streamed.

100
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:40,109
Interactivity was built in
to ensure participation

101
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:44,612
and a set of activity flash cards
that were given to the participants.

102
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:48,448
This was followed by explaining
what is the methodology of CCMC

103
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,984
that has adopted to collect waste
in a very source-segregated manner

104
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:54,260
from the households.

105
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,337
A practical demonstration of the post card

106
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,492
with all the segregation system

107
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,317
was put there that you can see
in picture three and four of this slide.

108
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:09,656
This, you can see another picture of
the largest recycling lesson in progress.

109
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:14,716
The first part of the session
was an icebreaker

110
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:17,637
to a funny anecdote involving Yamarāja

111
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:20,641
or the god of death
according to Indian mythology.

112
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,632
As the caretaker of Hell,
Yamarāja is faced with a space crunch

113
00:06:25,632 --> 00:06:29,533
and he tries to find
another plug-and-play space for hell,

114
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,437
and he stumbles upon
dump sites in the country

115
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,075
which are even worse than hell,

116
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:36,131
to punish those who commit sins.

117
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:40,823
He describes the current behavior
of waste management by people as sins

118
00:06:40,823 --> 00:06:43,457
and the dump sites as hell on Earth.

119
00:06:44,294 --> 00:06:45,973
The participants were to answer,

120
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,247
"Where the hell
are the dump sites in their city

121
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:52,573
and what is the name of that hell,
or the place, the dump site?"

122
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:58,739
The second part was an interactive session
of source-do-and check activity

123
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:01,973
that's explaining
for identifying different major streams

124
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,769
into organics, inorganics and hazardous

125
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:07,595
to provide a clear understanding
of the segregation.

126
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,722
From the set
of colorful pictures and flashcards,

127
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,300
the participants identified types of waste

128
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,648
which needs to be put in appropriate bins.

129
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,839
A formative assessment
was built into the session plan

130
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,312
to check the correctness of their choice
and learn from their own mistakes, if any.

131
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,299
This picture was to reinforce
the role of the citizen,

132
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:33,098
what they need to do
and what they need to promote

133
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:35,867
as green ambassadors
for their own localities.

134
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,691
One key element of this campaign

135
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:44,621
is that the students were requested
to take the contest card home

136
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,776
and practice it for seven days

137
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:49,743
and also doing the segregation
at their own home.

138
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:55,063
They were informed that 1,200 postcards
with six category source separation

139
00:07:55,063 --> 00:07:59,429
has been pressed into service
for litter free and bin free system

140
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,941
for most of the wards.

141
00:08:03,656 --> 00:08:05,420
After the lesson was completed,

142
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,222
the adjudicator or Guinness

143
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:10,955
accepted that the record attempt
has been successfully completed

144
00:08:10,955 --> 00:08:14,594
following all guidelines, and handed over
the certificate to the commissioner.

145
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:16,737
This is the photo where you can seeº

146
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:20,233
the adjudicator giving the certificate
to the commissioner.

147
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,866
This is another picture showing

148
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:27,115
the Guinness Book
of World Records certificate

149
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,425
and how many people and organizations,
volunteer associations

150
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:34,039
who contributed and participated
in this record-breaking attempt.

151
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:40,316
Recycling girth since then has gone
from a mere 6% to 23 %

152
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:41,759
in the last few months.

153
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:46,597
That means dumping of recyclables
and compostable waste reduced by 23%,

154
00:08:46,597 --> 00:08:49,613
or nearly 120 plus tons
per day in this city.

155
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:55,316
This one single campaign
encouraged other similar campaigns

156
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,954
like Zero Waste Wars
and Happy Street Campaigns.

157
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,789
You can see it in the pictures,

158
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,040
where the roads were cleaned,
they were decorated,

159
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,292
children played games over it

160
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:08,032
and Coimbatore also became
the first city in India

161
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,826
to segregate waste
in six different categories

162
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:14,235
partially by the households, and partially
by the trained collection team.

163
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:19,168
As I stated, the Guinness campaign
triggered many more such

164
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:21,447
community [OMS]
initiatives in Coimbatore.

165
00:09:21,714 --> 00:09:24,476
No Food Waste became
one of the hit campaigns

166
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:28,821
that picked up steam, actually,
after this campaign was completed.

167
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:32,911
The leftover food from five star hotels,
restaurants, marriage parties,

168
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:37,968
were collected, kept very safely,
and distributed to the poor in the city.

169
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,797
This is still going on.

170
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:44,503
Many engineering graduates,
who had read in the past about recycling,

171
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:47,939
chucked their jobs and took it
as a social enterprise,

172
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:51,903
the business of recycling
as a social enterprise after the campaign.

173
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:59,315
To conclude, I can say that it requires
a very well thought out strategy

174
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,118
to run any campaign
and get the momentum going

175
00:10:02,118 --> 00:10:04,121
to get any tangible results.

176
00:10:04,652 --> 00:10:07,669
It is also important
to install the system in advance

177
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,674
to get the public familiar with it.

178
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:14,831
The idea is the system should be in place
before organizing a campaign

179
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:18,681
so that people can start practicing
immediately after learning the lessons

180
00:10:18,681 --> 00:10:21,118
or the messages of the campaign.

181
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:24,819
One should also find a way
to share the results of the campaign

182
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:26,489
with the public.

183
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:29,096
For example, one can share
the recycling weight.

184
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,574
One can also share with them

185
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,794
that a new door to door collection system
has been put into place.

186
00:10:33,794 --> 00:10:38,275
One can also share how much
organic waste is being composted now

187
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:40,822
so that you can ensure further action

188
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:44,499
both from the municipal staff
as well as from the citizens.

189
00:10:45,261 --> 00:10:47,890
Finally, thank you
for giving me this opportunity

190
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,567
to share the experience with one and all.

191
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,913
Thank you.
