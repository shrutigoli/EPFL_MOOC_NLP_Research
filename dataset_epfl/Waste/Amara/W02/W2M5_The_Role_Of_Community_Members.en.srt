00:00:04,542 --> 00:00:06,709
Welcome to this module
on community members

2
00:00:06,709 --> 00:00:08,666
in solid waste management.

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:11,587
By now, you should be aware
that keeping a solid waste service

4
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:13,833
running is financially demanding

5
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:16,791
and requires know-how and infrastructure.

6
00:00:16,792 --> 00:00:19,791
Public and private
solid waste service providers

7
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:23,791
often fail or are unable to supply
an adequate service,

8
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:27,791
especially in areas that are difficult
to access by conventional services

9
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:33,167
such as low-income neighborhoods
or in rapidly growing residential areas.

10
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:35,974
Consequently, in many cities
around the world,

11
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,793
neighborhoods organize themselves
to find a solution to the waste problem

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,379
and obtain services
for their own benefit.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,040
Members of communities,
for example residents,

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,240
are key stakeholders in the solid waste
management process,

15
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,510
since they generate and store waste,

16
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,249
benefit from the service,

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,001
and in many cases are also the client,
the payers for the service.

18
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:01,478
In this module, we will focus on
the involvement of community members

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,568
in the solid waste management service,

20
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:07,229
which is of utmost importance
and is often neglected.

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,060
Let's start clarifying some terms.

22
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:13,550
What is a community?

23
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:16,970
In this context, a community is
a group of users of a service

24
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:21,510
who live in the same area
and have access to and use

25
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,072
the same service.

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,750
This could be households
in a neighborhood, for instance.

27
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:29,293
When these communities
share social features,

28
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,791
such as cultural and religious ideas,

29
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:34,251
or have similar socio-economic interests,

30
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,793
the concept of community
becomes even stronger.

31
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:40,834
This often helps to stimulate
participation of people.

32
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:43,293
Community members can play different roles

33
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:46,291
and present different
levels of involvement.

34
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,274
Let's see some examples.

35
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,534
Community members can change
their sanitation behavior.

36
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,792
For instance, adapting
to the collection timetables,

37
00:01:55,793 --> 00:01:58,792
keeping their house
and immediate surroundings clean,

38
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:01,744
or source separating.

39
00:02:01,745 --> 00:02:05,303
Problems arise when residents
give low priority

40
00:02:05,304 --> 00:02:07,053
to solid waste management

41
00:02:07,054 --> 00:02:10,423
and have low willingness to co-operate.

42
00:02:10,424 --> 00:02:15,120
Often, residents had bad experiences
with solid waste services

43
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:18,761
and do not want to have any of these
activities next to their homes.

44
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:23,750
This is also called "Not In My Backyard".

45
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,374
These issues have often been tackled

46
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:31,166
organizing competitions at city,
neighborhood or household level

47
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:36,250
or providing discounts for those
who participate in solid waste management.

48
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:40,333
This was done in SIRDO Recycling
Projects in Mexico, for instance,

49
00:02:40,334 --> 00:02:44,249
where vegetables were sold
cheaper to those households

50
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,542
separating organic waste.

51
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:51,751
Community members can also contribute
directly by paying the fees regularly,

52
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:56,918
donating equipment,
or contributing in labor.

53
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,956
Concerning payments of fees,

54
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,816
low ability to pay and low willingness
to pay are common issues.

55
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:07,507
The second one occurs especially
when communities perceive

56
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:09,710
that fees are unfair,

57
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:14,006
or that the waste service is unreliable
or not satisfactory.

58
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:17,999
Three possible solutions for this
are paying the collectors

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,539
based on their performance,

60
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,019
to change the ways fees are collected.

61
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,689
For instance, combining them
with other utility bills,

62
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,959
such as the water or the electricity bill,
or to cross subsidize.

63
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:35,974
They can also participate
in service and consultation

64
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:39,959
organized by CBOs to talk about
the needs and problems

65
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:43,970
of the community regarding
solid waste services.

66
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:48,090
And finally, participating
in administration and management,

67
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:51,281
which is the highest level
of community participation.

68
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:55,481
To this end, community members
may take part in a city-wide

69
00:03:55,482 --> 00:04:00,124
stakeholder meeting or committees,
become members of CBOs

70
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:03,500
directly involved in the provision
of waste collection services

71
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,526
or environmental education,

72
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:09,766
or participate in decision-making
during meetings.

73
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:13,228
We would like to point out three
types of community members.

74
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,750
These are leaders, women, and youth.

75
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,809
Let's have a look
to how they can influence

76
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,765
the solid waste management system.

77
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:26,516
Community leaders might manage
solid waste services

78
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,796
by becoming members of committees

79
00:04:28,797 --> 00:04:31,546
or CBOs established for this purpose.

80
00:04:31,547 --> 00:04:34,384
They can also keep in contact
with the municipality

81
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:37,876
in order to communicate
about the co-ordination of primary

82
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,963
and secondary collection systems

83
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:44,406
or exercise political pressure
or forward complaints.

84
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,945
And finally, they are the key stakeholders

85
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:50,227
to keep in contact with the community.

86
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:53,601
In many cultures, women
are responsible for keeping

87
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:56,441
the home and it's immediate
environment clean.

88
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:59,029
But their voice is seldom heard.

89
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,037
And their participation
in community decision-making

90
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:05,268
should be improved and highlighted.

91
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,012
Unemployed adolescence discovered
the income generating potential

92
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,863
of solid waste services.

93
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:16,485
Normally the youths want a material reward
for their participation or effort.

94
00:05:16,486 --> 00:05:19,774
Children, too, often carry out daily tasks

95
00:05:19,775 --> 00:05:22,977
such as bringing waste
to the communal collection point,

96
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,548
as shown in the movie.

97
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:29,446
Until now, we talked about the community

98
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,603
and some specific community members,

99
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,502
such as leaders, women, and youth.

100
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,500
But what happens
when they organize themselves?

101
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,917
Then we talk about
community-based organizations

102
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,960
also abbreviated as CBOs.

103
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,187
These are formed when some
community members

104
00:05:48,188 --> 00:05:52,083
organize themselves to provide,
for instance, a solid waste

105
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:56,452
service in a specific neighborhood
or village in a rural context.

106
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:58,704
They can be driven
by different motivations,

107
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,269
such as cleaning up
their neighborhood,

108
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,028
or earning an income
from solid waste.

109
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,669
The most common example
is the primary collection of solid waste.

110
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,810
Other examples may include
the sale of recyclables,

111
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:16,027
recycling on its own,
and composting activities.

112
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:21,253
CBOs can present different
organizational structures.

113
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:23,960
They can work together
with micro enterprises,

114
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,251
where generally, the CBO
has a management

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,239
and supervision task,

116
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,542
while the micro enterprise is responsible
for operating the service,

117
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:36,272
driven by its income generating aspects.

118
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:39,231
Government institutions can assist CBOs

119
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,751
by providing them supervision,
financial control or support.

120
00:06:42,752 --> 00:06:48,870
While the CBO carries out the operation
and management of the service.

121
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,290
Or CBOs can be combined with NGOs.

122
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:56,511
In this case, NGOs usually set up a CBO
as a development project.

123
00:06:56,512 --> 00:06:59,751
which later they supervise,
provide financial assistance

124
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:03,112
and technical support,
and also train and recruit

125
00:07:03,113 --> 00:07:07,502
members of the management
committee and operators.

126
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:11,502
CBOs operate the service.

127
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:14,262
Setting up a CBO is often not a hard task.

128
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:16,751
The difficulty is to keep it ongoing.

129
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:20,791
Why? Because various problems might arise.

130
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:23,834
Here we distinguish management problems,

131
00:07:23,834 --> 00:07:27,500
operational problems, financial problems,

132
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:31,249
and failing co-operation
with municipality.

133
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,249
Management problems occur

134
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,459
when there is low willingness to manage,

135
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,249
which was often solved by training

136
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,792
and providing exchange visits
of the management committees,

137
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:46,958
increasing their motivation
or by ensuring assistance

138
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,041
and moral support
on behalf of the municipality.

139
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,793
This is an issue of particular importance.

140
00:07:53,794 --> 00:08:00,541
Often CBOs are a voluntary activity
carried out by a motivated individual.

141
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:04,666
Voluntary actions by experience
show not to be long lasting

142
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:09,293
since these schemes often stop
when the individual gives up the activity.

143
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:14,293
However, solid waste management needs
to be ensured in the long run.

144
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:18,514
That's why an enterprise approach
is often more sustainable.

145
00:08:18,515 --> 00:08:21,390
Problems might also arise
when the management board

146
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:24,980
is not representative
of the community, ethnic groups,

147
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:29,209
there is gender imbalance,
or it consists of outsiders.

148
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,019
Having seen management problems,

149
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,501
now let's have a look
to operational problems.

150
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,873
Operators are often unsatisfied
due to low salaries,

151
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,918
the low status of the job,
and bad working conditions.

152
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,419
Possible solutions to these issues
include increasing collected fees

153
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:49,278
by using cross-subsidizing schemes
for example

154
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:52,542
or by providing special
benefits to the operators,

155
00:08:52,543 --> 00:08:56,523
such as medical assistance,
food, accommodation, etc.

156
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:58,917
And providing them,
of course, with facilities,

157
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:02,500
gloves, boots, collection cards, etc.

158
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:07,293
On top of being unsatisfied,
operators often have no or little

159
00:09:07,334 --> 00:09:10,168
expertise in solid waste
management issues

160
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,167
and are, therefore, unprofessional.

161
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:16,254
This can be solved by providing
them with training.

162
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,705
The previous two problems often
lead to an unreliable service

163
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:21,333
on behalf of operators.

164
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:24,501
Involving them in decision-making
appears to be an incentive

165
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:26,523
for them to perform better.

166
00:09:26,542 --> 00:09:32,267
Also, paying them based on
their performance improves the service.

167
00:09:32,268 --> 00:09:35,670
Other operational problems
might arise from competition

168
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,457
on behalf of the private
and the public sector.

169
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,168
And finally, space seems to be
an important constraint

170
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:45,756
for waste treatment and sorting projects.

171
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:49,999
Financial problems might arise
due to the following issues:

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,751
low ability to pay
on behalf of households,

173
00:09:52,751 --> 00:09:56,458
which could be avoided
by cross-subsidizing schemes,

174
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,418
or due to inadequate fee collection.

175
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:03,370
This is often due to the lack
of rigorousity of fee collectors.

176
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,612
Other reasons could include
the absence of sanctions

177
00:10:06,613 --> 00:10:10,791
for non-payment and lack of legal
obligation to pay.

178
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,500
Both issues involved lead
to cost recovery problems,

179
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:18,868
which are discussed in the modules
about financing mechanism.

180
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:23,541
Problems might also arise
when co-operation with municipality fails.

181
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:27,293
Many times it is difficult
for big municipalities to connect

182
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,378
and co-ordinate with hundreds
of tiny CBOs.

183
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,185
However, sometimes a municipality
or solid waste agency

184
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:37,729
can also obstruct CBOs in various ways.

185
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:41,563
Either directly by hampering
the performance

186
00:10:41,564 --> 00:10:43,777
of community-based services.

187
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,126
The bad co-ordination
between primary and secondary collection

188
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:50,185
is one of the most common examples.

189
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:54,940
Or indirectly by refusing assistance
to provide legal, financial

190
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:58,496
or promotional support.

191
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:01,959
Why is community management
desirable at all?

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,516
Several benefits exist
of having communities

193
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:07,171
manage their solid waste service.

194
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:12,167
First, it creates social cohesion
and networks among residents.

195
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:17,174
Second, it can trigger some peers
social pressure to participate.

196
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:21,839
Third, it facilitates cross-subsidies
for those that cannot pay.

197
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,986
For instance, in Karachi, Pakistan,

198
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,766
widows that have very little income,

199
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:31,350
are exempted from payment
but still got service from the CBOs.

200
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,046
Fourth, it adapts the service
to the local needs and conditions.

201
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:40,132
And with the priorities and capacities
of the men and women concerned.

202
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,611
And ultimately, when co-operating
with the private and the public sector,

203
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:48,511
it allows to provide solid waste
services to a larger population.

204
00:11:50,547 --> 00:11:52,736
This is the end.

205
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:55,181
In this module we learned about
community members

206
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,782
and the roles in solid waste management.

207
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,625
Community-based organizations are formed

208
00:12:00,626 --> 00:12:04,152
when residents of a confined
area are organized.

209
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:07,559
These CBOs can provide different
services to the community

210
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,789
including solid waste management.

211
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,051
They can be driven by different
motivations, such as having a clean

212
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,754
neighborhood or earning some money.

213
00:12:15,755 --> 00:12:19,485
We also saw different
organizational structures of CBOs.

214
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:21,765
They can partner with micro enterprises,

215
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:24,980
local government agencies and NGOs.

216
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:29,818
Finally, we mentioned several social
and management problems CBOs face,

217
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:32,876
as well as some of the benefits
of community management.

218
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:35,518
We hope you learned something.

219
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,021
This module was prepared
using this document shown here.

220
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:42,085
Those of you who would like to get
more insights on the topic,

221
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,806
I recommend you to have a look
to it on the Internet.
