00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,160
Hello and welcome to this
module on private sector involvement

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,320
in municipal waste services.

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,670
This can be a quite
political sensitive topic, given the

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,860
relevance of solid waste
management as a public good.

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,560
But let's be clear from the start.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,370
In this module, we are not talking
about transferring responsibility

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,940
of solid waste management.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,650
Responsibility, independent
of who operates the service,

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:35,120
always remains with local government.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,350
Regarding private sector
involvement: in literature, you will

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,270
often come across the
two terms PSP or PPP,

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,920
Private Sector Participation
or Public-Private Partnerships.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,050
This can include a lot of things
in terms of scale of enterprise,

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,160
starting from the very
small and informal,

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,770
to the large national or even
international enterprises.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,320
There are also different levels of
privatisation being joint-venture

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,000
of an enterprise with the public
sector, or even the involvement

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,500
of community groups or
non-governmental organizations.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,560
This is also the
object of another module.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,390
In this module, I shall focus on
the formal private sector involvement,

21
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,530
as seen from a municipal
viewpoint, but also cover the opportunities

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,580
of small and medium
enterprises in waste management.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,270
My main message, in this
module, is not to advocate blindly

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,410
for the private sector, but
rather show what conditions should

25
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,660
be considered so to allow the
private sector participation

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,420
that it has a good chance
to improve the situation.

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,700
Why would a municipality consider
engaging with the private sector?

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,790
From a municipal viewpoint, a
frequent reason for engaging with

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,590
the private sector is increasing
 efficiency and lowering cost.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,070
However, efficiency is
driven by competition.

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,230
The private sector, usually,
also has more flexible procedures

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,660
and procurement rules, 
less bureaucraty.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,840
Increasing efficiency, may
also allow to expand coverage

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,380
to areas not yet serviced.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,290
Experience from Latin America,
Malaysia, for example, has shown

36
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,240
a decrease in cost, by 20 % to 50 %.

37
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,200
One other aspect may be the easier 
access to the private sector to capital

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,660
as compared to a public utility;

39
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:49,720
also, the flexibility in deploying
 human resources, for instance

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,430
in hiring the necessary
expertise, if needed, or laying off

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,680
personnel which is not performing.

42
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,200
Finally, another reason may be to free 
solid waste from political interference.

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,500
One key precondition for
successful private sector participation

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,790
is a balanced partnership
with the municipal authority.

45
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,400
If the private sector is
very dominant, then,

46
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,160
there are risks for disaster.

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:27,700
The same if the municipal authorities
 are very dominant and can decide

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,690
in contractual terms over the private sector.

49
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,640
Besides balanced partnership,
another precondition

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,660
for successful private sector 
 participation is competition, 

51
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,380
competition by different private
sector enterprises.

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,330
This keeps prices low.

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,140
If there is a monopoly by one enterprise, 

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,790
that might even increase the price of service.

55
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,420
Further preconditions are
clear objectives and precise contracts.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,170
What that means is a very careful

57
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,490
preparation of the tender
documents by the municipal services.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,630
What it also needs is adequate
monitoring and enforcement by

59
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,640
the client, the
municipal, authorities, and

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,730
to ensure regular
payment to the private sector

61
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,900
for the services rendered.

62
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,620
Finally, the last precondition
I want to mention here is public involvement.

63
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,220
The residents, the public are
actually the beneficiaries of the service.

64
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:48,580
Involving the beneficiaries, especially in monitoring,

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,620
and giving feedback on service quality is essential,

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,320
but also in preparation of

67
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,520
private sector enterprise involvement
 in solid waste management services.

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,930
This table shows different
options of collaboration with the

69
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,060
private sector by the municipality.

70
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,500
Contracting, where a
fixed term contract is awarded,

71
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,320
based on competitive procurement, 

72
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,070
and the service is paid by government.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,420
Similarly, franchising,
where, however,

74
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,520
the revenue sources come through direct
charges to the beneficiaries.

75
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,220
And finally, to highlight
maybe the open competition, where

76
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,820
the government grants a
license, and allows the private sector

77
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,840
to compete for service provision.

78
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,930
Private enterprises built the
service directly to the customers.

79
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,230
One special case is the
involvement of small and medium enterprises.

80
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,680
One advantage is that small
medium enterprises are close to home.

81
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,420
That means they're quite closely
 connected to the beneficiaries.

82
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Often, they are
people from the same neighborhood,

83
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,380
working in the neighborhood.

84
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,250
They can also adapt their
services to the individual needs of

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
the beneficiaries, of the
people in the neighborhood.

86
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,360
However, usually their services are
 limited to neighborhood service.

87
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,910
That means primary
collection and recycling in the neighborhood.

88
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,160
And because they're limited to
the neighborhood service, 

89
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,600
they have to coordinate with the
next step in the waste management chain

90
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,220
which is
typically the municipality.

91
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,780
For the municipality,
engaging with many small enterprises

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,880
is quite difficult to manage.

93
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,520
One solution forward is
to build larger groups,

94
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,350
cooperatives, or consortiums.

95
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,320
Let me highlight one case study
from Douala and Yaoundé in Cameroon.

96
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,940
Here, the municipality gave contracts
 to the private sector.

97
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,730
Exact targets and even
the schedule frequency

98
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,000
were defined in the contracts.

99
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,880
The tonnage of waste
collected was monitored daily

100
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,200
for neighborhoods which were
difficult to access by large trucks.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,690
The enterprise entered into
agreements with community-based

102
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,900
organizations, for primary collection.

103
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,370
Since private sector
involvement, the collection coverage has

104
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,820
now increased up to 80 % to 90 %.

105
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,680
The private enterprise was
given a five years contract, 

106
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,260
so they were also able to
recover their investment costs.

107
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,000
The company now has contracted
with fourteen towns and cities

108
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,840
throughout the country, and
it has won the Africités prize

109
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,600
for Waste Management in 2009.

110
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,980
Another example is the
municipality of Maputo in Mozambique.

111
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,080
The city of Maputo is divided
in two different administrative districs.

112
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,930
The
municipality provides waste collection

113
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,810
services across the city.

114
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,720
Inner city waste collection
and secondary collection in 

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,280
the suburban areas are covered
 by a private large scale operators,

116
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,700
with public containers and compactor trucks.

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,460
The city councils own
operation covers the residential areas

118
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,470
in the inner city with
door to door collection.
The city councils own
operation covers the residential areas

119
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,500
in the inner city with
door to door collection.

120
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,250
Based on various experiences
with NGOs, the city council

121
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,000
implemented primary collection
system for the suburban neighborhoods.

122
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,070
Primary collection in these areas
is provided by micro enterprises,

123
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,450
with manual door to door
collection and hand cars.

124
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,450
The city's ambition was to
extend primary collection to areas

125
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,180
that would be difficult to reach
with modern collection equipment.

126
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,460
Monthly waste fees are
attached to the electricity bill.

127
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,190
This module is particularly
interesting, because fees increase

128
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,230
according to the social
economic level of the users.

129
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,780
Currently, thirty five micro
enterprises or associations are

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,680
contracted by the Maputo city
council and are servicing over

131
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,160
900 000 people living
in the suburban areas.

132
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,680
This model has become a
great success for the government.

133
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:54,580
And here is one example of micro
enterprise involvement in Managua, Nicaragua.

134
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,420
Collection services are
provided by the municipality,

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,920
but only on the main roads. 

136
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,160
However, collection by motorized tricycle

137
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,760
is provided to the households 
through these small entreprises.

138
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,060
Revenues are from user fees
 and mainly from recyclables.

139
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,620
What is
important, however,

140
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,150
is that the municipality ensures that
there are transfer stations

141
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,160
available for these micro enterprises,
which are operated by the municipality.

142
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,600
This even includes sorting and 
storage sheds for the recyclables.

143
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,980
Let me summarize what we
talked about in this module.

144
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,560
We looked at private sector
involvement as opportunity

145
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,680
for increasing efficiency and lowering cost.

146
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,220
We also saw that it needs a lot
of capacity at local government level

147
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,520
to prepare the tender documents,

148
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,120
but also to monitor and supervise the service.

149
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,440
Competition helps a lot to
keep prices low,

150
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:11,310
and it's important to include the
public in the whole procedure.

151
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,400
Finally, we ended with
showing a few case studies.

152
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,560
If you're interested in reading
more about private sector involvement

153
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,080
in solid waste management, I
can recommend these three books.

154
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,940
They are available on our
website for free download.
