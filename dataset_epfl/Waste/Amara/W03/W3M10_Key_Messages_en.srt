00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,400
Let's revise what we
learned this week.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,600
On this third week, we focused on
the treatment of organic waste.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,550
We learned the basics of two very
common organic waste treatment

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:18,380
technologies, namely composting
and anaerobic digestion.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,860
Remember, composting is a controlled
decomposition of raw organic

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,910
material into compost, which is
carried out by microorganisms

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,890
in the presence of oxygen.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,580
We distinguished the active phase,
when temperatures can reach

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,120
up to 70 degrees and thermophilic
bacteria are active, and the

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,020
curing phase, when both temperature
and oxygen consumption drop

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,160
and mesophilic bacteria are active.

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,650
In a different module, we covered
the main important operational

13
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,950
parameters that need to be considered
when composting is carried out.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,540
These are: Carbon/nitrogen ratio,
particle size and porosity,

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,450
moisture content, pH, and
temperature and climate.

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,840
We then introduced different
composting technologies which are

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,230
commonly used in low- and
middle-income countries.

18
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,920
Do you remember their names?

19
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,580
For instance, which one is the
one on the bottom right, or the

20
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,280
one on the top left?
I hope you remember!

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,260
We compared these 5 technologies
regarding 5 different criteria:

22
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,470
Investment and maintenance cost,
space and time required,

23
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:37,310
as well as labour needed. In order
to provide you with a more hands-on

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,280
feeling of composting, we introduced
2 very interesting study cases.

25
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,100
One from Dhaka in Bangladesh,
shown on the picture on the left,

26
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:50,420
and one from Temesi, Indonesia,
shown on the picture on the right.

27
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,610
We then moved to learn about
anaerobic digestion, as a treatment

28
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,290
technology for biomass.

29
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,940
Anaerobic digestion is a collection
of processes, where, similar

30
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,360
to what happens during the
composting, microorganisms break

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,260
down biodegradable material. However,
in this case, this happens

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,450
in the absence of oxygen.

33
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,590
Anaerobic decomposition happens in
a 4-step biochemical process,

34
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,010
which happen partly simultaneously.

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,250
These are: hydrolysis, acidogenesis,
acetogenesis, and methanogenesis.

36
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,290
This is an interesting technology,
because it generates methane,

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,740
which is flammable and can be
used as source of energy.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,950
Similar to composting, the anaerobic
digestion also has important

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,450
operational parameters that
need to be considered.

40
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,810
In this case we have: feedstock
 characteristics, such as total

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,600
solids or volatile matter content,
organic loading rate, pH,

42
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,840
temperature, hydraulic retention
time, carbon/nitrogen ratio,

43
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,020
and particle size. We then saw
different anaerobic digestion

44
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,960
technologies, which are suitable
for a low- and middle-income

45
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,100
country context; all of them wet,
continuous feeding, and mesophilic.

46
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,080
What about their names?

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,980
Do you remember them?

48
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,290
We then proceeded to learn some
hints on how to operate and

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,820
maintain anaerobic digestion plants.

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,320
We looked at how to dewater, store,
and make use of the produced biogas.

51
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,710
And we also discussed important
criteria, favouring the choice

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,140
of anaerobic digestion as
a treatment technology.

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,790
And finally we learned how to
calculate the volume of a fixed-dome

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,860
reactor for the example of a
school with 250 students.

55
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,800
In the coming modules, we will
introduce some more innovative

56
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,730
technologies to treat organic waste.

57
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:47,870
See you then!
