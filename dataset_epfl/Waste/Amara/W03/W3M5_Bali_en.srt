00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,120
Hi.

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,640
Welcome to this module where
I'll present a composting case

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:08,690
study from Bali, Indonesia.
Welcome to this module where
I'll present a composting case

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,460
study from Bali, Indonesia.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,880
As you can see, I even put on my batik
shirt for this special occasion.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,440
First of all, I would like
to thank David Cooper.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,890
He is the initiator of the Temesi
recycling center that we'll

8
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,950
be talking about, and he provided us with
most of the background information.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,860
In Indonesia, the island of Bali
is most famous for its beautiful

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,210
nature, landscape and beaches.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,920
Given this situation, Bali is also
Indonesia's primary travel destination.

12
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,450
But tourism, littering, lack of
appropriate waste management

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,400
service are jeopardizing
this pristine situation.

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,180
Waste is often burned at the
roadside, disposed indiscriminately

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,040
in the countryside,
rivers, and canals.

16
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,970
Thus polluting beaches
and even coral reefs.

17
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,450
The Rotary Club of Bali in Ubud
started addressing this problem

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,980
of waste, and sponsored a waste
recovering facility in Temesi,

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,730
which is in the regency of Gianyar,
where also the city of Ubud is located.

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,660
In 2004, a pilot facility for
waste recovery with a capacity

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,460
of about 4 tons per day was
built in the village of Temesi,

22
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,600
on the old landfill site.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,750
At this pilot facility, the composting
procedures were learned and optimized.

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,950
A state of the art research station
and a fully equipped laboratory

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,330
were also established at that pilot
site, and they also received

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,410
international academic support
by visiting researchers.

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,560
This pilot facility operated
until June 2007, and had already

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,470
gained wide local and international
attention, and thus of course

29
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,140
raised high expectations for a
future large scale facility.

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,660
By 2007, they then felt that all
required knowledge and experience

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,020
had been established to be able
to expand the capacity from

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,480
4 tons to 60 tons per day.

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,220
But they did this stepwise.

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,600
In 2008 the first phase of such
a large facility with a waste

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,400
processing capacity of 30
tons per day was completed.

36
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:44,480
Then, in the second half of 2009,
an expansion to a final 60

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,200
tons of waste per day began, and it
was operational in January 2010.

38
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,920
The old pilot plant area was
converted into an environmental

39
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,550
park and an environmental
education center.

40
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,480
This is the layout of the recycling
center: a roofed area covers

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,880
a large part; the waste separation
area; the shredding area;

42
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,960
the composting area; 

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,920
and the sieving
and bagging area.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,650
The roof is to avoid heavy
rainfalls in the rainy season and

45
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,020
keep the rain out of
the composting heaps.

46
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,850
Here you can see this large roofed
area, and also the delivery

47
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,180
of waste at the bottom
left in this red truck.

48
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,950
Temesi's focus lies on organic waste.

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:48,140
Given the waste characteristics
in Bali, 85% of this waste is

50
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,770
organic and biodegradable.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,790
This organic fraction is
processed into compost.

52
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,120
After arrival of the waste at
the site, the waste is sorted

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,480
by a cooperative of recyclers.

54
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,580
The recyclers separate 85% of the
organics and 7% of other recyclables

55
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,420
from the waste.

56
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,930
The recyclables are sold to
nearby agents and middlemen.

57
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,580
And the organics are sold to
the Temesi facility, at 45,000

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,320
Indonesian rupiah per ton.

59
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,620
That's around 3. 3 US dollars.

60
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,650
About 8% are residues, not organic,
and of no recycling value.

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,140
These are disposed of at
the landfill close by.

62
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,620
If the biodegradable waste has large
components in it, these are shredded.

63
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,300
Then the biowaste is piled to
large heaps called tables.

64
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,530
The tables are turned with a
front loader every two weeks.

65
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,350
The compost tables are actively aerated
by radial centrifugal air blowers.

66
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,310
It showed that axial propeller fans
did not give the expected results.

67
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,930
During this whole active composting
period, which lasts around

68
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,480
3 months, the composting parameters,
temperature, oxygen and

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,300
moisture, are always measured.

70
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,360
The compost is left for
another 1 month to mature.

71
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,350
So finally after a total period
of 3 to 4 months, the compost

72
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,260
is sieved and bagged for sale.

73
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,390
Main customers are the tourism
industry, hotels for their gardens

74
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,060
and parks, but also landscapers
and home gardeners.

75
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,750
This scheme summarizes the
treatment steps: starting off with

76
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,730
waste separation, receiving the
biodegradable fraction, shredding

77
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,700
if the components in the waste
are too large, piling the waste

78
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:57,810
onto heaps, here called tables,
active aeriation of these tables,

79
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:03,710
and turning every 2 weeks and 1
additional month for maturation,

80
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,150
then sieving and bagging with
quality control also at the end.

81
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,620
One important factor is also
the education center.

82
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,280
It often receives schools and other
visitors, to create awareness

83
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,230
of the waste issue and
educate on recycling.

84
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,160
So much for the technical details.

85
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,400
But there are also other factors
that make this case so successful.

86
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,120
A major milestone of the project
was to transfer the ownership

87
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,610
and management of the facility
to a new foundation.

88
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,520
This was in December 2008.

89
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,240
What was created is a private
public partnership: the Yayasan

90
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,840
Pemilahan Sampah Temesi.

91
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,040
That stands for Temesi Waste
Separation Foundation.

92
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,100
It is firmly anchored in the village
and the village administration.

93
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:02,470
Also, vulnerable women have an
equal opportunity to participate

94
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,260
in the project.

95
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,890
It is a declared employment policy
of the project to give priority

96
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,600
to the needy.

97
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,330
Then, since August 2009, Temesi operates
with a quality control system.

98
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,810
It ensures product quality, work
discipline, and consideration

99
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,580
of consumer satisfaction.

100
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,480
It has a quality manual, operating
procedure, and work instruction manual.

101
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:37,950
From an economic perspective, Temesi is
a registered CO2 mitigation project.

102
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,960
It obtains carbon credits,
which have a certain price.

103
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,860
It has a partnership with a large
international travel agency,

104
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,400
where the customers of the travel
agency can compensate their

105
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,020
CO2 emissions through a voluntary
compensation fee, buying these

106
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,320
carbon credits for Temesi.

107
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,050
For the compost sales, main
customers are the tourism industry,

108
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,850
the hotels for their gardens and
parks, but also landscapers

109
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,920
and home gardeners.

110
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,670
Temesi is reported to be
economically sustainable.

111
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,780
If the compost can be sold at
410,000 Indonesian rupiahs per

112
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,050
ton, that's around 30
US dollar per ton.

113
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,240
All in all, the Temesi site
recycles 92% of the waste, which

114
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,360
extends the lifespan of the landfill
by more than a factor of 10.

115
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,100
Developing this recycling center
and compost facility had a

116
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,460
large impact not only on the
environment, by transforming the

117
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:48,700
old disposal site into a nice
recycling center, into a well-managed

118
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,170
and attractive recycling facility.

119
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,030
This activity also shows that you can
create employment opportunities,

120
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,890
and it shows that improvements are
possible and waste management

121
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,810
is not a dirty and polluting activity.

122
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,150
In fact, due to its success, the
facility received various awards

123
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,840
and recognitions nationally and
internationally, for its performance

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,220
and its sustainability.

125
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:21,260
Well, that was the composting case
of Temesi, in Bali, Indonesia.

126
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,920
Let's summarize a few
important aspects.

127
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,250
First of all, aspects of
technical sustainability.

128
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,620
Simple, functional, technical
approaches were used.

129
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,750
They started small and learned
on the way to larger scale.

130
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,920
They also put a strong focus on
always ensuring quality of the

131
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,290
process and quality of the product.

132
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,600
They also had the aspect of social
and organizational sustainability,

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,700
by integrating it into the village
setting and creating employment

134
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,510
opportunities for the vulnerable, the
aspect of economic sustainability

135
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,370
by ensuring a market demand for
the compost, and the element

136
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,100
of obtaining additional revenues
through the carbon credit scheme.

137
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,220
In the next module, we'll look at
other biowaste treatment approaches,

138
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,710
besides composting, so stay with us.
