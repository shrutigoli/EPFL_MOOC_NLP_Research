00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,000
Congratulations, you made
it through week 5.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,590
In this last week, we learned
about assessment and planning

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,260
methods for municipal
solid waste management.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,440
Let's briefly summarize the
main contents of the week.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,570
We started the week by introducing
a planning strategy to integrate

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,220
biowaste management in the general
solid waste management strategy

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,630
of a municipality. Having a good
segregation of biowaste

8
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,350
is of utmost importance
for this integration.

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,280
This strategy consists of several
steps, such as framing

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,200
the problem, deciding objectives and
eliciting their weights, assessing

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,150
the performance of the selected
alternatives, and finally scoring them.

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,130
We then introduced the wasteaware
indicator set, as a comprehensive

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,210
and structured approach, which serves
to compare cities'performance

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,690
on solid waste management.

15
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,620
Here we see all the indicators
for the physical components and

16
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,290
governance aspects listed on the
left, and the score of 4 different

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,800
cities for each of these indicators.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,130
Climate: such an important topic.

19
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,520
And of course the solid waste management
also has an impact on it, as we saw.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,220
Waste management practices
generate greenhouse gases.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,400
Nevertheless, we saw that there is
reduction potential, depending

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,160
on the management chosen.

23
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,990
In the past, several economic
mechanisms were established,

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,440
in order to trade emissions, such as
the Clean Development Mechanism.

25
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,420
And now, with new mechanisms
such as the Nationally Adapted

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,160
Mitigation Actions, or
NAMAs, this will continue.

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,600
And finally, our last module,
which you will probably still

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,270
have fresh in mind, gave us an
indication of the future role

29
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,550
of waste management. Linear
management of both biological and

30
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,230
technical materials should have
an end, and a shift towards

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,010
more circular patterns
should be achieved.

32
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,220
This is the last course module.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,500
Chris, why don't you join
me for a last goodbye.

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:06,890
Thanks Imanol.

35
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,220
First of all, congratulations
and well done!

36
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,530
But now for a personal request.

37
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,230
We need your help.

38
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,280
During the entire course, you've
been listening to us from

39
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,690
behind the screen, and we
know a little about you.

40
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,410
We need your help with a last
important contribution.

41
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,910
Please tell us how you can,
and how you will be able

42
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,200
to make use of this gained
knowledge: in your job, or in the

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,610
development of your
professional career.

44
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,350
Thank you so much.

45
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,280
Use this knowledge.

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,620
Everybody can make a difference.

47
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,970
Goodbye.

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,170
Goodbye.
