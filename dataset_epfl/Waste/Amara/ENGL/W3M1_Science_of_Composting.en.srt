00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,611
Hi! And welcome to this module
on the science of composting.

2
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:13,494
Composting is a common term 
that all of us have heard or read,

3
00:00:13,494 --> 00:00:16,804
and it is not at all a new practice
as some of you might think.

4
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,974
<i>Did you know that there is evidence</i>

5
00:00:18,974 --> 00:00:21,344
<i>that Romans knew about compost?</i>

6
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:25,864
<i>Or that George Washington 
used to produce and promote it?</i>

7
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:30,355
Being such an old practice, 
it probably had something of interest.

8
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,275
But do you actually know
what composting is?

9
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:35,355
Is it true that we get a fertilizer?

10
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:37,235
Or does it always smell bad?

11
00:00:37,235 --> 00:00:40,905
In this module you will learn
those and more aspects.

12
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:44,865
<i>Composting is a controlled decomposition 
of raw organic material</i>

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:49,775
<i>into biologically stable humic substances,</i>
<i> also called compost.</i>

14
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:53,873
<i>This is carried out by microorganisms
 in the presence of oxygen.</i>

15
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:58,553
<i>The final product, compost, 
is stable, doesn't degrade further,</i>

16
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:02,049
<i>and it can act as an excellent 
soil amendment.</i>

17
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:06,539
<i>Let's now have a closer look </i>
<i>to what exactly happens during composting.</i>

18
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,491
<i>The first ingredient we need
 is raw organic material,</i>

19
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:13,631
<i>such as food waste, yard waste,
 manure, agricultural waste,</i>

20
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:16,381
<i>municipal organic waste, etc.</i>

21
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,581
<i>These materials are broken down
 into smaller particles</i>

22
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:22,011
<i>and are later piled up.</i>

23
00:01:22,011 --> 00:01:25,211
<i>This breakdown can be natural
 or controlled.</i>

24
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,261
<i>When natural, first, 
the compost pile is made</i>

25
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:30,261
<i>and then the breakdown happens,</i>

26
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>which is carried out by earthworms,
 nematodes, and soil insects</i>

27
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,761
<i>such as mites, sowbugs, 
springtails, ants and beetles.</i>

28
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,938
<i>When controlled, first, 
operators break down large particles</i>

29
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,978
<i>through grinding, shredding
 or chopping, as shown in the video,</i>

30
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:49,118
<i>and then, they prepare the pile.</i>

31
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,709
<i>Breakdown in this case
 is a preliminary step.</i>

32
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:54,679
<i>Of course, the controlled breakdown</i>

33
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,899
<i>is much faster 
than the natural breakdown.</i>

34
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:00,159
<i>Once optimal physical conditions
 are established, </i>

35
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,159
<i>microorganisms naturally found in soils
 colonize the organic material</i>

36
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,759
<i>and initiate the decomposition process.</i>

37
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:10,559
<i>Soil bacteria, fungi, 
actinomycetes and protozoa</i>

38
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,519
<i>are the most commonly found
 microorganisms.</i>

39
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,969
<i>The decomposition process 
can be divided into two phases.</i>

40
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,709
<i>The active and the curing phase.</i>

41
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,109
<i>During the active phase, 
temperature increases rapidly</i>

42
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:26,192
<i>due to the metabolism of microorganisms.</i>

43
00:02:26,192 --> 00:02:32,952
<i>In 24 and 72 hours, 
temperature can rise up to 55 to 70 °C.</i>

44
00:02:33,148 --> 00:02:36,328
<i>This temperature increase 
hygienizes the material</i>

45
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:38,308
<i>by killing pathogens,</i>

46
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,578
<i>it also contributes 
to eliminate weed seeds,</i>

47
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,628
<i>and it breaks down phytotoxic compounds.</i>

48
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:48,478
<i>Under these conditions, thermophiles,
 those microorganisms that function</i>

49
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:53,982
<i>at temperatures higher than 41 °C,
 take over the decomposition activity.</i>

50
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,778
<i>The active phase normally 
goes on for several weeks.</i>

51
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,958
<i>During this time, oxygen and water
 need to be replenished</i>

52
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,178
<i>in order to ensure the activity
 of the microorganisms.</i>

53
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:08,958
<i>Once all the easily degradable 
or digestible materials are eaten,</i>

54
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:13,558
<i>the activity of the thermophiles
 will drop, and the curing phase starts.</i>

55
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:18,178
<i>This is characterized 
by a temperature dropped to 37 °C.</i>

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,250
<i>Oxygen concentrate also drops,</i>

57
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,980
<i>and mesophilic bacteria
 recolonize the pile.</i>

58
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,100
<i>The decomposition of organic materials</i>

59
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,680
<i>continues into stable humic substances.</i>

60
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,550
<i>There is no clearly 
defined time for curing,</i>

61
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,290
<i>it can take as long 
as one month to one year,</i>

62
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,790
<i>depending on feedstocks,</i>

63
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,030
<i>composting method used
 and management.</i>

64
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,640
How do we know when compost is finished?

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,230
Compost is considered finished
when the raw feedstocks

66
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,490
are no longer and actively decomposing,

67
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,140
and are biologically 
and chemically stable.

68
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,140
The parameters that I use 
for this purpose are:

69
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,640
Maturity and Stability.

70
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:58,271
Maturity is usually defined 
as the degree of humification.

71
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,101
Conversion of organic compounds
to humic substances,

72
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:04,911
which are most resistant 
to microbial breakdown.

73
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,781
Stability, on the other hand, 
is indicated by temperature

74
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,961
and oxygen consumption.

75
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:12,511
Measuring compost stability
is normally easier

76
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:14,151
than measuring maturity.

77
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,861
The most clear indication 
of a stable or finished compost pile

78
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:19,231
is when the temperature 
at the center of the pile

79
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:21,081
returns to near ambient,

80
00:04:21,081 --> 00:04:25,171
and when the oxygen concentrations
in the air cavities inside the pile

81
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:29,171
remain greater than 10%
for several days.

82
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,288
Once the curing phase is over,

83
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:34,788
depending on the final use of compost
and the origin of the organic material,

84
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,618
the operators might want to separate
possible impurities,

85
00:04:37,618 --> 00:04:39,968
such as plastics or metals,

86
00:04:39,968 --> 00:04:43,968
or oversized and not fully composted
chunks of organic waste.

87
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,808
Wood, for instance.

88
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:49,188
This is done by sieving 
the mature compost.

89
00:04:49,808 --> 00:04:52,498
<i>Sieving or screening 
usually takes place</i>

90
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,798
<i>before or after the curing phase.</i>

91
00:04:54,798 --> 00:04:58,508
<i>It is used for two purposes, 
to separate impurities</i>

92
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:01,078
<i>and to produce a range 
of products grades </i>

93
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,038
<i>suitable for various end uses,</i>

94
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,278
<i>such as soil conditioning 
mulching or others.</i>

95
00:05:06,278 --> 00:05:10,498
<i>Often, the organic oversized 
is fed back into the processing system,</i>

96
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:13,228
<i>so that they breakdown fully.</i>

97
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:17,228
<i>There are engine driven sieves as well as
 more simple and low tech sieves.</i>

98
00:05:17,228 --> 00:05:20,218
<i>As long as they accomplish their goal
 of diverting impurities</i>

99
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:23,438
<i>and separating the compost 
into different particle sizes,</i>

100
00:05:23,438 --> 00:05:25,048
<i>all of them are valued.</i>

101
00:05:25,048 --> 00:05:27,478
<i>In each location, one or the other 
should be chosen</i>

102
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,058
<i>based on the local capacities and needs.</i>

103
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,510
So after sieving, we should
have our final product.

104
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:38,180
Are you guys aware 
of what happened here?

105
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,850
We started with something like this,
which is raw organic material,

106
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,835
in this case from my kitchen,

107
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:51,535
and we ended up with a good looking,
fresh and very well smelling compost,

108
00:05:51,535 --> 00:05:54,934
ready to be applied 
in anybody's garden or field.

109
00:05:55,494 --> 00:05:58,234
But actually, what is the added value 
of adding this compost

110
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,544
to your soils or to your fields?

111
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,344
Let's have a look today.

112
00:06:02,344 --> 00:06:06,064
Compost has many advantages.
Here we will mention five.

113
00:06:06,064 --> 00:06:08,824
On the first hand, it represents 
an organic matter source,

114
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:12,774
which improves the chemical, physical,
and biological characteristics of soils.

115
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:16,308
Then, it also contributes
to water retention,

116
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:20,308
it promotes soil structure by increasing
the stability of soil agregates,

117
00:06:20,308 --> 00:06:24,308
it increases soil fertility 
and cation exchange capacity,

118
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:26,688
and although it contains nutrients,

119
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:29,648
its value does not rely 
on its fertilizer capacity,

120
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,118
fertilizing capacity.

121
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:35,358
However, it can reduce 
fertilizer requirements up to 50%.

122
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,710
Let's quickly refresh 
what we learned on this module.

123
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,860
In this module, we learned first
about the composting process,

124
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,800
including the active 
and the passive phase,

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,570
and their distinct 
process characteristics.

126
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,440
Secondly, we also learned 
about maturity and stability,

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,260
as two process parameters 
that we can use to determine

128
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,410
when compost is finished.

129
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,180
And finally, we mentioned 
some of the interesting benefits

130
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,810
of using compost in our gardens.
