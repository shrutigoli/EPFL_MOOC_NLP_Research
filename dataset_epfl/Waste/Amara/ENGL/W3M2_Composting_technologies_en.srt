00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:05,732
Hi!

2
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:09,545
We already learned the basics
of the science of composting.

3
00:00:09,545 --> 00:00:13,858
In this module, we will have a look
at the different composting technologies

4
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:17,013
which are commonly used
in low and middle income countries.

5
00:00:17,013 --> 00:00:19,833
These are Windrow composting,

6
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,879
passively aerated windrows,

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,891
forded aerated windrows,

8
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:25,218
in-vessel composting,

9
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:27,637
and bin composting.

10
00:00:27,637 --> 00:00:31,344
Let's start with Windrow composting.

11
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,266
Windrow is the general term

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,078
for an elongated pile
of stacked raw materials.

13
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:40,731
This method is suited
to treat large volumes of bio-waste

14
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:43,472
and produce large volumes of compost.

15
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:45,758
Aeration of the material is crucial.

16
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:48,656
Oxygen needs to be replenished
as it is consumed.

17
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:51,293
Otherwise, the piles
go anaerobic in the center,

18
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,421
following a different
decomposition process

19
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:56,241
and producing foul odors.

20
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,689
Making sure that the material
is porous enough for air to pass through

21
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:01,655
is always advisable.

22
00:01:01,655 --> 00:01:06,517
This is achieved by mixing
fine dusty, wet, or soft materials

23
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:09,223
together with structure-giving materials

24
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:13,824
such as small branches,
cardboard, or hard vegetables.

25
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,458
In any case, the piles are normally turned

26
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:20,074
which can be done
mechanically or manually.

27
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:22,798
This way, the porosity is reestablished

28
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:26,506
and air, and therefore oxygen,
get into the pile.

29
00:01:26,506 --> 00:01:29,502
Besides, the materials which are
at the exterior of the pile

30
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:31,140
are now in the interior

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,134
so that they can be
decomposed by micro-organisms.

32
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:39,222
This technology requires
low initial investment and maintenance.

33
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:43,377
However, it needs a lot of space
because the windrows have sloped sides

34
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:46,011
and cannot be put too close together.

35
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:47,769
It ranks medium when it comes

36
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:50,377
to the time needed
for the composting process

37
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,581
and it is labor intensive.

38
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:58,238
The second technology
is passively aerated windrows.

39
00:01:58,238 --> 00:02:00,810
This technology consists
of perforated pipes

40
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,806
located within the bio-waste pile

41
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:05,891
which promotes convected airflow
throughout the material.

42
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,435
The pipes can be located
in different dispositions

43
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,213
as shown in the picture.

44
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:15,073
The air that gets into the pile brings
the oxygen required by the microorganisms.

45
00:02:16,358 --> 00:02:19,192
These piles are normally
not turned during the process.

46
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,061
Therefore, it is important
to premix the feed stock thoroughly

47
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,043
before placing it on the perforated pipes.

48
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:29,772
It is advisable to insulate
these piles with finished compost

49
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:34,448
to ensure thermophilic temperatures reach
the outer layer of the pile as well.

50
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:38,695
This technology requires slightly higher
initial investment and maintenance

51
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:40,438
than non-aerated windrows,

52
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:43,198
as it involves a passive aeration system.

53
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,260
It has similar space requirements.

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,738
The composting process might take
as long or slightly shorter

55
00:02:48,738 --> 00:02:50,994
than with non-aerated windrows

56
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,468
and it also requires less labor

57
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:56,402
as the piles do not need to be turned.

58
00:02:57,393 --> 00:03:00,655
The next technology
is called forced aerated windrows.

59
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:03,418
They might look very similar
to the previous ones.

60
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,509
The difference is that blowers
are installed at the end

61
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,782
of perforated pipes or air ducts.

62
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,495
These blowers inject air into the piles,

63
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:14,484
preferably during the active phase,

64
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,642
when the compost
reaches high temperature.

65
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:21,156
Airflow can be adjusted by changing
the frequency and duration of the blower.

66
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:24,436
These piles do not need to be turned,
and as in the previous ones,

67
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:27,881
insulation with finished compost
ensures that thermophilic temperatures

68
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,228
are reached in the outer layers.

69
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,841
This technology requires
even higher initial investment,

70
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:37,048
given the need for a blower
and aeration channels.

71
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,887
Maintenance is also higher
than the previous two.

72
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,977
It has similar or slightly less
space requirements

73
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:45,971
since the composting process
is even shorter

74
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:49,312
and it requires less labor,
as the piles do not need to be turned.

75
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:53,527
Our fourth technology
is called in-vessel composting.

76
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:57,942
This describes a group of methods
that confine the composting materials

77
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,971
within a container or vessel.

78
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:04,538
Installations vary from very high-tech
options where parameters are monitored,

79
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:08,395
acting more as a bio-reactor,
to very low tech alternatives.

80
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,580
In all configurations airflow
and temperature

81
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,610
can be more easily controlled
than with other composting techniques.

82
00:04:15,194 --> 00:04:20,504
Turning or stirring takes place manually
or mechanically as seen in the video.

83
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:26,422
(motor noise)

84
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,762
This technology is more capital-intensive

85
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:34,208
and requires more maintenance
than the ones mentioned before.

86
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,853
It requires less surface area
than with the previous technologies

87
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:40,199
since the composting process is shorter.

88
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,478
Besides, little labor is required

89
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:44,873
as the material
is mixed within the vessel.

90
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,757
Finally, our last technology
is called bin composting.

91
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,550
This technique is practiced
mainly at household level

92
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,689
which will then treat
little amounts of waste

93
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:58,673
and produce compost
for self-consumption.

94
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,924
Bio waste is located in a container

95
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:03,696
which most of the time
has some sort of perforated wall

96
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:05,600
for air to get through.

97
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,724
Some containers include
a stirring mechanism

98
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,880
as the one shown on the right.

99
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:13,418
Bin composters can also
be used on a big scale,

100
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:15,319
as in this installation where we see

101
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,409
passively aerated big scale
bin composting examples.

102
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:21,266
In this case, the installations
are run by operators

103
00:05:21,266 --> 00:05:25,359
and most of the times,
the produced compost is commercialized.

104
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,905
Bio-waste is most of the time
inserted from above

105
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:31,415
and removed from the bottom.

106
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:35,143
The material degrades and compacts
slowly as it gets down into the bin.

107
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,913
This technology requires
medium investment cost

108
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,228
and minor maintenance.

109
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,224
In order to treat
the same amount of waste,

110
00:05:42,224 --> 00:05:44,871
it will require less space
than windrow composters

111
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:48,310
as the waste is piled up
vertically in the bins

112
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,597
without any sloped sides.

113
00:05:50,597 --> 00:05:54,846
Besides, no turning is required
and therefore labor is low,

114
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:58,411
but the composting process
might take longer than other options

115
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:00,122
described before.

116
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,729
This final table shows
a comparative summary

117
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,160
of the presented technologies

118
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,878
assuming they are all treating
a similar amount of waste.

119
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:11,599
However, keep in mind that in vessel
and specially in bin composting,

120
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,689
can also or are normally used
in smaller amounts.

121
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:18,554
In any case, the table
allows to have a quick impression

122
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:22,379
of which technology could suit
your needs and constraints best.

123
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:25,614
This is the end of the module.

124
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:28,829
Now that we learned the basics
on the science of composting

125
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:32,238
and about the most common technologies
used in developing countries,

126
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:34,716
in the next module I will give you
some more insights

127
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:37,093
on practical aspects of composting

128
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:40,308
such as how to get a proper mix
of different organic wastes,

129
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:45,048
or what environmental impacts
composting as an activity can cause.

130
00:06:45,048 --> 00:06:46,527
I hope to see you there!
