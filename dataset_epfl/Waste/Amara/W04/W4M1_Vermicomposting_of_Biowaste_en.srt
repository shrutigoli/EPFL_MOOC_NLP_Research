1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:04,313
Hi and welcome back.

2
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:07,928
After looking at composting 
anaerobic digestion,

3
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:11,837
the most common approaches
for organic waste treatment,

4
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:15,275
in this module, 
I'll try to give you a brief overview

5
00:00:15,275 --> 00:00:18,287
on <i>vermicomposting</i> or worm composting.

6
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:21,883
This is one other 
biowaste treatment approach.

7
00:00:22,723 --> 00:00:26,536
Vermicomposting is using worms
and microorganisms

8
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:29,940
to process biowaste 
in a controlled manner,

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,089
and to produce valuable soil amendment
called vermicompost or worm compost.

10
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:40,432
Actually, if the main focus
is to grow and market worms,

11
00:00:41,202 --> 00:00:45,736
then we we call the process <i>vermiculture</i>
rather than vermicomposting.

12
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,566
But really, it's the same principle.

13
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:52,482
The process of using worms
is quite straightforward:

14
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:55,420
we feed biowaste to earthworms.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,841
Some earthworms 
are more suitable than others

16
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:00,457
and we will look at that in just a minute.

17
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:05,171
The worms eat the biowaste,
they grow and they reproduce.

18
00:01:05,171 --> 00:01:08,408
We shall look at what they eat
and what not.

19
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:12,122
As the biowaste passes through 
the gut of the worms

20
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,053
it becomes vermicompost.

21
00:01:14,245 --> 00:01:19,183
So vermicompost is really only a fancy way
to say <i>worm poop</i>.

22
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:21,898
During the process of vermicomposting,

23
00:01:21,898 --> 00:01:26,184
we as waste managers need to ensure
that the worms are happy.

24
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,869
They need to have a favorable environment

25
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,479
so that they can feed and reproduce

26
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:33,781
and we shall look at those parameters.

27
00:01:34,204 --> 00:01:38,546
Then we will look at suitable technologies
with some examples.

28
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,048
Finally, we will conclude
with looking at the products

29
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:46,709
of this waste treatment process, 
the vermicompost and the worms.

30
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,062
First, let us start off 
with the suitable worms.

31
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:55,682
First of all, it's important to remember
that the common earthworm

32
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,457
is actually not the ideal worm 
for vermicomposting.

33
00:01:58,457 --> 00:02:00,046
Why not?

34
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:04,517
Well, this is the type of worm
that digs deep burrows into the soil

35
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:08,899
and does not feed as quickly
and has a very low reproductive rate.

36
00:02:09,632 --> 00:02:12,724
The ones that we are looking for
are the <i>surface dwellers</i>.

37
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,192
We call these the <i>epigeic</i> group.

38
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:20,443
These are worms which live within
the organic material on the surface

39
00:02:21,005 --> 00:02:24,806
and you'll find them in compost heap
or in your manure pile.

40
00:02:24,806 --> 00:02:30,220
Eisenia Foetida and Lumbricus rubellus,
the first two on the list here,

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,967
are the most popular 
used in vermicomposting.

42
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:36,367
They have a high reproduction rate

43
00:02:36,367 --> 00:02:39,596
and they're very flexible 
regarding environmental conditions,

44
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:41,991
so actually, quite ideal.

45
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:44,455
Here's a picture of Eisenia Foetida.

46
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,959
It is one of these surface dwellers.

47
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,619
It can process large amounts 
of organic matter

48
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:52,261
up to its body weight each day.

49
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:54,572
It has a high reproduction rate.

50
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:59,008
Populations can be expected to double
every one to three months.

51
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:02,029
First let's look at the adult worm.

52
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:06,037
It can be recognized by the presence
of bulge on it's front end.

53
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:09,289
Eisenia Foetida is a <i>hermaphrodite</i>

54
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,772
which means that 
it is both female and male.

55
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:17,211
However, two individual worms 
are still needed for reproduction.

56
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:21,798
When they mate, they lay side-by-side
and exchange sperm.

57
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:24,996
Then the worms deposit cocoons.

58
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,383
These are roundish 
and few millimeters in diameter.

59
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:32,496
An average of three worms develop
in each cocoon

60
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,932
and these hatch after about three weeks.

61
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:40,051
The baby worms then feed and grow
into mature worms

62
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,193
over a period of eight to ten weeks.

63
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:45,496
So what wastes can we feed to the worms?

64
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:50,022
Suitable waste are fruit 
and vegetable waste, plant waste,

65
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,146
even bread, rice and various staple foods.

66
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:58,841
What does not work so well
is meat or fish waste,

67
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:01,727
fats, grease, oil, butter,

68
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:07,051
dairy products or salty or vinegary waste.

69
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:11,592
Now, let us look at the ideal 
environmental conditions

70
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:15,111
for the worms to work as waste managers.

71
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:19,245
Temperature is ideal in the 20's.

72
00:04:19,378 --> 00:04:23,716
Below 15 will slow down their activity.

73
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:27,309
Above 32, the worms will want to leave

74
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,675
and at 35 degrees Celsius,
they start to die.

75
00:04:31,215 --> 00:04:35,398
For hot climate, this means 
keeping them shaded and moist.

76
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,480
Moisture is important.

77
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,230
It should always be between 
70 and 85 or slightly higher.

78
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,612
<i>pH</i> should be neutral 
or slightly above neutral.

79
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:52,382
pH below 7, so acidic,
is harmful to the worms

80
00:04:52,972 --> 00:04:56,499
and will also increase the risk 
of red mites

81
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,595
which are predators of the worms.

82
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,620
Worms need air to breathe,
so the system should be aerated.

83
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,622
Worms do not like light,
so we should keep them shaded

84
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:10,818
and we can actually use the light

85
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,472
if we want to move them away 
from somewhere,

86
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:16,291
for instance, to harvest the vermicompost.

87
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,474
Let's look at some other 
operating conditions.

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,618
We should provide the worms
with bulky carbon-rich bedding.

89
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,653
Typically this is shredded paper
or cardboard.

90
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:34,448
Stocking densities are recommended
between 2.5 and 10kg per square meter.

91
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:38,772
Below 2.5, the worms will not 
reproduce as fast

92
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,532
because they don't find each other.

93
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:46,825
And above five to ten,
there will be competition for food,

94
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,713
so they'll be stressed out by that.

95
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:54,478
It is nice to feed a particular size
of smaller than five centimeters

96
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:56,977
because they can process it easier,

97
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:00,361
and often the waste 
is even semi-composted.

98
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:04,543
Slightly degraded, so it can be fed 
easier to the worms.

99
00:06:05,053 --> 00:06:11,570
Feeding rates, we can estimate about 50%
of the worm mass per day

100
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,452
as feeding material.

101
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:17,314
So 50% of the body mass of a worm

102
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:21,218
can actually be processed 
by the worm per day.

103
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:26,756
However, we should not feed this in layers
of more than 10 centimeters thickness.

104
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:30,709
Over 10 centimeters, 
the waste tends to heat up

105
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:33,055
through the microbiological process,

106
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:36,613
and therefore is not very suitable 
for the worms.

107
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,618
Now let's look at different technologies--
so we'll look at worm bins and beds.

108
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,815
This can be operated at household level,

109
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:48,920
medium-scale neighborhood level,
or even large scale facilities.

110
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,303
Sometimes, but not so often,
we also see worm windrows.

111
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:57,814
Here are some examples 
of household scale worm bins.

112
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,825
Different trays where you can 
feed the worms

113
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:02,855
with your food scraps.

114
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:05,660
Although such bins 
are commercially available,

115
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,720
you can also make them them yourself
with normal plastic bins

116
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,978
as are shown in these pictures.

117
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,797
Here is an example from Indonesia.

118
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:19,071
It's an example of vermiculture
in these plastic bins.

119
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:24,732
Weekly, about 10% -- 
so a corner of each bin is harvested

120
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:26,814
and the worms are removed.

121
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:29,361
This worms are then sold as shrimp feed

122
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:33,501
or processed to medicinal capsules
for human consumption.

123
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:36,008
This is also in Indonesia

124
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:39,891
and you see it's quite easy 
to just use one corner in the neighborhood

125
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:44,922
and to stack this with different boxes
where vermicomposting is done.

126
00:07:45,762 --> 00:07:48,513
Here an example from rural India

127
00:07:48,513 --> 00:07:52,764
where the vermi bins are made
with cement rings.

128
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,341
And here, an example from the Philippines.

129
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:01,873
Here you see how the bins are covered
with these bamboo mats

130
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:04,789
to keep them shaded and protected.

131
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,165
This is another example
from the southern India in neaby Chenai.

132
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:14,197
You see this hut with a thatched roof.

133
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:19,258
Inside are these cement bins
with vermicomposting.

134
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:26,119
What you can also see is this grid, 
this mesh that covers the worm bins

135
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,881
to keep predators out.

136
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:35,723
Finally, also a larger example from the US
with these automized vermi bins.

137
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,109
This has an automatic feeding

138
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,372
and it also has an automatic 
harvesting system on the bottom

139
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,538
through a breaker.

140
00:08:47,968 --> 00:08:50,770
Now let's look at the products 
for vermicomposting.

141
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,628
As the feed passes through 
the earthworm gut,

142
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:59,815
the material is mineralized,
and plant nutrients are made available.

143
00:08:59,815 --> 00:09:04,545
The grinding effect of the gut
leads to the formation of small granules.

144
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:08,627
That is quite typical when you take 
vermicompost into your hands,

145
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,041
you see those granules.

146
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:15,325
Nitrogen content of vermicompost
is typically higher than compost.

147
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:17,658
It's around one to two percent

148
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:21,039
and the nutrients 
are easily available to plants.

149
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:25,826
Furthermore, the enzymes 
in microorganisms from the gut

150
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:32,206
are also very beneficial for soil
and plants, even suppressing diseases.

151
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:36,981
Leachate from the worm bins
can also be used as a liquid fertilizer.

152
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:40,128
This is typically used 
in small scale systems

153
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:42,228
and they call this <i>Worm Tea.</i>

154
00:09:42,888 --> 00:09:47,164
Earthworms are rich in protein
up to 65%,

155
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,381
with all essential amino acids.

156
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:55,259
They are considered a good probiotic feed
for fish or for poultry.

157
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:59,011
In the last 10 years, 
earthworms have also been studied

158
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,165
with regard to their medicinal properties.

159
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:06,811
What researchers agree on
is their anti-blot clotting effect.

160
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:10,775
So they were found to be effective
in treating thrombotic diseases.

161
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:16,158
Worms are also finding new uses 
as a source of collagen

162
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,348
for pharmaceutical industries.

163
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:23,825
Now you got excited about vermicomposting
and this module is just about over.

164
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,676
Here are some references
if you want to read more

165
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,478
and have more details 
about vermicomposting.

166
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:32,668
Let's summarize what we've talked about.

167
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:34,317
We've talked about the worms,

168
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:38,345
the ones that are suitable 
and not suitable, their life cycle.

169
00:10:38,345 --> 00:10:40,411
We've talked about 
environmental conditions

170
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:44,058
which are suitable for vermicomposting
that need to be aerated,

171
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:46,434
it needs to be moist,
it needs to be shaded.

172
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:51,756
We looked at daily feed which could be
up to 50% of worm rate per day.

173
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:55,911
We also looked at examples 
of small and large scale facilities

174
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:57,788
in different parts of the world,

175
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,412
and we looked at the properties
of the products,

176
00:11:00,412 --> 00:11:03,787
the nutriative value 
of vermicomposting in agriculture,

177
00:11:03,787 --> 00:11:06,659
and the worms as animal feed.

178
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:08,527
Thank you very much for listening.
