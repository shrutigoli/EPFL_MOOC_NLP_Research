00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,610
Congratulations,
you've completed week 4!

00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,760
Let us quickly look what we
have covered in this week.

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,950
We looked at biological
biowaste treatment options,

00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,620
we looked at vermicomposting and
processing with black soldier flies,

00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,490
we looked at thermochemical
conversion of organic waste,

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,840
but then we also looked at
hazardous and healthcare waste,

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,150
and concluded with E-waste.

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,190
In vermicomposting, we looked
at the worm cycle as a start.

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,490
Here shown in this
picture, Eisenia fetida.

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,660
And then we looked at the environmental
conditions suitable for vermicomposting,

00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,240
such as aeration, moisture,
also the need to be shaded

00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,280
and the daily feed rates of
about 50% of worm rate per day.

00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,690
We also looked at case studies,

00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,500
and looked how this
technology is constructed.

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,000
Such as the example
here from the Philippines.

00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,500
And then we looked at the
products of vermicomposting:

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,860
the vermicompost, the worm
tea, and the worms themselves.

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,140
Then we looked at another
approach of biowaste processing

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,630
using black soldier fly larvae.

00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,050
First we looked again at
the life cycle of the insect.

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,220
Then on how to manage the colony,

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,030
and how to operate
the treatment process.

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,250
And then we looked
at the BSF products:

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,290
the residue, which is similar
to vermicompost and the larvae,

00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,330
which have a high protein
content of 40% and fat content of 30%,

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,220
and are a high value product
especially for animal feed.

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,230
In the module on
healthcare waste management,

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,030
we started off by
looking at the waste amounts.

00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,550
Remember, only 15 to
20% is actually hazardous.

00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,128
The rest is typical
municipal waste,

00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,244
so segregation is
a main priority.

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,550
And then we looked at how to
enhance this source segregation

00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,060
by color coding,

00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,750
and the provision of
containers, for instance for sharps.

00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,610
Then, we looked at healthcare 
waste treatment options,

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,000
mostly referring to this book:

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,314
"The Compendium of
Technologies for Treatment

00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,084
and Destruction of
Healthcare Waste".

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,110
We looked at different systems;
autoclaves, but also incineration,

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,790
and finally ending with the
special pits of landfilling.

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,090
In the module on
thermochemical processes,

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,020
we looked at the different
options and their different parameters:

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,640
temperature, air, and retention time,

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:50,140
but we also looked at the products from
these processes and their quality.

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,000
After looking at the
processes and their parameters,

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,020
we also looked at the value chain,

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,367
starting off with primary products, through
to conversion, to finally the market;

00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:07,830
looking at different products of value,
which we can sell in the market.

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,280
And then the module on E-waste,

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,460
where we looked at the
relevance of E-waste on a global scale,

00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,450
but also the risks of E-waste
recycling and how this can be improved.

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,750
Stay with us for an
exciting fifth week,

00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,330
where we will be talking
about strategic planning,

00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,040
benchmarking city performances,
looking at waste and climate change,

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,530
and also the issue
of circular economy.
