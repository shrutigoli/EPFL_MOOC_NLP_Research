1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:10,170
Welcome back! In this module we will be
presenting a case study of composting.

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,850
For this, I would like to welcome
Maqsood Sinha and Iftekhar

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,200
Enayetullah from Bangladesh.
They are the founders and directors

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,800
of the Waste Concern Group.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,550
Waste Concern is a social business
enterprise, with a for-profit,

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,720
and a non-profit section.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,630
And they will be sharing some of
their experiences with composting,

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,760
particularly on a large scale
composting project in Bhulta at

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,740
the outskirts of Dhaka. So now, the
floor to Maksood and Iftekhar.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,580
Solid waste management is a huge
problem in Bangladesh, mainly

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,840
because of the rapid population
growth, as well as also

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,120
the economic growth in Bangladesh.
In 1991, as per our estimate,

13
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,010
6,500 tons of solid waste were
generated per day, and in 2014,

14
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,220
based on the study of this concern,
we have found that total

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,630
waste generation is around
24,000 tons per day.

16
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,920
And the volume estimation, by
2020/2025, of the daily waste

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,520
generation in urban Bangladesh would
be around 47,000 tons per day.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,700
Dakha city is divided into
two parts, North and South.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,350
4,200 tons of solid waste is a
combined total for both the cities.

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,080
If we look at the composition of
this waste, in Dhaka, around

21
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,900
70% of this waste is
organic in nature.

22
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,100
In terms of collection efficiency,
the cities are able to collect

23
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,440
around 50% of the
generated waste per day.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,440
If we look at the solid waste
management process in Dhaka,

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,560
waste is collected from the containers
by the municipality, and open

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,480
dustbins, then transported by
the municipal trucks and there

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
is disposed in the landfills.

28
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,870
There, different kinds of
problems can happen.

29
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:13,730
One of the major problems is that
the landfills are not designed

30
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,660
properly, there is greenhouse
gas emission, mainly methane.

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,800
Since the landfills are not
properly designed and it's not

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,470
a sanitary landfill site, there is an
issue of ground water pollution

33
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,630
and surface water pollution
from the leachate.

34
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,060
More land is required because
it's an end of the pipe solution.

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,500
There's an increasing waste
management cost, and the way

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,060
the entire waste is managed in Dhaka,
and also in other municipalities

37
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,240
of Bangladesh, can
cause health hazards.

38
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,710
The project which Waste Concern is
implementing in Dhaka and also

39
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,240
in other parts of Bangladesh,

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,810
is based on the 3 R approach.

41
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,640
We are promoting segregation of waste.

42
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,800
Segregated waste is collected from
the source, then is transported

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,980
by the trucks, and then taken to
a compost plant, where it is

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,210
recycled through an aerobic
composting process.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,080
The project we are implementing
in Dhaka is the first large-scale

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,510
registered CDM-project,
where we are claiming carbon

47
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,910
credits for recycling
of organic waste.

48
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,090
Another project we are doing is
reducing greenhouse gas emission

49
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,840
by avoiding waste from
landfill sites.

50
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,240
It is saving the cost and reducing
pollution, it is reducing

51
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,150
the need for land, creating
value from the waste.

52
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,140
And when this organic fertilizer
produced from the organic waste,

53
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:57,150
of Dhaka city, is used in the soil,
it can increase the soil fertility.

54
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,850
So, Waste Concern's approach is
basically trying to solve three

55
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:08,100
problems which are very prevalent
in Bangladesh by converting

56
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,720
this organic waste into organic
fertilizer and then using

57
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,340
the organic fertilizer in agriculture
soils. This can not only improve

58
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:26,720
the soil fertility, but at the same
time, it can give higher crop yield.

59
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,210
The management model which
Waste Concern is following

60
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,910
to implement a larger scale compost
plant, based on public-private

61
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,450
partnership model, and the second
important feature of this

62
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,480
project is that the project is also
harnessing carbon financing.

63
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,050
The project is implemented
through a joint-venture company,

64
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,070
between Waste Concern and a Dutch
company called World Wide Recycling BV.

65
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:57,870
This is a for-profit company,
joint venture company,

66
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,200
which has invested in the project,
and this joint-venture company

67
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,950
called WWR Bio Fertilizer
Bangladesh Ltd.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,780
is currently operating this facility.

69
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,070
We collect waste free of cost from
the different markets of Dhaka city.

70
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,340
The markets are authorized by
the city, and we have got a concession

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,310
agreement for fifteen years to
collect waste from the market.

72
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,900
The revenue model of this concern
is based on two revenue streams,

73
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,820
one is the sale of compost and
the second revenue is the sale

74
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,590
of carbon credits. Due to the recent
crash in the carbon market,

75
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,250
Waste Concern is mainly depending
on only one source of revenue

76
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,920
which is the sale of compost.

77
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,660
Compost is marketed by a private
company, and they market

78
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,540
and distribute the compost
all over Bangladesh.

79
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,990
There is a stress on the project
to sustain the operations

80
00:05:58,990 --> 00:05:59,820
with single source of revenue.

81
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:08,130
First, we have to collect waste
from the sources, from the city.

82
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,640
This is one of the largest market
of Dhaka city, where we have

83
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,080
appointed a private company to collect
the waste from these markets.

84
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,470
It generates about 60 to 70 tons of
waste, organic waste, every day.

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,060
On the right hand side, the picture is
of our second facility and a truck.

86
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,430
For each and every truck, we record
the weight on the weighbridge.

87
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,990
This facility, at Bulta composting
plant, can recycle 100 to

88
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,430
130 tons of organic
waste every day.

89
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,280
The waste is unloaded in our sorting
area, we put it in a composting

90
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,340
box which is especially designed,
which has a draining system

91
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,280
on the base, and we can blow air
to insure oxygen in the pile.

92
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,090
Here, compost piles are aerated
by forced air from the bottom

93
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,560
with large floors. And another
aspect during

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,880
the composting process that we have to
monitor, is the temperature.

95
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:20,880
As a thermophilic process, we need to
maintain the temperature and monitor it.

96
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,100
Quality control is very much
important for doing this process.

97
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,840
Normally it takes 40 days for
the composting process in the

98
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,800
pile, and another 30 days
for the maturing phase.

99
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,320
After the thermophilic
composting phase, the compost

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,790
is transferred to the maturing
shed, where it stays for another

101
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,380
20 to 30 days, depending
on the seasons.

102
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,410
Thereafter, it is sealed with
a rotating device. And

103
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,820
then the next step is
bagging and marketing.

104
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,130
For good quality compost, if you
want to market, you must ensure

105
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,440
the moisture content. To
ensure that we use plastic liner

106
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,680
to protect the compost from
moisture loss, and the design is

107
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,420
very attractive to the farmer.

108
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,030
Quality control of composting
process is very important,

109
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,940
and good quality compost is one 
of the important aspects for

110
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,480
the marketing of this product, and
we have to comply with that.

111
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,980
In Bangladesh, according to our
policy, we cannot market

112
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,900
compost without a license, so we
need two licenses, one

113
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,150
license for the compost production
facility, and then another

114
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,600
license is needed for the product.

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,360
The next step is
packaging and branding.

116
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,840
I think it is very important for
all of us to understand that,

117
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,380
if your product is good and
packaging is attractive, it will

118
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,300
attract the farmer to
use it in the soil.

119
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,310
In our previous slides, we have
seen large scale composting

120
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,940
plants which have more than
100 tons per day capacity.

121
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,600
But these plants are especially
designed, suitable

122
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,040
for small and medium scale towns.

123
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,500
We call it box method of composting.

124
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,520
This technology is patented by
Waste Concern. We have developed

125
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:25,210
this technology in such a way that
it is affordable and suitable

126
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,350
for other parts of the world.

127
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,050
After a successful experience in
Bangladesh, we started to 

128
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:38,950
partner with United Nations ESCAP
(Economic and Social Commission

129
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,850
for Asia and Pacific) to replicate
Waste Concern's model,

130
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,170
which is called Integrated Resource 
Recovery Center or IRRC, in different

131
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,770
cities and towns in Ocean Pacific.

132
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,920
At present, we are working in
Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia,

133
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:03,110
Pakistan and Indonesia. Apart from
this partnerships, we established

134
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,380
a recycling training center to
offer capacity building training

135
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:11,140
for the municipal staff, officials,
mayors and also all

136
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,350
enterpreneurs from private sectors.

137
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,880
Out of many lessons, we have compiled
a few lessons, key lessons,

138
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,360
which we want to share with you.

139
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,950
First, for any recycling project,
there is a question of incentives

140
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,750
and subsidies. Compost products cannot
compete with chemical fertilizers.

141
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,940
Whereas in most of the country
chemical fertilizer is heavily

142
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,490
subsidized, while the compost, as an
organic product, it is not subsidized.

143
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,060
So, there should be some thinking on
this aspect with the government.

144
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,890
And then, the clear policy guideline
on private-public partnership.

145
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:56,110
We also experience that small
towns and cities cannot afford

146
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,750
this kind of recycling projects
with their own source of funds.

147
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,360
So if you want to attract private
investment in this kind of

148
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,000
projects, we have to give
comfort to the private sector.

149
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,600
One of the opportunities for the
recycling project is that

150
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,020
we can claim carbon trading, although
the market is low today.

151
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,280
But we hope for the future a
better market of carbon trading.

152
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,470
Compost standard is very important.
If we want to promote compost

153
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,350
from organic waste, the farmer
must have trust, they must have

154
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,600
good quality compost which
can be used in the soil.

155
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,090
There's no compromise about
the standards of the compost.

156
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,730
And then, quality control
is very important.

157
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,160
So, during the process of composting,
we must maintain the quality

158
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,040
of the process, and
the product quality.

159
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,810
And as we're dealing with waste, source
separation is very important.

160
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,740
In most of the cities and towns
source separation is 

161
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,350
existing. So, it's very important
for source separation to make

162
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,140
people aware, and there must be
some policy in every city.

163
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,910
A compost testing protocol
is very important.

164
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,680
Without this testing protocol you
cannot ensure the quality of compost.

165
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,030
That must be standardized
by the government.

166
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,670
A specialized marketing company
is very important, right

167
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:29,050
now, we are harnessing large fertilizer
company, marketing company,

168
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,190
for selling our product.

169
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,570
They have a network all over the
country, experienced people

170
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,200
and storage facilities in
regional towns and cities.

171
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,010
And then inclusion of informal sector.

172
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,360
This is very important. Sometimes,
we make policy without thinking

173
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,710
about these people. In our Waste
Concern recycling factory,

174
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:56,020
we try to include, train these
informal, poor women and men,

175
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,160
we train them and give them better 
working conditions and health situation.

176
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,630
