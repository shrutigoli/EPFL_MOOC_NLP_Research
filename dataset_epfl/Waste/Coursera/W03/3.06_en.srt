00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,330
Hi and welcome back! This week we'll talk
about

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,299
anaerobic digestion. Sometimes this is also called 
biomethanation or sometimes just called

3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,849
biogas treatment. I will probably often use 
the abbreviation AD for anaerobic

4
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:27,720
digestion. For this module, I'm using this
book published by SANDEC as a main

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,739
resource. It's called "Anaerobic Digestion
of Biowaste in Developing Countries". You

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,320
can download this book on our website
and it's free of charge. You will

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,750
probably remember that in the past few
modules, we have covered composting as one

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,120
option for biowaste treatment. As you
now know, composting is a process of

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,619
controlled aerobic degradation, that means
with air or with oxygen. You see this

10
00:00:56,619 --> 00:01:01,699
clearly here. This composting heap which
has a passive areating tunnel in the

11
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,340
center. In this module we'll talk about
anaerobic digestion, which is the

12
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,530
collection of processes were
micro-organisms break down biodegradable

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,060
matter in the absence of oxygen.

14
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,600
This is very common to many natural
environments, such as swamps or stomachs

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,230
of ruminants, cows. So, why is this
interesting for waste management? Because

16
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,070
in anaerobic digestion micro-organisms
produce biogas. That's a mixture of

17
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,190
methane and carbon dioxide. Methane is
really what is interesting, because it's

18
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:42,659
flammable and can be used as an energy
source. In addition, what we also get is a

19
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,190
nutritious digestate. Anaerobic digestion 
is becoming very, very popular

20
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:54,690
for waste management. In Europe, many units
are being built and operated and even in

21
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,470
developing countries it's becoming very
interesting, especially from the point of

22
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:06,460
view of renewable energy resource. What
we are especially interested in, is using

23
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:14,379
this process in an engineered way with
control design, for instance in an air

24
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:20,740
proof reactor, in a digester to produce
biogas and digestate, as you can see on

25
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,160
this picture.

26
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,900
So, what are the key benefits of
anaerobic digestion? Of course, we're

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,620
producing renewable energy and that
means, we're reducing our dependency on

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,430
fossil fuels. We're also reducing
greenhouse gases. AD is pretty good

29
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,360
because it doesn't need much space. You
can actually build the reactors

30
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,610
underground. Of course, it also reduces
solid waste volumes and thus avoids

31
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:55,960
disposal costs. And it reduces pollution
from waste and pollution from fossil

32
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:03,070
fuels. Finally, of course, we can recover
value from waste, in the gas and the

33
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,170
nutrients. There are also a few drawbacks of AD,
especially when comparing to composting.

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,310
The process of the AD is more
sensitive, it's slower and it's less

35
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,140
energy intense. In fact, the energy is
contained in the methane, but that

36
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,850
means that there is also no heat
generation and that has implications for

37
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:35,050
hygenization. AD is also
technically more complex and therefore

38
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,720
also needs higher levels of skills and
investment. Now let's look at the

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,940
biochemical processes. Anaerobic
digestion happens in four steps. Although

40
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,820
these processes happened partly
simultaneously. The first step is

41
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:59,650
hydrolysis. It is the slowest of the four
degradation steps. Bacteria transforme

42
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:07,100
complex organic materials into liquefied
monomers and polymers. The

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:13,420
second step is acidogenesis. That's
where sugars and aminoacids are

44
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,440
converted. The third step is acetogenesis. 
That is where the substances are

45
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:28,190
then transformed into hydrogen, carbon
dioxide and acetic acid. Finally, the last

46
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,090
fourth step is methanogenesis, where
the methanogenic bacteria convert

47
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:41,270
hydrogen and acid acetic into methane 
gas and carbon dioxide. Typically the gas

48
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,600
mixture will also contain hydrogen
sulfide, that's the stuff that smells of

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,950
rotten eggs, but also nitrogen, oxygen and
hydrogen. In volume percent, methane 

50
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,920
amounts to roughly about 60%
while CO2 is around 40%. Hydrogen

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,410
sulfide is usually lower than 2%.
Now, let us look at the parameters and

52
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,850
operational conditions and how these
influence the anaerobic digestion

53
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:16,770
process. Let's start with the feedstock,
also called the raw material or input

54
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:23,280
material. We can distinguish between the
solid content and the water content. The

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,910
dry matter is also what we call total
solids. Now, some of these total solids

56
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,169
will be biodegradable and some won't.
In this context, it is of course the

57
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,520
biodegradable organic fraction that is
relevant, and this we call volatile

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,860
solids. Levels of total solids and
volatile solids in waste differs

59
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,640
depending on the type of waste. In this
table you can see some examples

60
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,360
regarding total solids and volatile
solids of different waste feedstocks.

61
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,250
Depending on the type of waste you can
also expect different amounts of methane

62
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,550
yield, as shown in this table.
Interestingly, lignin, one of the main

63
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,980
wood constituents doesn't degrade under
anaerobic condition. So, this anaerobic

64
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:18,370
digestion is not really suited for
treating yard waste or woody waste.

65
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:25,380
You can see this here in the last row,
where methane yield of lignin rich

66
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:32,870
organic waste is quite low. An important
parameter in AD is the organic

67
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:39,080
loading rate OLR. This parameter
quantifies the substrate quantity per

68
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,630
reactor volume and

69
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:47,760
time. The unit is kilograms volatile
solids per cubic meter and day. A good

70
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,110
daily loading rate for unstirred
reactors is 2 or below. With a stirred

71
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,900
reactor this can be higher,

72
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,900
you can increase this up to a loading
rate of 8. The pH range for anaerobic

73
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:07,920
digestion is between 6.5 and 7.5 so
actually quite neutral. However, in the

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:14,660
acidic phases, the pH is rather lower,
whereas in the methogenic phase it is

75
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:20,060
somewhat higher. Now, when the loading
rate is too high,

76
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,850
acidogenic bacteria will cause
acidification of the reactor.

77
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:31,860
Methanogenic bacteria are rather more
sensitive to these conditions and will

78
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,980
thus be inhibited. To react to this

79
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,080
the loading rate should be reduced or
one can also add lime or sodium

80
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:47,040
hydroxide to increase the pH level.
Another factor influencing the  AD

81
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,910
process is temperature. Temperatures
below 15 degrees Celsius are not ideal.

82
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:58,100
As then the organisms really slow down
their activity. Underground construction

83
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,940
or installation can buffer this
variation of temperature, but the

84
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:10,440
anaerobic process is most comfortable
in two temperature zones: the mesophilic

85
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,540
temperature zone between 30 and 40, and
the thermophilic temperature zone

86
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,680
between 45 and 60. Operation in the
mesophilic range is more stable and can

87
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:29,060
tolerate greater changes in parameters
and consumes less energy. However

88
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,289
mesophilic organisms are slower in
degrading and so you need to give them

89
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,090
more time.

90
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:41,900
Thermophilic organisms however are
faster but the system is more sensitive

91
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:47,720
to changes. Further parameters that
influences the process is hydraulic

92
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,140
retention time. That is

93
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:57,170
amount of time that the material stays in
the reactor. Ideal is a time between 10

94
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,560
and 40 days. The lower value is rather
for higher temperature in the

95
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,160
thermophilic range, because the process
is quicker. Now, here we are confronted

96
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,030
with an optimization process. If for given
inputs the reactor volume is small, then

97
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:23,550
the retention time is low, which means
we'll get little biogas yield as there

98
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,750
is little time for the process. If the
reactor volume is large, then

99
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,160
retention time increases and we get more
yield, but at the cost of having a large

100
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,240
reactor meaning more space needed and
higher investment costs. Another

101
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,170
parameter is the C/N ratio. We've
heard about this in the composting

102
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:53,420
module. Ideal is a value between 16 and
25. A higher value means limited supply of

103
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,970
nitrogen, that means food for the
bacteria and therefore less gas

104
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,190
production. A lower C/N ratio can cause
amonia accumulation which then

105
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,610
inhibits the anaerobic process. The last
parameter we'll look is the particle

106
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:12,940
size of the input material. Here,

107
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,270
small is beautiful. Particle sizes below
five centimeters are ideal. What that

108
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:24,540
does, it increases the surface area of
the material and allows the

109
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,880
microorganisms to faster degrade the
material. For operation that means, that

110
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,330
usually we chop up through a shredder
our input material, to make small

111
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:43,180
particles. So, let me summarize what we
covered in this module. We looked at

112
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,860
benefits and drawbacks, we looked at the
four stages of the biochemical process.

113
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,010
And then we looked at different
operational parameters: input material,

114
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:59,440
organic loading rates, pH, temperature,
hydraulic retention time, C/N ratio

115
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,270
and finally particle size.

116
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,410
In the next module, we will look at
different types of reactors and how to

117
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:09,930
operate them. So stay with me for the
next module!
