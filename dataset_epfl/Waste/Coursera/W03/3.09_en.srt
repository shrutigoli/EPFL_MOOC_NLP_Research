00:00:04,642 --> 00:00:08,488
Hi! This is a bonus track 
on Anaerobic Digestion.

2
00:00:08,488 --> 00:00:13,816
What we'll do is we'll calculate the size
for a fixed-dome reactor

3
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:16,846
for the example of a boarding school.

4
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:19,780
Okay. This is the situation.

5
00:00:20,266 --> 00:00:25,749
A boarding school with 250 students
and about 50 staff in a tropical climate.

6
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:31,236
We have around 0.2 kg of wet waste,

7
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:34,236
biowaste, per capita a day.

8
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:36,929
The TS is around 20%

9
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,394
and the volatile solids
are estimated around 80% of the TS.

10
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,603
The gas shall be used in the canteen
of the boarding school.

11
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:51,145
We want to build a fixed dome reactor
below ground.

12
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:54,640
The picture is here to illustrate 
how this should look like,

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,543
and we know that the construction
and operational skills

14
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:01,210
are available on site.

15
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,511
So, what should we calculate?

16
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:13,361
First, let's look at the things 
related to feedstock.

17
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,601
We have 300 people x 0.2 kg per day
of biowaste per capita.

18
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:33,546
That amounts to 60 kg per day 
of wet waste.

19
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:42,328
And we have a TS of 20%
of this wet waste.

20
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:46,467
We'll shred this waste into small pieces

21
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:50,586
and mix it with one part waste
to two parts water

22
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:54,981
so that we can create a slurry
which could feed nicely into the digester.

23
00:01:56,688 --> 00:02:03,197
So that means 1 x 60 of wet waste,
plus 2 x 60 of water,

24
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:06,797
equals 180 liters,

25
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:10,698
assuming one kilogram equals to one liter.

26
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:15,619
Next, let's look at retention time.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,673
For a digester in a tropical climate,

28
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:22,825
we can assume a good retention time
would be around 30 days.

29
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:30,360
So that means, 
180 liters per day x 30 days

30
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:37,516
equals 5,400 liters,
which are equal to 5.4 cubic meters.

31
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:41,946
Now let's look at feedstock quality.

32
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:47,691
We have 60 kg of wet waste,

33
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,792
we have a TS of 20%,

34
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:57,610
so that equals to 12 kg of dry matter.

35
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:03,264
And we have 80% volatile solids,

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,081
so times these 12 kg of dry matter

37
00:03:07,081 --> 00:03:12,923
equals 9.6 kg of volatile solids per day

38
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,285
per 180 liters.

39
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:20,877
But now what we want to have
is the amount per cubic meter.

40
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:24,075
So, the calculation that we need to do

41
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:29,850
is 9.6 / 180 x 1,000

42
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,118
equals to 53.3 kg of volatile solids
per cubic meter.

43
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:39,588
Now let us look 
at the organic loading rate.

44
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:46,994
The organic loading rate 
is the flow rate times the concentration

45
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,418
divided by the reactor volume.

46
00:03:54,294 --> 00:03:58,640
The units are, for flow rate,
cubic meters per day;

47
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:02,849
for concentration -- kilograms 
of volatile solids per cubic meter

48
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:05,934
and for the reactor volume, cubic meters.

49
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,032
Now let's plug in the numbers.

50
00:04:08,172 --> 00:04:13,732
So that is 0.18 cubic meters per day,
that the 180 liters,

51
00:04:13,732 --> 00:04:18,515
53.3 kg volatile solids per cubic meter.

52
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:21,224
That is just what we calculated previously.

53
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:26,231
And 5.4 cubic meters - that's the volume 
that we calculated

54
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,002
based on the retention time.

55
00:04:28,078 --> 00:04:33,466
That equals to 1.78 kg of volatile solids 
per cubic meter.

56
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:36,253
And if you remember the slides
that we showed previously,

57
00:04:36,253 --> 00:04:39,143
when talking about 
the organic loading rate

58
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,411
for unstirred reactors,

59
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:45,483
it is ideal to have an organic 
loading rate below 2.

60
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:48,320
So we have achieved this
in our calculation.

61
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:53,519
Now let's look at the amount of gas
that we expect.

62
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,350
From literature, we can expect 
a biogas yield for vegetable waste

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,318
of around 0.67 cubic meters per kilogram
of volatile solids.

64
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,580
So we have 1.78 kg pf volatile solids
per cubic meter,

65
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,725
which we just calculated before,

66
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:23,235
times the 0.67 cubic meters per kilogram
of volatile solids,

67
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:27,174
times the reactor volume
of 5.4 cubic meters.

68
00:05:27,518 --> 00:05:31,733
That equals to 6.4 cubic meters per day.

69
00:05:32,894 --> 00:05:39,017
That means we can expect 6.4 cubic meters
of biogas production per day.

70
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:42,232
Also from literature,

71
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:47,658
we know that a biogas stove uses about 
0.4 cubic meters per hour.

72
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,386
We have this 6.4 cubic meters per day,

73
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:54,595
so we know that if we use one stove,

74
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:58,693
we actually operate it 
for 16 hours per day,

75
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:01,302
or, if we have four stoves,

76
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:05,123
we can operate them each
for four hours per day.

77
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,024
So that means, we can actually cook 
quite a lot of food

78
00:06:09,024 --> 00:06:11,825
in the canteen of the boarding school.

79
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:16,263
Now let's look at the total volume
of the unit.

80
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,939
In this specific design, we estimate
that we need about 75%

81
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:25,425
of the total volume for the slurry,

82
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:29,895
and 25% as gas holder storage.

83
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:35,725
So, we have 5.4 cubic meters of slurry,

84
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:40,598
plus an additional 1.8 cubic meters 
for the gas holder,

85
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:46,097
equals a total volume that we need
of the whole reactor,

86
00:06:46,097 --> 00:06:48,627
which is of 7.2 cubic meters.

87
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:51,079
So let's sum up what we calculated.

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,069
We calculated the amount 
of feedstock, 180 liters.

89
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:03,524
We calculated the volume of the digester
based on the retention time of 30 days,

90
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:06,677
which is 5.4 cubic meters.

91
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:11,606
We looked at total volatile solids 
per cubic meter, 53.3,

92
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:16,159
and to check on our organic loading rate,

93
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:22,977
we calculated the organic loading rate
which is 1.78, which is nicely below 2,

94
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:25,489
so it fits nicely to our system.

95
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:31,086
And we calculated the amount of gas,
6.4 cubic meters per day,

96
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:35,489
and looked at how much 
a biogas stove consumes

97
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:39,433
and calculated how long 
we actually operate biogas stoves.

98
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:43,944
Finally, we also calculated 
the total volume of the unit

99
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:47,419
also considering the volume that we need
for the gas holder,

100
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,549
and it amounts total to 7.2 cubic meters.

101
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,859
So that was the calculation 
for a fixed-dome reactor.

102
00:07:54,968 --> 00:07:58,634
I hope you can use it in any case
in your country.
