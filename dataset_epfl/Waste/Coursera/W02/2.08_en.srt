00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:09,780
Hi! This is the second module on financial
mechanisms. In the first module we saw

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,799
what types of costs there are existing in 
solid waste management and we described

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,220
in detail the most common sources to
cover investment costs. In this second

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,830
part, we will explain what are the most
common sources for operation and

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:27,280
maintenance costs. Let's start! Operation
and maintenance costs, also called

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,140
recurrent costs occur at every step
of the solid waste management system and

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,429
can represent up to 60 to 70%
of the total costs.

8
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:41,440
These are: cost of labor, fuel, energy
revenue collection, administration,

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,300
capacity building and customer care. Do you
have an idea of how much collecting a

10
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,949
ton of waste costs approximately in your city?
Or the tipping fee per tonne in the

11
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:56,600
landfill? Let's have a look to some of
these figures. This table shows some

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,870
approximate figures of operational and
maintenance costs in four income bands.

13
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,880
Check how collection is much more
expensive than disposal or composting.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,950
Check also how sanitary landfills cost
four to five times more than open dumping.

15
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:20,369
The money required to cover the costs is
called revenues, which mainly come from

16
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,909
public sources. Public financing systems
have two main downsides. On the one hand,

17
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:33,170
they are vulnerable to political factors
and national economic problems. In

18
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,539
Bangalore, India and Managua, Nicaragua
for example, fees are being kept low due

19
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:44,090
to political reasons rather than
affordability issues. On the second hand,

20
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,079
public services are often not looking
for profit, but are rather runned as a cost

21
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,149
center. We distinguish three main sources
of revenues, national government, local

22
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,079
government, end users which can be the
residents themselves or private

23
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,399
enterprises. The national governments
often assigne grants and subside to

24
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,679
supplement local revenues, since in most
municipalities in developing countries

25
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,700
these are insufficient to cover all the
operation and maintenance

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,980
costs. This is a case in Cameroon,
where the national government subsidizes

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,379
85% of the operation and
maintenance costs. Local governments

28
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:28,810
obtain their revenues from a variety of
sources, such as property taxes often

29
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,660
based on the property size, as it happens
in Belo Horizonte Brazil, Delhi India,

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,489
Dhaka Bangladesh or from other municipal fees,
parking fees, for instance and fines,

31
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:42,590
as it happens

32
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:49,140
in Ghorahi Nepal and Quezon City Philippines.
Depending on the tax money to cover the

33
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,720
cost of municipal solid waste management
is often difficult, because as mentioned

34
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,069
before, tax money is needed for a large
variety of urban services and it

35
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:05,390
requires hard negotiations to get
the amounts needed. But also tax recovery

36
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,090
is often difficult, given the inadequate
property systems in rapidly

37
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,810
urbanizing cities with expanding
informal settlements where actually only

38
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,440
a small proportion of the residents
actually pay taxes.

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,540
Besides payment of waste service through
property taxes might be suitable if it

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,380
is clearly stipulated that 
certain portion of the tax is earmarked

41
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,230
to cover the cost of such service as it
is a case in Bamako Mali and Bangalore India. 

42
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:39,109
Ok, so we now saw that national and 
local governments can put

43
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,650
money, but users can also be charged
directly for the service. This is called

44
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,459
direct charging. This is done in many
cities such as CaneteNepal Peru, 

45
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:56,590
Kunming China, Lusaka Zambia or Nairobi in Kenya.
These charges can be sent to the users

46
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,799
on a weekly, monthly or yearly basis or
directly charged after the collection 

47
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,150
crew collects the waste as shown in the
pictures. User charges have the

48
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,579
advantage that they can raise public
awareness about the real cost of the

49
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:16,180
service and they tend to make the
service accountable. User charges can

50
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:21,560
either be a flat rate. Everybody pays the
same. Attached to other utility bills,

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,480
water bill, sanitation, phone, security,
electricity bill,

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:31,100
which increases willingness to pay and
reduces billing costs. Or related to the

53
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,790
quantity of waste discarded, which may
serve as incentive for waste prevention.

54
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:43,020
This is also called pay as you throw. As
a general principle any increase in fees

55
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,840
needs to be credible and connected to
real improvements in the waste

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,910
management service, that are well
communicated to the citizens and

57
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,330
actually perceived as such by them. Otherwise
users may choose to stop

58
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,880
payment.Let's say for example they
promised to increase collection frequency

59
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,310
from once per month to once per week. If
this never happens, 

60
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,200
users would never pay on a weekly basis.
But if it does, they will probably be

61
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,310
willing to do so. In any case, generally
collection of user charges for waste

62
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,370
services is extremely low. Not everyone is
willing to pay or able to pay. 

63
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,120
Consequently three very important
aspects need to be considered.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,690
Affordability, cost recovery and
willingness to pay. 

65
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,020
How much can people afford for waste management services in
developing countries? It has been

66
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,110
suggested that a practical upper limit
for affordable waste management costs is

67
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:49,530
1% of per capita income level.
In low and middle-income countries with

68
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,610
income levels below 1000$ per
capita per year,

69
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,240
these works out to be around 10$ or less
per capita per year.

70
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,230
It comes as no surprise that some low-
and middle-income countries set their

71
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:11,990
user charges below full cost recovery
rates. Cross subsidizing could be an

72
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,830
option to solve this. User charges allow
cross subsidizing between high income

73
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,930
areas and low income areas. This happens
in Moshi Tanzania and 

74
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,590
Couretipe Mauritius, for example. That brings us to
the next question: How much of the

75
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,140
operational and maintenance costs should
be covered by user charges? Should they cover

76
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,640
100% of the service or 50%? Only the
collection service? Or collection and

77
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,540
disposal?

78
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,180
Or treatment as well? These decisions
should be taken based on the

79
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,650
availability of other revenue sources
and the affordability of the citizens. In

80
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,420
the case of not willing to pay,

81
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,350
collecting direct user charges may
require an efficient enforcement

82
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,240
mechanism. It is difficult to just stop
the service for those that do not pay,

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,440
because then they litter and that would
affect all the others who are paying.

84
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,940
This is the aspect of a public good,
we're all affected if one does not

85
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,510
comply. Combining bills with other 
utility bills allows to make effective

86
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:18,280
sanctions in the case of non-payment.
Linking waste fee collection to

87
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,800
electricity bills was successfully
implemented in Greece, Grenada and Jordan,

88
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,670
but contested in court and overruled in Egypt.
Are there other alternatives to raise

89
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,720
revenues other than the public financing? 
Yes, there are! 

90
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,930
Let me give you four examples. The first
one is profit sharing in public-private

91
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,800
partnerships, the second one is extended
producer responsibility, about which you

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,840
can find a lot of literature on the
internet. The third one is clean

93
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,880
development mechanisms established by
the Kyoto Protocol, which

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,750
allowed to trade carbon credits between
different infrastructure installations

95
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,730
or institutions. However the Kyoto
Protocol expired at the end of 2015,

96
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,940
therefore all this carbon trading also
expired. And the fourth one is reselling

97
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,840
recyclables. In most cases resource
recovery activities represent net costs

98
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,690
to the municipalities. However, when led
to the informal sector or the private

99
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,880
sector, sometimes they could make profit
and saving costs to the municipality. In

100
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,660
this module we learned the main
financial sources to cover the operation

101
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,740
and maintenance costs of solid waste
services. These are national government,

102
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,750
local government, through taxes and fees,
and the users who are charged user 

103
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,980
charges. These can be flat combined
with other utility bills or to the

104
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,560
amount to be disposed, also called pay
as you throw.

105
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,240
Regarding user charges there are two
important aspects to consider. The

106
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,720
affordability of the charges and the
willingness to pay and possible

107
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,510
enforcement mechanisms and finally,
the cost recovery aspect is also very

108
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,380
important and this should be
established once all the previous

109
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,400
aspects are known. How much of the
operation and maintenance costs will be

110
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:17,390
covered from the revenues. And from which
revenues. How are waste management

111
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,740
service costs paid in your city? Why
don't you share it with us. Write it down into the forum.

112
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm sure that many of your colleagues
following this course will be as

113
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,250
interested as we are to read about your
city. Do you pay monthly bills? Do you pay

114
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,339
directly to the collectors once they come
to pick your waste? Do you pay for

115
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:44,029
also disposal facilities? How is it? Just
let us know. If any of you would like to

116
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:48,190
get more insights about this topic, we
recommend the following two key readings,

117
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,050
which can be found on the internet and
are downloadable for free.
