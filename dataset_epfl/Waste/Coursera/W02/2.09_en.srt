00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:10,680
Hi. Today, we are going again
to talk about money, and more

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,550
explicitly about how to evaluate
the costs of a system and how

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,220
to establish a tariff system.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,350
Why to talk about a cost model?

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,590
We saw in the module about
collection and transport how

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:30,170
the cost can vary following the
decision we took and, much more,

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,970
following the decision
we haven't taken.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,450
Waste management is a combination
of logistics and treatment.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,040
For both logistics and treatment,
cost calculation is a necessary

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,860
information for the authorities
having to take a decision and

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,510
having to organize the financial
system and make it sustainable.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,140
Cost calculation should present
not only the investments but

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,070
also the yearly operation cost
in term of cost per inhabitant

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,590
and of cost per ton. The cost
estimation is also necessary

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,060
to establish an annual budget as well
as to define how to finance

16
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,430
it and what will be the level of
taxes that we have to collect.

17
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,940
It is engineering and
good governance, too.

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,310
Cost calculation allows also to
develop an interesting benchmarking,

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,600
which consists of comparing its
own efficiency to the efficiency

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,200
of other towns in order to learn
from other best practices.

21
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,060
Cost model is just a realistic
calculation of all of the costs

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,610
of a system but tariff setting
is more a political decision.

23
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,320
There are large numbers of
possible models of tariffication

24
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,350
depending on the local conditions,
habits, politics, economy and so on.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,930
We will just see some principles.

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,680
We will not develop a high
financial tool but just try to fix

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,900
some pragmatic consideration
and how to use it.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,320
Investment costs are generally
the clearest part of a system.

29
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,250
Investments integrate mobile material
– like trucks or bins or

30
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,340
other tools – but also construction
cost of the infrastructure.

31
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,230
Each investment has a life duration after
which it is necessary to replace it.

32
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,080
For example, uniforms and tools
have to be changed once a year;

33
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,850
machines can be amortized over five
to ten years; and constructions

34
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,170
are generally considered to be
rebuilt or strongly innovated

35
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,940
after thirty years.

36
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:59,430
In  this example, we can see a
collection truck of seven tons

37
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,310
with loading and compacting system
for an investment of some

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,070
hundred thousand dollars and a
lifetime estimated to ten years.

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,830
The yearly cost of each investment
can be estimated in the first

40
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,880
approach as a total value divided
by an amortization period.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,460
In this case, we have one hundred
thousand dollars; in ten years,

42
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,690
we have ten thousand dollars per year.

43
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,050
In this example, we consider that the
truck has no more value after ten years.

44
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,340
In other cases, when the
interest rates is higher, you can

45
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,920
use another formula – a little
bit more complicated.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,680
In this case, using this formula
with five percent interest,

47
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,030
we get a yearly cost of some thirteen
thousand dollars per year.

48
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:56,280
This is the average annual cost
necessary to finance the investment

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
through a bank loan.

50
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,340
In  municipal management, the
biggest investments are sometimes

51
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,790
not considered at all because it
doesn't appear in the yearly budget.

52
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,790
This can create a financial
problem when it will be necessary

53
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,460
to buy new equipment. In other
clever municipalities, the yearly

54
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,130
investment costs are stored in
a special fund in anticipation

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,740
of future investments.

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,950
To  calculate the operation
cost, we need some information.

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,760
This information can vary from one
city to another one depending

58
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,460
on local conditions. But the first
basic information to calculate

59
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,780
the operation cost is the estimated
time of using trucks, machines

60
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,340
or treatment plants.

61
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,710
As we saw in the collection and
transport costs, this time is

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:54,840
strongly dependent on the waste
quantities, the choice of machines

63
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,170
or vehicles, containers and local
conditions like distances.

64
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:05,630
Let's take our example of a
 seven ton collection truck

65
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:11,570
with bins of 1,100 liters. The  collection
truck has a compaction rate of 2.

66
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:19,810
5, a volume of 16 cubic meters
and, we can consider, an average

67
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,000
filling rate of the
bins of 80 percent.

68
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,550
With this data, we can calculate
the required number of bins

69
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,210
necessary to fill the
truck – in this case 45.

70
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:38,170
Then, we can measure or estimate the
time to load or charge one bin: 2.

71
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,440
5 minutes. We can estimate the
distance of the collection routes

72
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,710
of 8 kilometers and an average
speed during the collection of

73
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,510
7 kilometers per hour. The same for
the transport to the landfill,

74
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,690
we can consider 40 kilometers
– 20 to go, 20 to come back –

75
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,220
with a speed of 50
kilometers per hour.

76
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,010
And then, we have also to consider
the unloading time in the landfill.

77
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,430
If we have a good truck, it
can be reduced to 6 minutes.

78
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,210
On this data, we can calculate
the total time per one tour.

79
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,640
In this case, it will give us some
4 hours for one tour,

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,620
which is very good in this case because
in this condition,

81
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,790
we can think to do two tours in one shift.

82
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,090
Then, we can calculate the total
waste quantities of one truck.

83
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,400
For that, we can measure the
waste quantity in one full bin

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,210
by weighting and in this case
having 140 kilograms per bin.

85
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,330
With over 45 bins to fill the
truck, we can calculate that we

86
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:52,660
can charge 5 tons per each truck.

87
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,750
The annual operation cost of
each entity should include

88
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,350
the energy – or the fuel –, the
other equipment and the maintenance

89
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,910
and repair. You know an example
of a seven ton truck working

90
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,470
in two shifts per day, seven days
per week; we can calculate

91
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:20,470
a total distance making 48 kilometers
per day, we get some 35,000

92
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,970
kilometers per year.

93
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:29,680
Considering a fuel consumption of
some 45 liters per 100 kilometers

94
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,000
and a certain price of the fuel, we can
estimate the yearly cost of the fuel.

95
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,020
Same with the tires: we can
estimate that we have to change

96
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:44,030
the tires after 20,000 kilometers
and that we need six or eight

97
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,140
tires and we can calculate the
yearly cost of the tires.

98
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,840
Same with engine oil or hydraulic oil.

99
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:57,860
We have also to consider the
maintenance cost of the trucks

100
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,960
– in this case we consider a 2.

101
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:06,580
5 percent of the initial investment
for each shift, so it will

102
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,180
cost some 5,000 dollars
per year in this case.

103
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,690
And we have also to consider
insurances and taxes.

104
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,730
Here some one percent of the
initial cost, which gives us some

105
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,040
1,000 dollars per year.

106
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,530
The taxes and insurances are strongly
dependent from the country.

107
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,680
Considering all these costs, we
can calculate the yearly cost

108
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,290
of one truck, here getting
30,000 dollars per year.

109
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,330
After the investment cost and
the operation cost, we have

110
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,950
now to calculate the personnel cost.

111
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,140
Personnel cost is usually an
important part of the cost or the

112
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,500
bigger one but it depends strongly
on local economic condition

113
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,920
and labor taxes. We have to
consider the salary but also the

114
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,260
labor charges – here
estimated at 20 percent.

115
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,070
We have also to consider the time
of working in the week – in

116
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,660
this case we have to add a 40 percent
for working seven days a week.

117
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,820
And you have to consider a
certain reserve of 15 percent.

118
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:23,390
In our example of two shifts per
day, we need to have two drivers

119
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:28,710
with a certain salary; with this
coefficient by twelve months,

120
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,600
it gives us a certain
amount in the year.

121
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,360
After, we have to consider two
workers for each truck – by two

122
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:42,110
shifts they are four – with a certain
salary with the same coefficient,

123
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,840
we have the yearly sum
for these workers.

124
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,810
But we have also to consider a
supervision and administration

125
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,530
cost with, considering here,
about 0.5 people for each truck

126
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,100
and each shift with a certain
salary and the same coefficient.

127
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,900
Altogether, we have the total
annual personnel cost of 52,000

128
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,430
dollars per year.

129
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:13,430
Now, we have all the elements to calculate
the total annual cost of our truck.

130
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,210
With this annual cost, we can
then calculate a cost per ton

131
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,350
and a cost per inhabitant. Let's
consider the investment

132
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,310
we mentioned before, the operation
cost and the personnel cost.

133
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,490
Altogether, it makes some
96,000 dollars per year.

134
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:36,840
It's interesting to consider that
personnel costs are more than

135
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,340
50 percent of the cost; operation
costs, 30 percent; and investment

136
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,360
costs, only 13 percent.

137
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,690
Once we have the total cost of
the truck, we can calculate

138
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,490
the total capacity of the truck.

139
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:56,030
Considering the five tons per
truck per trip, with four trips

140
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:01,770
per day, in all the year we
get 7,400 tons per year.

141
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,830
Then, we can calculate a cost
per ton: with amortization,

142
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,900
it gives us 13 dollars per tons; and
without considering the amortization,

143
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:16,400
it gives us 11 dollars
per ton, in our example.

144
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,030
We can also consider another scenario
having only one shift per day.

145
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,650
In this case, we can calculate,
with the same model,

146
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,400
that we have some 15 percent more cost.

147
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,590
If we consider another scenario
– having no bins in the streets

148
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,450
and using the double loading time – we
will have only one tour per shift.

149
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,000
In this case, we can show that the cost
will be increased by 100 percent.

150
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,160
In another scenario, we can try
with three workers per tour

151
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,990
– and not two – and in this case we
have some 13 percent more cost.

152
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,680
Then, with these same calculation
models, we can evaluate

153
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,650
different scenarii and propose to
the municipality the best one.

154
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:10,510
It is sure that the united cost
and factors have to be adapted

155
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,970
to every local cost and conditions,
but the method is the same

156
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,900
and allows to show what are the
consequences of the different

157
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,020
choices and to prepare
the annual budget.

158
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,660
Using this tool on a similar
way for each activity, you can

159
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,090
calculate the total annual budget.

160
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,530
As mentioned before, the choice
of the tariff system is

161
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:40,340
more a political decision. The role
of the engineer is to propose

162
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,620
a different scenario, to calculate
the necessary taxes to cover

163
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,210
the cost and to organize
the tariff collection.

164
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,050
The cost of the service must be
financed by tariff collection

165
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,930
or by other municipal resources.

166
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:02,000
This is the first political decision
to decide which part should

167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,280
be covered by tariffs and which
part by other resources.

168
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,990
There are four basic recovery
principles for tariff setting.

169
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,010
The first principle is a polluter
pays system: the waste generator

170
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,180
has to pay for its elimination.

171
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,860
Second point is the transparency:
tariffs should reflect

172
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,250
the cost and the citizens should be
informed in a transparent way

173
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,660
on the cost and tariff calculation.

174
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,800
Thirdly, the cost recovery
principle: the amount of collected

175
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:46,180
tariffs should be close to the
expenses – not under, not over.

176
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,770
Finally, the simplicity of the tax
calculation and the tax recovery

177
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,280
system is very important.

178
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,270
Tax system should be based on the
available data and it is very

179
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,160
important that the system
is simple to operate.

180
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,980
We will not enter in the definition
of each possible system

181
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,910
of tariff but perhaps just to
consider some basic questions.

182
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,850
First question is: which part
of the cost should be covered

183
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,860
by taxes or by other resources?

184
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:25,370
Also, which part of the cost
should be covered by businesses

185
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,580
or by families or inhabitants?
Also, should all the citizens

186
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,760
pay the same tax, or should the
tax be adapted following

187
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,690
the equality of services, the zone
of the city, the frequency of

188
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,810
the service, the distances
of the service?

189
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,270
Other important question is:
how to calculate the tax?

190
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,250
Per inhabitant or per family, or
per bin or per square meter

191
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:56,500
of the main house, or in proportion
of electricity or water use?

192
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Other question is: how to
establish an update?

193
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,730
On the clients and billing data basis?

194
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,460
How to collect the taxes?

195
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,090
Alone or together as a service
like electricity or water?

196
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,440
Other question is: how to inform
the population about the taxes

197
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,600
and about the importance
to pay the taxes?

198
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,020
Other question is: how to
react when people don't pay?

199
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,060
How to integer the poorest
people in the system?

200
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,110
If the poorest people cannot pay,
then the level of taxes of

201
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,160
the other should be increased in
proportion to cover the cost.

202
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,210
As mentioned, financing of the
waste management is generally

203
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:50,260
the key factor of sustainability.
Financing implies to calculate

204
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:57,310
cost and budget; to calculate
and define taxes; to establish

205
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:02,350
a client database and a billing
system; and to organise

206
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:08,410
the tax recovery system. These are the
main elements of the sustainability

207
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,430
of a waste management system.
