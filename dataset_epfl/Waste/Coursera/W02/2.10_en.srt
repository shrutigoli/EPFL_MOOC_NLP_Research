00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,030
Congratulations, you made
it through week 2.

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:11,210
In this second week, we learned
about the governance aspects

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:15,040
of the integrated sustainable waste
management framework, namely

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,540
stakeholders, financial sustainability,
and financing mechanisms,

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,980
and institutions and policies.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,680
We started the week by presenting
aspects related to policy

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,740
and legislation in solid
waste management.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,620
We saw the relevance of policies and
strategies and their translation

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,820
into legislation and regulations.

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,680
These should be clear and enforceable.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,030
Furthermore, three different
instruments to implement policies

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,430
were mentioned, namely regulation and
enforcement, social mobilization

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,430
and economic instruments.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,070
We then moved our attention to the
public and private stakeholders

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,800
in solid waste management.

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,720
Public institutions are responsible
for ensuring the protection

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,640
of public health and environment.

18
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,180
Their responsibilities should be
clearly divided, in particular,

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,980
those of the operators and their
regulators, and transparency

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,470
as well as accountability
should be guaranteed.

21
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,770
Regarding private stakeholders,
we discussed the reasons and

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,440
opportunities for municipalities
to involve the private sector.

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,590
We also mentioned the different
types of collaboration and pointed

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,450
out the need for clear objectives and
careful preparation of tender documents.

25
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,050
We then looked at the informal
sector in solid waste management

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,810
and visualized the
actors in a pyramid.

27
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,610
We pointed out their significant
role in solid waste management

28
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,670
and their activities along
the complete waste chain.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,890
We highlighted different measures
to improve the working conditions

30
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,150
of the informal sector, for example
organization in cooperatives,

31
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,020
recycling closer to the source, etc.

32
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,720
After looking to public, private
and informal stakeholders,

33
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,300
we covered the roles that community
members can play in solid

34
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,860
waste management and the
consequent benefits.

35
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,260
We first mentioned special community
members, such as leaders,

36
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,120
women, and youth, and we then
specially focused on community-based

37
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,000
organizations. We covered their
different organizational structures,

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,840
as well as several social and
management problems they face.

39
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,060
We then presented an example of
a public awareness campaign

40
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,960
in Coimbatore, India. We pointed
out the different aspects

41
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,530
that made this campaign a success.

42
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,690
Later in the week, we
talked about money.

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,950
We highlighted that knowing the
total costs of providing municipal

44
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,410
solid waste services
is very important.

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,570
Often costs are not fully known,
which makes it difficult

46
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,180
to develop effective
improvement measures.

47
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,280
We distinguished between investment
and operational and maintenance

48
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,700
costs, and we saw the most common
sources of funds in order

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,320
to cover each of them. We pointed
out, that operation and maintenance

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,900
costs are often very high, being
collection often the largest share.

51
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,260
We also talked about the difficulty
to achieve full cost recovery,

52
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,910
which is related to affordability of
fees on behalf of the city dwellers.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,480
It is important to set fair and
effective use of charges and

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,740
how to enforce payment. We also
mentioned cross-subsidizing

55
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,210
as a possible method
to cover expenses.

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,980
Last but not least, we presented
an example for calculating

57
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,950
the costs of a hypothetical case.

58
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,980
So, that was all for the second week.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,170
If you have any experiences related
to the content of this week,

60
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,960
I invite you now to share these
experiences in the forum.

61
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,270
Join us for the next exciting week.
