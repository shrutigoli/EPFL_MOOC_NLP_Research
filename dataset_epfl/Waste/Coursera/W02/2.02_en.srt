1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,310
Hi, and welcome back for this
module on the role of the public sector.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,500
When we look at wastegovernance,
 one key stakeholder,

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,350
of course, is the public sector.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,300
Solid waste management, in
fact, is often cited as one of the

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,300
most visible indicators of
the state of urban governance.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,470
We have already talked about
the role of the public sector as

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,390
policy maker and
regulator in the last module.

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:37,020
Often another function of the
public sector is the one of service providers,

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,210
especially when you think
 of the urban local government.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,090
In this module, we should look
at this and other main challenges

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,370
that the public sector faces
in solid waste management.

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,560
There are many public sector
institutions representing the government

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,550
that are responsible for
solid waste management.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,080
Good institutional arrangements
inside the public sector include

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,690
clear organizational structures
and clear assignments of roles

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,080
and responsibilities of
the various public agencies.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,410
In many developing countries,
however, there is often a strong

18
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,430
institutional fragmentation.

19
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,480
Fragmentation and a lack of
clarity in roles makes it very difficult

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,140
to hold concerned agencies
 accountable for what they do.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,000
It also makes coordination a major challenge.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,000
In the worst case, for instance,
 the department of cleansing

23
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,000
may depend on vehicles and drivers which
 also work for the highway department 

24
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,740
and may be under the jurisdiction of 
the central transport department.

25
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,860
And the salaries for the laborers
 and drivers are paid

26
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,440
by another unit altogether,
for instance the personal organization

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,570
or the central finance ministry.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,080
In such a case then, four or
even more separate departments

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,500
can be involved in day to
day way service operations.

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,460
This is a practical
nightmare for management.

31
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,960
What however is crucial is to separate 
between a regulator and an operator.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,600
Else transparency accountability
 and enforcement

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,370
are extremely challenging
 if not impossible.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,380
Another critical issue is
whether there is a sustained political

35
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,060
commitment to solid waste
management, typically by the mayor

36
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,260
and not only in times when
things go bad, but also when things go well.

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,220
However, we have
to pay attention that the

38
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,530
solid waste department is not
subject to political maneuvers.

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,600
One key issue always cited is transparency
 and accountability of the public sector.

40
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,910
As this is a service provided to the
citizens, it is also scrutinized by them.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,720
It requires their
acceptance and their collaboration.

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:09,270
And transparency and
accountability are the main way to build trust.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,860
We have not been talking much
about corruption until now, but

44
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,060
in waste governance, this is
also a major issue of concern.

45
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,710
Integrity of waste governance is
an important element of building

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,700
a trust relationship among
different stakeholders, which again

47
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,410
is facilitated through a very
clear strategy of transparency

48
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,350
and accountability. Waste
collection is usually best provided

49
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,230
at the lowest appropriate level
of new sub administration which

50
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,350
means closest to the
service users, the people.

51
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,360
But in metropolitan areas
or small urban centers,

52
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,010
the organization and the investment
 in larger infrastructure such

53
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,350
as waste treatment or disposal
may need to be organized on a

54
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,070
unified base across cities
 or across the county.

55
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,200
Here, inter-municipal cooperation
can be an essential element.

56
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,430
This involves an approach that
uses synergies by cooperation

57
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,270
between municipalities in
order to increase public service

58
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,370
efficiency and also
create economies of scale.

59
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,460
In other words, it is
about joining forces.

60
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,450
One other aspect is that
of professional competence.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,470
Solid waste departments are
unfortunately often not seen as

62
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,520
a prestigious department
to work for or to direct.

63
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,480
At the same time, you have
probably already realized that working

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,620
in the waste sector is a highly
interdisciplinary task.

65
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,190
You need the expertise in management,
engineering, logistics or social mobilization.

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,700
So, we have a major problem
in the public sector which is a

67
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,560
bad image, a low recognition of
the work, although it is highly

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,000
complex and it is a
demanding challenge.

69
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,540
The lack of qualified staff and
professional competences affects

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,220
performance and decision making.

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,120
And this may be even worse in
small towns and municipalities.

72
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,060
As often, the best qualified 
professionals like to remain

73
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,760
close to the large cities
 or even the capital.

74
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:21,270
Another aspect is the fact
that hiring governmental

75
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,140
employees often does not relate
to skills but rather to social connections.

76
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,130
And once hired, there
are kinds of limited possibilities

77
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,920
to value or to correct
performance of the work.

78
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,900
More often than not, local
authorities will lack the competences

79
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,060
to negotiate, interact with
private sector, donor agencies,

80
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,820
or even business people or
salespeople that promise

81
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,320
some magic waste treatment solutions.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,270
In order to develop staff
capacities and competence, a good

83
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,250
starting point is for governmental
 institutions to collaborate

84
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,550
with local universities,
 NGOs or consultants.

85
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,100
Strengthening formal education
on waste management topics, 

86
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,590
both technology and governance
related is a very good investment

87
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,340
for obtaining qualified staff.

88
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,230
Another option is also to
connect local government officers

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,440
among each other to facilitate
an exchange of experiences

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,180
for collective learning.

91
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,450
For instance, under the name 
PEARL, Peer Experience And

92
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,570
Reflective Learning, a network
was launched in India in 2007

93
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,140
by the ministry of urban
development for cross learning and

94
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,850
exchanging experiences.

95
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,670
Documenting and publishing
experiences is a good way to share,

96
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,690
not only showing best practices
but maybe also things that don't

97
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,940
go so well in order
to learn from failures.

98
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,660
The PEARL network from India, for
instance, has recently published

99
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,940
a compendium of good practices
in urban solid waste management.

100
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,780
It is structured into different
thematic sections as shown here.

101
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,050
You will also find this document 
on the suggested readings or

102
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,150
on a web page, if you want to
look into more detail into the

103
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,660
various good practices.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,030
Developing public sector
capacity and the skills to manage this

105
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,570
complex task does not come overnight.

106
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,730
As an example, let me show you
the case of Maputo in Mozambique.

107
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,190
Mozambique, in a
decentralization process,

108
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,130
transferred the responsibilities
of waste management to the local

109
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,860
government or to the municipalities
through their local government act.

110
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,030
This decentralization process,
however, was not matched with

111
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,680
a transfer of financial,
technical or institutional resources.

112
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,730
And therefore, it was very
difficult for these municipalities

113
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,800
to provide an acceptable service.

114
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,090
A specific solid waste management
regulation only followed in 2004.

115
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:13,200
This finally gave local authorities
 the power to adopt specific rules,

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,220
establish fees for
waste management

117
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,640
or approve license processes and technologies.

118
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,070
It also required the local
authorities to develop and submit

119
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,450
waste management plans that
were then approved by the ministry

120
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,340
for coordination of
environmental action.

121
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,850
For Maputo, waste management
falls under the responsibility

122
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,700
of the directorate of hygiene which is responsible 
for the execution of collection services,

123
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,220
contracting, supervision and disposal site management.

124
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Street sweeping was handed over

125
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,710
to the urban district administrations.

126
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,200
Maputo introduced
specific bylaws in 2008.

127
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,400
The current collection system
comprises adequate solutions for

128
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
different characteristics of this city.

129
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,260
I will talk more about
this in a later module.

130
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,370
The municipality still
provides part of the service.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,910
Other services are subcontracted 
to private sector or micro

132
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,180
enterprises and they achieve an
excellent collection coverage of 82 %.

133
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,000
Finally, the last aspect I want to
mention in relation to strengthening

134
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,030
municipal authorities is
the aspect of data management.

135
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,390
It has already come up in
various previous modules and you will

136
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,210
probably be hearing more about
it again and again, also when

137
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,960
talking about benchmarking.

138
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,540
Measuring performance and
practice can help determine effectiveness

139
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,470
of policies, but also the
effectiveness of the funds being spent

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,200
for solid waste management.

141
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:57,770
Besides collecting the data,
it is of course essential to be

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,390
able to process the raw data
into useful information which can

143
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,550
then be used to make wise decisions.

144
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,330
This again requires
respective skills and capacities.

145
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,710
This of course comes at a cost
but data collection is becoming

146
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,420
more affordable due to
innovations in information technology.

147
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,980
So, let me summarize this
module with this slide:

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,780
first, I highlighted the importance of
clear institutional responsibilities

149
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,250
among public sector agencies.

150
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,400
Ideally, it would be nice to have
a unique entity with operational

151
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,170
and financial independence as
well as the power to implement.

152
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,000
Institutional fragmentation in waste
management makes life very complicated.

153
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,480
The public way sector needs
strong sustained political support,

154
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,800
not only when things go bad.

155
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,130
But it should not be
hijacked for political motives.

156
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,220
And finally, we touched upon the
subject of professional expertise

157
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,320
and how to strengthen
capacity in the public sector.

158
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,980
Thank you for listening.
