00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:05,420
Hi.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,000
After looking at different
organic waste treatment options,

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,890
in this module we'll look at
two specific fractions.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,830
We'll look at hazardous household waste
and healthcare waste management.

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,350
If at this point you were expecting
a module on hazardous waste,

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,940
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,410
The wider topic of hazardous
waste management goes far beyond

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,380
the scope of this course on
municipal solid waste management,

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:35,570
but let me just give you a few words
on hazardous waste management.

10
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,680
The main bulk of hazardous waste
is generated from chemical,

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,040
industry, fertilizer and pesticide
manufacturing, petroleum

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,850
and mining industry, and
also heavy steel industry.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,830
At municipal scale, there might
be smaller scale production

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,180
units like leather tanning or
electroplating industries.

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,720
If you're really interested in
hazardous waste management, then

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,320
I really recommend this website.

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,460
It's a training resource pack
and has a lot of resources and

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,870
information on hazardous
waste management.

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,630
Browse through the different
menus and see what you can find.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,700
Documents, library, publications.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,530
.. Everything is there,
so feel free to browse.

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,910
Now, let's focus on the municipal
stream and its hazardous fractions.

23
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,630
That is what we call
hazardous household waste.

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,610
It comes from households,
offices and small businesses.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,220
So what does it include?

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,240
The eight most common hazardous
household items are shown here:

27
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,840
batteries; aerosol cans partially
filled or not; fluorescent

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,990
lightbulbs containing mercury;
automotive products like fuels

29
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,990
and fluids; various paints,
especially those which are latex

30
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,950
and oil-based; household detergents
and cleaners; lawn and garden

31
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,040
care chemicals, but also pool
chemicals; and finally, personal

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,490
care products, such as nail polish,
polish remover or even hair spray.

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,010
In general, data is quite scarce
on household hazardous waste.

34
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,680
However, we can estimate that it's
usually less than one percent

35
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,860
of all municipal solid waste.

36
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,700
There are some industries and some
commercial activities where

37
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,540
the waste might get mingled with
the municipal solid waste.

38
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,870
For instance, paint shops, mechanic
shops, dry cleaning, leather

39
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,810
tanning, electroplating of metals,
photo industry or even construction

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,080
and demolition waste, which
may contain asbestos.

41
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,990
For household hazardous waste,
the principle is to segregate

42
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:09,040
at source, to collect separately
and then manage within a hazardous

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,340
waste system.

44
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,590
Unfortunately, in most developing
countries, implementation

45
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,580
of such systems and respective
controls are lacking.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,330
And, even waste treatment facilities
for hazardous waste are not available.

47
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,820
Here are some ideas and thoughts
of what could be envisaged

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,250
for these low income settings.

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,760
First of all, create awareness
among the population to avoid

50
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,660
or even substitute with other
products which are less hazardous.

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,060
Organize sporadical collection
days with designated collection

52
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,350
points in the neighborhood. We
can recycle if feasible, but

53
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,070
we need to think about the work
conditions for the recyclers.

54
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:04,250
Then, we can team up with other
industrial partners that anyway

55
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,080
must treat their hazardous fraction
and can also treat the household

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,160
hazardous fraction. Finally,
what we need to keep an eye on

57
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,170
are these special waste generators,
provide specific regulation

58
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,420
and monitor their practice.

59
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,840
Now, let's look at healthcare
waste management.

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,030
That is waste from hospitals,
clinics and dispensaries.

61
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,990
What is most important is to know
that only fifteen to twenty

62
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,440
five percent of healthcare
waste is actually hazardous.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,060
The rest is actually like
municipal solid waste.

64
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:52,760
So, it is most important to segregate
this hazardous fraction from the rest.

65
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,470
Here is a list of categories of
hazardous healthcare waste:

66
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:05,780
sharps – that's needles and syringes
but also blades; then infectious

67
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:12,410
waste – blood and body fluids,
infectious cultures; pathological

68
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:19,510
waste, human tissue, organs or body
parts; pharmaceutical waste,

69
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:23,310
which are pharmaceuticals themselves
or items contaminated by

70
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,720
pharmaceuticals; chemical waste –
reagents, disinfectants, solvents

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,610
but also batteries, thermometers;
radioactive waste from radiotherapy

72
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,040
or from laboratories.

73
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,500
As segregation is important, it is
also important to distinguish

74
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,020
these various fractions.

75
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,270
We can help doing this
by color coding.

76
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,190
What you see here are different color
codes for different waste types.

77
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,220
The black color code for
noninfectious waste; then the yellow

78
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,750
and red color code for infectious
waste or sharp wastes.

79
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:11,360
Sharps are one fraction which
needs special attention.

80
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,910
They are a high risk, mostly for
healthcare workers, waste workers

81
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,190
or sometimes even users using
recycled injection equipment.

82
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:30,170
Here are some examples of how to segregate
and store sharps in containers.

83
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,390
These must be closable, puncture
resistant and leak proof on

84
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,640
the sides and bottom. They
shouldn't be overfilled and, as we

85
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:47,420
mentioned before, color coded
and with the biohazard symbol.

86
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,160
Even very low cost solutions can
be developed, like this old

87
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,750
plastic bottle, which is labelled
with a biohazard symbol and

88
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,130
adapted at the top so that the sharps
can be entered into the bottle.

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,870
Or, this more sophisticated model,
which can be directly put

90
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,540
into the autoclave for disinfection.

91
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,000
So what must we think about when
developing a waste management

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,980
plan for a healthcare facility?

93
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,870
First of all, it must be embedded in
a national strategy and policy.

94
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,640
We should also have a clear
assignment of responsibilities and

95
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,680
we have to know how much waste
is actually generated and how

96
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,690
much of that is hazardous.

97
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,700
Then, we have to think about
financial arrangements and duties

98
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,220
and develop a hospital
waste management plan.

99
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,500
Ideally, that is done together
with the staff in the hospital.

100
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,040
Before implementing, we need to
conduct awareness campaigns

101
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,440
so that everyone knows what there
is to do in the hospital to

102
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,670
ensure good segregation of
the hazardous fraction.

103
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,890
At municipal level, you can follow
different waste management

104
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,070
treatment strategies. That can be
on-site treatment, where the

105
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,700
healthcare facility treats its
own waste – typically, in large,

106
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,110
national or university hospitals.

107
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,950
But you can also think of cluster
treatment, where the hospital

108
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:24,400
treats its waste plus waste from
other facilities, from smaller

109
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,890
clinics or doctors'clinics.

110
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,390
Or, finally, a central treatment
where there is one dedicated

111
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,330
treatment plant that collects
and treats the waste from many

112
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,280
healthcare facilities throughout
the urban center or even region.

113
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:45,380
I won't go into much detail about
the different healthcare waste

114
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,830
treatment options. However, I
would like to refer you to this

115
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,950
compendium of technologies for
treatment destruction of healthcare

116
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,600
waste, from 2012.

117
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,000
Summarizing, there are different
systems that can be used: autoclaves,

118
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,420
steam or microwave systems.

119
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,440
Those used wet heat.

120
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,000
Then, we have dry heat systems; those are
usually adapted for smaller amounts.

121
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,590
Then, there is incineration but
there we need to pay attention

122
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,700
that we might create dioxides.

123
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,440
Finally, chemical disinfection or
landfilling with special pits.

124
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,740
So now let's look at a few examples
of these different technologies.

125
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,870
Here are two autoclaves in
a hospital in Senegal.

126
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:45,260
Or here, a rather low-cost autoclave,
which is gas powered in Tanzania.

127
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,930
And here is a picture of a
large autoclave in Vietnam.

128
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,790
For incineration, I would like
to show you only one example:

129
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,220
the De Montfort medical
waste incinerator.

130
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,550
It was designed to be as low-cost
as possible and easy to build.

131
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,570
Investment costs are
between 500 and 1.

132
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:10,610
500 US Dollars.

133
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:17,830
This module can process 12
kilos to 50 kilos per hour.

134
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,170
What is particularly interesting
is that it has a primary and

135
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,850
a secondary combustion chamber,
which allows temperatures to

136
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,360
reach higher than 800°C up to 

137
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,890
1.000°C. Typically, we have an
ash pit nearby but, because we

138
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,430
cannot guarantee emissions through
the chimney, we should make

139
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,610
sure that we place the incinerator
in a downwind location.

140
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,590
And finally, some examples of
landfilling of healthcare waste.

141
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:02,480
What you see here is a sharps pit,
so a constructed cement pit

142
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,740
where sharps can be disposed
of through this tube.

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,930
And what you see here is a placenta
pit, so a constructed cement

144
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,610
pit where human tissue – the placenta
after birth – is deposited.

145
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,020
Okay, now let me sum up what
we've covered in this module.

146
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,550
We've talked about hazardous
household waste, its waste types

147
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,870
and some strategies for segregation
in separate collection.

148
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,910
Then, we talked about
healthcare waste management.

149
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,510
We looked at classification – remember
the sharps – as a high-risk

150
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,120
fraction; we looked at segregation
and separate collection,

151
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,220
the color coding; we looked at
strategies depending on the settlement

152
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,420
pattern and how much waste is
available; and then, we ended

153
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,710
with some treatment options:
autoclaving and incineration.

154
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,720
If you're interested in reading
more about healthcare waste

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,130
management, I can recommend
these three documents.

156
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:13,700
They are all available on the WHO
webpage and can be downloaded for free.

157
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,520
Thank you for listening.
