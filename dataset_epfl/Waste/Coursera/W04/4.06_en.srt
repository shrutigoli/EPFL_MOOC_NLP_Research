00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:07,340
Congratulations, you've completed Week 4.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,560
Let us quickly look what we
have covered in this week.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,310
We looked at biological
biowaste treatment options.

4
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:21,200
We looked at vermicomposting and
processing with black solider flies.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,210
We looked at thermochemical
conversion of organic waste.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,440
Then we also looked at hazardous and
healthcare waste and

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,030
concluded with e-waste.

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,660
In vermicomposting,
we looked at the worm's cycle as a start.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,820
Here shown in this picture.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,860
Then we look to the environmental
conditions suitable for vermicomposting,

11
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,080
such as aeration, moisture,
also the need to be shaded, and

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,820
the daily feed rates of about
50% of worm weight per day.

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:59,740
We also looked at case studies and
looked how this technology is constructed,

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,710
such as the example here
from the Philippines.

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,475
Then we looked at the products
of vermicomposting,

16
00:01:05,475 --> 00:01:09,610
the vermicompost, the worm tea,
and the worms themselves.

17
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,600
Then we looked at another
approach of biowaste processing

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,450
using blank soldier fly larvae.

19
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,940
First, we looked again at
the life cycle of the insect.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,590
Then on how to manage the colony and
how to operate the treatment process.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,760
Then we looked a the BSF products,
the residue which is similar to

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,600
vermicompost and the larvae, which
have a high protein content of 40% and

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,190
fat content of 30% and are a high value
product, especially for animal feed.

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,480
In the module on healthcare
waste management,

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,150
we started off by looking
at the waste amounts.

26
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,520
Remember only 15-20%
is actually hazardous,

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,870
the rest is typical municipal waste.

28
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,210
Segregation is a main priority.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,590
Then we looked at how to enhance this
source segregation, by color coding and

30
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,770
the provision of containers,
for instance, for sharps.

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,340
Then we looked at healthcare
waste treatment options,

32
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,890
mostly referring to this book,
The Compendium of Technologies for

33
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,840
Treatment and
Destruction of Healthcare Waste.

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,600
We looked at different systems,
autoclaves, but also incineration and

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,750
finally, ending with a special
pits of landfilling.

36
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,590
In the module on thermochemical processes,
we looked at the different options and

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,300
they're different parameters,
temperature, air and retention time.

38
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,890
But we also looked at the products from
these processes and their quality.

39
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,200
After looking at the processes and

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,420
the parameters,
we also looked at the value chain.

41
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,720
Starting off with primary products through
to conversion to finally the market,

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,720
looking at different products of value,
which we can sell in the market.

43
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,360
Then the module on e-waste,

44
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
where we looked at the relevance
of e-waste on a global scale but

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,240
also the risks of e-waste recycling and
how this can be improved.

46
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,394
Stay with us for an exciting fifth week,

47
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:28,757
where we will be talking about strategic
planning, benchmarking city performances,

48
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:33,548
looking at waste and climate change,
and also the issue of circular economy.
