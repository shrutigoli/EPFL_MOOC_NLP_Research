00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,970
Hi, in this module I'd like to talk about

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:13,840
the link between waste management and
climate change. I'm quite sure that

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,119
you're familiar with the climate change
challenge, but here just a reminder as a

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,810
small repetition. Global warming and
climate change

5
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:29,380
refers to an increase in average global
temperatures with various human activity

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:36,670
as the main cause for this.The increase
in average global temperature is caused

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,960
primarily by increases in greenhouse
gases, as shown here on the right.

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,670
Predominantly carbon dioxide but also
other gases, such as methane, nitrous

9
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,910
oxide and other fluorinated industrial
gases, which are however less relevant in the

10
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:02,600
waste management discussion. What you see
in this list, is also this number, showing

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,600
how much more this gas would warm the
earth over a hundred year period as

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:21,240
compared to carbon dioxide. So, methane
is 25 times as potent as CO2 and nitrous

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,650
oxide even 298 times more potent.
What is done in this

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:35,370
whole greenhouse gas discussion, is to
relate these different gases to CO2,

15
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:44,190
using this number. And the unit is then
tons of CO2 equivalents. Besides the gases

16
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,710
research has also identified another
substance that can have a large impact

17
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,180
on climate and its relevance to the
waste management sector. This is called 

18
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,090
black carbon, which are small black
particles in the atmosphere, resulting

19
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,170
from incomplete combustion of biomass.
Black carbon has been recognized as an

20
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,799
important short lived

21
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,409
climate pollutant. Black carbon is not
yet included in the whole emission

22
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:20,460
quantification as there is yet no good
or agreed metric to compare black

23
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,380
carbon with other greenhouse gases. As
mentioned, black carbon is a typical

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:33,470
result of burning waste. This whole issue
of black carbon is clearly a topic of

25
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,810
growing interest, which in future will
need much more attention and research.

26
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,160
Now, let us have a look, how different
countries and how the waste sector

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,910
contributes to global greenhouse gas
emissions. This infograph of the World

28
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:54,330
Resources Institute allows you to look
at different countries and sectors

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,530
contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
The inner circle differentiates between

30
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,210
the top 10 countries and the others. 
The countries are then shown in the middle

31
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,900
section with the top 10 shown in colors.
Finally, the outer circle shows the

32
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,350
emission contributions by sector. First,
we shall click on Indonesia, shown here

33
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:27,550
in bright red. The total CO2 equivalent
emissions are 760 tons,

34
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:37,350
as shown in the grey bar above.
While the waste emissions are 69 tons, so

35
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,710
the contribution of the waste sector is
8%. Why don't you google this infograph

36
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:50,110
and search for your own country in the
list and the emissions contribution of

37
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,690
the waste sector. Compare this with other
countries and share your views on this in our forum.

38
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,670
In the global average, the
waste sector including wastewater

39
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,680
contributes only 3-5%
of the global greenhouse gas emissions.

40
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,690
This is mainly through methane emissions
from landfills, methane and nitrous

41
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,890
oxide from wastewater and some minor CO2
and nitrous oxide from burning of fossil

42
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:29,460
carbon. However, experts agree that this
contribution is severely underestimated

43
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,249
because certain

44
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:37,249
aspects of waste management are not
considered. For instance, the contribution

45
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:44,419
of recycling or of reducing transport of
waste through recycling. It has been

46
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,379
estimated at around ten to twenty
percent of global greenhouse gas

47
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,409
emissions could be reduced by the waste
management sector. This can be by

48
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:59,789
projects that recover landfill gas to
either flare it or convert it to

49
00:04:59,789 --> 00:05:06,129
electricity or by methods adapting the
landfill management. For instance,

50
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:13,029
landfill aeriation to avoid methane
generation or also by utilizing cover

51
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:18,149
soil as a way to reduce methane
emissions from landfills through the

52
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:18,899
methane

53
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:25,629
oxidizing effect of soil bacteria. Here
is an example of landfill gas recovery

54
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:31,429
and electricity production from South
Africa. On the left, you can see the

55
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:37,469
landfill in its early stages being filled,
and on the right, the infrastructure

56
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:43,329
where the collected landfill gas is
transformed to electricity. 

57
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:48,129
In the background of the picture on the right
you can see the final landfill cells

58
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:56,059
with soil and grass cover. Other
greenhouse gas mitigation measures are

59
00:05:56,059 --> 00:06:02,769
avoiding disposal in landfills either by
composting anaerobic digestion or

60
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:09,329
thermal processes. Here is not only the
effect of meeting avoidance that play a

61
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:15,459
role but also the substitution of other
resources. For composting, this is

62
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:19,999
substitution of chemical fertilizer
which are energy intense in their

63
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:25,039
production. Or for anaerobic digestion
and combustion it may be the

64
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,479
substitution of fossil fuel energy
resources.

65
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,959
Finally, in addition also waste
minimization recycling and reuse

66
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,529
represent an important and increasing
potential for indirect reduction of

67
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,110
greenhouse gas emissions through the
conservation of

68
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,470
raw materials and fossil fuel avoidance. 
Any government or individual company is

69
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:56,870
free to choose how they will reduce
emissions. One mechanism is that they

70
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,490
purchase emission reduction credits or
allowances from other sources, for

71
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,750
instance from waste management project
in low and middle income countries, which

72
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,590
have mitigated emissions of CO2
equivalents. They're different schemes

73
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,010
that help regulate and control these
emission reduction units. The clean

74
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,180
Development Mechanism CDM is a
market-based mechanism under the Kyoto

75
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:28,100
Protocol where projects in developing
countries can earn carbon credits

76
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,420
equivalent to the amount of CO2 they
have reduced or avoided. These credits

77
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,380
can then be used by industrialized
countries to meet a part of their

78
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,480
emission reduction targets. This is what is
called the compliance market based on

79
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,990
the Kyoto Protocol agreements of each
country. CDM has registered methodologies

80
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:56,660
on how emission reductions are calculated,
but also standardized and monitored and

81
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:02,630
also verified as these for their registered
projects before issuing the certified

82
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:09,740
emission reduction units. Similarly the
carbon finance unit of the World Bank

83
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:16,560
uses money by governments and companies
in OECD countries to purchase carbon

84
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,660
credits, generated by projects in low- and
middle-income countries. Finally, there is

85
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,450
also a voluntary market, which uses other
certification measures and standards to

86
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:34,960
issue voluntary emission reduction units.
Waste related projects account for

87
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:44,330
approximately 18% of all CDM projects.
Since the beginning of CDM, around 200

88
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:50,960
municipal solid waste project have been
registered worldwide. However, nearly 90%

89
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,120
of registered solid waste
projects involve landfill gas flaring

90
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,030
and recovering. 

91
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,800
And most of these projects have been
submitted by middle-income countries.

92
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,900
the lowest income countries have generally
not yet

93
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:11,610
benefitted from this mechanism. Here is an
example from the DoÃ±a Juana 

94
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,680
landfill in Bogota Colombia. It is one of
the largest Clean Development Mechanism

95
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,610
projects in Latin America. The project
started in 2009 and was 100% operational by

96
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:32,170
the end of 2010. For the period of
January to June 2015, the emission

97
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,530
reduction amounted to 340000 tons 
of CO2 equivalent.

98
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,960
Total greenhouse gas emission reduction
is estimated to be 14.8

99
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:51,290
million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over
the entire 22 year life of the

100
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,980
project. After the climate conference in
Bali in 2007, a new concept was

101
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,780
introduced: the nationally appropriate
mitigation action NAMA. This refers to a

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,490
set of policies and actions that
country's undertake as a voluntary

103
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:15,730
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. It recognizes that different

104
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,730
countries may take different actions
depending on their respective

105
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:27,310
capabilities. It also emphasizes the need
of financial assistance from developed

106
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:33,290
countries to developing countries, to
reduce emissions. It can include a wide

107
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,290
range of actions: policies, strategies,
research or development, even training

108
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,330
and capacity development, and of course
projects. So, let me summarize what we

109
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,490
have covered in this module. We have
talked about greenhouse gas emissions, in

110
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,610
general but specifically also from waste
management. We've talked about how

111
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,820
greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced,
either by landfill gas recovery or

112
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,180
diversions from landfills or waste
minimization recycling

113
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,870
and reuse. We looked at different carbon
trading measures, specifically at the

114
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,220
clean development mechanisms, with one
example from Bogota, Colombia and we looked

115
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,570
towards the future with the new
mechanisms such as NAMA. Thank you for

116
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:27,660
listening.
