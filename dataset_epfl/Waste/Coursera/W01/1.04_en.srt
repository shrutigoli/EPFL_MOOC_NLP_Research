00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:04,930
Hi.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,490
My name is Félix Schmidt.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,630
I am a lecturer here in the EPFL
in Sanitary Engineering, but

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,000
most of my professional
activities are in my company

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,670
C.S.D Engineers.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,150
Today we will speak about waste
collection and transport.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:27,010
I would like you to remember
two important points.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:32,820
Firstly, collection and transport
are usually the major part

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,410
of waste management costs, much
more than landfill costs.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:44,250
Second point I want you to remember,
is that the cost of collection

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,840
and transport is varying a lot from
one city to another, according

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,370
to local characteristics, urban
situation and the level of services.

13
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,150
Frequencies, collection rules,
equipment, bags or containers

14
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,540
and trucks, have a big
influence on the cost.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,130
What is the main problem
of waste management?

16
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,190
Money!

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,420
We have not enough money to do
the waste management as well

18
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,520
as we think to do it.

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,080
Thus, we have two solutions:
either we bring the cost down,

20
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,910
or we adapt revenues and taxes
to reach a sufficient level.

21
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,470
Generally we have to do both.

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,210
Today we will see how to bring
the cost down and improve

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,600
the service to the population.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,400
What are in waste collection
the most expensive elements?

25
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,250
First there are trucks, the trucks are
very expensive, and also the workers.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,840
The workers are also a
big part of the cost.

27
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,660
Thus, if we want to reduce the
cost, we have to develop solutions

28
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:05,630
in order to use better
these important elements.

29
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,880
We have to work on time reduction,
in order to load as much

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,950
waste as possible in a reduced time.

31
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,180
For that, we have to work on the
organization and on the equipment.

32
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,600
We need to choose good trucks in
order to minimize as much as

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,300
possible the time we need to load, to
transport and then to unload the waste.

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,590
For that we have to choose trucks
allowing to load the waste

35
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,300
in the shortest time possible.

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,580
An important point is to have a
compaction system, which allows

37
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,530
to take more waste.

38
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,020
But a second point, very important,
is to consider the height

39
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,380
of loading the waste.

40
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,660
Here we have some one meter height.

41
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,160
Here in this example in São
Tomé we have 2 meters height.

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,200
It's much more work, much more time.

43
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,490
Here in Peru we are using
trucks with 4 meters height.

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,410
This needs much more work, much
more time, and lots of people,

45
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,620
for doing the same job.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,540
If we consider the cost of
operation of such a choice,

47
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,090
here in Peru we have some estimation
of some 60 soles/ton.

48
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:35,850
With this kind of trucks we
are on about 350 soles/ton.

49
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,660
This is 5 time more!

50
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,790
And if we consider this kind of
open trucks we are at about

51
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:56,320
650 soles/ton, because we need
a lot of time to load and to

52
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,520
unload such trucks.

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,170
And if we consider these little
vehicles here, which could be

54
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:09,570
very useful to go in narrow streets,
the cost is 1,900 soles/ton.

55
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:18,380
Which is much, much higher
than our 60 soles/ton.

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,590
So the choice of good trucks is
very important in order to reduce

57
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:31,920
the cost of the collection
and transport.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,730
The volume of the trucks is also a
very important point of efficiency.

59
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,780
If we consider such trucks,
we have approximately 0.8 tons

60
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,330
per cubic meter; because
we have a compaction system,

61
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,860
we have more or less 7 cubic meters,
which makes more or less 5.

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,250
6 tons.

63
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,900
In such an open truck, we have only 

64
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,020
0.3 tons per cubic meter.

65
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,140
Also about 8 cubic
meters, we have only 

66
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,790
2.4 tons.

67
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,310
This is just half.

68
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,290
In this bad system, we have also

69
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:32,980
 0.3 tons per cubic meter and 1
cubic meter, which means only 

70
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,280
0.3 or 0. 5 tons.

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,600
So the transportation between
these different types of trucks

72
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,400
is very different, and we have
to choose also a good volume

73
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,180
for efficient transportation.

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,320
This has influence on time
and on fuel consumption.

75
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,140
Other element, very simple, is to
choose trucks having an unloading

76
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,230
time as short as possible.

77
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,460
In this kind of trucks we see
that we can unload it in more

78
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,010
or less 2 minutes with one driver.

79
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,700
If you have to do it manually,
like in this situation, we need

80
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,040
3 or 4 hours with 3 or 4 workers.

81
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,540
These are not good solutions.

82
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,330
For reducing the time the trucks
are stopped for loading

83
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,200
the waste, we also need to choose
a good container strategy.

84
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:40,470
Bulk waste in the ground
is the worst case.

85
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,610
Here in Albania, or in São Tomé,
we see how many times it's

86
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,460
necessary to load the
waste to the truck.

87
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,460
The utilization of plastic bags
allows a faster loading time.

88
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,740
The best is the utilization of
containers, and if possible standardized

89
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,360
containers.

90
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:08,530
Ideal solution for reducing the
loading time is to provide containers

91
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,700
with large or very large capacity.

92
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:18,020
A truck takes more or less the same time
to load 100 liters or 3 cubic meters.

93
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,810
There are some other conditions
to reduce the loading time.

94
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,760
First, is that the containers must
be accessible for the trucks,

95
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,120
and not blocked like here
in Albania by the cars.

96
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:39,420
For having the containers in good
condition, it needs to organize

97
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,370
maintenance and repairing
the containers.

98
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,490
This means to respond
to some questions:

99
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,530
Who is the owner of the container?

100
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,510
Who is responsible?

101
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,740
Who is in charge of the maintenance?

102
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,770
Who would react if there are not
enough containers, or if the

103
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,360
containers are not in good condition?

104
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,960
A good routing design is another
important point for efficient

105
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
collection of the waste.

106
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,390
In this example, we see the door-to-door
collection of every container.

107
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,360
The collection time and
distances are quite high.

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,370
It could be also possible to reduce
the number of loading points,

109
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,860
and to reduce the
distance of the work.

110
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:35,780
It will take less time, less effort
for the same number of containers.

111
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,080
It will require that the population
has to go 100 or 200 meters

112
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,720
to the containers.

113
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,480
But this happens in a lot of cities.

114
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,910
Finally, transports are an
important point of the cost

115
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,030
as we saw at the beginning.

116
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,690
Transport costs are depending on
local conditions, quantities

117
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,860
and distances, and materials.

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,170
If you use a big truck or a small
one, the time and fuel consumption

119
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,060
are more or less the same, so it's
very important to use trucks

120
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,390
as big as possible.

121
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,600
To reduce the cost it is also
important that the trucks are

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,020
in average near 100% full.

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,960
If they are not full enough, the cost
per ton will increase rapidly.

124
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,810
But, in general, collection trucks
are not optimal for transport.

125
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,170
If the distance to the landfill is
more than some 20 kilometers,

126
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,480
and if the volume is big enough,
it is interesting to study

127
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,870
the possibility of the implementation
of transfer stations.

128
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,760
In this case, transport is done by
big trucks, having a capacity

129
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,370
of 3 to 5 collection trucks.

130
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,660
Collection trucks and teams keep
working in the city, and transport

131
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,500
trucks ensure the transport
to the landfill.

132
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,250
Such transport stations can
contribute significantly to

133
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,150
the efficiency and to the cost
reduction of the transport.

134
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,000
The sustainability of the waste
management service is strongly

135
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
depending from the cost.

136
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,860
The experience shows that there
is usually a big potential of

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,550
cost reduction in
collection and transport.

138
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,750
Working for cost reduction means
to choose good trucks and good

139
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,190
bins in order to reduce the times,
but also to choose a reduced

140
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,920
number of collection points, 
to make a good routing, and

141
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,360
to create a good organization and
maintenance system of trucks and bins.

142
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,510
Next time we will see in more detail
how to proceed on an analysis

143
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,050
of the present situation in
order to reduce these costs.
