1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,650
Today, we will speak about
different treatment options which

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,680
are mostly used in
developed countries.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,940
These are incineration, mechanical
biological treatment 

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,300
and refuse-derived fuel. All these
solutions require quite a high

5
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,390
level of technology.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,760
Generally and historically these
solutions were developed with

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,220
the following objectives. Firstly,
the necessity of reducing

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,580
the quantities of waste which
have to be stored in landfill,

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,470
generally due to difficulty in
finding places for new landfills,

10
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,160
for new volumes in the
neighborhood of big cities.

11
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,620
Secondly, for the willingness to
use the value of material or

12
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,040
of the energy from the waste.

13
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,830
And thirdly for the willingness of
reducing the long term impact

14
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,190
on the environment.

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,070
Incineration allows to use the
waste calorific content to create

16
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,810
heat production which can
be used for electricity production

17
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,770
and, in cold countries, for warming
the city buildings through

18
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,010
an underground heating system.

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,810
The waste calorific content is
strongly varying with the waste

20
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,700
 characteristics and especially of
the plastic and paper content.

21
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,560
Generally, richer are the inhabitants,
more waste they are producing

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,460
and higher is the calorific
value of the waste.

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:47,580
Incineration is transforming the
waste in two main flaws:

24
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,340
the smoke of flue gas and the ashes
were all of the heavy metal

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,380
and acid gas will be concentrated;
the slags, which represent

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,710
some 22% of the initial waste
weight and which have to be land

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,030
filled after to have
recuperated iron and aluminum.

28
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,320
Without treatment, the smoke
would strongly pollute the air

29
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,160
and the environment with
acid and heavy metals.

30
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,400
For this reason, the gas treatment
is a very important part

31
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,120
of the incineration process.

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,220
This treatment with filters and
gas washing system produces

33
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,410
ashes and sludge where the heavy
metals will be concentrated.

34
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,590
In the most modern incineration
plants, these metals can be

35
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,480
recuperated and recycled.

36
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,280
Incineration capacity of a plant
is strongly dependent from

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
waste composition and quantity.

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,410
The investment cost of an
incineration plant is very high and

39
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:03,220
the financial cost represents
approximately 50 to 100 dollars per ton.

40
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,600
In total, the global cost of an
incineration represents some

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,880
100 to 200 dollars per ton which
is a very high cost for most

42
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,810
of the developing countries.

43
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,260
In this example, we can show that
the revenue of energy production

44
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,240
only represents some
15% of the total cost.

45
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,090
There are a lot of different
types of mechanical biological

46
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,360
process but they all have the same
objectives, to increase

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,020
the recycling part of the waste
through an in-plant treatment and

48
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,630
to reduce the proportion of the waste
needed to be stored in landfills.

49
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:52,150
The general idea is to combine
different systems in order

50
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,960
to separate the waste in different
interesting fractions.

51
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,530
There are mechanical systems like
crashing, screening, sieving;

52
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,210
magnetic system in order to get
back the ferrous material and

53
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,930
manual sorting which allows to
recuperate any valuable material

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,280
like aluminum cans,
plastic or other metals.

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,090
Here, we can see a
typical recycling plant.

56
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,820
At the beginning, we can see a
reception and storage area where

57
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,530
the waste is coming. Then, a first
mechanical sorting installation

58
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,100
from which we can take out organic
waste and also all the fine materials.

59
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,240
After we have a sorting plant,
manual, from which different

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,510
types of materials can be taken,
and the residual waste is

61
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,060
going to landfill through
a transport truck.

62
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,610
The efficiency of such a waste
sorting plant is much higher

63
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,590
with a separate collection
of recyclable material.

64
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,390
It's not so efficient to treat
100% of the waste in order to

65
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,860
separate only 5 to 15 % of the
waste, it's much better to have

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:18,080
a separate collection and then to
organize the sorting of good

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,020
quality recycled material.

68
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,360
For that, it is better to have
a separate collection through

69
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,590
a door-to-door system or better
with specific collection points

70
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,980
where people can bring their
recyclable waste in the city.

71
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,910
In this case, the recycled material
will be of much better quality

72
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,610
and will have a better
value on the market.

73
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,270
But anyway, it is important to
notice that experience shows

74
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:54,920
that the collection, treatment and
transport of recycled material

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,280
is not covered by the selling
price of the recycled materials.

76
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,850
Recycling, in plant, is an additional
cost for the municipality.

77
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:10,970
If the organic fraction is not
collected separately at source,

78
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,560
the sorting and recycling of the
organic material from the waste

79
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,840
in a sorting plant is not recommended.

80
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,250
The reason is that the organic
fraction will be contaminated

81
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,280
by the fine elements of the waste
where are concentrated

82
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,830
the main pollutants like heavy metals.

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,630
Mechanical treatment is also very
much used for the separation

84
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,710
and recycling of construction waste.

85
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,550
The main idea of the refuse-derived
fuel system is to consider

86
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,340
the waste as an energy source which
can be used as an alternative

87
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,240
fuel in substitution of primary fossil
fuels such as gas, coal or oil.

88
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:04,330
For that objective, it is necessary
to process and transform

89
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,010
the waste in order to produce a
solid fuel, having the highest

90
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,390
possible calorific content.

91
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,100
Then, this alternative fuel
can be stored and used.

92
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,310
The most common user is
the cement industry.

93
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,290
This production requires a series
of mechanical treatments

94
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,960
of the waste combined sometimes
with manual sorting.

95
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,100
Then we have concentrated all the
most interesting part of the

96
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,550
waste with the maximum calorific
value like plastic, papers,

97
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,780
cardboard and these go through a shredder
to be prepared for the storage.

98
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,910
The cost of such system represents
25 to 50 US dollars per ton.

99
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,790
Other separately collected waste
are also used as fuel in

100
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,700
the cement industry, like tires,
solvents, waste oil, industrial

101
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,320
waste or agriculture organic waste.

102
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,570
The economic interest of the
refuse-derived fuel is directly

103
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,520
depending on the fuel cost but
also the transport distances

104
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,900
to the cement plant
and to the landfill.

105
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,300
Other important point is the
technical investment the cement

106
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:29,460
plant has to do for accepting the derived
fuel and respect the legislation.

107
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,820
For the moment, the refuse-derived
fuel system has not known

108
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,900
a big development, important reason
is that generally the cement

109
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,740
industry prefers other types of
waste with higher calorific

110
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,820
content and better stability like
tires, waste oil or solvent.

111
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,300
In conclusion, we can say that all
of these alternative treatment

112
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,250
options can reduce the quantity
of waste to be landfilled but

113
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,060
they generate an additional cost.

114
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,400
Treatment, transport costs are
generally not covered by

115
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,210
the value of recycled material or energy.

116
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,060
In plant, manual sorting of the
human waste creates health

117
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,100
and safety hazard to workers
and should be avoided.

118
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,860
Priority should be given to the outsource
recycling and separate collection.
