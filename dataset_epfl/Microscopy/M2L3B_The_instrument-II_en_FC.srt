00:00:05,225 --> 00:00:07,249
Welcome to CIME's lecture

2
00:00:07,449 --> 00:00:10,449
on transmission electron microscopy
for material science.

3
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:14,570
In today's video, we will use
the building blocks

4
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,320
that we have seen before,
the lenses.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,270
And see how we can put them together
to get a working microscope,

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,795
with all its parts able
to make the image

7
00:00:26,995 --> 00:00:28,520
of a specimen.

8
00:00:29,143 --> 00:00:31,331
<i>There are many lenses
in a microscope.</i>

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,306
<i>They belong to 3 main groups which
have different functionalities.</i>

10
00:00:36,456 --> 00:00:39,993
<i>The first one before
the specimen</i>

11
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:43,193
<i>is called the Condenser lenses.</i>

12
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:47,670
<i>These are the lenses used
to form the beam</i>

13
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:51,318
<i>that is exiting the gun</i>

14
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,518
<i>and project it onto
the specimen.</i>

15
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,046
<i>The second block is the objective
lens and its apertures.</i>

16
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,983
<i>It's where we have
the specimen,</i>

17
00:01:02,183 --> 00:01:05,721
<i>and that is a very important
lens</i>

18
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:08,921
<i>used to make the first
intermediate image</i>

19
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:12,633
<i>of the specimen, and also
a diffraction pattern.</i>

20
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:17,033
<i>And finally, we want to be able
to change the magnification</i>

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,373
<i>to look either at the image
of the specimen</i>

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,473
<i>or at its diffraction pattern,</i>

23
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:26,085
<i>and also to change the magnification
of the diffraction pattern.</i>

24
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,960
<i>That is done by the third group</i>

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,160
<i>which is made of
the intermediate lens</i>

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,360
<i>and projective lenses.</i>

27
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:39,308
<i>So the first group,
condenser lens,</i>

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,367
<i>forms the beam, projected
on the specimen.</i>

29
00:01:44,567 --> 00:01:49,030
<i>The objective lens makes an
image of the specimen,</i>

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,530
<i>and the intermediate
and projective lenses</i>

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,392
<i>will project this image
on the recording device,</i>

32
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:58,392
<i>magnify it, or project
a diffraction pattern</i>

33
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:00,555
<i>eventually magnifying it.</i>

34
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:06,305
<i>Why is it important to understand
those lenses and how they work?</i>

35
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,404
<i>Let's go to the microscope.</i>

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,852
So here we are at the real
transmission electron microscope.

37
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:16,202
This is a JEOL 200kV

38
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,827
and you can recognize the same
structure as we had before

39
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:21,527
in the lecture.

40
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,792
On the top, we have the gun.

41
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:28,192
This is a 200kV field
emission gun.

42
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,787
Then we have the condenser lenses

43
00:02:30,987 --> 00:02:32,899
with condenser aperture.

44
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,099
And below we have the objective lens

45
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,049
with the specimen,
the objective aperture,

46
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,962
and hidden behind, we have
the selected area aperture.

47
00:02:43,669 --> 00:02:46,632
Further down, we have
the intermediate

48
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:48,532
and projective lenses.

49
00:02:48,732 --> 00:02:52,519
And here on the table, we have
the computer

50
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,469
for controlling the microscope

51
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,457
and the control panel.

52
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,604
There are a lot of knobs on
this control panel,

53
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:03,154
and each of these knobs will have
some influence

54
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,929
on some of the lenses
of the microscope.

55
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:09,759
So, for example,
this brightness knob

56
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,434
controls the condenser lenses

57
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:14,996
and the illumination
on the specimen.

58
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,984
If I change the focus knob,

59
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,184
it will change the current
in the objective lens.

60
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:24,234
I can change the magnification

61
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:27,772
which will have an influence
on the projective lens.

62
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,644
I can switch to diffraction

63
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,444
that will change the projective
and intermediate lenses.

64
00:03:34,912 --> 00:03:38,524
And I also can deflect the beam

65
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:41,027
on after, before the specimen

66
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:45,804
So it's very important to understand
what you are doing

67
00:03:46,004 --> 00:03:47,991
when you operate the microscope.

68
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,191
And for this you know 
to understand the functioning

69
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:53,516
of all those group
of lenses.

70
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:57,104
And that's what we ill see now in
the following part of the lecture.

71
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,558
<i>The condenser system forms
the beam after the gun</i>

72
00:04:01,758 --> 00:04:03,983
<i>and projects it on
the specimen.</i>

73
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:07,070
<i>It is the first set of lens
before the specimen</i>

74
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,958
<i>and after the gun.</i>

75
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:11,933
<i>And it is made of at least
2 lenses</i>

76
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:14,108
<i>and 1 aperture.</i>

77
00:04:14,308 --> 00:04:16,770
<i>We will start with
the simplest case</i>

78
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,458
<i>of 2 lenses and 1 aperture.</i>

79
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:24,220
<i>The first one on the top
is called condenser 1.</i>

80
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:26,882
<i>The second one just below</i>

81
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:29,419
<i>is the condenser 2.</i>

82
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:33,057
<i>And the aperture is
the condenser 2 aperture.</i>

83
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,650
<i>The specimen is further away</i>

84
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,313
<i>and the beam formed by
the set of lenses</i>

85
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,675
<i>will be projected on it.</i>

86
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:46,405
<i>The gun is producing
a crossover</i>

87
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:49,930
<i>which is a point where
all the electrons will cross</i>

88
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,968
<i>on the optical axis.</i>

89
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:56,080
<i>These set of lenses will then
form an image</i>

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,305
<i>of this crossover and project it
on the lens.</i>

91
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,643
<i>In that simplest case
which I've taken,</i>

92
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:05,618
<i>the distance between lens
and focal point</i>

93
00:05:05,818 --> 00:05:09,155
<i>is the same as the distance
between focal point and object.</i>

94
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:12,043
<i>So I know that in this
schematic</i>

95
00:05:12,537 --> 00:05:15,712
<i>I will have a magnification
of exactly 1,</i>

96
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:19,137
<i>and the image will form
at the same distance</i>

97
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,862
<i>as the object is. The drawing
is therefore very simple.</i>

98
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,602
<i>Depending on the strength
of the C2 lens,</i>

99
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:38,965
<i>I can form my last crossover
exactly on the specimen,</i>

100
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,973
<i>before the specimen,</i>

101
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,248
<i>or after the specimen.</i>

102
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:48,473
<i>I will take the case where I form it
exactly onto the specimen.</i>

103
00:05:50,454 --> 00:05:52,929
<i>You see that the condenser 2
aperture</i>

104
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:56,454
<i>actually limits the extension
of the beam.</i>

105
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:01,333
<i>I can redo the drawing in
the reverse direction</i>

106
00:06:01,533 --> 00:06:03,583
<i>and I will know exactly</i>

107
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:07,360
<i>what is the maximal opening
of my beam.</i>

108
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,038
<i>This part of the beam, is cut
by the aperture</i>

109
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,088
<i>while this one is kept
by the aperture.</i>

110
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:20,026
<i>I have here, a maximal angle</i>

111
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,589
<i>that will illuminate
the specimen.</i>

112
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,376
<i>It's called the illumination
semi angle alpha.</i>

113
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,264
<i>If I change the excitation of
the C2 lens,</i>

114
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,065
<i>I will change the position
of the focal point.</i>

115
00:06:34,548 --> 00:06:37,423
<i>By doing this, I will
also change</i>

116
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,986
<i>the position at which the crossover
is formed.</i>

117
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,691
<i>For example, if I increase
the strength,</i>

118
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,730
<i>the focal point will move
closer to the lens</i>

119
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:53,144
<i>and the strength of the lens
will be stronger.</i>

120
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:59,810
<i>I will have the same ray
path after C1.</i>

121
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:03,967
<i>But after C2, as I will have
a stronger lens,</i>

122
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,292
<i>my crossover will form earlier.</i>

123
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,442
<i>My lens will be
in over focus.</i>

124
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:14,305
My crossover,
before the specimen.

125
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:18,362
<i>The reverse is if I decrease
the strength of C2 </i>

126
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:21,562
<i>I will form my crossover
after the specimen.</i>

127
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:25,019
<i>If I want to know what will be
the effect of changing the strength</i>

128
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:28,694
<i>of C1, I have to redo
my drawing.</i>

129
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:33,203
<i>And this time, I will increase
the strength of C1.</i>

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,937
<i>Which means I will have
my focal point</i>

131
00:07:38,017 --> 00:07:39,992
<i>closer to the lens,</i>

132
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:43,829
<i>and the symmetric focal point
also closer to the lens.</i>

133
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:47,367
<i>In that case, the image
of my crossover</i>

134
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:51,354
<i>will not be at the symmetrical
position as before.</i>

135
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,825
<i>I have to do a complete drawing
to know where to find it.</i>

136
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:01,735
<i>With this drawing, I know
the position</i>

137
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:05,147
<i>of the image
of my gun crossover</i>

138
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,960
<i>and then I can draw
the ray pass.</i>

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,960
<i>I have to take rays with
a slightly lower opening.</i>

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,035
<i>I need to know the image</i>

141
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:18,935
<i>of this crossover done by C2.</i>

142
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,435
<i>I will adjust my C2 lens</i>

143
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,860
<i>in such a way that the image</i>

144
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,060
<i>is forming on the specimen,</i>

145
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,998
<i>and to have a convergent beam
on the specimen.</i>

146
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:33,310
<i>Adjusting the C2 lens, means
that I am allowed</i>

147
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,310
<i>to change the position of
the focal point.</i>

148
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,348
<i>Now my constraint is that
my object for C2 is there</i>

149
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,060
<i>and my image for C2 is
at that position.</i>

150
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:52,502
<i>With this drawing,
I have the position</i>

151
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:56,388
<i>for my new focal point</i>

152
00:08:56,588 --> 00:08:59,013
<i>F2 of the C2 lens.</i>

153
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:01,196
<i>I also notice something.</i>

154
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,820
<i>Before, I had
a magnification of 1.</i>

155
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:09,344
<i>Now, I have a magnification</i>

156
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:14,032
<i>between this as an object
and that point as an image</i>

157
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,244
<i>which is smaller.</i>

158
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,638
<i>I can finalize the drawing
by knowing that the rays</i>

159
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:22,984
<i>will converge
to the specimen,</i>

160
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:26,859
<i>and then eventually take
into account the C2 aperture.</i>

161
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,996
<i>Finally, by changing
the strength of C1,</i>

162
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:35,175
<i>I end up with a beam
on the specimen</i>

163
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,603
<i>with the same alpha as before</i>

164
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:41,066
<i>when I'm converged
on the specimen,</i>

165
00:09:41,369 --> 00:09:44,444
<i>but with a de-magnified image</i>

166
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:46,571
<i>of my source.</i>

167
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:51,483
<i>I am working with a smaller spot
of electrons on the specimen.</i>

168
00:09:51,783 --> 00:09:57,196
<i>And that's finally why we say
that C1 controls the spot size.</i>

169
00:09:57,521 --> 00:10:00,158
<i>And C2 with its aperture,</i>

170
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,838
<i>will control the opening
of the beam,</i>

171
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:07,038
<i>and the width
of the illumination</i>

172
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,726
<i>on the specimen.</i>

173
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:14,294
<i>So, that was for a 2 condenser
lens system.</i>

174
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:16,838
<i>With the help of
the appendix video</i>

175
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:19,313
<i>you will figure out by yourself
how it works</i>

176
00:10:19,513 --> 00:10:21,913
<i>for a 3 condenser
lens system.</i>

177
00:10:22,113 --> 00:10:24,213
<i>But now let's go
to the microscope.</i>

178
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:27,594
Okay, here we are again
at the microscope.

179
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:31,456
And I will show you the effects
of the condenser lens system.

180
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:36,678
This time, we see the image
of the beam of electrons

181
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:40,913
that will illuminate the place where
we have the specimen.

182
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:45,971
If I turn the knob
called brightness,

183
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:49,958
I can illuminate a larger
or smaller

184
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:53,024
place on my specimen.

185
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:56,982
And this is done by changing
the current

186
00:10:57,182 --> 00:11:00,182
in the second condenser lens

187
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,920
which is called CL3 here.

188
00:11:06,262 --> 00:11:09,824
I can also change the spot size.

189
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:13,954
Now we have spot 1,
to increase it

190
00:11:14,464 --> 00:11:19,964
for example, to spot 3, 4, 5, etc.

191
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:24,664
This changes massively the current
in the first condenser lens

192
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:28,974
and with this I'm able to have

193
00:11:29,174 --> 00:11:32,087
a smaller illumination
on my specimen.

194
00:11:33,762 --> 00:11:37,550
<i>But now let's move on to the next
building block of the microscope.</i>

195
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:41,948
<i>The objective lens makes
the first intermediate image</i>

196
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,135
<i>and diffraction pattern
after the specimen.</i>

197
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:47,310
<i>It's a very important one.</i>

198
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,510
<i>It has 3 main components.
The lens itself,</i>

199
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:52,821
<i>and 2 apertures.</i>

200
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,578
<i>At that height, we have
the specimen.</i>

201
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:59,606
<i>We can generally make
a simple sketch</i>

202
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,331
<i>where we have
the optical axis,</i>

203
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:05,081
<i>the specimen, and
the objective lens.</i>

204
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:09,068
<i>We suppose that we know where
we have the focal point</i>

205
00:12:09,545 --> 00:12:12,820
<i>F and F' of
the objective lens.</i>

206
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:15,611
<i>First of all, we need
to figure out</i>

207
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,999
<i>where the image of the specimen
is forming.</i>

208
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:25,043
<i>With this, I see that I have
an image</i>

209
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,505
<i>formed below the lens with
a small magnification.</i>

210
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,123
<i>For simplicity,
I will imagine</i>

211
00:12:32,373 --> 00:12:35,948
<i>that my illumination system,
the condenser lenses,</i>

212
00:12:36,224 --> 00:12:40,086
<i>produce a parallel illumination
on the specimen.</i>

213
00:12:40,655 --> 00:12:45,442
<i>Some of the electrons will
interact weakly with the specimen,</i>

214
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,437
<i>and will exit the specimen
parallel to the optical axis.</i>

215
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:53,726
<i>Those electrons will be focused
to the back focal plane</i>

216
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,464
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

217
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,688
<i>With this drawing,
I know exactly</i>

218
00:12:58,963 --> 00:13:01,575
<i>that this point
of the specimen</i>

219
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,799
<i>corresponds to this point
of the image.</i>

220
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:10,636
<i>If I imagine that I have
a series of electrons</i>

221
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,472
<i>that are diffracted
in the specimen,</i>

222
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:16,794
<i>they will exit the specimen</i>

223
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,976
<i>with the beam making an angle
to the optical axis.</i>

224
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:25,596
<i>But all this part
of the specimen</i>

225
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:28,009
<i>will diffract the same way</i>

226
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:31,209
<i>which means that all these rays
will be parallel</i>

227
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:32,909
<i>to each other.</i>

228
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:37,543
<i>Still,</i>

229
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:41,304
<i>rays exiting the specimen
from that point</i>

230
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:46,095
<i>will correspond to the same
image point</i>

231
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:47,583
<i>on the specimen.</i>

232
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,908
<i>They will be focused by
the objective lens</i>

233
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:55,547
<i>to this point. The same
holds for the next one.</i>

234
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,334
<i>And I can continue
my drawing.</i>

235
00:13:59,648 --> 00:14:01,623
<i>Now, what you can observe</i>

236
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:04,823
<i>is that all those red rays</i>

237
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:08,623
<i>cross at the same position
in the back focal plane</i>

238
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,511
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

239
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:14,261
<i>That's something that you might
have seen in your optics lecture.</i>

240
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:20,385
<i>Rays that enter the lens
parallel to each other</i>

241
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:23,310
<i>but at an angle
to the optical axis,</i>

242
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,935
<i>will be focused to a point
in the back focal plane</i>

243
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:28,772
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

244
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,407
<i>Now we can connect
the different parts</i>

245
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:36,045
<i>of this drawing
with the microscope.</i>

246
00:14:36,945 --> 00:14:41,033
<i>At that position, we have
the specimen holder</i>

247
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:42,733
<i>with the specimen.</i>

248
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,733
<i>We have a first aperture.</i>

249
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:48,820
<i>This one is the objective aperture,</i>

250
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,833
<i>and it is exactly situated in
the back focal plane</i>

251
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,895
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

252
00:14:59,227 --> 00:15:02,277
<i>We have a 2nd aperture
further down.</i>

253
00:15:02,923 --> 00:15:05,536
<i>This one is situated
at the height</i>

254
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:07,898
<i>of the first intermediate
image</i>

255
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:09,523
<i>of the specimen.</i>

256
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:14,061
<i>This aperture is called a selected
area aperture.</i>

257
00:15:14,904 --> 00:15:17,491
<i>Actually, if you want to go
a little bit further,</i>

258
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:20,627
<i>you might have seen in
your optics lecture</i>

259
00:15:21,174 --> 00:15:24,786
<i>that in the back focal plane
of the objective lens,</i>

260
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:27,382
<i>you have a Fourier transformation</i>

261
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:28,994
<i>of your object.</i>

262
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:32,688
<i>The Fourier transformation
of a specimen</i>

263
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,307
<i>if it's a crystalline specimen,</i>

264
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:37,882
<i>you enter
the reciprocal space.</i>

265
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:40,920
<i>Which means that
in the back focal plane</i>

266
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,920
<i>of the objective lens,</i>

267
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,608
<i>you have an information on
the reciprocal lattice</i>

268
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:48,083
<i>of your specimen.</i>

269
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:50,970
<i>And that's exactly
your diffraction pattern.</i>

270
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,495
<i>We will come closer to this
in the lecture about</i>

271
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,958
<i>diffraction contrast, and
diffraction in the TEM.</i>

272
00:15:57,335 --> 00:16:00,810
<i>But now, let's look
into more detail</i>

273
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,935
<i>at that real transmission
microscope.</i>

274
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:07,083
<i>If you look carefully,
you will recognize</i>

275
00:16:07,283 --> 00:16:10,095
<i>that the objective aperture</i>

276
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:13,570
<i>which is in the back focal plane
of the objective lens</i>

277
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:17,790
<i>is very close to the specimen.</i>

278
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,418
<i>And that in contrast,
the selected area aperture</i>

279
00:16:22,643 --> 00:16:24,456
<i>is very far away.</i>

280
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:26,992
<i>A second strange thing</i>

281
00:16:27,192 --> 00:16:30,542
<i>is that the objective lens
seems to be</i>

282
00:16:30,742 --> 00:16:32,580
<i>below its back focal plane.</i>

283
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,567
<i>This is absolutely impossible.</i>

284
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:38,480
<i>In reality, you have soft
magnetic material</i>

285
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,842
<i>which guides
the magnetic field</i>

286
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,730
<i>produced by the coil of
the objective lens,</i>

287
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,727
<i>to be very close
to the specimen.</i>

288
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:50,239
<i>All these distances are
in the order of magnitude</i>

289
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,539
<i>of a few millimeters. </i>

290
00:16:52,739 --> 00:16:55,039
<i>The focal length of the objective
lens is generally</i>

291
00:16:55,239 --> 00:16:57,252
<i>around 2 millimeters.</i>

292
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,880
<i>The specimen is very close
to the front focal plane</i>

293
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,068
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

294
00:17:04,268 --> 00:17:07,943
<i>What would happen if you
would try to draw this exactly?</i>

295
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:12,814
<i>Instead of having
the focal point</i>

296
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:15,676
<i>between lens and specimen,</i>

297
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:19,476
<i>we should put it close
to the specimen.</i>

298
00:17:19,932 --> 00:17:23,670
<i>In that case, when I try
to draw the image</i>

299
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,332
<i>of my specimen,</i>

300
00:17:25,532 --> 00:17:29,107
<i>I will take a point close
to the optical axis,</i>

301
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,304
<i>passing through the focal point,</i>

302
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:35,979
<i>and then exiting parallel
to the optical axis...</i>

303
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:38,442
<i>Oops. I have a problem.</i>

304
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,492
<i>I can't do my drawing.</i>

305
00:17:40,913 --> 00:17:44,975
<i>The image is forming
very far away.</i>

306
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:47,994
<i>A second thing
that you notice,</i>

307
00:17:48,194 --> 00:17:50,556
<i>is that if this is my object,</i>

308
00:17:50,914 --> 00:17:54,977
<i>the image would have this size
even if it's much further down.</i>

309
00:17:55,302 --> 00:17:57,977
<i>That's exactly what happens
in the microscope.</i>

310
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:01,177
<i>The magnification by
the objective lens</i>

311
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:04,202
<i>is around 50 times.</i>

312
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:09,283
<i>The specimen is very close
to the focal point</i>

313
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:12,846
<i>and the image is forming
far away</i>

314
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:14,971
<i>from the lenses.</i>

315
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:18,909
<i>Since such a real scale drawing
is not practicable,</i>

316
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:23,659
<i>we will always use a sketch
with small magnification.</i>

317
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:27,030
<i>We now remain with the last
building block.</i>

318
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,075
<i>To visualize the image</i>

319
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,275
<i>or diffraction pattern formed
by the objective lens,</i>

320
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:37,070
<i>we use the intermediate
and projective lenses.</i>

321
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,555
<i>This is the group
that is situated after</i>

322
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,413
<i>the objective lens.</i>

323
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:46,813
<i>Generally you have at least
one intermediate lens</i>

324
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:48,901
<i>and 2 projective lenses.</i>

325
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,313
<i>Do we really need to draw them</i>

326
00:18:51,513 --> 00:18:53,651
<i>to understand how
they are working?</i>

327
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:56,734
<i>Actually, we never do it.</i>

328
00:18:56,934 --> 00:19:00,484
<i>We stick to the drawing
of the objective lens,</i>

329
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,942
<i>the one that we have here</i>

330
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:06,579
<i>which I have put a little bit
further up.</i>

331
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:10,254
<i>So let's connect all
the things together.</i>

332
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:14,061
<i>At that position I have</i>

333
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,981
<i>the specimen,</i>

334
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:19,443
<i>then I have the formation</i>

335
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:22,743
<i>of the diffraction pattern in
the back focal plane</i>

336
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:25,330
<i>of the objective lens.</i>

337
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:29,026
<i>And the selected area aperture</i>

338
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:32,620
<i>in the first intermediate image.</i>

339
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:38,792
<i>That's the diffraction pattern,
the image, and that's my specimen.</i>

340
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:42,312
<i>The current in those intermediate
and projective lenses</i>

341
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:44,587
<i>is not changed continuously.</i>

342
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:47,911
<i>It has presets,
and those presets</i>

343
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:53,126
<i>will help to either
project the image</i>

344
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,781
<i>of my specimen on
the recording device,</i>

345
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,006
<i>and when I do this</i>

346
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:02,568
<i>I obtain on my camera</i>

347
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,980
<i>something that might
resemble that.</i>

348
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,550
<i>That's a small oxide particle,</i>

349
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:13,426
<i>and that's the direct image
of this particle.</i>

350
00:20:14,912 --> 00:20:18,387
<i>By just doing one press
on one knob,</i>

351
00:20:18,587 --> 00:20:21,587
<i>I can switch all my lenses</i>

352
00:20:22,286 --> 00:20:24,999
<i>and then move
to the projection</i>

353
00:20:25,199 --> 00:20:28,199
<i>of the diffraction pattern
on the recording camera.</i>

354
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,893
<i>And in that case,
I see directly</i>

355
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:36,855
<i>the diffraction pattern
of this small oxide particle.</i>

356
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:40,333
<i>Okay, you will see
this interplay</i>

357
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:46,246
<i>between the pre-select of this
intermediate and projective lens,</i>

358
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:51,488
<i>and those planes in
the next part of the lecture</i>

359
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,001
<i>where we will show</i>

360
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,338
<i>the complete microscope
at work.</i>

361
00:20:56,968 --> 00:21:00,330
<i>Together with demonstration
on a real TEM.</i>

362
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:02,189
So in today's module,

363
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,176
we have seen the
3 main blocks of lenses

364
00:21:05,376 --> 00:21:08,914
that are used first
to produce the image

365
00:21:09,114 --> 00:21:11,201
of the crossover after the gun

366
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:13,664
to illuminate the specimen.

367
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:16,889
Then to make your first image
of the specimen,

368
00:21:17,223 --> 00:21:21,898
and finally to take the image
or diffraction pattern

369
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:25,098
and view it on your recording device.

370
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:26,996
Next time,

371
00:21:27,196 --> 00:21:30,558
we will have a look at the complete
microscope at work.

372
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:32,934
Both in diffraction mode,

373
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:35,034
and in imaging mode

374
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:38,234
and see how we can control
those lenses

375
00:21:38,434 --> 00:21:41,984
to really obtain images
and diffraction patterns.
