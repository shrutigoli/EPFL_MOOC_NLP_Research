1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,724
So, welcome to CIME's lecture on
Transmission Microscopy for material

2
00:00:10,924 --> 00:00:15,080
science. In this video we will have
a brief historical introduction

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,753
about the Transmission microscope
and then review all the building parts

4
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,608
of the instrument with which we will
work during this lecture.

5
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:31,150
The Transmission Electron Microscope
was first built by Knoll&Ruska

6
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:36,519
in 1931. When they have built the
first prototype.

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,165
Actually, when they started working
on this device, the idea was to prove

8
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:50,696
the theoretical demonstration that
thin electromagnetic coil would have

9
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:56,565
exactly the same effect on electrons
than a thin glass lens has on light.

10
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:01,265
So, if you want to prove this, the
idea was to say: "OK, let's prove

11
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:07,525
that this lens, electromagnetic lens
can focus electron and make an image"

12
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:13,978
And very soon they realized that
it's possible to get images with

13
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:19,224
better resolution than the light
microscope. Only two years later

14
00:01:19,424 --> 00:01:24,997
the TEM is surpassing the light
microscope in terms of resolution

15
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:31,066
And then only 6 years later there're
the first commercial instruments

16
00:01:31,266 --> 00:01:35,348
which is quite fast if you look at
the time and history in Germany

17
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:42,764
at that time. And then time passes
and it's only 1986 that E.Ruska's

18
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:48,346
is awarded the Nobel Price. About
the Nobel lecture I really recommend

19
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:53,576
that you have a read at a Nobel
lector E.Ruska because it's both

20
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:58,139
very entertaining and very
instructive on how this instrument

21
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:03,995
was imagined, developed, built
and all the interaction between

22
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:07,307
engineering technique and
science at that time.

23
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:14,094
I said 1933 the TEM surpasses the
light microscope in resolution.

24
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:19,557
Why is it so? How can we explain
this? For the light microscope you

25
00:02:19,757 --> 00:02:23,296
all know the Abbe diffraction limit
based on the Rayleigh Criterion

26
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:27,596
It gives you the smallest detail
that you can resolve in a microscope

27
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:32,733
as a function of the wavelength
lambda and the numerical aperture

28
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:38,173
n sinus theta. A similar formula
holds for the electron microscope

29
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:42,233
where lambda is the wavelength
of the electrons and theta -

30
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:45,754
the maximum angle at which
electrons are collected.

31
00:02:45,954 --> 00:02:50,505
Let's try to plug in some numbers
in there. Lambda for typical

32
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:57,151
transmission elec. microscope at
200 kilovolt is about 2.5 picometer.

33
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:06,003
so  10 to the -12 meter at 200
kV. Theta is the angle at which

34
00:03:06,203 --> 00:03:10,889
electrons are collected, and it's
typically around 10 milliradians.

35
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:18,138
Say 10 to 20. So, 10 to the
-2 radians. You will come back later

36
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:23,566
to this during the lecture. OK,
putting this into the formula, we

37
00:03:23,766 --> 00:03:36,241
get "d" approximatively 1.2 times
2.5 10 to the -12 over 10 to the -2

38
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:46,023
which is around 3 10 to the -10
it's 3 Angstrom. We are around the

39
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:52,453
atomic distances in material. Atomic
resolution is possible and that was

40
00:03:52,653 --> 00:03:58,936
already recognized as early as in
the 30s. Let's imagine now if we

41
00:03:59,136 --> 00:04:04,550
improve things a little bit with
lambda, or with theta, then we can

42
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:10,834
get maybe less than 3 Angstrem.
If we have 10 to 20 millirads then

43
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:17,882
20 millirads gives us 1.5 Angstrom,
that's really around the interatomic

44
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:25,803
distance in crystals. It's far above
the resolution of a light microscope.

45
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:31,304
And indeed if we watch the evolution of
resolution of microscope,

46
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:36,582
you see that the resolution of light
microscopes was improving at the

47
00:04:36,782 --> 00:04:43,250
beginning and then is hitting some
maximum just limited by the

48
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:47,368
Abbe diffraction limit and
wavelength of light and you reach

49
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:54,775
something around 100-200 nanometers
and as soon as it started being

50
00:04:54,975 --> 00:05:01,410
commercialized the EM
surpasses the resolution of LM.

51
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,751
And the resolution increase as
progress is made to be able to

52
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:11,505
work with larger theta, or smaller
lambda. But then, it reaches also

53
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:17,295
a maximum which is just below 1
Angstrom. Why is it so? Can't we

54
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:21,841
improve things by having a very
large theta? Well, actually not

55
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:26,731
because we have problems with
aberrations. So, for these microscopes

56
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:32,260
 the resolution is limited by the
aberrations and not as for LM

57
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,595
by the wavelength. Later on
aberration corrected microscope

58
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:42,176
were developed and with aberration
corrected transmission microscope

59
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:47,393
you can reach even better resolutions.
So, I think that's sufficient to be

60
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:52,134
convinced that this is a fantastic
instrument that will open

61
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:57,664
an incredible amount of
possibilities. But before learning

62
00:05:57,864 --> 00:06:02,738
how to work with it and how it works
we need to look at its difference

63
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:08,543
building blocks. So, we need to look
at all of the constituent of the TM.

64
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:14,755
Let's start with this microscope:
it's a Jeol 200cx an old generation

65
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:19,831
microscope that has been cut open,
so you can see all the internal part

66
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,266
because normally they have to be
under vacuum. The electrons are

67
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:29,208
generated on the top and come down
the electron column they hit the

68
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:33,526
specimen at the height of the
specimen holder and they're focused

69
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,636
by all these electromagnetic lenses.
So, let's start from the top.

70
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:43,828
We have the electron gun at the top
The electron gun will be the part

71
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:49,025
that generates and accelerates
the electrons. The first part, where

72
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:54,269
the electrons are generated is
hidden behind this plastic part

73
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:58,517
and then all these ceramics are
separating of different parts of

74
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:06,667
the accelerator. The emitter emits
the electrons. And the accelerator

75
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:11,419
stage accelerates them to the
desired energy. There are 4 types

76
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:19,468
of emitter listed in the next table.
W and LaB6 are so-called

77
00:07:19,668 --> 00:07:27,327
thermionic emitters. For those 2
types, the emitter is heated and

78
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:31,716
electrons are emitted
because of this heating.

79
00:07:31,916 --> 00:07:37,539
The Cold Field Emission Gun is
a real field emission emitter

80
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:43,459
The electrons are emitted thanks
to a high electric field applied to

81
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:50,148
the emitter. And in the middle we
have the so-called Shotkey FEG

82
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:55,149
which is a compromise between
thermionic emitter and Cold FEG

83
00:07:55,349 --> 00:08:01,315
where the electrons are emitted by field 
emmission assisted by a heating of the

84
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:06,141
filament. A key quantity to
characterize the emitter is the

85
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:14,281
brightness. The brightness gives
the intensity emitted per sq.m

86
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:20,469
and steradian. So, if you take an
area of your emitter and you look

87
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,809
at the current, the number of
electrons by unit of time

88
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:35,737
emitted for this given area, and
in a solid angle omega, you get the

89
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:41,251
brightness. There's a huge difference
in brightness between the different

90
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:46,722
type of emitters. And the high
brightness is linked to a high coherency

91
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:51,818
because the electrons come from
a small part of the emitter

92
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:58,773
This is important for phase contrast.
A second characteristic is the size

93
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:07,657
of the cross over after the emitter.
It is much larger for W, than for

94
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:13,310
the Cold FEG. With a small size of
the cross over after the gun

95
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,352
you will be able to focus your
beam more precisely on the specimen

96
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:23,446
which will be good for chemical
analysis, for example, or for

97
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,646
working in scanning transmission
electron microscopy.

98
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:32,464
The third characteristic is the
energy spread. How well are

99
00:09:32,664 --> 00:09:38,139
the electrons defined in energy.
Field emission gun have a much

100
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,795
narrower energy spread. This is both
important for chemical analysis,

101
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:49,636
but also a smaller energy spread
gives a better temporal coherency

102
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:55,252
important for phase contrast as well.
But those better characteristic

103
00:09:55,452 --> 00:10:01,467
come at a price. We need a higher
vacuum or those emitters, which

104
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,059
means that they are much more
expensive in operation,

105
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,908
but fortunately they also have
a longer lifetime.

106
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,587
Let's continue down the column
to the next part.

107
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:17,897
One of the most important one:
It's the electron lens.

108
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:23,204
The electron lenses, you see some
there, but also some down the column

109
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:26,612
They are electromagnetic coils.

110
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:34,004
If you look at an enlarged picture
you can clearly see how the wires

111
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:38,722
so it just a copper wires winded
around the optical axes of the micr.

112
00:10:38,922 --> 00:10:42,389
You see all is wires there.

113
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:48,070
So, with this geometry, they will
definitively generate a field with

114
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,922
cylindrical symmetry. Also, with
this type of lenses, there's a big

115
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:57,226
difference compared to light
microscopy. Here we can easily

116
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:02,005
change continuously the focal
length of the lens by just changing

117
00:11:02,205 --> 00:11:06,756
the current in the coil and that is what
we do all the time when we operate

118
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:11,682
the microscope. For example, when
we change magnification, the focus

119
00:11:11,882 --> 00:11:15,949
of the image, change from imaging
to diffraction, etc.

120
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:20,955
This is much more versatile than
for a light microscope.

121
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:25,079
We had a little talk about this.
They are "bad" lenses.

122
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,340
They have a lot of aberrations,
and that will be the limiting

123
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,703
factor to the resolution of
microscope. So the TEM is

124
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:38,264
limited by the aberration of
this kind of lenses. That is why

125
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:42,361
we will review the aberrations in
the next lesson as they are very

126
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:46,107
important to understand the
imaging properties of the microscope.

127
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:50,579
Also, if you stick to lenses with
cylindrical symmetry, as is usually

128
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:56,613
the case in the TEM, then you only
get convergent lenses.

129
00:11:56,813 --> 00:12:00,838
And last. Because the electron lens
has the same focusing property

130
00:12:01,038 --> 00:12:07,211
on electrons,  than a glass lens has on light, you can make use of
ray diagrams to understand your

131
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:13,651
microscope as you do in light
microscopy. So, basically, I have two

132
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:17,966
news there. One bad news-
the electron microscope is limited

133
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:23,153
by the resolution of those lenses.
One good news - you will be able

134
00:12:23,353 --> 00:12:26,752
to use ray diagrams and you will
make use of them all the time

135
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:30,468
during this lecture. They are very
important to understand the

136
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,936
working property of the TEM.

137
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:39,545
OK. It's a good news provided
you remember how to use them.

138
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:43,679
So, do you remember how to draw
the image produced by the thin

139
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,707
convergent lens? If not, it will be
explained in the next video.

140
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:54,363
But let's continue on the building
parts of the microscope now.

141
00:12:54,563 --> 00:13:00,809
The next one, that we will look at
are the Apertures. The Apertures

142
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:05,208
are holes of defined size placed
on the path of the beam.

143
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:08,621
They are supported by a thin plate
mounted on a rod.

144
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:13,579
You can see here some apertures
in the lower part of the image also.

145
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:19,011
These holes are small 10-200
micrometers and they will limit the

146
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:24,809
extension of the beam. Generally,
you have something like 4-8 sizes

147
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:28,608
you can chose from, like here,
for example you recognize

148
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:33,975
maybe 3-4 sizes, and they are at
strategic places in the microscope.

149
00:13:34,175 --> 00:13:38,568
They will define some properties of
the beam, like the one which is just

150
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:44,166
after the beam-forming coils that
we will review next time or the one

151
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:50,596
which are at strategic places in the
imaging parts of the microscope.

152
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:56,251
And, finally, we need to look at
something, right? We want a specimen

153
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:04,738
we want the specimen  hold at  some place. It's hold in the
Goniometer and in a  thing called

154
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:10,108
the Specimen holder. The specimen
we look at TEM is small and you will

155
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:16,777
see that is the specimen holder that
enters the beam, the optical axis

156
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:22,503
is down there and at that point you
have the place for the specimen.

157
00:14:22,703 --> 00:14:26,562
So, the specimen holder will hold
the investigated specimen.

158
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:32,537
Very commonly it's a 3mm disc
and you need an area that will be

159
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:39,477
transparent to your electrons an
magnitude should be around 100nm

160
00:14:39,677 --> 00:14:44,887
or less. If it's thinner, it's much
better for some imaging.

161
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:52,470
Natively, you will be able to tilt
your specimen along the axis of

162
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,140
the specimen holder. That's what
we call the alpha-tilt.

163
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,244
Some holders will also allow you to
tilt the specimen along a second axis

164
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:07,604
which is perpendicular to it. And
then some holders will allow

165
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:13,797
incredible things. Like, you will
be able to heat your specimen or cool your specimen

166
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:18,587
to liquid Nitrogen temperature or
even to liquid Helium temperature.

167
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:22,838
Might be able to have electrical
fields, or electrical currents

168
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:27,701
You might be able to have some
straining experiment or some

169
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:32,329
indentation experiment, well
there's no limit to the imagination.

170
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:36,461
That will not be too much part of
the lecture that if you look in to

171
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:40,120
what's done in transmission
electromicroscopy, there's a huge

172
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,629
variety of in situ experiments
allowed by these specimen holders.

173
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:50,511
And, finally, to be a little bit
back to the real world, well

174
00:15:50,711 --> 00:15:56,768
I've brought you a specimen holder.
It's there in its protective cover

175
00:15:56,968 --> 00:16:03,812
and if I remove it, you see this
very thin long rod. That's an O ring

176
00:16:04,012 --> 00:16:07,463
that will allow to keep the vacuum
in the microscope and there you have

177
00:16:07,663 --> 00:16:14,549
the place where to put the specimen.
So, it's a small thin disc and some

178
00:16:14,749 --> 00:16:19,209
specimen can be, for example,
nanoparticles or whatever

179
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:25,217
that are deposited on a copper grid
covered with a thin carbon film.

180
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:30,910
How does the copper grid looks like?
Well, it's this very thin tiny 3 mm

181
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:36,043
disc that you have here. So,
manipulating them you need

182
00:16:36,243 --> 00:16:38,992
a lot of care.

183
00:16:39,192 --> 00:16:43,489
So, in this module you have seen
the main constituents of the TM.

184
00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,387
One of them is the lens. In the
next module we will review all

185
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:53,292
the aberrations that are relevant to
electron lenses.
