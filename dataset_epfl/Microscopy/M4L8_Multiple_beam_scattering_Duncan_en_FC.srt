00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to CIME’s lecture on Transmission Electron Microscopy for Materials Science.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the last few lectures on the basics of electron diffraction, 
I have looked at the theoretical case

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of two beam electron diffraction. As we saw, in this case,

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
we have one plane (hkl) which is inclined relative to

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the incident electron beam, at the exact Bragg angle theta_B. 

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have strong scattering from that plane, giving a diffraction pattern

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
which has two strong spots: one for the direct beam, the

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
000, and another for the diffracted beam, hkl.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
However, if we look back at the video of electron diffraction

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I showed in my first lecture, you will see in that video that there is

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
another case of diffraction where we have many different

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
diffraction spots – so scattering from many different beams –

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
also showing a high degree of symmetry. This is a so-called zone axis

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
diffraction pattern, and this is the case that I'm going to look at in this lecture.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As an example, we can look at two experimental diffraction patterns taken from

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a single crystal of silicon. In this pattern,

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I once again show the case of 2-beam electron diffraction,

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
here with the plane with Miller indices (hkl) of (220)

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
at the exact Bragg condition. So, we have strong

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
scattering into this diffraction spot, such that we have strongly

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
excited the diffraction vector g_220.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In this case, I have instead aligned the crystal such that its

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
[001] axis – that is its z axis – is aligned

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
exactly parallel to the incident electron beam. This

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
gives a so-called [001] zone access diffraction pattern.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We will now look at this case a bit more closely. So if we look at this pattern,

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
we can see that we have many different diffracted beams; so-called

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
multiple beam scattering. The crystal has been aligned on what

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we call a low index lattice vector; effectively an important crystallographic direction.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For instance, if you have a cubic crystal, such as silicon, this could be

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
a direction such as [001], [110],

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
or [111]. This lattice vector will have these indices

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
[UVW], and we will call this the zone axis. So the

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
zone axis corresponds to the direction in the crystal which is aligned

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
parallel to the incident electron beam. In this case, we have

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
diffraction from planes in the crystal which are parallel to that incident

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
electron beam. So to the electron beam these planes look like they are end on,

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
with each plane giving a corresponding diffraction spot.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Multiple beams are excited at the same time. In this condition we obtain a diffraction

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
pattern which has lots of symmetry. So if we look at this pattern in particular, we can see

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that we have a mirror plane here, a mirror plane here, another mirror plane

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
here, and a fourth mirror plane here. Instead looking at rotational

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
symmetry, we can see that there is 90 degree rotational symmetry

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
through the diffracted beams. So, we have fourfold

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
rotational symmetry: a tetrad. And we can observe that this mirror and rotational

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
symmetry corresponds to the rotational symmetry for the [001]

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
direction in the crystal. In other words, we have a diffraction pattern which has

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the rotational and mirror symmetry of its corresponding lattice

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
vector in the real space crystal lattice. So why does such a

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
diffraction pattern form in this zone axis condition? To gain some

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
insight into the formation of this zone axis diffraction pattern, I'm going to

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
make a simple analogy, and say that in this zone axis condition our TEM optics

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and sample are similar to the condition for a diffraction grating in

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Fraunhofer far-field geometry. Here I have a representation

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
– an illustration – of this diffraction grating;

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and we can see that we have an incident plane wave, with a wavelength Lambda,

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
being scattered by a regular array of slits, with each slit

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
having the spacing d. When this incident plane wave is

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
scattered by the grating, each slit acts as the source of a spherical wavelet

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
spreading out. We can represent that wavelet a ray scattered at different

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
angles, which here are called phi. Now what we can see is that, at certain angles

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
phi, parallel rays have a path difference which will correspond

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to that for constructive interference. In other

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
words, this path difference here – which equals

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
d.sin(phi) – by corresponds to one, or multiples of,

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
a wavelength. In other words we have constructive interference when

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
d.sin(phi) equals n x lambda, where lambda is

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the wavelength and n is an integer. If we now put a screen

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
sufficiently far from this diffraction grating, then we will be in

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
a far-field geometry where parallel rays come to a point, and

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
we will obtain a diffraction pattern. Where first of all we'll have a spot in the

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
center corresponding to beams that are scattered straight on:

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the direct beam. But then, for sin(phi) =

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
lambda/d, we will obtain another diffraction spot; here. So with an angle of

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
scattering given by sin(phi) = lambda/d.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Then we'll have another spot here, for 2.lambda/d,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
3.lambda/d, and so on; and their inverses the other

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
side. So you can see that this grating has given a diffraction

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
pattern of regularly spaced spots. As an exercise, you can

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
prove to yourself that, in the small angle approximation for this far-field geometry,

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the angle of scattering between the diffraction spots is exactly the

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
same as you would obtain for Bragg diffraction in an electron diffraction pattern.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We should also note that this Fraunhofer far-field case is equivalent to the

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
back focal plane of the objective lens in TEM because, in both cases,

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
parallel rays come to a point. We shall now use this diffraction grating

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
approximation to help construct a zone axis diffraction pattern. For this

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
example, I'm going to take a very simple case of a primitive tetragonal

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
unit cell, such that there are no systematic absences in the reciprocal of

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
lattice.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And, we're going to take an alignment of this tetragonal unit cell of the electron beam

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
parallel to the lattice vector [001]. In other words,

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
parallel to the z axis of the unit cell. So here

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I show an illustration of a 2 x 2 block of unit cells

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
in this orientation. Being tetragonal, we have a equals b.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So, we just have a simple square form. And now we're going

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to look at the planes which are parallel to the incident electron beam – in other

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
words the electron beam will view them as end on planes – and take each plane in

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
turn, and say "that is like a diffraction grating" and we'll see which

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
diffraction spot it will make in our diffraction pattern.

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So if we start off even without any object, of course we will always

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
have a central direct beam in the diffraction pattern;

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the so-called 000. Now we consider diffraction from planes.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
First of all I take this plane here. We can see that this plane is parallel to the y axis

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and intersects the x axis at one unit cell parameter. So this is

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
clearly the (100) plane. Like a diffraction grating, it will make a

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
diffraction spot in our diffraction pattern perpendicular to that

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
plane; and with a spacing which will be the reciprocal

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of the plane spacing d. So we get a

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
diffraction spot looking like this. Now we move on;

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
consider another plane. We can see that this plane is instead parallel to the x axis,

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and intersects the y axis at one unit cell spacing. So this is clearly the

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
(010) plane. This plane has exactly the

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
same spacing as the (100), but it's perpendicular to it. So it will give a

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
diffraction spot over here, with the same spacing as the (100), but at an angle

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
of 90 degrees. Now we move on, and consider this plane. We can see that this plane

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
intersects the x and y axes at 1 unit cell spacing. So this is going to be

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the (110) plane. Its spacing is 1/SQRT(2)

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of the spacing of the (100) plane, or the (010) plane.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So it's going to give a reciprocal lattice spacing which is SQRT(2) x larger than this spacing here.

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Also it's at this angle here;

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
it's going to give a spot, then, in this direction. So it's going to give a spot

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
over here: the spot for (110) plane. Moving on, I

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
consider this plane. We can see that this plane is parallel to the (100), but

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it intersects the x axis at half a unit cell spacing. So it's going to

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
be the (200) plane. Being parallel to the (100), it's going to

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
give a spot in this direction. But, having half the plane spacing of the (100),

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the scattering angle will be two times that of the (100), so it gives us here

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
– the (200). Moving on, I put on this plane here.

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It intersects at half a on the x and y axes, so is clearly the (220) plane.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Being the 2 2 0, it's going to give a spot parallel to the (110).

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But having half the plane spacing, is going to have double the scattering angle,

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
so it will give a spot over here. And we can keep on going. Here I put on the

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
(300) plane, which of course is parallel to the (100),

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
so will give a spot in the same direction, but with three times the scattering angle,

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
so giving a spot here. And we can keep on going, and as we

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
do this, we build up this diffraction pattern which, by symmetry,

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
includes inverse planes such as the (–100) and

138
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
(0–10). And we can notice a number of things about this. One thing: we can see

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that it looks like a section through our reciprocal lattice, which

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
indeed it is. Secondly, we have associated each diffraction spot

141
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
with the Miller indices (hkl) of the plane that's created it.

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is called "indexing the diffraction pattern". The third thing I will

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
point out is that here we have our electron beam parallel to [001];

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
so [001] is our so-called "zone axis". And we can note that all

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
these planes – being parallel to the zone axis – obey

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the Weiss zone law:

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
hU + kV + lW = 0

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
- the rule which applies for plane (hkl) being parallel to a lattice

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
vector [UVW]. Now we have looked at the formation of the zone axis

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
diffraction pattern by the simple analogy of the crystal as a diffraction grating,

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
we should instead look at the diffraction pattern formation by the Ewald

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
sphere/reciprocal lattice representation. So that's what I have done here.

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Here we have the Ewald sphere, and the vector for the incident

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
beam k_I. And, when we have this geometry, what

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we see is that one layer of this reciprocal

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
lattice is now tangential to the Ewald sphere.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And what's more is that, when we have this geometry, we see

158
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that the Ewald sphere actually does not intersect any of the reciprocal lattice

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
nodes in this layer directly around the 000 beam.

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In other words, the Bragg condition is not met. Now this is the exaggerated

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Ewald sphere representation that I showed before. We can make it a realistic

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
representation; as follows. So here, now the

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
curvature of the Ewald sphere corresponds to what we would see for a 200 kV

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
beam, and a reciprocal lattice for body centred cubic iron. But

165
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
even in this case we can see that, even with this very flat Ewald sphere,

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
the surface of that sphere does not intersect most of these reciprocal

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
lattice nodes. In other words, the Bragg condition of scattering

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
for these reciprocal lattice nodes is not met. And if the Bragg condition is

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
not met, theoretically there should be no scattering from these planes,

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and we should not have all these diffracted beams that we in fact see. Because

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
experimentally, we know we have strong scattering from many planes in this zone

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
axis condition. So, we have some problem in our

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
representation using the Ewald sphere and reciprocal lattice, for the

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
zone axis condition. To summarize,

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
when the electron beam is parallel to some important crystallographic direction,

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or so-called low index zone axis [UVW], we obtain a zone axis

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
diffraction pattern which has multiple scattering in many different beams.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This pattern can display high symmetry, with mirror and rotational symmetries

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which correspond to that of the real crystal lattice.

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Further, in this condition, we had diffraction from planes

181
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
which are parallel to the incident beam, and so parallel to the zone axis

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
[UVW}. And because of this, the Weiss zone law is met. So

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
all of the planes directly around the direct beam obey the Weiss zone law,

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
where for the plane (hkl): hU + kV + lW = 0

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
On the other hand, when we represent this condition using our

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Ewald sphere/reciprocal lattice representation, we find that the Bragg

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
scattering condition is not met.

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Clearly there is a problem in our representation. The problem in our representation is

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because, while the recipient lattice nodes so far have been represented as

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
infinitely small points, in fact they have a size and a shape – and the size and

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
shape leads to a relaxation of the bragg scattering condition, and

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,500
we obtain multiple beam scattering in our schematic diagram.

193
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,000
And this is what we will look at in the next lecture.
