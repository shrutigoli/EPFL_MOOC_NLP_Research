00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,430
Welcome to CIME's lectures on transmission
electron microscopy for materials science.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,740
In the last lecture,
we saw how the size and

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,880
shape of the sample,
in particular the fact that is very thin

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,560
leads to the reciprocal lattice
nodes having an elongated form.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,200
The so called reciprocal lattice rod or
rail rod form.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,430
And it is this elongation that gives the
relaxation of the Bragg condition, which

7
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,030
in turn allows us to start understanding
why in a zone access condition,

8
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,210
we have such strong scattering from many
different crystal planes at the same time.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,270
In this lecture,
we're going to consider in more detail

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,880
the intensity along one of
these reciprocal lattice rods.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,640
But I'm looking not at
the zone access condition,

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,950
but instead at the two beam
electron diffraction condition.

13
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:58,120
And further, considering what happens
to the intensity in a diffracted beam

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,170
when we deviate slightly from this
perfect Bragg scattering condition.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,535
Here, we have a schematic diagram of our
sample with strong scattering from this

16
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:14,460
Bragg plane into this diffracted beam kD,
and the sample having a thickness of t.

17
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:19,729
To calculate the intensity
along a railroad,

18
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:24,720
we need to determine the free
transform of this sample thickness.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,330
Effectively, the sample is like a top
hat function along this Zed access.

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,860
We have a function which is either
at maximum within the sample,

21
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,460
or along the rest of Zed
has a value of zero.

22
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:49,840
We need to calculate the Fourier
transform of this function.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,980
Once we have identified that,
by taking its modulus squared,

24
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:57,660
we can obtain the intensity
distribution along this axis.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,692
This, we will plot in reciprocal
space along the axis of the rail rod.

26
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:09,838
And for reasons that will become clear,
we will call the distance along

27
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:15,180
this rail rod, s, with a center of
the railroad corresponding to s = 0.

28
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:22,667
The amplitude and intensity distributions
of that top hat function are equivalent

29
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:27,090
to those from the scattering of plane
wave by a single slit with width W.

30
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:32,944
Here, we look at such a plane
wave with a wavelength

31
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,670
of lambda incident on the slit
which has this width W.

32
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,639
When the wave scatters from the slit,

33
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:46,476
we will obtain some
interference pattern that

34
00:02:46,476 --> 00:02:51,685
the waves spreading out
with a central maximum and

35
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:57,017
then other narrow maxima
Looking at the far field,

36
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:02,104
the aptitude we're scattering for
a scattering

37
00:03:02,104 --> 00:03:07,188
angle of phi is given by
the formula A = A0 sine of

38
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:12,560
pi W phi over lambda divided
by pi W phi over lambda.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,295
In other words, we have a sync function
of sine x over x multiplied by A0,

40
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:24,600
where A0 is the maximum amplitude observed
at scattering angle phi equal to 0.

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,120
To translate this formula to the TEM case,
we know that W,

42
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,590
the width of our slit,
is equivalent to the sample thickness t.

43
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,170
And further, it can be easily showing
that in reciprocal space, phi over lambda

44
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,200
equals s, the distance along
our reciprocal lattice rod.

45
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,690
Taking these together,

46
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:57,250
when you see that A = A0
sine of pi ts over pi ds.

47
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,880
Plotting out this aptitude function along
the length of our reciprocal lattice rod,

48
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,150
s, we obtain an aptitude
distribution that looks like this.

49
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,350
With these modulations which are strong
in the center, where s = 0 and

50
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,680
the k out either side.

51
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,289
Further, considering s away from 0,

52
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:23,500
it is clear that when pi ts = n pi.

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,554
Where n is an integer that A = 0,

54
00:04:28,554 --> 00:04:35,061
therefore, we see that s = n divided by t.

55
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:40,433
We have zeros along this modulation.

56
00:04:40,433 --> 00:04:43,973
The first at 1 divided by thickness.

57
00:04:43,973 --> 00:04:47,936
The second at 2 divided by thickness t and
so on.

58
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:52,646
Additionally, we see that
these sine type modulations

59
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:55,357
sit within a 1 over s envelope.

60
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,010
This is the amplitude function, but
in diffraction, we measure intensity.

61
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,200
To calculate the intensity distribution,

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,720
we simply need to take
the square of this function

63
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,620
corresponding to this Fourier transform
multiplied by its complex conjugate.

64
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,879
Looking at this intensity function,
we now have an intensity proportioned to

65
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,130
sine-squared of pi t s divided by pi
ts squared, or sine squared pi ts.

66
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,004
Along the railroad axis, We, again,

67
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:32,856
have a central maximum at s = 0.

68
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:40,660
And again, has 0 in the modulation at
s = 1 over t, 2 over t, and so on.

69
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,350
However, these time, these modulations
sit within our 1 over s squared envelope.

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,650
Here, we make that intensity expression
yet more specific to the TM case,

71
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,560
by considering that we have an incident
intensity on the sample, include a 1.

72
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,912
And now, calculating directly
the intensity in a diffracted beam, Ig.

73
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:10,150
Where Ig is, again, given by the sine
square root of pi ts on the top.

74
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:16,340
However, on the bottom, we have a new term
sIG is known as the extinction distance.

75
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,500
And while not proved here
is given by the expression

76
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,180
sIG = pi times the volume
of the unit cell times

77
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,220
cosine theta b,
where theta b is the Bragg angle,

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,140
divided by lambda,
the wavelength, times Fg,

79
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:42,870
where Fg is the structure factor for
that particular reflection.

80
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,797
Further, it can be straightforwardly
shown that the intensity at

81
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:51,807
the tip of the central maximum, at s = 0,

82
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:56,428
is given by the expression Ig = 0
= pi t divided by phi g squared.

83
00:06:56,428 --> 00:07:02,108
One thing that is very important
to mention at this point is that

84
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:09,840
this expressions only apply in the case
of what we call kinematical scattering.

85
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,290
Kinematical scattering means
single elastic scattering.

86
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,040
In other words, the beam will
be diffracted at most one time

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,880
on its transmission or
trajectory through the sample.

88
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,280
While such kinematical scattering is
not an accurate assumption during real

89
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,100
electron diffraction where the probability
of scattering is very high.

90
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,710
Nevertheless, this expression and this
intensity distribution with this 1 over s

91
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:41,120
squared envelope will still give useful
insights in the remaining slides, where

92
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,390
we will interact this rail rod intensity
distribution where the Ewald sphere.

93
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,590
On this slide,
we're gong to make this interaction

94
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,770
looking at the perfect
Bragg scattering condition.

95
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,600
So we imagine we have a sample
of thickness t, with a plane

96
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,950
scattering at a perfect Bragg angle t to
b, giving a diffracted beam as follows.

97
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,860
Given that we're at the perfect Bragg
condition, the center of the reciprocal

98
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,790
lattice node is intersected
exactly by the Ewald sphere.

99
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,720
Thus, we will have a diffraction vector,
g, coming here

100
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,880
which is of course perpendicular
to our Bragg scattering plane.

101
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,450
We know that this reciprocal
lattice node is at the center

102
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,660
of some reciprocal lattice rod.

103
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,640
And now, we're going to plot
the intensity distribution

104
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,790
along this reciprocal lattice rod.

105
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:38,130
As we saw before, it will have some
modulations with a central intense peak.

106
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:44,787
Given that the eval sphere intersects
in the center of this peak,

107
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:50,874
the diffracted beam will have a strong
intensity given by that maximum.

108
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:56,135
Thus, if we took a diffraction pattern,
we will have one bright spot for the 000,

109
00:08:56,135 --> 00:09:00,830
the direct beam, and another very bright
spot for the diffracted beam hkl.

110
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,065
On the next slide,

111
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:06,931
we will look at what happens to the
intensity in this diffracted beam when we

112
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:12,360
now tilt this diffracting plane slightly
away from that perfect Bragg condition.

113
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,610
On this slide, if that diffracting plane
was previously at this angle, there's now

114
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:26,046
been tilted slightly by an angle down to
theta towards the incident electron beam.

115
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,078
Since the reciprocal lattice vector
is perpendicular to this plane,

116
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:38,020
it also is rotated by an angle,
delta theta, compared to previously.

117
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,253
The reciprocal lattice rod is going to be
centered on this vector, g, as follows.

118
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:47,511
With the Ewald sphere
intersecting this real rod here,

119
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:50,960
the diffraction vector
kD drops as follows.

120
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,610
Sketching in the intensity modulations
along the reciprocal lattice rod,

121
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,330
we say that unlike the perfect
Bragg condition, where

122
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,180
the intensity in the diffraction beam was
given by the maximum in this central peak.

123
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,770
The intensity in that diffracted beam
is now given by this locus here.

124
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,850
Thus, clearly,
if we now sketch a refraction pattern,

125
00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:16,712
While the direct beam will be strong,

126
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:22,840
the intensity in that refracted beam
will be much smaller than before.

127
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,480
Thus, this deviation away from
the perfect Bragg condition

128
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,770
has led to a dramatic weakening of
intensity in the diffracted beam.

129
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:38,307
In addition, the vectorial expression we
had before for perfect Bragg diffraction,

130
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:44,220
where kD = kI,
the incident wave vector, + g.

131
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,170
The diffraction vector no longer applies.

132
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,471
To solve this, we now introduce

133
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:57,580
another vector which we'll call sg.

134
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,780
By closing the loop,
we obtained kD = kI + g + sg.

135
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,700
Where essentially,

136
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,730
sg describes the deviation from
the perfect Bragg condition.

137
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,812
Cleaning these two diagrams up, here,
we have the schematic illustration for

138
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,478
scattering at the perfect Bragg condition,

139
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:23,142
where the Ewald sphere intersects
the center of the rail rod.

140
00:11:23,142 --> 00:11:26,623
Thus, giving an intensity
in the diffracted beam,

141
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:30,974
which corresponds to the maximum
in this sync squared function as

142
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:35,580
demonstrated by this real experimental
diffraction pattern here.

143
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,440
Now turning away from that perfect Bragg
condition by a small amount delta theta,

144
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,110
the Ewald sphere wave from
the center of that peak,

145
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:50,584
resulting in a significant decrease in
the intensity of that defected beam.

146
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:56,300
Given the 1 over s squared envelope for
this intensity distribution,

147
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,862
for example, with a typical
thickness of 50 of 100 nanometers,

148
00:11:59,862 --> 00:12:04,070
delta theta just needs to be
a fraction of a degree for

149
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:09,010
us to observe a significant reduction in
the intensity of this diffracted beam.

150
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,104
Finally, to describe this deviation
away from the perfect Bragg condition,

151
00:12:15,104 --> 00:12:17,224
we introduce this new vector sg.

152
00:12:17,224 --> 00:12:23,820
Where in this case, I define sg as being
parallel to the incident wave vector ki.

153
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,370
Further, sg is known under two
expressions, either the excitation or

154
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,470
deviation vector.

155
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,110
Having defined sg,
I now introduce a scalar quantity s.

156
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,390
So s equals the scalar quantity of sg.

157
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,220
This s is, again,
known under two different expressions.

158
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,550
One of them being the excitation error.

159
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,620
In other words, how much we are in error
of exciting a perfect Bragg condition or

160
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,040
alternatively, as the deviation parameter.

161
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,200
In other words, how far we are in
deviation of the perfect Bragg condition?

162
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,360
However, it should be known that while
some people refer to s has being

163
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,060
the deviation parameter.

164
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,846
In other works,
the deviation parameter can refer to

165
00:13:10,846 --> 00:13:16,580
a quantity of s times phi g,
the extinction distance.

166
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,950
Being in reciprocal space, this excitation
error, s, is typically measured or

167
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,100
specified in inverse nanometers.

168
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,563
Obviously, for
the perfect Bragg condition, s = 0.

169
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:34,060
Away from the Bragg condition,
if s is within the Ewald sphere,

170
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,190
that is corresponding to a tilt of
the diffracting plane this way, and

171
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,180
then s is greater than 0.

172
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,160
And if s is outside the Ewald sphere,
then it's negative.

173
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,300
This time, instead corresponding to
a tilt of the diffracting plane,

174
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,700
this way relative to
the perfect Bragg condition.

175
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:57,740
Looking a bit more at the s
equals negative scenario, here,

176
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,550
I have a rather symmetrical illustration
where this would be the g vector for

177
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,910
the perfect Bragg condition.

178
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:09,020
Given that the diffracting plane has
been tilted away from the perfect Bragg

179
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:14,140
condition by an angle delta theta,
which gives an equivalent

180
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:19,863
total angle of this reciprocal
lattice vector ghkl.

181
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:25,352
It is clear from this that the small
angle of approximation, delta theta

182
00:14:25,352 --> 00:14:29,580
= s divided by the modulus of ghkl.

183
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:39,980
Given that the modulus of ghkl simply
= 1 over the plane spacing dhkl.

184
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:47,250
We can see that the excitation error, s,
is given by delta theta divided by dhkl.

185
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,080
We know that in this s = negative case,

186
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,670
the diffracting plane was tilted this way
away from the perfect Bragg condition.

187
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,880
Therefore, for signs to correspond, in
this case, delta-theta must be negative.

188
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,003
Alternatively, tilting
the other way from the perfect

189
00:15:09,003 --> 00:15:13,780
Bragg condition,
would give a positive delta-theta.

190
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,337
To summarize, in this lecture, we have
seen that the intensity distribution

191
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:24,906
along a reciprocal lattice rod modulates
within a 1 over s squared envelope.

192
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:30,588
The s is the excitation error or deviation
parameter when we're at the exact

193
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:36,990
Bragg condition, s = 0, and
we will have an intense diffracted beam.

194
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,982
However, when s is away from a 0,

195
00:15:38,982 --> 00:15:43,560
the intensity in that diffracted
beam can decrease dramatically.

196
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,310
Further, we define that s is greater
than 0, when the vector sg lies

197
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,560
within the Ewald sphere, and it's less
than 0, when it's outside the eval sphere.

198
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,170
While all this may seem a bit abstract,
knowledge of the excitation error

199
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,000
is critical to certain kinds of
diffraction contrast imaging.

200
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,410
For instance, for imaging dislocations
in weak beam or strong beam conditions.

201
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,550
Finally, all this was studied in
what's called the kinematical regime,

202
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,730
meaning single electron scattering.

203
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,160
In reality, in a two beam condition,
we typically have what is called dynamical

204
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,480
scattering, this is multiple
elastic scattering.

205
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,260
In the dynamical case,

206
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,795
the more duration along the reciprocal
lattice rod will be the more different.

207
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:40,130
Indeed, you may not even have a maximum
intensity at s = 0, but at s away from 0.

208
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,390
However, the general principle that
the intensity in the diffracted beam

209
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,920
is directly related to the intersection

210
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,980
of the Ewald sphere with this intensity
distribution remains the same.

211
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,928
Thus, this kinematical
condition provides a useful

212
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:59,264
introduction to a concept needed for
understanding dynamical diffraction.
