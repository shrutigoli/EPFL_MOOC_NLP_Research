00:00:00,726 --> 00:00:03,476
I'm Cécile Hébert, professor
in physics at the EPFL

2
00:00:03,607 --> 00:00:06,607
and leading the center
for Elec-microscopy here.

3
00:00:06,744 --> 00:00:10,381
And I'm Duncan Alexander,
a scientific professional at EPFL

4
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:13,842
specialized in transmission
electron-microscopy

5
00:00:14,008 --> 00:00:17,908
and welcome to CIME's course on
transmission electron microscopy

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,510
for materials sciences.

7
00:00:20,624 --> 00:00:24,111
Since it's invention, transmission
electron microscopy has become

8
00:00:24,231 --> 00:00:27,781
a key tool in analysis of
many types of materials.

9
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,523
It has the ability to generate
an image with nano-metric or even

10
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:35,272
atomic resolution and can give,
for example information on

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:39,319
the crystallinity of materials,
but also on the defect structure

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,595
the characteristics of interfaces
and grain boundaries, etc.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,945
Nowadays, state of the art
transmissionary microscopy

14
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:50,708
is both a mainstay of much
advanced materials and technological

15
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:55,238
research, but also for industries,
such as semi-conductor fabrication

16
00:00:55,345 --> 00:00:57,333
or catalyst production.

17
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:02,801
When using this microscopy, often
called TEM, or Tem for short

18
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:06,639
The electron beam of the microscope
has strong interactions

19
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,813
with the sample of interest.

20
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,781
We use these different interactions
to characterize and to understand

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,900
many different properties
of this sample.

22
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,787
To take such useful data

23
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:21,441
or to interpret TEM results,
it is important to have

24
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:24,854
a thorough understanding
of the basics of TEM.

25
00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:28,675
Starting from the microscope
and it's optics through

26
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,995
electron matter interactions,
and on to how to use these to record

27
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,756
imaging data.

28
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:38,111
Teaching these basic is
the aim of this course.

29
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:43,005
Starting with an introduction to the TEM,
on through electron diffraction and

30
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:47,085
diffraction contrast imaging,
and finally to phase contrast imaging

31
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,174
used for high resolution TEM.

32
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:54,882
This course is clearly designed for
people working with solid specimen

33
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:57,042
I mean, non-biological specimen

34
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,395
where the crystallinity
dominates the contrast.

35
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:04,783
So, if you are to take a practical
training on a TEM, this course

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,493
provides a first theoretical
grounding for your training.

37
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:12,970
However, it will also be useful
to understand any TEM image

38
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:16,681
you might encounter, or it can
provide the basic building blocks

39
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:20,468
you need before studying or applying
one of the many more advanced

40
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,498
TEM based techniques.

41
00:02:22,565 --> 00:02:26,352
And as TEM is an imaging technique,
and operating the instrument

42
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:30,362
a dynamic process, in our course
we embedded many examples

43
00:02:30,465 --> 00:02:34,190
filmed on real TEM, making
it more visual than a book.

44
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:36,707
We hope you enjoy it.

45
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:40,675
In the coming weeks you will see
both of us for different modules

46
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:41,792
in the course.

47
00:02:41,918 --> 00:02:46,943
Now for the introduction, Cécile
will begin, so over to you Cécile.

48
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:51,024
Thank you Duncan!
