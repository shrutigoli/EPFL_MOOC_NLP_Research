00:00:05,084 --> 00:00:07,029
Welcome to CIME's lecture

2
00:00:07,229 --> 00:00:10,229
on Transmission Electron Microscopy
for material science.

3
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,248
In this video
I will take you to the microscope

4
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:17,450
and show you how it can record
images and diffraction patterns.

5
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,352
First of all,
I need to introduce you the

6
00:00:20,552 --> 00:00:22,961
control panel of the microscope.

7
00:00:23,705 --> 00:00:27,745
This is, this panel,
which I have at my disposal,

8
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:32,950
and where I can change,
for example, the magnification

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,378
of the image or
the diffraction pattern,

10
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:40,697
I can change the intensity,
as we saw on a previous video,

11
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:46,678
I can also move the specimen
to select different areas,

12
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:52,757
or I can change the position of
the illumination on the specimen.

13
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:57,549
I have also a very important knob,
which is called "Diffraction",

14
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:02,404
and this one will help me to switch
between "Image Mode",

15
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,120
while image the first
intermediate image,

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,324
and "Diffraction mode" will image
the back focal plane

17
00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:09,681
of the objective lens.

18
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:17,405
Then, we have the screen capture
of the software

19
00:01:17,605 --> 00:01:22,547
that controls the microscope
and gives us as an image filmed

20
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:26,241
of either the specimen
or the diffraction pattern.

21
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:33,209
This is, this big panel.
In the center you have the image

22
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,668
where you'll see the image displayed by
the intermediate and projective lens

23
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:41,970
in that case, this is an image
of a specimen.

24
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:46,883
The ring that you see corresponds
to the illumination on the specimen.

25
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:51,575
At that position, you see
the magnification that is chosen,

26
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:58,434
and on the left panel, I have
the possibility to choose aperture,

27
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:03,538
either the selected area aperture
or the objective aperture.

28
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:09,481
To help you understand
how it's working on the micoscope,

29
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:14,084
you will also have a sketch of the
Transmission Microscope.

30
00:02:15,407 --> 00:02:19,829
This is, this small drawing,
which we had before

31
00:02:20,393 --> 00:02:26,070
with the specimen, illuminated
by a parallel beam of electrons,

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,986
and we imagine that the specimen
is crystalline,

33
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:33,273
so we have undiffracted electrons

34
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:37,065
and some electrons which are
diffracted by the specimen.

35
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:42,096
That is the objective lens, in the
bifocal plane of the objective lens

36
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,785
we have the diffraction pattern,
and, later on,

37
00:02:45,985 --> 00:02:48,589
we have
the first intermediate image.

38
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,670
Those black drawing are the aperture,

39
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,779
this is the objective aperture

40
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:57,998
and this is the selected area aperture.

41
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:03,514
And with the orange arrow
I will symbolize which plane

42
00:03:03,714 --> 00:03:05,370
I'm currently imaging.

43
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:10,714
When I move to the microscope
I see it in that state,

44
00:03:10,914 --> 00:03:16,690
I have the image,  I'm imaging
the first intermediate image

45
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,195
and I have no aperture.

46
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:23,395
First I adjust the focus,
with the focus knob,

47
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,067
which changes the current in the
objective lens,

48
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,102
to obtain the minimum contrast.

49
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:32,157
Then, I will insert
the selected area aperture,

50
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,395
which comes in
the first intermediate image

51
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,058
given by the objective lens.

52
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:41,283
This aperture cuts the image
and is now visible.

53
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:45,173
Now, on the panel, I will
hit the diffraction knob,

54
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,357
with this I changed the current

55
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:51,983
in the intermediate and projective lens,
and have a diffraction pattern.

56
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:57,082
On this diffraction pattern you see
several diffraction spots

57
00:03:57,282 --> 00:04:00,826
and the pattern is not very regular,

58
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:03,934
it looks like
we are selecting several grains

59
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,738
with different orientations.

60
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:10,138
In the next step, I will insert
the objective aperture,

61
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,973
which will come
in the diffraction pattern,

62
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:16,363
and select only the central beam.

63
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:20,312
I can choose the size
of the aperture

64
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,857
and, eventually,
center it around the beam.

65
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,817
Now you see that we have only
direct beam

66
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,528
and none of the diffracted one.

67
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:35,991
Then, back to the panel,
I hit, again, the diffraction knob,

68
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:38,523
I am back to "Image Mode",

69
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:42,624
I see again
the first intermediate image

70
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,065
but this time
with a stronger contrast

71
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:49,102
and still with
the selected area aperture inserted.

72
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:55,191
I will take it out, so we have
the whole image of the specimen.

73
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,124
What you see now
is an image of the specimen

74
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,188
but with much higher contrast
than we had before.

75
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:08,508
The place where we have a hole
is bright,

76
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,753
that's why the image is called
"Bright Field".

77
00:05:12,714 --> 00:05:15,924
You recognize several dark parts
on the specimen,

78
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,366
the contrast has two origins:

79
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:23,522
First of all, parts of the specimen,
which are thicker,

80
00:05:23,722 --> 00:05:28,118
specially on
the bottom left part of the image,

81
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:33,631
will appear much darker because
they are scattering more electrons,

82
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:37,150
so more electrons are cut
by the objective aperture,

83
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,882
which is still inserted.

84
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:43,849
But also on the rim of the specimen,
close to the hole,

85
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:48,556
you see a lot of bright
and dark contrast,

86
00:05:48,756 --> 00:05:51,309
these are diffraction contrasts.

87
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:55,228
If you look carefully,
some grain appear dark

88
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:57,623
while other appear much brighter,

89
00:05:57,823 --> 00:06:00,736
it depends on the orientation
of this particular grain,

90
00:06:01,468 --> 00:06:04,701
some will diffract strongly
and be dark,

91
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:08,336
and some will not be in
good diffraction condition

92
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,232
and they will appear brighter.

93
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:14,796
Back to the control panel,
I can change the magnification

94
00:06:17,013 --> 00:06:21,520
and also adjust the brightness,
so that I keep the illumination

95
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,966
on the area which I see
on the screen.

96
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,524
So I zoom in my specimen
and I can also move it.

97
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:39,357
I'm still keeping
this interesting contrast

98
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:41,714
due to the objective aperture.

99
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,851
Now you see
in the center of the screen,

100
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:50,777
there is a grain which appear
very dark.,

101
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:55,461
it might be interesting
to have a diffraction pattern

102
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:58,543
originating only for this,
from this grain.

103
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:04,418
What I will do is, I will insert
a smaller selected area aperture,

104
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:11,871
which will cut the image
and select only part of the image

105
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:13,565
that I'm interested in.

106
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,705
Now we'll go back to "Diffraction"

107
00:07:23,502 --> 00:07:28,714
I see not much, because the contrast
aperture, or objective aperture,

108
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:31,722
is still inserted,
so I have to remove it

109
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,696
to see the diffraction pattern,

110
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:37,858
and know you see
the clear diffraction pattern

111
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:43,425
of, nearlly,
a single Crystalline grain

112
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,484
close to zone-axis orientation.

113
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,307
And now inserting, again,
an objective aperture,

114
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:57,833
but this time I will not
center it around the central beam,

115
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:01,640
but I will choose one of these
bright diffraction spot

116
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,311
that I had in my diffraction pattern.

117
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:11,463
If I hit back "Diffraction",
I'm back to image mode,

118
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:14,905
imaging the first intermediate image,

119
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:19,282
I need to remove
the selected area aperture

120
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:24,990
and what you see now
is the same specimen

121
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,951
with a different contrast,
the hole is dark

122
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:36,295
because in the hole I have no
diffraction or diffusion of electrons

123
00:08:36,495 --> 00:08:39,382
so they are all cut by the aperture.

124
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,098
The specimen itself
has brighter parts

125
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:50,463
And the very bright part are the one
which diffract strongly

126
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:54,603
in the direction which I have
selected with the objective aperture.

127
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,731
This is called a "dark field" image.

128
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,871
Again, I can play around, change
magnification, adjust intensity,

129
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:10,124
to zoom in and out of my specimen,

130
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:15,862
but still keep the same dark field contrast.

131
00:09:18,848 --> 00:09:22,342
I might want to have a closer look
at my specimen

132
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,440
and go to higher resolution.

133
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,646
For this, I insert, again,
the selected area aperture,

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,744
adjust it properly

135
00:09:35,134 --> 00:09:40,460
to select the same small area
of my specimen as before.

136
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,560
I switch back to "Diffraction"

137
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:54,257
and I will select
a much larger objective aperture,

138
00:09:54,457 --> 00:09:59,262
which will take
several diffraction spot,

139
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:03,810
and I center it around
the center beam.

140
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,946
Back to "Image",
by hitting the diffraction knob

141
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,833
and removing the selected
area aperture,

142
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,301
We have, again,
a bright field image

143
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:29,685
with less contrast then
in the first one,

144
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:33,586
it's clear,
we have a larger objective aperture,

145
00:10:33,786 --> 00:10:37,575
so we have selected, also,
some diffracted beam.

146
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:41,213
And now
I'm increasing magnification

147
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:45,047
and adjusting the intensity
to keep it on the specimen.

148
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,812
You see the magnification on
the bottom of the panel.

149
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:01,727
Once I've reached
a very high magnification

150
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:05,167
in that time,
more than one million times,

151
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,977
I start to see on my screen
what is called "lattice fringes".

152
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:17,237
Actually, with the resolution
of the video capture of the screen

153
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:20,712
you can not really recognize them
on this video.

154
00:11:21,424 --> 00:11:25,004
So, we will switch back
to the presentation

155
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:29,266
and I will show you the
capture images that have been taken

156
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,388
on the CCD camera.

157
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:36,227
To have you better understand
what I mean with "high resolution",

158
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:40,800
I now have inserted this image,

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,154
which was acquired on
a good CCD camera on the microscope,

160
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:51,497
you see clearly the lattice fringes
and you will understand

161
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:53,435
how they are formed in the module

162
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:56,129
about high resolution
and face contrast.

163
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:00,403
Now we are finished
with the introduction,

164
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,161
you've had the building parts
of the TEM,

165
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,576
as well
as it's main operating modes.

166
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,227
In the following,
we will start considering

167
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,040
electron scattering by the sample
in more depth,

168
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,071
and for this
I will pass over to Duncan.

169
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:15,742
Thank you,  (INAUDIBLE)

170
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,945
When imaging any crystalline sample
in TEM

171
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:23,818
elastic scattering from
the crystal lattice, that is diffraction,

172
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:26,436
will dominate the image contrast.

173
00:12:26,636 --> 00:12:31,606
Therefore, understanding
electron diffraction is vital to TEM analysis.

174
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,901
Here, starting from an assumed
understanding

175
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,091
of the basics of crystallography
and diffraction,

176
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,652
in the coming lectures
we will consider both

177
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:44,833
the theory of electron diffraction
and its influence in TEM image contrast.
