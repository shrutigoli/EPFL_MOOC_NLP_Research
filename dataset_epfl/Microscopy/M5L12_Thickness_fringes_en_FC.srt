00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome CIME's lectures on Transmission Electron Microscopy for Material Science

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
in the last lecture I introduced a dynamical scattering. That is the

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
multiple elastic scattering that can occur as a beam propagates across the thickness

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of a 10 sample. I further showed how this effect

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
leads to a strong interaction between the direct beam and different diffracted beams.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That in the two case can be conceived of as the diffraction and re

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
diffraction of a propagating beam. In this lecture I'm going to

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
demonstrate one of the most evident effects of dynamical scattering in tame

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
imaging namely the formation of thickness fringes that is

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
patterns of bright and dark fringes that can be seen in images

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
of crystalline objects of varying thickness. We're going to consider the

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
formation of these thickness fringes in the case of a two beam scattering condition

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
as shown in the last lecture. The intensity in the defective beam IG

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
is given by this expression here in the tubing case where S is

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the excitation area that is the deviation from the perfect bragg condition

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
t is the sample thickness and size G is the

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
extinction distance given by this formula here where V0

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
is the volume of the NASL feet b is the bragg angle for scattering

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
lambda is the wavelength and F G is the structure factor for the

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
diffracted beam of interest further. Sometimes this part of

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
the expression the root of one over size G squared plus S squared is referred to as s

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
prime. The effective excitation error this expression refers to an

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
incident intensity of 1. So since we're in a TVM condition and all the

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
intensity must either be in the direct beam I0 or the diffracted beam

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
IG clearly the intensity in the direct beam is given by one minus

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
IG. Now if we consider the case where we're at the exact bragg

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
condition then the excitation error s equals zero for this

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ezekial zero case. You can easily see that IGY simplifies to sign

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
squared of PI T divided by size

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
G.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Further since the intensity in the direct beam equals one minus IGY

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
then that intensity is given by zero equals cause squared of PI

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
T divided by side G If we plot these two

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
intensities against Thickness. It is clear that both of them would relate sinusoidal  with

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
thickness as shown on these curves. Here where the black curve refers to

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the intensity in the direct beam and the blue curve. The intensity in the diffracted beam

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
further we can see that their modulations are an anti phase with each other.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Looking further the black curve is zero. The intensity in the direct beam we can see that

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
when the something has no thickness obviously this intensity is at a maximum because they can be no

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
scattering. However as sample thickness increases this intensity

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
decreases until when the sample thickness equal size G divided by 2.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The intensity goes to zero equally at that thickness.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The intensity in the diffracted beam is at a maximum

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
looking now. This blue curve for the intensity and the diffracted beam. This in

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
turn decreases to zero where the thickness equals one size

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
G and then to side G and so on. Thus when thicknes

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
T equals an integer number of extinction distances

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
then the intensity in the diffracted beam equal zero. For this exact

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
bragg condition situation and that's why g is called the extinction distance

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
because when T equals size G the intensity in this reflection G is

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
extinguished.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What would be nice is if we could measure these intensity more dilations experimentally

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
and in the next light hour show how that can be done with simple bright field and dark field imaging

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
to demonstrate these intensity modulations with thickness. I use a sample of

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
silicon with a basic zone axis of 0 0 1

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
here's the diffraction pattern on that zone access which can be indexed as follows

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
in the center.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The Direct being 0 0 0 surrounded by some 2 2 0

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
toper reflections is further out 4 0 0 type reflections

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the sample is a so-called cleaved wedge. That is it has been made by

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
cleaving the silicon on one or one type planes. Thus

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
if we look in cross-section the sample has a form like this. Here we have the

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
0 0 1 axis and this is solid material bound

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
by these one or one type planes. We look at the sample in projection with the

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
electron beam traversing it as follows. Clearly

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
as we move away from the vacuum edge of the sample the thickness and

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
projection increases

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
further if we go the distance from the edge X

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
then with this geometry the thickness is given by the simple

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
formula T equals 2 times x. I have

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
tilted the sample such that this two to zero reflection is that the exact bracket

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
condition giving this to diffraction pattern. Here where here is the direct beam.

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And this is G220.

74
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Tilting in this way is known as exciting the reflection

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have then inserted an object of aperture in order to select just the

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
direct beam and cut out the diffracted beam here. When we do

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
this effectively we specially map the intensity in this direct

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
beam making this bright  field image here.

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In this image here is the vacuum. And then here is the edge of the sample. So

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
X measures this way here. And as we've seen as

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
x increases so does the thickness of the sample and clearly

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
with increasing thickness we see a pattern of bright and dark fringes

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
as predicted by the formula for the intensity in the direct beam.

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have then displaced the object of aperture in order to select the diffracted beam.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So now we make a dark food image where we spatially map the intensity

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
IG in that diffracted beam

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
similarly to the bright field image. We again see a pattern of bright and dark fringes

88
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
but as predicted these fringes are an anti phase with those

89
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
in the bright field image. So this is the edge of the sample is X

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
and we can see that in the vacuum of course it's dark because there is no diffraction.

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then at a certain thickness when the bright field image is dark

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
dark the image is bright on this light. I take this Bright field and

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dark field image pair and pull out the intensity profiles with respect

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
to thickness. So looking at the bright image we can see that the intensity profile is bright

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
he descends to being dark and then it's bright and dark. And

96
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
so I've taken this profile and plotted it against

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
thicknesse T where I've simply said that T equals to X as

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
previously discussed with X being that distance from the edge of the sample

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have done the same thing for the dark field image taking its intensity profile

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and plotted these two profiles on this curve here where on

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the gray curve I showed the intensity and the direct beam and then the red

102
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
curve I show you the intensity in the diffracted being the intensity

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
of both these curves has been normalized to the intensity in the vacuum in the

104
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
bright field image. As predicted these curves are shown

105
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
sinusoidal modulations in anti-faith with each other. And if we look we can

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
see that the extinction distance size G is

107
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
approximately to 80 nanometers. We now take

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
this plot and compare it to the theoretical model from before.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's what we do on this slide where here I show you that experimental data put intensity in the direct

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
beam and the intensity in the diffract beam in gray and red

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
respectively compared to that simple model for the intensities

112
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
discussed earlier where in the black we have the intensity on in the direct beam and

113
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the blue curve the intensity and the diffracted being as predicted by the models

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
we have those sinusoidal modulations and anti-faith with each other. However in the

115
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
experimental data the maximum intensity DKs

116
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
with thickness further the minimum intensity increases a bit with thickness.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The reason this is not seen in the model is because this simple model did not account for

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
absorption effects.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
However as sample thickness increases as well as there being more dynamical scattering

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There is also absorption of the transmitted electrons and it is

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
because of this we see these changes in maximum and minimum intensity as thickness

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
increases. To demonstrate that here

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have changed the model to account for absorption in a rather simple

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
way. Specifically I have introduced imaginary parts of the

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
extinction coefficient both for the direct beam and the defective

126
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
beam where for the direct beam I have introduced an

127
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
imaginary part of extinction distance size zero prime equal to

128
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
ten times Size G and I have given the diffracted

129
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
beam an imaginary coefficient size G prime equal to

130
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
15 times size G. Once I have accounted for absorption

131
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in this rather simple way we can see that the model is strikingly

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
similar to the real experimental data.

133
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
These bright and dark fringes are typically known as thickness fringes though they're

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
also sometimes called extinction controls so far. We

135
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
have looked at the case of the exact bragg condition when s equals zero.

136
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And the diffracted beam is strongly excited. However we can ask what

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
happens when we change the value of s. In this case where we

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
make s greater than zero. Looking at the diffraction pattern from the

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
general region of interest we can see the intensity in that defective beam has

140
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
decreased compared to the Ezekial zero case

141
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because we are no longer at the exact bracket condition.

142
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If we consider this quantity here sometimes known as S prime or the effective

143
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
excitation era and clearly when S is greater than zero

144
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
this quantity is larger than when s equals zero. Thus

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the intensity in the defective beam will be extinguished and smaller thickness variations

146
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
than the equal zero case and that's exactly what we see here. And this dark food

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
image made from g with s greater than zero.

148
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Compared to the Ezekial zero case it is clear that the

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
separation between these thickness fringes has decreased

150
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
indeed. Whereas before we had extinction of the defective beam

151
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
for a thickness of about 80 nanometers. Now we have extinction

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
for a thickness of just 45 nanometers. In this case I have increased the

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
excitation area S such that S Square it is about the same order of magnitude

154
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
as one of her side G squared. But we can ask what happens if I

155
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
make S squared much larger than size G squared. That's what we discuss on the

156
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
next slide we can see that if we can deviate

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
sufficiently from the perfect bragg condition we can make S squared

158
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
much larger than one over side squared.

159
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
In this case. One of us IDs square plus Esquire it is simply

160
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
approximately equal to s squared. Thus the intensity in the defective

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
beam becomes proportional to sin squared of Pie

162
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:27,000
TS

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
this condition is known as a weak beam imaging condition

164
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
one that is often used for analysis of defects such as dislocations

165
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
on this slide. I have set up such a weak beam imaging condition. Indeed in this case

166
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
what's known as a GI 3-G condition on the diffraction

167
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
pattern here is my reflection G. However what I have done

168
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is instead of putting G at exact bragg condition, I have put

169
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
3G here at the exact bragg condition. If we consider the

170
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
ewald sphere construction with the reciprocal lattice is a direct beam

171
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
is 3G the ewald sphere in the sense that 3-G.

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Exactly. Now if our mark in the G and also the 2G

173
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we can see that reflection G has a large and positive excitation era

174
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
s here. Making this week being conditioned we're S squired

175
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
is much larger than one over side G squired.

176
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
experimental case s is approximately equal to

177
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
0.075 nanometers to the minus one. Now looking

178
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
at the dark food image made from that reflection G

179
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
we can see that compared to before. There is an extremely dense frequency

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
of bright and dark thickness fringes pulling out an intensely profile

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
with respect to the thickness we can see that here we have

182
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
very frequent dark fringes that spacing of about one every

183
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
13 nanometers where that distance corresponds

184
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to one divided by S. This intentionally large excitation

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
error as well as being a function of the excitation error S, If we consider the

186
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
formula for the extinction distance here we can see that thickness fringe frequency

187
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
will also be a function of FG the structure factor for the reflection

188
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
such that side G will be proportional to one over FG.

189
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is a case that I illustrate on this light using a sample of a cleaved wedge

190
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
not now Silicon but of aluminum gallium arsenide or gas

191
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
as it is sometimes known where the aluminum and gallium irons can substitute for

192
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
each other on the same atomic sites. The sample

193
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
again has a basic zone axis of 0 0 1

194
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and I have excited this two to zero reflection here.

195
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Given this tubing pattern here and then

196
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
made a dot for the image from that excited reflection.

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
On the left of this dark food image we have thicknesse fringes in the

198
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
substrate where the substrate has a composition of about

199
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
25 percent aluminum and 75 percent gallium on these

200
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
shared atomic sites. On this

201
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
substrate quantum wells have been deposited which are perfectly

202
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
hypotassium. However they have a different composition in

203
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
these quantum wells. We instead have a composition of about 80 percent

204
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
aluminum and 20 percent gallium on the shared

205
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
sites. If we look closely at the thickness fringes in the quantum

206
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
worlds we can see the fringe separation as larger than the

207
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
fringe separation in the substrate. In other words the quantum

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
worlds have a larger extinction distance than the substrate.

209
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is reasonable because aluminum scatters less than gallium. So it

210
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
has a small atomic scattering factor than gallium does as the percentage of aluminum

211
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
increases the atomic structure factor from this shed's site

212
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
decreases decreasing the structure factor for that reflection and

213
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
increasing the extinction distance. Another thing you might notice is

214
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
that the onset for the thickness fringes is further away from the edge of the

215
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
sample and the quantum wells than in the substrate that's due to another

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
effect. These quantum Wells oxidized badly. Thus the

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
first part of the thickness is amorphous oxidized material

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and doesn't count to the crystalline dynamical diffraction scattering

219
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
effect needed to make the thickness fringes. This cleat which sample geometry which

220
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I've used to illustrate thickness fringes is little use in regular tame

221
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
analyses. Thus in a way these illustrations have been rather academic.

222
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
However thickness fringes will regularly be observed in regular tame

223
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
imaging here I sure bright field image of barium

224
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Titanite nanocrystals the crystals are randomly orientated with

225
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
respect to the electron beam. We can see that some of the crystals have rather low

226
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
contrast these crystals must be in a weak

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
scattering condition far away from a low index zone axis. However we

228
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
have other particles which are darker showing a strong diffraction contrast.

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The particles have varying thickness and being in a strong diffraction condition

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
they have increased dynamical scattering and we can see that as the thickness

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
changes away from the edge we see thickness fringes here

232
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
and this particle here on this edge here on this edge here

233
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
this illustrates how you may well see thickness fringes from dynamical

234
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
scattering and regular teme data of for

235
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
instance such randomly oriented nanoparticles or maybe narrow roads or

236
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
other crystalline objects of strongly varying thickness

237
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
to sunrise in a tubing condition. I have measured the intensity and the direct

238
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
beam zero and intensity in the defective beam I G using

239
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Bright field and dark field imaging are the perfect bragg condition

240
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
with Ezekial zero. We see that zero G

241
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
model 8 sinusoidal G and are in anti-faith with each other with increasing

242
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
thickness giving bright field and dark food images such as

243
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
these where these patterns are bright and dark fringes are known as thickness fringes

244
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
or extinction contours we further see that when

245
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
we pull out the intensity profiles of zero and IG on these wedge

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
shaped samples and the profile matches very nicely a model which accounts for some

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
absorption effects. I have gone on to show that if we increase

248
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
S then the frequency of these thickness fringes increases

249
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
in keeping with theory. Finally with an example of barium Titanite nanocrystals

250
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I have shown how such thickness fringes are often observed in regular term data.

251
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When your image samples of strongly varying thickness in the next

252
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
lecture I'm going to continue on this theme of dynamic and effects and time imaging this

253
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
time looking at what happens when our crystalline sample is deformed or

254
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
bent giving rise to the appearance of bend controls and

255
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
bright field and dark field images.
