00:00:05.307 --> 00:00:10.750
Welcome to CIME's lectures on transmission
electron microscopy for materials science.

2
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.280
In this video, we will see
the effect of a thin specimen which

3
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.220
only affects the phase,
the weak phase object approximation.

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.200
And what's the influence when we
consider the contrast transfer function.

5
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.980
So now I am back with my specimen,

6
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.600
the electron wave that comes on
the specimen and is a plain wave.

7
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.090
And I have the electron wave after
the specimen called f(r).

8
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.620
This is affected both in amplitude and
phase.

9
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.090
At that position I have the phase shift,

10
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.130
which depends on the thickness
of the specimen t.

11
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.161
Here is the amplitude and the phase.

12
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:10.760
If I have a thin specimen, only the
projected potential will affect the phase.

13
00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:22.230
I can write the phase shift as
pi / (lambda.E) V_t(r).

14
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.970
Since I have a thin specimen,
the phase shift is small.

15
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.100
Lambda is the wavelength of
the electrons and E the electron energy.

16
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.430
So if I have a very thin specimen,

17
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.557
the amplitude is not affected,
so A(r)=1.

18
00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:51.813
And the phase shift is extremely small,

19
00:01:51.813 --> 00:01:59.732
so pi/ (lambda.E) V_t(r)
is much smaller than 1.

20
00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:05.150
With this I can rewrite f(r).

21
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.930
This called
the Weak Phase Object Approximation.

22
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.360
We will now look at what is the influence

23
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.700
of the objective lens on this object wave.

24
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.910
So we keep the specimen object wave in
the Weak Phase Object Approximation.

25
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.770
And we know at the objective lens.

26
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.210
The objective length is described
by the point spread function.

27
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.310
And it's Fourier transform,
the contrast transfer function.

28
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.500
Which is the Fourier transform
of the point spread function.

29
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.080
After the objective lens,
we have the electron

30
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.760
wave formed as an image,
which is the convolution

31
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.170
of the exit wave and
the point spread function.

32
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:12.620
But what we measure is then the intensity
projected on a recording device.

33
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.490
So the measured quantity I(r)
has the following expression

34
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.390
g times its complex conjugate.

35
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.410
I will calculate this using
the point spread function and

36
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.990
the approximation for the exit wave.

37
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.010
I now insert this expression for f, but
I'll keep the point spread function.

38
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.700
I have a real part, an imaginary part.

39
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.270
So now I will consider
the two parts real and

40
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.760
imaginary part of
the point spread function.

41
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.600
So I will first expand
the convolution product, and

42
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.013
see what the first term is doing.

43
00:04:01.013 --> 00:04:03.438
And then for the second part,

44
00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:08.682
I will need to consider separately
real and imaginary part of h.

45
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:20.910
I will first take care of this first
quantity, one convoluted with h.

46
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.900
If I want to get this,
I can consider it's Fourier transform.

47
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.176
So this is the inverse Fourier
transform of its Fourier

48
00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:39.955
transform which will transform this
into a multiplicative product.

49
00:04:39.955 --> 00:04:43.816
The Fourier transform of
1 is a Delta function,

50
00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.840
I'm now entering reciprocal space.

51
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.802
So I have u times the Fourier
transform of the point

52
00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:55.060
spread function is the contrast
transfer function.

53
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.314
This is A and A is equal to that.

54
00:04:59.314 --> 00:05:04.978
Okay, this just picks the value of H for

55
00:05:04.978 --> 00:05:09.095
u equals 0, which is 1, so

56
00:05:09.095 --> 00:05:14.350
it's also a delta function.

57
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.820
The inverse Fourier transform
of a delta function is unity.

58
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.400
So A is equal 1.

59
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.570
So we're plotting now this
equation on the next slide.

60
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.620
I will continue by expanding this term
to separate real and imaginary parts.

61
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.858
The real part will come from
the multiplication of this imaginary

62
00:05:43.858 --> 00:05:49.299
part with this one, and
the imaginary part from the last term.

63
00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:54.800
It's time now to calculate
the modulus to get y.

64
00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.945
So the real part squared plus
the imaginary part squared.

65
00:06:05.488 --> 00:06:09.400
Let us now come back to the weak
phase object approximation.

66
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:17.920
We build it by saying that this
quantity is small with respect to 1.

67
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.536
Now I will have this quantity,
small with respect to 1 as well.

68
00:06:26.536 --> 00:06:31.714
And if you look well,
this will be of order 2.

69
00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:36.355
And this can be simplified by
keeping only the first order.

70
00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.218
The two last term,

71
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.539
Are negligible.

72
00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.504
So the projected intensity only depends

73
00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:06.231
on the imaginary part of
the point spread function.

74
00:07:06.231 --> 00:07:10.007
Since now the only important quantity Is

75
00:07:10.007 --> 00:07:14.671
the imaginary part of
the point spread function,

76
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:20.113
that also means that for
the contrast transfer function,

77
00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:24.681
I will only need to consider
its imaginary part.

78
00:07:24.681 --> 00:07:33.027
The CTF was A times the envelope times B,

79
00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:38.438
which is exponential y times chi.

80
00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:45.192
If I take the imaginary part of the CTF,

81
00:07:45.192 --> 00:07:51.739
I end up with A times E, both are real,

82
00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:55.640
times sinus of chi(u).

83
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.600
Now I also have this factor
of two which arise due

84
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.770
to the approximation we made before.

85
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.794
So I can define the phase

86
00:08:09.794 --> 00:08:15.662
contrast transfer function

87
00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:20.794
T(u) as being A(u),

88
00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:26.920
E(u) times 2 sinus chi(u).

89
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.670
So this phase contrast transfer function
is a characteristic of the microscope.

90
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:36.641
It includes the effect of apertures,
the envelopes, and

91
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.698
the aberrations of the objective lens.

92
00:08:39.698 --> 00:08:43.500
It will act as a filter
in reciprocal space and

93
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.820
govern on the transfer of information
as a function of spatial frequencies.

94
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.900
So we have to remember now, this very

95
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.640
important quantity called the phase
contrast transfer function.

96
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.180
If we only have defocus and
spherical aberration,

97
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.040
we had an expression for chi(u)

98
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.010
This is this expression depending on the defocus

99
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:18.510
delta f and
the spherical aberration coefficient Cs.

100
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:26.744
So now, we have the fast growing
function as a function of u,

101
00:09:26.744 --> 00:09:30.625
and we take the sinus of this.

102
00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:36.017
You can imagine that we
have chi(u),

103
00:09:36.017 --> 00:09:41.428
which will grow for
increasing u very fast.

104
00:09:41.428 --> 00:09:44.463
If you take the sine of this,

105
00:09:44.463 --> 00:09:49.394
you can expect the transfer
function T(u) to

106
00:09:49.394 --> 00:09:54.201
have a very complicated
form with something I

107
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:59.660
don't know how it will look
like at the beginning.

108
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.618
But for sure when I increase,
go to increasing u,

109
00:10:04.618 --> 00:10:08.760
I will get faster and faster oscillations.

110
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.550
What does it mean to have
such a strange function?

111
00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:20.560
If it crosses the horizontal axis,

112
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.680
I have to transfer function equal to 0.

113
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.360
That means,
I will not transfer any information.

114
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.226
If I have a positive or negative,

115
00:10:35.226 --> 00:10:39.378
I will have inversion of contrast.

116
00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:43.402
This is the spatial frequency u.

117
00:10:43.402 --> 00:10:47.484
So that as a function of u,
I will have very

118
00:10:47.484 --> 00:10:53.010
complicated different
transfer of information.

119
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:59.390
So now, you have seen how we come to
the phase contrast transfer function,

120
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.770
which is very important to
explain the transfer of

121
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.490
information in the case of the weak
phase object approximation.

122
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.600
In the next video,
we will look in more details at the phase

123
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:19.276
contrast transfer function as a function
of the microscope capabilities, C_s and

124
00:11:19.276 --> 00:11:24.460
defocus, and see how it affects
the image that we can record.
