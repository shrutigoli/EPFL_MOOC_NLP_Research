00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:09,030
Welcome to series lectures on Transmission Electron Microscopy for Material Science.

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,650
In the last lecture, I introduced thickness fringes.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,530
The patterns of bright and dark fringes seen

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,385
in crystalline samples of strongly varying thickness,

5
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,735
which are also in strong dynamical scattering conditions.

6
00:00:22,735 --> 00:00:25,100
In this lecture, I'm going to look at one of

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,855
the other main consequences of dynamical scattering on regular TEM imaging,

8
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,865
in the formation of bend contours.

9
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,270
These are contours that are observed in

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:39,880
crystalline samples which are locally deformed or bent,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,790
thus changing the crystal orientation

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,275
with respect to the electron beam depending on spatial location.

13
00:00:48,275 --> 00:00:53,275
Which in turn gives a spatially dependent diffraction condition.

14
00:00:53,275 --> 00:00:56,211
To understand the formation of bend contours,

15
00:00:56,211 --> 00:01:02,618
we can look at the simple schematic of lattice planes in a deformed crystal.

16
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:06,360
If we draw on some parallel incident rays,

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,540
we can immediately see that

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,895
the orientation of this lattice plane with respect to the incident ray,

19
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:19,270
depends on the position of the ray on the sample.

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,815
Marking on a number of parallel rays,

21
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,315
this becomes even more obvious.

22
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:27,034
In the center here,

23
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:31,050
the ray is perfectly parallel with the lattice plane.

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,215
Moving away from the central location in either direction,

25
00:01:35,215 --> 00:01:38,310
we can see that the angle between that incident ray and

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,596
the lattice plane gradually increases.

27
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:45,015
Thus we can see that the diffraction condition of this plane

28
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:49,950
will vary locally as this angle changes.

29
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,185
For instance, it might be that here the plane is in the perfect Bragg condition,

30
00:01:55,185 --> 00:02:01,221
thus there will be strong scattering of that ray into a diffracted beam.

31
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,100
We will first look at the effect of

32
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,570
that spatially dependent diffraction condition on dark-field imaging.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,970
To consider this, we will just look at this part of the

34
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:19,135
schematic around the plane which is in the Bragg condition at this place on the sample.

35
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:23,290
Therefore here, there will be strong scattering into a diffracted beam,

36
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,769
giving the wave vector k_D.

37
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:33,765
Considering that there will also be transmission of the incident or direct beam,

38
00:02:33,765 --> 00:02:39,250
the sample will give a two-beam diffraction pattern with one reflection 000,

39
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,940
the direct beam and another for the diffracted beam

40
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,418
g. As we move away from this spatial location,

41
00:02:49,418 --> 00:02:54,205
the plane loses that perfect Bragg angle with incident beam.

42
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:58,911
Thus while it will still scatter with this diffracted wave vector,

43
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:04,970
the intensity in the diffracted beam would decrease.

44
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,240
This is illustrated in a simple conceptual way here,

45
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,430
where we have strong scattering into the defective beam at this location,

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,650
weakening as we move either side from that location.

47
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:29,113
So, if we plotted the intensity in that diffracted beam relative to some spatial axis x,

48
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:37,045
we would see here there would be a strong intensity in that diffracted beam.

49
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:40,690
But as we move away in x,

50
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,420
that intensity would decrease as we lose that strong diffraction condition,

51
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,821
thus giving a profile like this.

52
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,629
Looking at a real dark-field image or a deformed crystalline sample,

53
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,965
this is indeed what we see.

54
00:03:56,965 --> 00:04:02,257
The sample in question is nickel-3 aluminum-titanium super alloy.

55
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:08,595
And here we have a bright band.

56
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:16,890
This bright band corresponds to places where the sample is at the exact Bragg condition.

57
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,720
As we move away from this band because of the curvature of the crystal,

58
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,043
we lose that strong diffraction condition.

59
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:28,125
Thus the intensity and the dark field image

60
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,770
decreases corresponding to the decrease in I_g,

61
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,900
the intensity in the diffracted beam.

62
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:42,260
And it is this bright band which is known as a bend contour.

63
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,610
Well at first, it may look like a simple bright band.

64
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,970
If we look closer we can see that there are actually

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,685
complex patterns of bright and dark fringes associated with this bend contour.

66
00:04:55,685 --> 00:05:00,115
These derive from dynamical scattering effects as now explained.

67
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,030
To explain the dynamical effects,

68
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,330
we go from this real space illustration to instead

69
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:12,575
considering the reciprocal lattice and the Ewald sphere construction.

70
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:17,926
When the latticed plane is at the perfect Bragg condition,

71
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:21,570
we know that the reciprocal lattice node for

72
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:27,040
this reflection is intersected exactly by the Ewald sphere.

73
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,640
However, as this plane tilts either side of

74
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,450
this perfect Bragg condition corresponding to the change

75
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,815
in inclination from the bending of the crystal,

76
00:05:41,815 --> 00:05:48,350
the reciprocal lattice node moves up or down.

77
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,440
As the plane tilts this way,

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,440
the node moves up and as it tilts that way the node moves down.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,910
Here giving a positive excitation error and here a negative one.

80
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,800
This change in local diffraction condition

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,485
can be described as a rocking of the Bragg plane.

82
00:06:08,485 --> 00:06:17,415
This is equivalent to a rocking of the Ewald sphere as demonstrated on this diagram here.

83
00:06:17,415 --> 00:06:21,480
Here, instead of moving the reciprocal lattice,

84
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,215
I've corresponded the tilts of the lattice plane to tilts of the Ewald sphere.

85
00:06:28,215 --> 00:06:31,190
For instance a tilt of that lattice plane in

86
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:37,225
this direction leads to a positive excitation error.

87
00:06:37,225 --> 00:06:40,560
Equally, if the Ewald sphere is tilted

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,615
this way while keeping the reciprocal lattice in one place,

89
00:06:44,615 --> 00:06:49,385
we create a positive excitation error as seen here.

90
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,885
In this illustration, I have further

91
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:55,835
replaced that schematic railroad with a little plot of

92
00:06:55,835 --> 00:07:02,290
the intensity variations of the diffracted beam against excitation error s,

93
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:07,154
given by the dynamical scattering equations.

94
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:11,530
And by zooming in on this part of the illustration in the next light,

95
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,150
we can start to understand better the pattern of

96
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,270
intensity seen in the bend contour on the dark-field image.

97
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:22,845
What we see is that as a Bragg plane rocks,

98
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:26,730
the Ewald sphere will cut through different parts of

99
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:33,455
the intensity modulations along the length of the railroad.

100
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:37,785
Thus in the center where the crystal plane is the perfect Bragg condition,

101
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,265
we have a broad bright band.

102
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,690
Then, after that we have

103
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:51,265
dark and bright fringes corresponding to the modulations on this curve.

104
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:57,365
These oscillations are seen a long way out from this perfect Bragg condition.

105
00:07:57,365 --> 00:08:00,740
Clearly, the distance between the modulations will depend

106
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,485
sensitively on the local curvature of the crystal lattice.

107
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:11,220
The more curved, the closer together they would be.

108
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,970
Also of course, the intensity modulations would depend strongly on the crystal thickness.

109
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,360
For instance, if the crescent has a thickness

110
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,590
corresponding to an integer multiple of the extinction distance,

111
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,848
then we would have a dark fringe in the center of the bend contour.

112
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:36,678
We now instead consider the formation of bend contours in the bright field image.

113
00:08:36,678 --> 00:08:39,220
If we go back to our simple schematic,

114
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,130
we can see that there are two locations where

115
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,677
the crystal plane achieves the Bragg condition.

116
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:53,440
If we say reflection at this angle corresponds to the +g diffraction spot,

117
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,040
then the reflection at this angle which gives a ray in

118
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,710
the opposite direction corresponds to the -g. That's in our diffraction pattern.

119
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,495
We would now consider a central spot with the direct beam,

120
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:17,575
another for g associated with this diffracted ray and then a third for -g,

121
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:21,525
associated with this ray.

122
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:26,120
Thus, we can simplify the schematic to consider only these three rays.

123
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:32,055
The direct beam g and minus g as seen on the next slide.

124
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:36,680
On this simple schematic showing those three rays,

125
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,920
we can see that at the two locations,

126
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,170
where we have the perfect bracket condition,

127
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,678
there are strong scattering into a diffracted beam.

128
00:09:45,678 --> 00:09:50,225
Equally, this will remove electrons from the direct beam,

129
00:09:50,225 --> 00:09:55,280
the beam that interests us for bright field image formation.

130
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,650
Now, if we make a plot of the intensity in

131
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:04,968
that direct beam with respect to spatial location,

132
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:07,125
when we are far from a strong diffraction condition,

133
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,590
the intensity will be high, and then,

134
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,740
as we reach this strong diffraction condition,

135
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,350
which gives more intensity in the defective beam,

136
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,401
the intensity in the direct beam will decrease.

137
00:10:19,401 --> 00:10:22,200
It would then increase again.

138
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,270
But, as we reach the minus g orientation, it decreases again.

139
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,625
Thus, associated with this plane,

140
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:39,143
we should see two dark bend contours in the bright field image,

141
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,535
one for the plus g diffraction condition,

142
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,580
and one for the minus g diffraction condition.

143
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,560
And if we look at this bright field image,

144
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,934
that's exactly what we see.

145
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:55,740
Here, we have the bend contour for the plane discussed in the dark field image, and here,

146
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,845
we have one dark line for the plus g,

147
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:03,350
and here we have another dark line for the minus g. We can

148
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,710
also see that we have many other bend contours for other diffracting planes.

149
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,491
We have a plus g minus g pair here,

150
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:15,460
another pair here, and so on.

151
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,075
Because of dynamical scattering effects,

152
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,847
we can see that they're also complex intensity modulations,

153
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,190
modulations that could, for instance,

154
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,980
be modeled by simulations using block wave theory.

155
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,270
The higher the index of the scattering plane,

156
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,338
the weaker the probability of scattering.

157
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,030
Because of this, high index planes have

158
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:43,110
less dynamical scattering effects and give much sharper bend contours.

159
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,500
So in these higher index planes,

160
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,150
we just see sharp dark lines,

161
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,905
where the plane meets the exact bright condition.

162
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:54,820
If we tilt the crystal by tilting the sample,

163
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,800
this will change the diffraction condition locally.

164
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,955
Thus, the bend contours will move across the image,

165
00:12:03,955 --> 00:12:08,870
as the places in the sample which are at the perfect bracket condition change.

166
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,050
This I demonstrate with this movie.

167
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,615
While imaging in bright field mode,

168
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:15,460
I now start tilting the sample.

169
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,180
As it tilts, we can see the bend contours moving as

170
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,705
the local diffraction conditions change.

171
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,820
I now stop tilting and, instead,

172
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,615
translate the sample over to this region here,

173
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:33,640
where we see many different bend contours coming together.

174
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,645
With a bit of extra tilt and translation,

175
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:42,045
I center that region and then insert a selected area aperture.

176
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,145
Now, going to diffraction mode,

177
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:46,545
I remove the objective aperture,

178
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,810
which had been forming the bright field image,

179
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:54,580
and we see we have a perfect zone axis diffraction pattern.

180
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,975
The reason for this is now explained.

181
00:12:56,975 --> 00:13:06,133
We have seen already that one plane with a plus g and a minus g,

182
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,310
in the bright field image,

183
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,740
we obtain bend contours perpendicular to their corresponding diffraction spots.

184
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,850
If we now consider a low index zone axis,

185
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,540
there will be diffraction from many other planes.

186
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,880
So this next plus g and minus g pair of spots will, in turn,

187
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,220
have corresponding bend contours like this and like this in the bright field image.

188
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:34,575
And we can go on considering diffraction from other planes,

189
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:39,370
marking in their respective diffraction spots and their schematic bend contours.

190
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,000
Where in the diffraction pattern,

191
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,295
we have scattering from many different planes at the same time,

192
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,440
in the bright field image,

193
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,900
there will be a convergence of bend contours associated with these different planes.

194
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:55,580
And that's exactly what we see on this bright field image of bend contours,

195
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:01,390
with different plus g and minus g pairs converging

196
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:08,975
on this zone axis.

197
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:10,750
Confirming this, when we take

198
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,340
the selected area diffraction pattern from this region of interest in the center,

199
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:23,755
we obtain a perfect zone axis diffraction pattern here of the nickel three,

200
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:31,545
aluminum titanium superalloy, on the 001 zone axis.

201
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:34,699
Looking closer, in the center,

202
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,290
we see very complicated patterns of fringes.

203
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:41,490
These are from strong dynamical scattering.

204
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,860
Because of the complexity of

205
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,700
the dynamical interactions between all these different planes,

206
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,000
they would need simulations made, for instance,

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,205
using block wave theory to model this dynamical scattering pattern.

208
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:02,640
To summarize, when a crystalline TEM sample is deformed or bent,

209
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,430
the orientation of a crystal plane relative to

210
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,070
the incident electron beam changes locally.

211
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,430
This results in the formation of bend contours,

212
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,340
as the sample comes into and leaves strong diffraction conditions.

213
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,325
In dark field images,

214
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:24,660
bright bend contours are seen when a plane matches the exact bright condition.

215
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:30,300
Conversely, dark bend contours are seen in bright field images.

216
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,433
In the bright field image,

217
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,920
each plane essentially has two dark lines,

218
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,890
one for the plus g diffraction condition,

219
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,640
and another for the minus g condition.

220
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:49,515
Plus g minus g pairs of lines from different planes converge on low index zone axes.

221
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:54,870
These bend contours may show strong dynamical scattering effects,

222
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,140
which can be associated with dynamical scattering theory.

223
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:05,318
Because any bent crystalline sample may show the strong contrast effects,

224
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:09,040
they can have important consequences for standard TEM imaging,

225
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,260
since samples thinned to electron transparency are often deformed in this way.

226
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:21,870
Finally, while bend contours can be useful for helping orientate our sample, in general,

227
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,590
the crystalline bending that creates them impedes our ability to

228
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,015
take TEM images at precise diffraction conditions.

229
00:16:30,015 --> 00:16:33,990
For instance, when a dark field image only has

230
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,555
strong bright contrast in the narrow zone of the bend contour,

231
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:43,997
it cannot be used to make observations across a large region of interest,

232
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:50,095
as for example would be needed to use the image to study dislocations in a sample.

233
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:54,700
Having looked at two effects of dynamical scattering and TEM imaging,

234
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,030
first with thickness fringes and then with bend contours, in the next lecture,

235
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,235
we will look at an effect on diffraction patterns with what's known as double scattering,

236
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:11,060
in which dynamical scattering leads to the observation of diffraction spots for planes,

237
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:17,420
which are kinematically forbidden and so should be systematically absent.
