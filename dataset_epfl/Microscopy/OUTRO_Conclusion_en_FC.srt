1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
So 

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This brings us to the end of CIME's lecture on
Transmission Electron Microscopy for Material Science.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this course

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have described the principles of how
a transmission electron microscope works

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And the theory behind the image contrast
and data that you record at the microscope

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You now have the basics for taking
a practical training at the microscope

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Or for moving under study one of the many advanced
analytical techniques that TEM offers

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Congratulations on finishing the course

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We hope that you have enjoyed learning about
this powerful and fascinating type of microscopy

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We wish you luck for any plans
you have to progress with TEM

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Either on the theoretical or learning
how to use the microscope yourself

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's goodbye from CIME's lecture on
Transmission Electron Microscopy for Material Science
