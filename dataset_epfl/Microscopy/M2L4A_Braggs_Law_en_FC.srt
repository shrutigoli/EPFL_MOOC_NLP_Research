00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:08,679
Welcome to CIME's lecture
on transmission electron microscopy

2
00:00:08,811 --> 00:00:10,061
for material science.

3
00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:12,661
In this video we will see
Bragg's law, which is

4
00:00:12,786 --> 00:00:16,549
a simple way to understand
the formation of diffraction pattern

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,055
in a transmission
electron microscope.

6
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:23,592
In a crystalline specimen
we can draw lattice planes

7
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:28,164
hkl with inter-lattice
distance d_hkl.

8
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:35,726
An electron wave will come and impact
on the specimen with an angle θ.

9
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:41,009
It will be reflected with
the same angle θ.

10
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,141
If I draw the wave on
the second plane

11
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:48,616
it will arrive also with
the same angle θ

12
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:51,448
and have the same
reflection angle.

13
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:57,656
The second ray has a path difference
with the first one, if I want to see

14
00:00:57,718 --> 00:01:04,043
something in that direction, I need
to have constructive interferences

15
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,167
between those two waves.

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,888
That will only happen if the path
difference is a multiple of

17
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:12,921
the wave length.

18
00:01:12,997 --> 00:01:19,172
The path difference can be found
on the graph and that position

19
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:28,777
it is the sum of those two paths and
since I have the angle θ again here

20
00:01:29,748 --> 00:01:40,698
the lengths of those two
segments is 2*d_hkl sin θ.

21
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:49,385
Thus the condition for constructive
interference is nλ=2* d_hkl sinθ.

22
00:01:49,574 --> 00:01:57,399
This angle θ in the case where I
do have diffraction is called θb

23
00:01:57,503 --> 00:02:00,503
for θ Bragg.

24
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:06,950
and in the transmission microscope
we only have the first order so n=1.

25
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,398
Looking at some orders of magnitude

26
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:18,194
λ at 200kV is equal
to 2.5 pico-meters.

27
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:21,903
Ten to the minus twelve meters.

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,700
In a typical crystal we can imagine

29
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:28,787
that we have
the inter-lattice distances

30
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:32,822
in the order of magnitude
of 2.5 angstrom.

31
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:41,389
Let's take
d_hkl=2.5x(10^(-10)) meters

32
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:50,992
that gives me
sinθb≃5x(10^(-3))

33
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:57,598
it is small, it means that
θb is close to sinθb

34
00:02:57,704 --> 00:03:03,354
θb≃5mrad

35
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,955
Usually, the microscope is vertical.

36
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:11,903
In that case the electron wave
is arriving close to the horizontal.

37
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:17,826
It's not realistic, so if we want to
draw it like it is in the microscope

38
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:20,503
it's more something like this.

39
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:27,568
I have the incoming election wave,
and the planes of my crystal.

40
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:31,128
But actually I don't
have such a large crystal

41
00:03:31,242 --> 00:03:34,242
I have a thin specimen
in the microscope

42
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:41,816
which means that I have a drawing
looking like this, with the specimen

43
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:47,146
the objective lens and the place
that will be in the right position

44
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,301
for  Bragg diffraction.

45
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:54,189
If I illuminate this specimen with
parallel beam of electrons

46
00:03:54,288 --> 00:04:00,463
so, parallel to the optical axis,
I will have some rays that will pass

47
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:06,087
through the specimen and
some rays that will be diffracted.

48
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:11,725
They will be imaged by the objective
lens, and as we've seen before

49
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,545
in the back focal plane,
I will have the formation

50
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:19,691
of the diffraction pattern and
in the first intermediate image

51
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,801
of the specimen,
I will have my image.

52
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:25,346
This can be connected
to the microscope

53
00:04:25,447 --> 00:04:29,297
that we have seen before
in the following way.

54
00:04:29,454 --> 00:04:38,466
The specimen  is in the specimen
holder at that position.

55
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,750
The diffraction pattern is in
the back focal plane of

56
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:46,961
the objective lens, where
I have the contrast aperture

57
00:04:47,046 --> 00:04:48,846
or objective aperture.

58
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:54,672
And the first intermediate image is
where we have selected are aperture.

59
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:59,995
Again, we have to be careful,
that was the incidence angle

60
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:07,617
that we had before, and that's
the θb after the specimen.

61
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:15,884
The inter-lattice distance is
d_hkl and Braggs law tells us

62
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:23,754
λ=2d_hkl sinθb

63
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,812
but in the transmission microscope
we look at the angle between

64
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,157
the incoming electrons
and the outgoing electrons

65
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:39,374
and actually, if we look carefully
the incoming electrons are

66
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:47,647
continuing like this, this angle is
2xθb, so the angle that we find

67
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:50,578
there is 2θb.

68
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:53,889
With this you have a sufficient
understanding of diffraction

69
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:58,446
in the TEM to understand the main
operating modes of the transmission

70
00:05:58,543 --> 00:06:02,443
electron microscope that
we will see in the next video.
