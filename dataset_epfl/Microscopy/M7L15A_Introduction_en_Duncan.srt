00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:08.957
Welcome to CIME's lecture on
transmission electron microscopy

2
00:00:09.038 --> 00:00:10.413
for materials science.

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.857
In the previous module you have
learned a lot about diffraction

4
00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:15.721
and diffraction contrast.

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.231
In this module I want to take
to the world of phase contrast

6
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:24.856
for which it's important to
know that electrons are waves.

7
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.764
But before starting this,
let's go to the microscope.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.080
My sample is made of
Indium-Arsenic-Tin nano-wires.

9
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:38.965
You have them at low magnification
here on the carbon film.

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.532
Now I have only one of them in,
so called high resolution mode.

11
00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:50.778
This nano-wire is well crystallized
and has an hexagonal cross section

12
00:00:50.874 --> 00:00:53.874
and it is lying on the carbon film.

13
00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:57.221
So if I make a sketch
of the specimen

14
00:00:57.387 --> 00:01:00.387
I will have my
amorphous carbon film

15
00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:05.783
and the nano-wire with
the hexagonal cross section

16
00:01:05.897 --> 00:01:11.372
lying on it, which means that
from the side of the nano-wire

17
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.629
towards the center I have
an increasing thickness.

18
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.807
That's why you recognize the bright,
dark, bright, dark, bright, etc.

19
00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:27.068
bands which are
thickness fringes

20
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.190
you have seen them with Duncan.

21
00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:35.638
But on top of this, because
the nano-wire is very well oriented

22
00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:41.868
in zone axis, you also recognize
especially at this position

23
00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:47.911
the periodic contrast of white dots.

24
00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:55.467
It's very tempting to call this
atomic column, or atomic contrast

25
00:01:56.462 --> 00:02:04.212
and to think what we have there
is just a projection of the well

26
00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.339
ordered atomic column
seen from the top.

27
00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:15.945
But on the other hand,
while the contrast is very clear

28
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:21.737
in that region, you see that it's
getting messy in this intermediate

29
00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:30.823
part and then I have an inversion
of contrast before I start again

30
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:37.139
with something looking like
white atoms in the next band.

31
00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:42.940
And then again, inversion of
contrast and later on white atoms.

32
00:02:43.192 --> 00:02:46.367
Actually, things will get
even more complicated

33
00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:49.473
if I start changing the focus.

34
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.054
Now I'll start changing
the focus of the objective lens.

35
00:02:54.176 --> 00:02:58.551
Concentrate on the band close to
the edge of the specimen.

36
00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:07.758
You see, I'v reached a focus where
the contrast has completely changed.

37
00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:11.955
I continue changing the focus now

38
00:03:12.112 --> 00:03:16.137
and I'm back to
the original contrast.

39
00:03:17.254 --> 00:03:23.354
And then, again changing...
back to the original contrasts

40
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.984
well actually I'm only changing
the focus in the same direction.

41
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.230
Now I continue changing the focus

42
00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:36.964
changing the direction
of focus change

43
00:03:38.342 --> 00:03:42.892
and you see, again, how
these contrasts are moving.

44
00:03:43.517 --> 00:03:49.229
So, clearly there's an interplay
between the focus of the objective

45
00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:53.464
lens, the thickness and
the crystallinity of

46
00:03:53.534 --> 00:03:57.484
the specimen and
the kind of image that I get.

47
00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:02.989
To understand phase contrast we
need to take everything into account

48
00:04:03.088 --> 00:04:06.088
what the electron wave's
has interacted with.

49
00:04:06.248 --> 00:04:11.435
If we take the optical axis as
the vertical axis, we have

50
00:04:11.574 --> 00:04:14.149
the electron waves
that can be considered

51
00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:15.984
as plane waves.

52
00:04:18.416 --> 00:04:23.129
Those electrons will first
interact with the specimen.

53
00:04:25.989 --> 00:04:31.476
After the specimen, the electron
wave will be completely changed.

54
00:04:31.697 --> 00:04:36.347
It will have changed phase
and amplitude.

55
00:04:38.038 --> 00:04:40.200
We draw it as a distorted wave.

56
00:04:40.295 --> 00:04:48.357
This is the incoming plane wave and
this wave is called the exit wave.

57
00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:52.918
It carries everything we would like
to know about the specimen.

58
00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.325
It is a complex quantity which
has phase and amplitude

59
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:05.531
and it's actually the quantity
that we would like to access to.

60
00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:10.242
But in order to access it,
we then have the objective lens

61
00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:12.431
bellow the specimen.

62
00:05:12.492 --> 00:05:18.567
Unfortunately, the objective lens
is not a perfect lens, so instead of

63
00:05:18.688 --> 00:05:25.550
transmitting the exit wave perfectly
it will transmit it mixed up with

64
00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:32.023
some properties that are due to
the lens, like aberrations

65
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.933
or cut off by the aperture.

66
00:05:34.023 --> 00:05:38.898
After the objective lens,
we have the electron wave

67
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.150
that carries information about both
specimen plus the electron lens.

68
00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:49.528
And then we need to measure it.

69
00:05:49.577 --> 00:05:56.490
Usually we have a recording device,
like a CCD camera with pixels

70
00:05:57.024 --> 00:06:01.612
on which we will project
our electron wave

71
00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:06.441
but this recording device we
can only measure the amplitude

72
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:12.247
so we have the projected
amplitude of the electron wave.

73
00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:15.822
it's very different
from the exit wave.

74
00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.957
In order to understand phase
contrast, we need to understand

75
00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:24.076
this whole chain of
information transfer.

76
00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.356
And to make it a little bit more
simple, we will start in the first

77
00:06:29.443 --> 00:06:34.630
part by describing the interaction
of the electron wave with

78
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.660
the objective lens.

79
00:06:36.717 --> 00:06:42.342
In the second part, we will see
how the specimen will affect

80
00:06:42.436 --> 00:06:43.636
the plane wave.

81
00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:51.121
And then finally we will combine
those two approaches to get

82
00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:55.019
the complete information
transfer by the system

83
00:06:55.153 --> 00:06:58.828
and then understand what we
obtain from the projection

84
00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.959
on the recording device.

85
00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:06.499
Basically, this will be the subject
of this module about phase contrast.

86
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.743
So, let's start with the next video

87
00:07:08.853 --> 00:07:14.240
to see how the objective lens
affects the electron wave.
