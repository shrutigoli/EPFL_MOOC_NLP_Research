1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,650
In this video, you will figure out
by yourself what's going on

2
00:00:03,778 --> 00:00:06,778
in the Three condenser lens system.

3
00:00:06,877 --> 00:00:13,252
Okay, I told you this two condenser
lens system is the simplest one.

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,261
In most of the modern microscopes we
have a three condenser lens system

5
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:20,332
It's very important, for example

6
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,409
if you want to have
a parallel illumination

7
00:00:23,643 --> 00:00:29,931
on your specimen, that means
if you want to have your beam

8
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:37,383
of electrons coming altogether
parallel on the specimen.

9
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:40,404
So, here is your exercise.

10
00:00:40,547 --> 00:00:45,459
You have to redo this
drawing on a piece of paper

11
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:55,297
and then try to draw the schematic
and explain at which place you have

12
00:00:55,444 --> 00:01:03,107
to put the crossover of
the C2 lens in such a way that

13
00:01:03,227 --> 00:01:10,302
the C3 lens will produce a parallel
illumination on your specimen.

14
00:01:12,262 --> 00:01:14,999
So the constrains are two fold.

15
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,104
First of all we have
the crossover produced by the gun

16
00:01:19,206 --> 00:01:23,931
which is then imaged by C1,
since we are not allowed to

17
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:28,874
change the strength of C1,
the position of the crossover

18
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:33,476
after C1 and after C2 is fixed.

19
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:38,594
The second constraint that we have,
and this is a very important one

20
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:44,538
is that we want to have a beam
making a parallel illumination on

21
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:51,175
 the specimen, something like this
will happen when you have all your

22
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:59,894
electrons passing through the front
focal point of the C3 lens.

23
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:06,495
That means that I have to make
sure that the crossover of C2

24
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:15,754
exactly matches this
focal point of the C3 lens

25
00:02:15,868 --> 00:02:21,493
and then the rays will exit
the C3 lens parallel to the optical

26
00:02:21,606 --> 00:02:27,931
axis and I will have a parallel
illumination on my specimen.

27
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,239
Okay, so now I have
a second exercise for you.

28
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:36,898
What happens now to
my parallel illumination 

29
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:43,005
if I first decrease
the strength of C3

30
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:49,945
so now I have C3 with
a smaller exitation and

31
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:57,731
I adjust C2 in order to still
have parallel illumination.

32
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:02,633
Okay, take another color and
draw this on the same drawing.

33
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,790
The constrains that I have
a C3 at a smaller exitation

34
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:14,648
tells me that the focal
lens of C3 is now larger

35
00:03:14,772 --> 00:03:22,135
therefore the focal point F3 has
moved upwards the optical axis.

36
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:33,862
I still have to adjust C2 in a way
that the rays pass now to the new F3

37
00:03:33,978 --> 00:03:42,140
which means that I have to increase
the exitation of C2, this adjustment

38
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,205
is an increase of the exitation .

39
00:03:45,474 --> 00:03:51,449
At the end, the rays are passing
through F3, they will exit C3

40
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:57,615
parallel to the optical axis, and
the final effect is that I have

41
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:06,792
a parallel beam on the specimen with
a larger diameter than I had before.
