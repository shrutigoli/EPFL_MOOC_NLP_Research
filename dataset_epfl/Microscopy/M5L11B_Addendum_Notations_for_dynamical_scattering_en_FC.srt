00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,380
If you look in their literature on dynamical scattering,

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,220
 you are likely to meet a variety of notations that are used to express

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,920
 scattering intensities and their equations.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,180
In this addendum, I described some of these notations.

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,920
In order to clarify and strengthen the connection of these lectures

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,860
 to references that you may read or study.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,580
Looking at it further at this expression for the intensity 

8
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,680
in the diffracted beam, always bearing in mind that the intensity

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,220
in the direct beam equals one minus the intensity in the diffracted beam.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,780
In different references, you’ll see that this expression is rearranged

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,180
 in different ways depending on the needs or purposes of the authors.

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,320
 For instance in some works, a parameter is introduced

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,880
 corresponding to Psy G times S 

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,480
Since psy G has units in real space and S had units in reciprocal space

15
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,180
This parameter is dimensionless and is often called 

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,640
W as for instance by Hawaiian wheelin.

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,480
Note that when it’s introduced some authors call this the 

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,740
deviation parameter while other authors actually use this 

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,240
same expression deviation parameter for S

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,660
 which I've been calling the excitation error. 

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,260
Having introduced W, this equation can be expressed as follows 

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,120
IG the intensity in the diffracted beam 

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,380
equals one over one plus W squared times sine squared 

24
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,360
of PI T over psy G times root of one plus W squared.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,560
Sometimes, an additional dimensionless parameter called beta is introduced 

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,360
where beta is defined as follows cot beta 

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,980
that is cos beta divided by sine beta equals W.

28
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,600
once this is done you can show that 

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,720
one over one plus W squared equals sine squared of beta.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,860
Thus this expression now becomes

31
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:19,500
 IG equals sine squared beta times sine squared of PI T 

32
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,460
over psy G  times the square root of one plus W squared 

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,060
In other works, yet another parameter is introduced

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,180
 which we call the effective excitation error or S prime 

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,800
where S prime equals the square root of the sum of 1/psy G squared 

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,200
plus s squared. Once this effect of excitation error is introduced

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,940
 this equation can now be expressed as follows;

38
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,500
 IG equals PI T divided by psy G squared 

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,860
times sine squared of PI T S prime divided by the square of PI T s prime 

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,120
Expressing it this way emphasizes the sine X over X all squared

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,140
 type of function now related to thickness and S Prime 

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,200
in other words sinh squared PI T S prime 

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,800
Finally we can substitute S prime into the last expression

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,980
 from the previous slide giving the overall compact expression

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,360
 IG equals sine squared of beta times sine squared of PI T S prime.

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,960
Well we have all these different ways of expressing diffracted beam intensity

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,560
In these lectures I’m going to mainly stick to this expression here

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,760
 because it shows in a rather clear way the effects of thickness 

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
and S on the intensity of the diffracted beam
