00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Welcome to CIMEâ€™s lectures on Transmission Electron Microscopy
for Materials Science

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in this video, we will have a closer look
at the phase contrast transfer

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
function and  first look at it
with a simulation

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
software and then see its effects
in a real transmission electron microscope

5
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
on amorphous carbon.
So from the last video you

6
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
remember that we arrived to the phase
contrasts transfer function.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
When we are imaging at week phase object with

8
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the objective lens this function is made

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of two parts, an envelope part.

10
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And a second part which corresponds to a phase shift

11
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
applied by the objective lens which depends on the

12
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
scattering vector reciprocal  Space Vector u, even

13
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if we only have defocus and spherical aberration this

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
phase shift is already a complicated function of u

15
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
including the defocus the spherical aberration coefficient

16
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and the wavelengths of the electrons.

17
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now in reality we have other aberrations like astigmatism to

18
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
each of them corresponds in an analytical formula
that can be included in the phase

19
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
contrast transfer function.

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So getting an intuitive interpretation of that function is not

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
easy. We will use the simulation software called

22
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
JEMS to plot this function as a function

23
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of u and also the phase contrasts transfer function including

24
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the envelopes. You have all the instruction to download and

25
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
install JEMS student edition on the Moocs.

26
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I strongly suggest that you do so to practice and follow

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
what we will see now. after starting JEMS student edition,

28
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you go to the tab called drawing and you

29
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
choose transfer function. You have a new screen

30
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
appearing. And the first thing we will do will be to select the kind of

31
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
microscope we will be working with, for the

32
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
beginning we take a generic microscope. Let's take the HF2000

33
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is a Hitachi model but it has 200

34
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
kilovolts 1.6 millimeter for the

35
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
chromatic aberration coefficient 1.2 millimeter for the

36
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
spherical aberration coefficient and here an energy

37
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
spread of 0.6 we will put it to 0.8

38
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
with this we have a standard field emission

39
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
gun transmission electron microscope for materials science

40
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
without CS correction. of course

41
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
if you know the microscope you're working with. You're free to change those

42
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
parameters to adapt them to your exact situation.

43
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In the tab CTF profile we see

44
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
a plot of the phase contrast transfer function as a

45
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
function of reciprocal unit length. So

46
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
nanometer minus one it's in reciprocal space. And

47
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
of course this is only at trace in

48
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
one particular direction in the reciprocal space which has

49
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
normally two dimensions.

50
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It includes all the terms at the beginning but

51
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we would start by removing the influence of the envelopes. So we

52
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
go to the tab call envelope, and to remove all

53
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
those envelopes also, there's a remaining

54
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
influence from the tab  drift and noise which

55
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we put to zero as well. with this the phase

56
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
contrast transfer function is as we expect

57
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
oscillating strongly and between one

58
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and minus one, it is because it's the same function

59
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of this complicated function of u including C_s

60
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
defocus and wavelengths of the electrons

61
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in the tab called CTF, besides the CTF profile you

62
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
can have a look at the 2D drawing of the contrast transfer

63
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
function also in reciprocal space. But here we have

64
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the view of the reciprocal vector and not just the trace

65
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
in one direction. The CTF profile will be sufficient for

66
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
now as we're working with aberration which have a cylindrical symmetry.

67
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So the CTF are circular and we have all the

68
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
information in a clear way from the profile.

69
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
On the right part of the screen in the tab "order two", I have access to the

70
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
defocus of the microscope. Let's do it with  "fine" so we

71
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
don't change it too much and see what happens if we change the 

72
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
defocus with this slider. You see how the

73
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
oscillations change as we change delta f which

74
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
will influence the phase contrast transfer function but whatever we

75
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
do at high spatial frequency we have this strong

76
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
oscillations. Let's put back

77
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the envelopes, spatial and temporal and go to option

78
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and plot's them. So no we see not only the effects on the envelope but the

79
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
trace of those

80
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
you can change the parameters that influence the envelopes in the tab

81
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
called coherence especially the energy spread of the microscope.

82
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
OK. No we can come back to this tab "order two" and change the

83
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
defocus while we have the effect on the envelopes.

84
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Still we see strong changes in the phase contrasts transfer

85
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
function and we see that we're able for example to put it in a way where we

86
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
have a relatively wide band where the phase contrasts transfer function

87
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is close to minus one at more or less constant while in other

88
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
range of the defocus we have a crossing of the zero axis

89
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in the middle of the accessible spatial frequencies.

90
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
As zero crossing means that we have no phase contrast transfer at

91
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
this particular spatial frequencies. In other words we

92
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
have no information transferred. So we will be

93
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
missing part of the information in the image

94
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Also, around the crossing, we have an inversion of the sign of the phase

95
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
contrast transfer function. This means that we will have an inversion

96
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of contrast for the different spatial frequencies.

97
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Before and after the crossing. Obviously an

98
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
image acquired under those condition will not be very easy to

99
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
interpret. Playing around with the defocus we find only

100
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
one value of delta F which gives us this wide band

101
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
of transferred frequencies. Now in the tab called diffractogram

102
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I have the possibility to simulate the image of an amorphous

103
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
specimen for example carbon or it's diffractogram

104
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
which is the fast Fourier transform of the image. This diffractogram

105
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is closely related to the phase contrast transfer function. Dark rings

106
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
corresponds to regions where no infon is transferred hence crossing of the 

107
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Zero axis in the phase contrasts transfer function. The dark

108
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
circles that you see appearing at some defocus and

109
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
some value of u means that at those particular

110
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
frequencies I have no information transfer

111
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
using an amorphous specimen to look at the contrast transfer

112
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
function. It's a good idea because an amorphous specimen

113
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
will have a wide band of spatial frequencies over the whole

114
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
specimen region. Now we will go to the real transmission of electron

115
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
microscope to see how things look like with an amorphous

116
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Carbon film when we take an image and build the fast Fourrier transform

117
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
transfer of this image. Here my

118
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
specimen is an amorphous Carbon film with a few very

119
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
small particles.

120
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And on the right part of the image there's a hole, so no specimen

121
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in the right pannel you see the fast Fourier transform, also called

122
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
diffractogram, of the left image. Now

123
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I will start to change the focus going to under

124
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
focus and then back to over focus

125
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
you see two things on the right part in the diffractogram,

126
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
you see this ring pattern like we had in the

127
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
contrasts transfer function. On the left

128
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
part on the image you see clearly the defocused carbon

129
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
film. Now I'm back towards focus,

130
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when I'm in focus, I have the minimum contrast and now my

131
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
contrast is increasing again. I see again the rings.

132
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
It's important to keep in mind that those black rings are

133
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
spatial frequencies which are not transmitted by the optical

134
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
system so in that region I have

135
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
no transfer of information.

136
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So back to the simulation software  we will now have a

137
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
closer look at the particular defocus for which

138
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I had a good transfer of information. We come back to

139
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the CTF profile and we play around

140
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
with the focus to see if we can find

141
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
an optimal value of Delta F

142
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Clearly I have a tradeoff between the width of this

143
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
band and the small indentation in the middle of

144
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
it. If we look at the tab Defocus, we

145
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
have preselected value of the defocus, and

146
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
actually, the first one gives me a good compromise.

147
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
No surprise. This is Scherzer's defocus. And we will now

148
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
try to see close up what it really means in the transmission

149
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
electron microscope. Let us have a closer look at the

150
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
situation. When I choose this value for the

151
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
defocus I have then the first crossing

152
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of the phase contrasts transfer function with the zero axis

153
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
at this frequency, I have no contrast transferred. And after this

154
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
frequency the first contrast transfer function is oscillating.

155
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
This means that we will have several crossing with zero axis where

156
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
no contrast is transferred as well as part where the contrast is

157
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
positive and part where it is negative. This will produce

158
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
images which are difficult to interpret. We referre to this crossing

159
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
as being the point resolution of the microscope.

160
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I can obtain it for the particular value of defocus

161
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
called Scherzer's defocus which

162
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
depends on the wave length and the spherical aberration

163
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
coefficient and which will give a good

164
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
compromise in terms of width and value of the

165
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
phase contrast transfer function in this first band.

166
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But even after this first crossing you'll see that I am able to

167
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
transfer some frequency and by tweaking the

168
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
defocus I could be able to map all this

169
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
frequency domain up to a certain point when

170
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the envelopes are cuting completely the phase contrast transfer

171
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
function, then I cannot get anything more out of my

172
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
microscope. This is called the "Information limit". But

173
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
what's happening if I have a C_s corrected microscope? for a C_s

174
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
corrected microscope. The spherical aberration coefficient can be

175
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
corrected and be equal to zero. Would that mean that the Sherzer's

176
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
defocus would also be zero? Let's have a look at what the

177
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
simulation software tells us.

178
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So now I come back to the same situation and microscope as before, but

179
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I will change it to have a corrected C_s.

180
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So a spherical aberration which is put to zero. I find

181
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
this in the tab "order 4", and I can take the slider and

182
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
put the C_s, actually to the value I want but

183
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I will be choosing exactly zero.

184
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Whoops. What happens there? I don't see my phase contrasts

185
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
transfer function anymore. The Sherzer's defocus

186
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
is zero, and I am now at Scherzer,

187
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
zero defocus, but what happend? Let's look at

188
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the tab where I have the defocus and play a bit with the defocus.

189
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Indeed, if I add some defocus I see my phase contrasts

190
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
transfer function coming back.

191
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
That's a well known effect. If you have a perfect correction of the spherical aberration,

192
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
No defocus at a weak phase object, we will

193
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
have zero contrast. Very good resolution but no

194
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
contrast so no image of the specimen.

195
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Of course if you have a specimen that goes beyond the weak phase object

196
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
approximation you will probably see some thing but

197
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
it will not be easy to interpret, the work around is to

198
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
put a little bit of C_S but much smaller

199
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
than what you usually have in a microscope. So, in some

200
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
micrometer range and then playing around

201
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
with the defocus, I can again find

202
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
condition where I have this Scherzer's defocus or

203
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
white band and the good thing is then the point

204
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
resolution is very close to the information limit of the

205
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
microscope. But what I can do too is put a negative

206
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
C_S because that's allowed by the C_S corrector. And then

207
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
you see an inversion of the contrast and especially

208
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
if you adjust the defocus to have the proper wide

209
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
band of phase contrast transfer function then

210
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
you have a positive contrast and this will give

211
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
you very nice images especially if you are imaging

212
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
small particles or very thin layers.

213
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Now we have a quick look at how thin amorphous carbon film

214
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
looks like in a C_ss corrected microscope. At the beginning,

215
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I have a defocus of zero and actually  so few contrast that

216
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
you probably cannot recognize where the film is and where the hole is

217
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
on the right part. You see the FFT of the left image

218
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
increasing the defocus you see progressively the contrast appearing

219
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
and exactly the same ring path as before on the non C_S corrected

220
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
microscope. Here we are not so much limited by the

221
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
envelope but more made available spatial

222
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
frequencies given by the carbon film

223
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and now I will come back to zero defocus

224
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and see how the ring pattern and the image are

225
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
changing. After that. The next step would be to look at the effect

226
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
of astigmatism. So now we are back to the simulation software to look at the effect of

227
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
astigmatism. First of all I want to take the same microscope as

228
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
before and we'll put the spherical aberration back to

229
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
1.2 millimeter. With this the CTF has the usual

230
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
circular symmetry back to the tab which contains the

231
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
defocus but also twofold asstigmatism we can for

232
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
example change the twofold astigmatism or first put the

233
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
defocused to a value which is close to the Scherzer's defocus we've seen before.

234
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
If I now play around with the twofold astigmatism actually I

235
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
don't see much difference with what happend before.

236
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
We should not forget that we are looking at an aberration

237
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
which has different effect in two perpendicular directions. So we

238
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
really need to look at the CTF and not at the profile to

239
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
understand what's going on. Here you see the

240
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
strong assymmetry in the

241
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
CTF in two dimension and with this

242
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
slider we are able to turn it on the screen. Once I

243
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
put a lot of astigmatism I can play around with the

244
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
defocus and see how the pattern changes in a

245
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
relatively complicated way also including 

246
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
crosses and oval patterns and ring patterns and so on.

247
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I suggests that you play around yourself with the JEMS software to see

248
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
a little bit what effect you can get.

249
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Watching the shape of the CTF which you can see in the

250
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
FFT of the image of an amorphous sample will

251
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
obviously be a big help to correct the astigmatism of your

252
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
microscope. Looking at

253
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.000
the diffractogram. We recognize a similar shape than the one we had

254
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
in the CTF and indeed that would be

255
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
easy to recognize on your microscope.

256
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
So now we will jump to the real microscope and see if

257
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
we can see exactly the same shape as we head here.

258
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Back to the same specimen as before just having a slight

259
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
defocused to see one black ring.

260
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
My microscope was correctly adjusted, and I will start

261
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
to mess up with the astigmatism correction. You see

262
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
how the diffractoram lose its symmetry its

263
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
becoming aval. Now I change the focus and you

264
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
see the same changes in the diffractogram as we had in

265
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
the CTF using JEMS

266
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
back to the same under-focus as before, now I will

267
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
increase the astigmatism even further.

268
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
So that will make the diffractogram more oval.
And if you look on the

269
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
left image you start to see an elongated structure in

270
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
the carbon film.

271
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
And when you go through the focus and then to

272
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
over-focus, you see how the direction of the

273
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
structure change in the film. This is a

274
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
typical effect of astigmatism in a carbon film.

275
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And clearly the diffractogram will be a big help to correct

276
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
astigmatism and have a well aligned microscope

277
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.000
OK.

278
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
with this video you have seen the effect of the phase contrast transfer

279
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
function on a thin amorphous specimen, and how  it is

280
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
possible to draw it with a simulation software and to image

281
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
it with a carbon film in the transmission electron microscope.
