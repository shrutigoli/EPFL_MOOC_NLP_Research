00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,110
Welcome to CIME's lectures on transmission electron microscopy for materials science.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,410
The coming lecturers are dedicated to the basics of electron diffraction.

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,600
In them, we will develop

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,415
a generally applicable framework for understanding and interpreting

5
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:21,870
electron diffraction, through the introduction of

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,150
the Ewald sphere and the reciprocal lattice.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,830
Well, essentially these form a geometrical construct rather than

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,748
giving a precise description of the underlying physics of diffraction,

9
00:00:32,748 --> 00:00:36,780
we shall see that this construct still provides many insights into

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,700
the phenomena of electron diffraction in a simple and intuitive way.

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,625
Before we begin on this construct,

12
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,745
in this first lecture on electron diffraction,

13
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:51,620
we will concentrate on the 2-beam electron diffraction condition.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,820
In this video recorded at the microscope,

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,730
we will look at electron diffraction from a silicon crystal.

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,495
At the beginning of the video now we are just looking at a vacuum.

17
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,950
And we're going to introduce

18
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:09,120
a selected area aperture and take the diffraction pattern from that vacuum.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,355
Here is the selected area aperture.

20
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:14,994
As explained in the earlier lectures by Cecile Hebert,

21
00:01:14,994 --> 00:01:18,970
this aperture is in the image plane and we use it to select

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,600
the region of interest of our sample, from which we will make a diffraction pattern.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,550
In this case, from the vacuum.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,210
Now we go to diffraction mode.

25
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,140
This is done by changing the strength of

26
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,765
the intermediate lens system such that the back focal plane is projected onto our screen.

27
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:39,870
Now we see that we have a single bright spot.

28
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:42,300
This is because we have an incident beam made of

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,515
parallel rays which in the back focal plane,

30
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:50,260
are being focused to one spot by the objective lens.

31
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,988
We can call this spot the direct beam.

32
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,020
Now I'm going to leave diffraction mode,

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,524
go back to image mode,

34
00:01:56,524 --> 00:02:02,310
take out that selected area aperture and then just move the sample until we're looking

35
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:11,540
at some silicon crystal.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,032
Here we are moving across the crystal and choosing a region of interest.

37
00:02:16,032 --> 00:02:20,210
We're going to re-insert the selected area aperture as

38
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:25,815
so and once again go to diffraction mode.

39
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:32,681
At first we see various bright spots each associated with a particular diffracting plane.

40
00:02:32,681 --> 00:02:35,630
However, we're not at a very specific orientation

41
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,125
of the crystal sample with respect to the electron beam.

42
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,150
But with the microscope's goniometer,

43
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,566
we will now tilt that sample towards a specific orientation.

44
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,955
One where the silicon crystal will be aligned such that

45
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:52,905
its 001 lattice vector is parallel to the electron beam.

46
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,203
As the sample is tilting,

47
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:57,440
we see that different diffraction spots,

48
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,465
which are sometimes called reflections,

49
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:03,305
become brighter or weaker in intensity.

50
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:06,890
Their intensity varies depending on the sample orientation.

51
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,526
Now we've become aligned on that 001 orientation,

52
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,730
what is referred to as the zone axis of the diffraction pattern,

53
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,340
where we now see a lot of intensity in

54
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,694
many different diffraction spots and a high symmetry in their pattern.

55
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:23,150
Now we're tilting away from

56
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,620
that zone axis condition to try and find another diffraction condition,

57
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,873
what we will call the 2-beam electron diffraction condition.

58
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:33,815
So, we're already starting to get there.

59
00:03:33,815 --> 00:03:36,960
We can see that two of the diffraction spots are becoming brighter and

60
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,717
brighter in intensity and the rest weaker and weaker.

61
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:43,400
It takes some refining to get there.

62
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,890
So a bit more sample tilt until we attain a good 2-beam condition.

63
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:56,480
Almost there. And here we are at that 2-beam condition.

64
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,695
By adjusting the contrast and brightness of the display of the diffraction pattern,

65
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:05,770
we see that in this 2-beam condition we now have two very bright diffraction spots.

66
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,760
All the other diffraction spots have become very weak in intensity compared to these two.

67
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,597
To look at this case of 2-beam electron diffraction,

68
00:04:15,597 --> 00:04:20,740
we will look once again at the Bragg diffraction geometry.

69
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:25,430
Here we have a crystal with planes and the planes are separated by

70
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:31,250
spacing dhkl where hkl are other mirror indices of the plane.

71
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,850
And we're going to consider an incident ray

72
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,470
coming into the first plane at an angle Theta.

73
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:47,200
And then that ray will be reflected from that plane at the same angle Theta.

74
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,305
Now we are going to consider another parallel ray reflecting from the plane below.

75
00:04:55,305 --> 00:05:00,885
So again, coming in at angle Theta and being reflected by this angle Theta.

76
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,985
Now because we have an incident plane wave,

77
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:09,020
we know that the waves on these two rays will arrive in phase with each other.

78
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,505
However, we can also see that the bottom ray travels a further path difference.

79
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:19,170
So you're marking an orthogonal here,

80
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,530
and an orthogonal here.

81
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,090
We can see that there's

82
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,065
an extra path difference of the bottom ray compared to the top ray.

83
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:32,494
Now if we magnify in on this region here as so,

84
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:35,185
and look at that extra path difference,

85
00:05:35,185 --> 00:05:39,535
we can see that by trigonometry here we have an angle Theta.

86
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:43,840
This distance here is dhkl.

87
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,989
This is a perpendicular hence

88
00:05:50,989 --> 00:06:01,395
this little bit of path difference here is equal to dhkl times sin Theta.

89
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:06,415
This extra path difference will be the same d sin Theta.

90
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:09,990
So, the total extra path traveled by the bottom ray

91
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:17,070
equals 2d sin Theta where I'm using d as a shorthand for dhkl.

92
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,160
And we know that if this extra path difference

93
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,980
2d sin Theta equals a whole number of wavelengths,

94
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,932
we will have constructive interference and hence Bragg diffraction.

95
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:33,744
Where here Lambda is the wavelength of the electron and N is an integer.

96
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,265
So, in the previous slide,

97
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:40,190
we considered Bragg diffraction for a symmetrical case.

98
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,710
In a non-symmetrical case such as here where the atoms in

99
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:48,055
the lower plane are laterally displaced from those in the upper plane.

100
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,915
Where the path differences now marked on as so.

101
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:56,641
We still obtain the same Bragg equation and Lambda equals 2d sin Theta.

102
00:06:56,641 --> 00:07:02,140
One thing that's helpful with this formula is that we can rewrite it and say that,

103
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:12,840
plane spacing for dnhnknl equals the plane spacing of dhkl

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,025
divided by N. This allows us to rewrite that equation there as

105
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:31,530
Lambda equals 2dnhnknl sin Theta.

106
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,685
Doing this allows us to remove the N from the expression in later slides.

107
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:41,105
Now, I said earlier that this diagram here corresponds to the x-ray case.

108
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:45,160
One reason for this is that in typical x-ray spectrometers,

109
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,150
we have the incident beam is produced at an incident angle rather like this.

110
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,715
And we have the detector over here.

111
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:56,890
Now in the TEM, instead the incident beam will

112
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,386
come down the optic axis from the electron gun.

113
00:08:00,386 --> 00:08:02,140
So, in the next slide,

114
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,510
we're just going to look at the TEM case,

115
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:07,180
by turning this diagram on its side.

116
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,485
But before we do that,

117
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:12,190
I'm going to introduce the wave function and

118
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,073
the wave vector to help us interpret diffraction more accurately.

119
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:19,870
The electron wave can be described by a wave function Psi,

120
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:26,410
where equals Psi, Psi zero times the exponential of minus 2 pie ik.r.

121
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,880
Where in this expression,

122
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,305
Psi zero is the amplitude of the wave,

123
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:38,405
K is the wave vector and r is the position.

124
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:46,443
And between them, two pie ik.r gives a face term in function of position.

125
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:50,210
Here we described just a position dependent wave function

126
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,160
ignoring the time dependency term.

127
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,830
Now we're going to look at this wave vector a bit closer.

128
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:04,060
This wave function I've written is for an incident plane parallel wave, Psi.

129
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,160
And its direction can be described by a wave vector K. You can mark

130
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,695
on this vector here K is the wave vector and its modulus equals one over Lambda,

131
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:19,195
where lambda is the wavelength of the electron.

132
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:25,710
On this slide, I have redrawn the Bragg diffraction schematic for the TEM geometry.

133
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,490
So now the incident rays are coming vertically

134
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,755
down as they come down the optic axis of the column.

135
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:36,400
The Bragg effecting planes are inclined to a small angle

136
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,495
Theta relative to these incident rays.

137
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,929
When there is Brag diffraction,

138
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,165
those rays are scattered at the same angle Theta.

139
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:53,400
I am now going to redraw that diagram in terms of the wave vectors for the incident beam,

140
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,580
ki, and for the diffracted beam kd.

141
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:05,100
So, we start off with the wave vector for the incident electron beam.

142
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:16,427
K_i, and then put in the wave vector for the diffracted electron beam k_d.

143
00:10:16,427 --> 00:10:23,408
Now, because we are considering elastic scattering,

144
00:10:23,408 --> 00:10:26,990
there is no change in energy during this scattering event.

145
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:33,679
Because of this, the modulus of K_i which equals one over Lambda,

146
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,365
equals the modulus of k_d.

147
00:10:36,365 --> 00:10:42,270
On the other hand, there is a change in momentum during the whole scattering event.

148
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:50,328
So, if first of all we consider the incident wave vector carrying straight on,

149
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:54,590
the difference between these two wave vectors,

150
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:57,798
represents that change in momentum.

151
00:10:57,798 --> 00:11:03,415
And we can add in an extra vector here to represent that change in momentum,

152
00:11:03,415 --> 00:11:09,260
which I'm going to call K. We can now see the wave vector for the diffracted

153
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,270
been k_d equals K_i plus this K,

154
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,745
where that K represents the change in momentum.

155
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:29,843
Equally, we can say that K equals k_d minus K_i.

156
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:35,110
On this slide, I'm going to develop the wave vector diagram a bit further.

157
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:39,550
So, to recap, we have the wave vector K_i,

158
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,925
the incident beam, which carry straight on here.

159
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:49,250
Here we have a plane scattering incident beam at the Bragg angle Theta,

160
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:56,470
generating another beam, with the way wave vector k_d.

161
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,090
And that diffraction can be described by this extra vector that we introduced,

162
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,950
which we called K. Now,

163
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:14,040
if we look at the length of that wave vector of K. If we draw on a perpendicular here,

164
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,825
we can see that half of the length of that vector

165
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:22,790
is clearly going to be the modulus of K times sine Theta.

166
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:31,823
So, that means that modulus of this big K overall will equal two times the modulus of K,

167
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:36,883
the general weight factor, times sine Theta.

168
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:41,500
And we're going to compare this expression now to the Bragg equation.

169
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,415
So, the simplified Bragg equation,

170
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,575
which we had developed earlier was Lambda

171
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:55,130
equals 2d_hkl sine Theta.

172
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:01,085
Now, if we look again at this expression for K, the diffraction vector,

173
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:10,510
we have modulus of K equals two times the modulus of the wave factor.

174
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,950
The modulus of the wave vector was one over Lambda.

175
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:20,910
So, this is going two over Lambda times sine Theta.

176
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,389
From the Bragg equation we can see that two over

177
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:30,398
Lambda sine Theta simply equals one over d_hkl.

178
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:35,970
So, this equals one over d_hkl.

179
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,920
In other words, the length of this vector is the

180
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,980
reciprocal of the plane spacing that's doing the diffraction.

181
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,493
So, we can easily see that Bragg equation in this diagram.

182
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:55,390
Out of this, we're going to describe that vector as the diffraction vector g_hkl.

183
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:01,948
K equals g_hkl,

184
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:08,480
where the modulus of that g_hkl equals one divided by the plane spacing.

185
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,260
So, we have a reciprocal relationship.

186
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,550
So, how does this Bragg's scattering look like in

187
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,765
a real experimental case in the electron microscope.

188
00:14:17,765 --> 00:14:20,700
So, here is our schematic diagram,

189
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,490
where now not only have I marked in the wave vector for the incident beam,

190
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,845
the wave vector for the diffracted beam,

191
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:34,710
but also I've symbolically included spots here,

192
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,922
for what we'd see in the diffraction pattern.

193
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,755
So, a spot for the incident beam,

194
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,910
which we'd call 000.

195
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,130
And then another spot,

196
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,590
that you see in the diffraction pattern,

197
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,205
for the diffracted beam,

198
00:14:47,205 --> 00:14:52,340
described by the diffraction vector g_hkl.

199
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:57,485
And the two of them are separated by an angle two Theta.

200
00:14:57,485 --> 00:15:00,415
Now, in this condition as we've already said,

201
00:15:00,415 --> 00:15:06,650
we have inclined to sample such that there is one plane hkl,

202
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,300
which is in a strong scattering condition.

203
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,115
And when we had done that, indeed we do obtain

204
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:15,905
two bright diffraction spots in the diffraction pattern.

205
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:18,550
When we're in this condition,

206
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,385
we can also apply a small angle approximation.

207
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:26,767
From the Bragg equation we know that,

208
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:33,040
Lambda equals 2d sine Theta.

209
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,889
And because the wavelength of the first electron beam is very small,

210
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:41,977
we know that Lambda is much less than d,

211
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:47,430
since sine Theta equals Lambda over 2d.

212
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,850
And Lambda is much smaller than d,

213
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,690
this means that sine Theta is approximately equal to Theta.

214
00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:02,019
By doing this, we can rewrite the Bragg equation as Theta.

215
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:12,255
Our scattering angle, is approximately equal to Lambda over 2d_hkl.

216
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:14,125
What we see in this,

217
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,965
is firstly a reciprocal relationship.

218
00:16:16,965 --> 00:16:19,270
That in other words,

219
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,325
the smaller the plane spacing,

220
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:24,594
the larger the scattering angle we will obtain.

221
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:29,020
Also, we see that in the small angle approximation,

222
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,880
we have a linearity of scattering angle with the reciprocal of the plane spacing.

223
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,885
And this is very useful because it means that we can measure

224
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:41,710
our electron diffraction patterns in a simple linear way,

225
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:45,945
to obtain reciprocal plane spaces.

226
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,935
To summarize on this lecture on 2-beam electron diffraction,

227
00:16:48,935 --> 00:16:54,462
we have seen that by inclining a crystal in the electron microscope.

228
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,795
Such that, it has one plane hkl,

229
00:16:56,795 --> 00:17:00,625
at the perfect Bragg angle relative to the incident beam.

230
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,925
We will have strong scattering from that plane

231
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:09,760
giving a bright diffraction spot in the electron diffraction pattern.
