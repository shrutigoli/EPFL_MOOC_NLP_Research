00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to CIMEâ€™s lecture on Transmission Electron Microscopy for Materials Science.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the last few lectures on the basics of electron refraction, 
I have looked at the theoretical case

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
of two beam electron diffraction as we saw in this case.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have one plane H.K. L which is inclined related to

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
the incident electron beam at the exact bragg angle 0B. 

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We have strong scattering from that plane giving a diffraction pattern.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Which has two strong spots: one for the drainfield the

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
0 0 0 and another for the diffracted beam. HKL.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
However if we look back at the video of electron diffraction,

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I showed in my first lecture you will see in the video that there is

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
another case of refraction where we have many different

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
diffraction spots. So scattering from many different beams

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
also showing a high degree of symmetry. This is a so-called zone axis

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
diffraction pattern and this is the case that I'm going to look at in this lecture

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as an example we can look at two experimental diffraction patterns taken from

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
a single crystal of silicon in this pattern.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I once again show you the case of two beam electron diffraction

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
here with the plane with minute indices h k l of two to zero

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
at the exact bragg condition. So we have strong

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
scattering into this diffraction spot such that we have strongly

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
excited the diffraction vector G to 2 2 0.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In this case I have instead aligned the crystal such that it's

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
0 0 1 axis that is z axis is aligned

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
exactly parallel to the incident electron beam. This

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
gives the so-called 001 zone access diffraction pattern.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We will now look at this case a bit more closely. So if we look at this pattern.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We can see that we have many different refractive beams so-called

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
multiple beam scattering the crystal has been aligned or what

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
we call a low index lattice vector effectively an important Crystal graphic direction.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
For instance if you have a cube a crescent such as silicon this could be.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A direction such as 0 0 1 1 1 0

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
0 1 1 1 this lattice vector will have these indices

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
U V W and we'll call these the zone axis. So the

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
zone axis corresponds to the direction in the crystal which is aligned

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
parallel to the incident electron beam. In this case we have

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
diffraction from planes in the crystal which are parallel to that incident

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
electron beam. So the electron being these planes look like they and on

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
with each plane giving a corresponding diffraction spot.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Multiple beings are excited at the same time. In this condition we obtain a diffraction

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
pattern which has lots of symmetry. So if we look at this pattern in particular we can see

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a mirror plan here, a mirror plan here, another mirror  plane

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
here and a fourth mirror plane here. Instead looking at rotational

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
symmetry we can see that there is 90 degree rotational symmetry

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
through the diffracted beams. So we have fourfold

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
rotational symmetry a tetrad. And we can observe that this Mirror and rotational

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
symmetry corresponds to the rotational symmetry for the 001

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
direction in the crystal. In other words we have a diffraction pattern which has

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the rotational mirror symmetry of its corresponding lattice

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
vector in the real space. Crystal lattice So why does such a

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
diffraction pattern fall in this zone axis condition to gain some

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
insight into the formation of this zone axis diffraction pattern. I'm going to

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
make a simple analogy and say that in the zone I say it's condition. Our Tim Optix

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and sample are similar to the condition for a diffraction grating in

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
frown Hoffa farfield geometry. Here I have a representation

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
an illustration. Of this diffraction grating

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and we can see that we have an incident plane wave with a wavelength Lambda

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
being scattered by a regular array of slits with each slit

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
having the spacing the when this incident plane wave is

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
scattered by the grating each slit actually the source of a spherical wave that

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
is spreading out we can represent that wavelet as arrays scattered at different

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
angles which here are called 0. Now what we can see is that at certain angles

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
0 Per nod rays have a perf difference which will correspond

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
to that for constructive interference. In other

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
words this past difference here which equals

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Dsin0 by corresponds to one or multiples of

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
a wavelength. In other words we have constructive interference when

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Dsin0 equals N times Lambda, Lambda is

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the wave length and is an integer. If we now put a screen

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
sufficiently far from this diffraction grating then we will be in

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
a far field geometry where parallel rays come to a point and

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
we will obtain a diffraction pattern. Well first of all we'll have a spot in the

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
center corresponding to the beams that are scattered straight on

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the direct beam. But then for sin0 equals

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
lambda over D we will obtain another diffraction spot here. So with an angle of

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
scattering given by sin0 equals lambda

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
over D then we'll have another spot here. For two lambda

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
D three lambda over D and so on and their inverses. The other

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
side. So you can see that this grating has given a diffraction

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
pattern of regularly spaceports. As an exercise. You can

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
prove to yourself that in the small angle approximation for this farfield geometry

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the angle of scattering between the diffraction spots is exactly the

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
same as you would obtain for Bragg diffraction and electron diffraction pattern.

83
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We should also note that this found half of farfield case is equivalent to the

84
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
back focal plane of the objective lens and TEM because in both cases

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
parallel rays come to a point we shall now use this diffraction grating

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
approximation to help construct a zone axis diffraction pattern for this

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
example. I'm going to take a very simple case of a primitive dragooning

88
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
unit cell such that there are no systematic absences in the reciprocal of

89
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
lattice.

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And we're going to take an alignment of this dragooning unit cell of the electron beam

91
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
parallel to the lattice vector 0 0 1. In other words

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
parallel to the Z axis of the unit. So so here

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I show an illustration of a two by two block of unit cells

94
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
in this orientation being drag and all we have A equals B.

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So we just have a simple square full and now we're going

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
to look at the planes which are parallel to the incident electron beam. In other

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
words the electron beam will view them as and on planes and take each plane and

98
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
turn and say that is like a diffraction grating and we'll see which

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
diffraction spot it will make in our diffraction pattern.

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So if we start off even without any of it of course we will always

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
have a central direct beam in the diffraction pattern

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the so-called 000. Now we consider diffraction from planes.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
First of all I take this plane. Here we can see that this plane is parallel to the y axis

104
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and intersects the x axis at one unit. So parameter. So this is

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
clearly a 1 0 0 plane like a diffraction grating. It will make a

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
diffraction spot in our diffraction pattern perpendicular to that

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
plane. And with a spacing which will be the reciprocal

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
of the plane spacing D, so we get a

109
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
diffraction spot looking like this. Now we move on.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Consider another plane we can see that this plane is in a state parallel to the x axis

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and intersects the y axis at one unit so spacing. So this is clearly the 0

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
1 0 plain this plane has exactly the

113
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
same spacing as the 1 0 0. But it is perpendicular to it. So it will give a

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
diffraction spot over here with the same spacing as the 1 0 0. But at an angle

115
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
of 90 degrees. Now we move on and consider this plane. We can see where this plane

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
intersects the x and y axes 1 unit cell spacing. So this is going to be

117
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
the 1 1 0 plane and spacing is one over route

118
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
to or the spacing of the 1 0 0 plane the 0 1 0 plane.

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So it's going to give a reciprocal lattice facing which is Route 2 times larger than this spacing

120
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
here. Also it's at this angle here

121
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
is going to give a spot then in this direction. So it's going to give a spot

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
over here the spot for 1 1 0 plane. Moving on I

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
consider this plane we can see that this plane is parallel to the 1 0 0 but

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
it intersects the x axis at half units or spacing. So it's going to

125
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
be that 2 0 0 plane being parallel to the 1 0 0. It's going to

126
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
give a spot in this direction. We're having half the plane spacing of the 1 0 0

127
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
the scattering angle will be two times that of the 1 0 0. So it gives us here the

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
2 0 0 moving on. It On this plane. Here

129
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
it intersects that half on the x and y axes. So clearly the 2 2 0 plane

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
being the 2 2 0. It's going to give us a lot parallel to the 1 1 0

131
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but having half the plane spacing is going to have double the scattering angle.

132
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
So it will give us support over here and we can keep on going here I put  on the

133
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
3 0 0 plane which of course is parallel to the 1 0 0.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So we'll give a spot in the same direction but with three times the scattering Ango.

135
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So giving us support here and we can keep on going and as we

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
do this we build up this diffraction pattern which by symmetry

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
includes inverse planes such as the bar 1 0 0 and 0

138
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
1 0. And we can notice a number of things about this. One thing we can see

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that it looks like a section through our reciprocal lattice which

140
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
indeed it is. Secondly we have associated each diffraction spot

141
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
with the Milliron disease H K L out of the plane that's created it.

142
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is called indexing the diffraction pattern. The third thing I'll

143
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
point out is that here we have our electron beam parallel to 0 0 1 0 0

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
0 1 is our so-called zone axis. And we can note that all

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
these planes being parallel to the zone axis obey

146
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
the vises zone law. Age you

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
plus cavy last year equals

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
zero the rule which applies for playing age Khail being parallel to that has

149
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
vector you VW. Now we have looked at the formation of the zone access

150
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
diffraction pattern by the simple analogy of the crystal as a diffraction grating.

151
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We should instead look at the diffraction pattern formation by the ewald

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
sphere reciprocal lattice representation. So that's what I have done here.

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Here we have the ewald sphere. And the vector for the incident

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
beam KI. And when we have this geometry what

155
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we see is that one layer. Of this. Reciprocal

156
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
lattice is now tangential to the ewald sphere.

157
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
And what's more is that when we have this geometry we see

158
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
that the ewald sphere actually does not intersect any of the reciprocal lattice

159
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
nodes in this layer directly around the 0 0 being.

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In other words the Bragg condition is not met. Now this is the exaggerated.

161
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Evil sphere representation that I showed before we can make it a realistic

162
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
representation as follows. So here now the

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
curvature of the ewald sphere corresponds to what we would see for a two hundred kilovolt

164
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
beam and a reciprocal lattice for both the center cubic ion. But

165
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
even in this case we can see that even with this very flat ewald sphere.

166
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The surface of that sphere does not intersect. Most of these reciprocal

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
lattice nodes in other words the bragg conditional scattering

168
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
for these reciprocal lattice nodes is not met. And if the bragg condition is

169
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
not met theoretically there should be no scattering from these planes.

170
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And we should not have all these diffraction beams that we in fact see because

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
experimentally we know we have strong scattering from many planes in this zone

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
axis condition. So we have some problem in our

173
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
representation using the ewald sphere and reciprocal lattice. For the

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
zone axis condition. To summarize

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
when the electron beam is parallel to some important crystallographer direction

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or so-called low end zone axis UAW we have Taina zone axis a

177
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
fraction passion which has multiple scattering in many different beams.

178
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This pattern can display high symmetry with mirror and rotational symmetries

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
which correspond to that of the real crystal lattice.

180
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Further in this condition we had diffraction from planes

181
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
which are parallel to the incident beam and so parallel to the z axis U V

182
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
W. And because of this the vice zone or law is met.. So

183
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
all of the planes directly around that direct beam obey the vice alone or

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
wherever the plane HKL, HU plus KV plus LW equals zero

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
On the other hand when we represent this condition using our

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
ewald sphere reciprocal lattice representation we find that the Braggs

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
scattering condition is not met.

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Clearly there is a problem in our representation. The problem in our representation is

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
because while the recipient lattice nodes so far have been represented as

190
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
infinitely small points. In fact they have a size in a shape and the size and

191
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
shape leads to a relaxation of the bragg scattering condition and

192
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,500
we obtain multiple scattering in our schematic diagram.

193
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,000
And this is what we will look at in the next lecture.
