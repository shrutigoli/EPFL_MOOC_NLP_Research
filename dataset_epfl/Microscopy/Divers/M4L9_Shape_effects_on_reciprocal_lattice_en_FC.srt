00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,840
Welcome to CIME's lectures on transmission electron microscopy for

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,840
materials science and the lecture on shape effects in the reciprocal lattice.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,040
In the last lecture on zone access electron diffraction,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,750
I identified a problem in

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,830
our representation of the Ewald sphere and the reciprocal lattice.

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,170
And that, while experimentally we know that in this geometry where we have

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,005
the incident electron beam parallel to a low index zone axis vector,

8
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:36,690
we have strong scattering from

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,945
many different planes which are parallel to that incident electron beam.

10
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,935
This strong interaction was not

11
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:50,330
illustrated in our Ewald sphere reciprocal lattice representation.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,860
In this lecture, I will resolve this problem by

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,850
illustrating how each reciprocal lattice node is not infinitely small,

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,080
but it has a certain size and shape related to

15
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,055
the size and shape of our TEM sample geometry.

16
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:09,110
And this is because of the size and shape,

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,211
that the reciprocal lattice nodes can interact with the Ewald sphere,

18
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:18,515
and we can have strong scattering from many different crystal planes at the same time.

19
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:20,690
To understand these shape effects,

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,780
I'm going to use the fact that the reciprocal lattice is

21
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,475
the spatial Fourier transform of the real space crystal lattice.

22
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:30,170
While I say this without proof,

23
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,750
we can understand it on a simple level by

24
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,500
considering the reciprocal lattice vector for a plane,

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,460
hkl, which has a spacing of d_hkl.

26
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,380
When we construct the reciprocal lattice vector for this plane, as we have seen,

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,810
we start at the origin zero_hkl and then make

28
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,530
a vector perpendicular to the plane which has a length which

29
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,840
is inversely proportional to the plane spacing.

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,170
Now, if we think about the spatial frequency of that plane,

31
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,950
it will be one divided by the plane spacing and

32
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,702
so identical to the length of the reciprocal lattice vector.

33
00:02:09,702 --> 00:02:15,850
Therefore, we can see that this reciprocal lattice node or in a diffraction pattern,

34
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,625
the diffraction spot, contains the information on the spatial frequency of that plane.

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:29,645
While Fourier transforms are often used to identify the temporal frequency of waves,

36
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:32,395
if we apply the Fourier transform to a lattice,

37
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:37,015
we identify the spatial frequency components of the lattice, hence,

38
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:40,197
we identify the spatial frequency of different planes,

39
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:43,225
so giving the reciprocal lattice where each node

40
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:47,506
identifies the spatial frequency of its corresponding crystal plane.

41
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:52,280
With the reciprocal lattice being the spatial Fourier transform of the real lattice,

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,415
all the properties of the Fourier transform

43
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:58,395
apply to this transformation of real lattice to reciprocal lattice.

44
00:02:58,395 --> 00:03:01,990
Most obviously is the property of reciprocity.

45
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,225
However, other properties apply as well,

46
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:08,830
such as linearity, which means that the Fourier transform of

47
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,170
function A plus function B is

48
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,440
a Fourier transform of function A plus a Fourier transform of function B.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,695
Next, there's the property of shift.

50
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:20,650
According to this, if a function is shifted,

51
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,790
the only change in its Fourier transform is a shift in phase.

52
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,890
Since in diffraction mode we can only measure wave intensities and not their phases,

53
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,375
this means that if the real lattice shifts,

54
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,305
then its diffraction pattern does not change

55
00:03:35,305 --> 00:03:39,395
neither in diffraction spot position or intensity.

56
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:42,186
There's also the property of conservation of angle.

57
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:46,715
Because of this, if the real lattice rotates by a certain number of degrees,

58
00:03:46,715 --> 00:03:51,595
the reciprocal lattice will rotate by the same number of degrees.

59
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:53,130
However, for this lecture,

60
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,450
the most important property of Fourier transforms that we're going

61
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,070
to use is that of the convolution theorem.

62
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,090
Convolution states that if we take

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,905
the Fourier transform of one function multiplied by another function,

64
00:04:07,905 --> 00:04:11,730
the Fourier transform of this is going to be the Fourier transform of

65
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,710
the first function convoluted with the Fourier transform of the second function.

66
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,855
So here, I'm using this symbol to represent that convolution,

67
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:26,820
and we will now use this convolution theorem to understand the effect of

68
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:35,485
TEM sample geometry on the size and shape of reciprocal lattice nodes.

69
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:38,560
If we consider first an infinite crystal lattice,

70
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,260
so an infinitely repeating arrangement of atoms through our space.

71
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,840
If we take the Fourier transform of this infinite lattice,

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,290
we will obtain the reciprocal lattice that we have seen

73
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,905
already with infinitely small reciprocal lattice nodes.

74
00:04:54,905 --> 00:05:00,990
However, it is obvious that our TEM sample is not infinitely large.

75
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,460
In fact, it is a bound volume of matter,

76
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,020
more particularly, if we do selected area diffraction,

77
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,430
the piece of material that we will sample will have a diameter which here I called D

78
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,260
corresponding to the diameter of

79
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,355
the selected area aperture back projected to the specimen plane.

80
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,020
Further, it will have a thickness,

81
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,875
here called T, corresponding to the thickness of the TEM sample.

82
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,965
This is typically just some tens,

83
00:05:26,965 --> 00:05:29,252
or one or two hundreds of nanometers,

84
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:32,650
in order that the sample be electron transparent.

85
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,390
This shape function will multiply

86
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,575
the infinite crystal lattice that we have represented here.

87
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:43,770
So to calculate our actual reciprocal lattice,

88
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,160
we need to take the Fourier transform of this infinite lattice

89
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,455
multiplied by this shape function here.

90
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:54,600
And this is where we can use the convolution theorem.

91
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,490
So first of all, we will take the Fourier transform of

92
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,530
this infinite lattice, making

93
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,790
this reciprocal lattice with infinitely small nodes that we have seen already.

94
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,895
And then we take the Fourier transform of this disk shape.

95
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:09,945
On a first approximation,

96
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:13,785
to do that we will simply take the reciprocal of this shape.

97
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:18,380
So, as a shape which has a large diameter relative to its thickness,

98
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,325
if you take the reciprocal of that or the inverse,

99
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:25,315
then we end up with this rod like shape where the diameter

100
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:29,350
of that rod is proportional to one over

101
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:33,640
the diameter of the selected region of sample here and

102
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,090
the length of that rod will be proportional to one over the TEM sample thickness.

103
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:46,800
We will then convolute this rod like shape with our reciprocal lattice here.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,110
Now, when we consider it,

105
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,690
the size of a TEM sample is much

106
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,550
larger than the interatomic plane spacings in our crystal lattice.

107
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,630
That means in reciprocal space,

108
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,350
that the size of this rod will be much smaller than the size

109
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,185
of the spacings of these reciprocal lattice nodes.

110
00:07:04,185 --> 00:07:06,260
So when we perform this convolution,

111
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:11,885
we will end up with little rod shapes on each of these nodes.

112
00:07:11,885 --> 00:07:17,240
So we convolute the rod shape with each node in the reciprocal lattice.

113
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,465
If we keep doing that we will end up with something like this.

114
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:24,645
So now, we see a reciprocal lattice,

115
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:30,190
where each node has a certain size and shape.

116
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:36,670
And while the spacing between the nodes corresponds to the inverse of the plane spacings,

117
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:44,260
the size of each node is related to the size and shape of our sample.

118
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,700
Therefore, we have two length scales in our reciprocal lattice.

119
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,355
Because of the importance of this road-like shape,

120
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:59,430
we call them by a specific term which is reciprocal lattice rods or relrods for short.

121
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,725
Now, we have this representation of the reciprocal lattice.

122
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:05,940
We're going to interact that with the Ewald sphere

123
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,390
in the zone axis geometry wherein the reciprocal lattice,

124
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,610
we have one layer ozone of

125
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,700
the reciprocal lattice tangential with the surface of the Ewald sphere,

126
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,290
and we'll see what happens.

127
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,430
So here I put on the Ewald sphere representation with

128
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:27,495
the incident wave vector parallel to some important direction in the reciprocal lattice.

129
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:30,270
And we can see straight away that now

130
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,324
the Ewald sphere cuts through many of these relrods.

131
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:34,870
Every time it cuts,

132
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,570
it meets the diffraction condition,

133
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,120
so we see that we can have many different diffracted beams.

134
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,820
For instance, we can have one here,

135
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,060
you have another here and another here and another here.

136
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,360
So, all these different planes which are parallel to

137
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,065
the incident electron beam can diffract because of this relrod geometry.

138
00:08:57,065 --> 00:09:02,405
We have what is called a relaxation of the Bragg condition.

139
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:04,210
In order to refract,

140
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,660
planes do not need to be at the exact Bragg condition.

141
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,610
They can simply be close to the Bragg condition and it's because of this that

142
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,695
we can observe scattering from many different planes at the same time zone axis geometry.

143
00:09:17,695 --> 00:09:21,520
For this layer or zone of the reciprocal lattice which is tangential to

144
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,832
the Ewald sphere for which the planes are parallel to the zone axis vector U,V,

145
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:34,105
W, we can remember that the Weiss Zone Law: hu + kv + lw = 0 applies.

146
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,760
However, we can also see that the Ewald sphere can

147
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,045
cut other layers or zones in the reciprocal lattice.

148
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:42,055
For instance, if we look at this zone,

149
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:45,355
we could have diffraction from that plane and from this plane,

150
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:48,010
and then looking at the next zone up,

151
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,165
we can have diffraction from yet another zone.

152
00:09:51,165 --> 00:09:54,580
Now, the planes in these zones are no longer parallel to

153
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,180
the instant electron beam that are inclined to the electron beam.

154
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,335
And they will have their own zone formulae.

155
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,874
So in this zone,

156
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:11,465
hu + kv + lw = 1 applies.

157
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:13,010
And then in the next zone hu + kv + lw = 2 applies.

158
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,580
This zone,

159
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,284
which is tangential to the Ewald sphere with hu + kv + lw = 0,

160
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:29,930
is known as the zero order Laue zone or these other zones which have

161
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,790
planes inclined relative to

162
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,455
the instant electron beam are known as the higher-order Laue zones.

163
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:40,452
For instance, with hu + kv + lw = 1,

164
00:10:40,452 --> 00:10:43,345
being the first order Laue zone.

165
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:45,060
And 2 being the second order Laue zone.

166
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,280
And it is this interaction of

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,609
the Ewald sphere with the three-dimensional reciprocal lattice,

168
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,850
which can allow these higher order Laue zones

169
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,355
to be visible in electron diffraction patterns.

170
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:01,125
On this slide, I demonstrate this experimentally.

171
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:06,980
Here I show a diffraction pattern from Silicon taken on the 001 zone axis.

172
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,800
And here, we're looking at the diffraction spots or reflections

173
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,635
immediately around the central beam the 000.

174
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,840
So in this part of the pattern,

175
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,150
we are tangential with the Ewald sphere with hu + kv + lw = 0.

176
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,890
And we have seen,

177
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,935
we have a diffraction from many different planes because of the relaxation

178
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:39,090
of the Bragg condition resulting from the form of the relrods.

179
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,460
However, looking further out,

180
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,395
we can see some little bright spots.

181
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,630
If we now take the same pattern but

182
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,235
increase the intensity to bring out the intensity in those little spots,

183
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:57,160
we see a circle of diffracting plains.

184
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,795
And these are the planes corresponding to the first order Laue zone where we have

185
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:09,525
hu + kv + lw = 1.

186
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,870
So for these planes, the Ewald spheres cutting through

187
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,885
the next zone in the reciprocal lattice,

188
00:12:14,885 --> 00:12:18,155
giving the scattering at higher angles.

189
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,020
By increasing the intensity on the diffraction pattern,

190
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,045
we can see something else.

191
00:12:23,045 --> 00:12:29,705
You can see all these pairs of dark lines,

192
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:32,460
these lines are known as Kikuchi lines.

193
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,270
However, their formation mechanism is a subject for another time.

194
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,575
To demonstrate this interaction of the Ewald sphere with reciprocal lattice,

195
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:46,410
I'm going to tilt away from this nice zone axis diffraction condition that we see here.

196
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,565
As we tilt away, you will see how the Ewald sphere

197
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:54,780
cuts through zero to Laue zone making arcs and also

198
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,560
these higher-order Laue zones such that we can see how

199
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,830
this Ewald sphere representation provides

200
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,260
an accurate description of the real diffraction phenomena.

201
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,660
Looking again at that interaction,

202
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,330
here I have a diffraction pattern from

203
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,590
the silicon crystal tilted slightly off the 001 zone axis,

204
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,585
and we can see here the Ewald sphere cutting through

205
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:24,380
the zero order Laue zone and then further out

206
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,905
another arc where the Ewald sphere cuts through the first order Laue zone.

207
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:34,610
Once again, demonstrating how our representation of the Ewald sphere and

208
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:40,230
reciprocal lattice can be very effective for understanding real TEM diffraction.

209
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,990
To summarize, in this lecture,

210
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,420
I have shown that because the reciprocal lattice

211
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,300
is the Fourier transform of the real lattice,

212
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,720
each reciprocal lattice node has a size and shape

213
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,315
which are the reciprocal of that of the selected area of TEM sample.

214
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:59,280
And because of this region having a disk shaped form,

215
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,185
we end up with reciprocal lattice nodes which are elongated, the so-called relrods.

216
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:06,060
Because of this elongation,

217
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,285
the Ewald sphere can cut through many different relrods at the same time,

218
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:16,825
leading to diffraction from many different planes in one diffraction pattern,

219
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:20,880
a so-called relaxation of the Bragg condition because

220
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,790
a plane no longer needs to be at the exact Bragg condition to diffract.

221
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,350
This allows us to understand the strong scattering from

222
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,528
many different planes at the same time in a zone axis diffraction pattern.

223
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:36,525
And further, it allows us to explain the diffraction at higher angles,

224
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:41,335
which is coming from higher order Laue zones in the reciprocal lattice.

225
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,630
In the next lecture,

226
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,230
we will look more in detail at the reciprocal lattice rod in

227
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,390
order to start understanding intensities in the electron diffraction pattern.
