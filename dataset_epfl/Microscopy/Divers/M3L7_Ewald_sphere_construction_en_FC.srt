00:00:05,318 --> 00:00:08,709
Welcome to lectures on transmission
electron microscopy and

2
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:10,324
the lecture on the Ewald sphere.

3
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:16,059
In the last lecture, I introduced
the concept of the reciprocal lattice,

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:21,157
a lattice of nodes in reciprocal
space where each node corresponds

5
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:26,920
to a possible diffraction vector from
a plane with [INAUDIBLE] indices HKL.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,700
This reciprocal lattice forms
the first half of our framework for

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,410
understanding and
interpreting electron diffraction.

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,780
In this lecture, I'm going to introduce
the second half of the framework, namely,

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,610
the eval sphere.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,730
To understand the Ewald sphere,
we're going to consider that

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,540
electron diffraction corresponds
to elastic scattering.

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:51,223
The incident electron beam is
effected by the of the sample.

13
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:55,170
And during this diffraction event,
there is no energy loss.

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,370
Therefore, at the scattering event,
the energy of the electron beam and

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,400
hence its wave length,
both remain constant.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,460
However, as we have already seen, there
is a momentum change during the fraction.

17
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,283
We can describe this on
a wave vector diagram.

18
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:22,220
So here, I have a wave vector for
the incident electron beam kI.

19
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:28,815
Whereas, we have previously seen
the length of kI is modulus

20
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:33,470
= 1 over lambda,
the wave length of the electron beam.

21
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,910
I'm going to say that here,
I have some diffraction event.

22
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,530
Now, the scattering from this event could
occur in one of many different directions.

23
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,650
So, for instance, we could have
a diffracted wave vector here.

24
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,247
Equally, we could have
diffraction in this direction, or

25
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:02,700
this direction, or
one of many different possible directions.

26
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,420
Now, while the angular scattering
may change, of course,

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,730
the length of these diffracted
beam wave edges cannot change.

28
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,544
They all have the same length as that of
the incident electron beam, 1 over lambda.

29
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:25,370
So looking just at this plane of
scattering, we can see that all

30
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:31,550
these different possible scattering
wave vectors will inscribe a circle.

31
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,070
That's just looking at one plane.

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,860
However, we could also have
diffraction out of plane.

33
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,870
And if you consider the out of
plane scattering wave vectors,

34
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,180
we can see that together,
they will inscribe a sphere.

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,360
And the sphere of possible diffracted beam
wave vectors is called the Ewald sphere.

36
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,270
Since the radius of the Ewald sphere
has a length of 1 over lambda,

37
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,760
we can see that the Ewald sphere
has reciprocal dimensions.

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,760
And we're now going to interact this
sphere with the reciprocal lattice.

39
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,200
To look at this interaction,
on this slide,

40
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,050
I have drawn both the Ewald sphere and
a reciprocal lattice.

41
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,600
Looking first at the Edward sphere,
again, here, we have the wave

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,860
vector for the incidence electron beam kI.

43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,680
If there is no scattering, then the wave
vector carries straight on, here.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,421
We know that in the back
focal order fraction plane,

45
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:48,386
that the incident electron beam is a
direct beam in the refraction pattern 000.

46
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:52,110
000 also forms the origin
of this reciprocal lattice.

47
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,120
So I have also placed this origin
at the end of the wave vector for

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,380
incident electron beam.

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,260
Now, if we look at the interaction of the
Ewald sphere with the reciprocal lattice,

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,800
we can see that here,
there is a node in the reciprocal lattice

51
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,070
that is intersected exactly by
the surface of this Ewald sphere.

52
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,400
Now, for this node, we can draw in a wave
vector for the diffracted beam, kD.

53
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,324
And since I am saying that
this is the wave vector for

54
00:04:24,324 --> 00:04:29,800
the diffracted beam, I can also draw
in here the diffracted vector g for

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,190
this particular reciprocal lattice node.

56
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,496
Now, we're going to look at
the geometry of this scattering for

57
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:40,820
that particular reciprocal lattice node.

58
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,700
First of all, we're going to
look at the angle of scattering.

59
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,680
And I'll say that the semi-angle
of scattering is theta.

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,681
From this diagram and by trigonometry,

61
00:04:55,681 --> 00:05:02,886
it's clear that the modulus of g,
the diffraction beta,

62
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:08,790
divided by 2 = modulus
of kD times sine theta.

63
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,500
Now we know that g,
the diffraction beta equals D star hkl.

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,690
Therefore, the modulus of g equals
the modulus of D star equals 1 over D.

65
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:24,086
So, you can see that this becomes

66
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:29,673
1 over 2 dhkl = the length of kD =

67
00:05:29,673 --> 00:05:35,090
1 over lambda times sine theta.

68
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:42,662
And this expression should
look very familiar to you,

69
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:46,612
because if we rearrange it,

70
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:52,060
we obtain lambda = 2dhkl sine theta.

71
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,700
In other words, we have obtained
the Bragg equation by theta = theta B,

72
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,330
the Bragg angle.

73
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,270
Thus, we see that when the Ewald
sphere intersects exactly through

74
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,330
a reciprocal lattice node,
the plane corresponding to that reciprocal

75
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,840
lattice node is at the exact Bragg
condition, and so will diffract strongly.

76
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,660
Cleaning up that diagram, we can
represent this scattering as follows.

77
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,365
So we have the incident wave vector kI.

78
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:28,382
Here, I have drawn in some Bragg planes
at the angle theta b relative to kI,

79
00:06:28,382 --> 00:06:33,159
scattering at the Bragg angle,
leading to diffraction for

80
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:37,760
a plane corresponding to that
reciprocal lattice node.

81
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,240
In this representation,

82
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,260
I have had to make an exaggeration
to make the representation compact.

83
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,184
Specifically, We know
that the electron wave

84
00:06:52,184 --> 00:06:59,750
length lambda is much smaller than
in the typical plane spacing dhkl.

85
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,170
Because of that,
the length of this wave vector k,

86
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:09,794
Is going to be much
greater than the typical

87
00:07:09,794 --> 00:07:15,430
reciprocal lattice spacing, d star hkl.

88
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,950
So the radius of this sphere for

89
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,330
a realistic representation must be much,
much greater.

90
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,490
Moving on with that, I make that realistic
representation of the Ewald sphere and

91
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,500
the reciprocal lattice
in this diagram here.

92
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:39,860
Here, we have the incident wave vector kI,
the diffracted beam wave vector kD,

93
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,860
and I have drawn them assuming
that we have 200 keV electrons.

94
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:53,593
With 200 keV electrons, the wavelength
lambda is approximately = 2.5 pm.

95
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:59,514
To complete the illustration,
I have taken a reciprocal lattice for

96
00:07:59,514 --> 00:08:03,150
body-centered cubic phase of iron.

97
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,950
This particular node here is
once again at the Bragg angle,

98
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,900
and this node is for the 020 plane.

99
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:21,960
And for BCC iron,
d020 is approximately = 0.14 nm.

100
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,680
The net result is that the length of k,
the wave vector,

101
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,245
is approximately 50 times greater than
the reciprocal lattice facing d star.

102
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,350
When we draw that in with
this very long radius,

103
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,720
we can see that the surface of
the Ewald sphere is almost flat.

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,840
And while this reciprocal lattice is still
inclined relative to the incident electron

105
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,410
beam, the angle of that
inclination is very, very small.

106
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,780
As an exercise, you can calculate
that angle of inclination.

107
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,450
And the Bragg angle of theta b and
the scattering angle 2 theta b, for

108
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,633
this case of 200 keV electrons and

109
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:11,360
BCC Iron when exciting this
020 reciprocal lattice note.

110
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,164
To summarize,
I have introduced the Ewald sphere,

111
00:09:15,164 --> 00:09:20,014
a sphere in reciprocal space, so
the radius of k = 1 over lambda.

112
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:25,814
And we have seen that when we interact
this sphere with the reciprocal lattice,

113
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:30,837
and when servers of that sphere
intersect exactly through the middle

114
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:35,771
of a reciprocal lattice node,
the plane corresponding to that node

115
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:41,170
is at the exact Bragg condition,
and so will diffract strongly.

116
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,685
So far, we have only looked at this in
the case of two beam electron diffraction.

117
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,880
Where only one of the reciprocal lattice
nodes is intersected by the Ewald sphere,

118
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,470
and hence, we only have strong
refraction on one plane.

119
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:59,160
Giving a diffraction pattern such as this,
where, in this case,

120
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,600
the 200 plane is excited strongly
giving an intense diffraction spot.

121
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,570
In this case,
that plane is inclined at an angle,

122
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,610
theta B,
relative to the instant electron beam.

123
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,620
However, in electron diffraction,
we can have another scenario.

124
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,780
Where instead of the instant electron beam
being in inclined relative to a particular

125
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,470
crystal plane, it is in fact parallel to
many different crystal planes at the same

126
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:33,550
time with the e beam aligned on a low
end axis of the crystalline sample.

127
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,270
And in this case, we obtained strong
diffraction on many different planes,

128
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,740
giving a diffraction pattern
with many bright spots, so

129
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,990
called multibeam electron diffraction.

130
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,921
And that's what we will look
at in the next lecture.
