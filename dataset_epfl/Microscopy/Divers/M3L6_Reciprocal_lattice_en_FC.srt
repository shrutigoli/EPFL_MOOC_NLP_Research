00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:10,105
Welcome to Simi's lectures on Transmission Electron Microscopy for material science.

2
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,740
Continuing on the theme of the basics of electron diffraction,

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,320
in this lecture I will introduce the reciprocal lattice,

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,690
which together with the ebounce sphere,

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,750
will form our framework for understanding,

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,125
and interpreting electron diffraction in the lectures to come.

7
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:28,760
To consider the reciprocal lattice,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,740
I'm going to begin by considering the geometry of the diffraction vector,

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,650
that was introduced in last time.

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,570
From there, I'm going to go on and look at reciprocal lattice vectors,

11
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:47,680
and then the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice a*, b*, and c*.

12
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,230
These form the reciprocal lattice units cell,

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,670
and have certain properties which will be discussed briefly.

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,250
Then finally, going from there,

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,355
to looking at an illustrated schematic of a reciprocal lattice,

16
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:08,155
which will then take further in the next lecture on the ebounce sphere.

17
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,720
As a way towards understanding the reciprocal lattice,

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,245
I'm first going to look at the way vector diagram for proving bragg diffraction,

19
00:01:17,245 --> 00:01:20,055
that I discussed in the last lecture.

20
00:01:20,055 --> 00:01:25,810
If you remember, in this diagram we have an incident way vector_k_i,

21
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,155
where the modulus of a general way vector_k equals 1/λ.

22
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:32,770
As we saw last time,

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,730
this incident way vector_k is scattered at an angle theta,

24
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,835
by the bragg difrracting plane.

25
00:01:38,835 --> 00:01:40,750
Such that in the diffraction pattern,

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,575
we would see two spots;

27
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,340
one for the direct beam,

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,395
corresponding to the incident way vector_k_i,

29
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:51,085
and another spot for the diffracted beam,

30
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,010
corresponding to the diffraction way vector_k_d.

31
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,380
And then joining these two,

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,065
I introduce the diffraction vector_g,

33
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:04,245
where I use g as a shorthand for ghkl.

34
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,305
Now if we look at this diffraction vector_g,

35
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:08,385
we can notice two things;

36
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:14,305
The first thing, we just consider that bragg diffracting plane.

37
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:18,140
It is evident that the direction of the diffraction vector_g,

38
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,135
is perpendicular to the bragg diffracting plane.

39
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:27,035
By the way, so I have a modulus of g is one divided by the plane spacing.

40
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:32,650
Well in this case, g corresponds to a particular diffraction vector.

41
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm not going to introduce a general vector,

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,085
called the reciprocal lattice vector,

43
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:41,775
which will correspond to any possible diffraction vector.

44
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:47,245
So, each plane hkl will have his own reciprocal lattice vector.

45
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:50,860
Evidently, this reciprocal lattice vector

46
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,230
must have the same properties as g.

47
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,595
In other words,

48
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:57,790
the reciprocal lattice vector will be perpendicular to

49
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,990
its plane hkl,

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,090
and will have a length,

51
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,230
which is inversely proportional or the reciprocal of the plane spacing.

52
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,295
To understand reciprocal lattice vectors and where to draw in

53
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:15,185
some reciprocal lattice vectors for hypothetical planes in real space,

54
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:18,050
such as we have in this diagram here,

55
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:26,580
where we have plane d₁ in red and plane d₂ in blue with an origin here.

56
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,120
We're going to define a reciprocal lattice vector for a plane d as d*.

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,075
Now, first considering the plane d₁,

58
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:41,010
we know that the reciprocal lattice vector will be perpendicular to the plane d₁

59
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,780
and since starting at the origin will look like this.

60
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:53,290
Now, instead considering the reciprocal lattice vector for the plane d₂, firstly,

61
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,640
this is going to be perpendicular to that plane d₂,

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,590
so in a different direction to d₁*,

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,870
but also we can see that the plane spacing for d₂

64
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,200
is smaller than the plane spacing for d₁.

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,480
So for d₂* we will obtain a longer reciprocal lattice vector like this.

66
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,980
Just for clarity, I will now redraw these two reciprocal lattice vectors over here,

67
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,160
so we have the d₂*,

68
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,755
perpendicular to the plane d₂ and d₁* perpendicular to the plane d₁.

69
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:32,955
These are just the reciprocal lattice vectors for two planes,

70
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:36,925
where we can continue on considering other planes.

71
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,440
So we shouldn't do that here.

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,805
Here I have again marked on the planes d₁ and

73
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:47,630
d₂ and their reciprocal lattice vectors d₁* and d₂*,

74
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,485
but now going to add another plane d₃.

75
00:04:51,485 --> 00:05:02,100
Now if the plane d₁ has an hkl of (h₁, k₁, l₁),

76
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:11,230
and the plane d₂ has a hk and l of (h₂, k₂, l₂),

77
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:17,765
the fact that the plane d₃ intersects these two planes,

78
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:20,030
one plane is facing from the origin,

79
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,480
means that d₃ will have an hkl

80
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:33,889
of (h₁+h₂ k₁+k₂ l₁+l₂).

81
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,665
I'm now going to mark in the reciprocal lattice vector for this plane d₃.

82
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:43,270
So once again, of course this reciprocal vector will be perpendicular to

83
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:49,275
the plane d₃ and have a length which is inversely proportion to this planes facing.

84
00:05:49,275 --> 00:05:53,845
Its planes facing is even smaller than that of d₁ or d₂,

85
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:58,505
so it's reciprocal lattice vector is even longer.

86
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:04,080
Now, this vector can be marginal on this cleaner diagram over here and there.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,685
Once we done that we can notice something,

88
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:12,865
that the reciprocal lattice vector d₃* equals reciprocal lattice vector

89
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:21,050
d₁* plus the reciprocal lattice vector d₂*.

90
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,540
Therefore, for this relationship of the planes miller indices, we have

91
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:34,460
a vectorial addition that d₃* equals d₁* plus d₂*.

92
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,410
Now we have looked at a general vector for a lattice plane hkl,

93
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,845
we're going to look at the basis vectors that form the reciprocal lattice unit cell.

94
00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:48,440
While the real space lattice has units cells basis vectors: a, b,

95
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,950
and c.

96
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:53,060
In the reciprocal lattice we will also have a unit cell,

97
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,720
and this will be defined by its own basis vectors, a*,

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,255
b*, and c* to find as follows; that a*=d*₁₀₀.

99
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:12,390
Clearly, a* will therefore be perpendicular to the 100 plane.

100
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:20,965
It will also have a length of one divided by the plane spacing of the 100 plane.

101
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:25,880
Similarly, b*=d*₀₁₀, and will have

102
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:32,490
a modulus equal to 1/d₀₁₀ plane spacing.

103
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:36,950
And we have c*=d*₀₀₁, where again,

104
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:44,445
the length of c*=1 divided by spacing 001 plane.

105
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:49,100
These reciprocal lattice basis vectors can then be used

106
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,485
to define the reciprocal lattice vector for a general plane with miller indices hkl.

107
00:07:55,485 --> 00:08:01,005
To understand why, we can consider the following; first of all,

108
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:07,255
we will consider our plane with a miller indices hkl equal to 2_0_0.

109
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:12,700
Now, this 2_0_0 plane is going to be parallel to the 1_0_0 plane.

110
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,980
However, if we instead think about plane spacings,

111
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,830
we know that the 2_0_0 plane will have

112
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,770
a plane spacing which is half that of the 1_0_0 plane.

113
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:32,135
So, d₂₀₀= d₁₀₀/2.

114
00:08:32,135 --> 00:08:36,560
Now considering reciprocal lattice vectors,

115
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
since the planes are parallel,

116
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,170
the reciprocal lattice vector for the two zero zero plane will be parallel to that of

117
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:50,483
the one zero zero plane but it will have two times the length.

118
00:08:50,483 --> 00:08:55,410
So we will have a reciprocal lattice vector, d star two zero

119
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:02,245
zero equal to two times d star one zero zero.

120
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,445
Now as we saw previously,

121
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:10,400
d star one zero zero is defined as the reciprocal lattice basis vector a star.

122
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,620
So, d star two zero zero,

123
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,455
simply equals two times a star.

124
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,725
Generalizing this finding a bit further,

125
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,370
we go to a planes with miller indices of h zero zero,

126
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,885
or alternatively zero k zero.

127
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:30,845
Starting with the h zero zero plane,

128
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:33,345
taking this derivation a bit further,

129
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:35,580
it can be seen that it has

130
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:43,505
a reciprocal lattice vector d star h zero zero equal to h times a star,

131
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:47,030
the first or the reciprocal lattice basis vectors.

132
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:51,940
Going on now to the zero k zero plane, similarly,

133
00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:01,105
that has a reciprocal lattice vector d star zero k zero equal to k times b star,

134
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:04,875
the second of the reciprocal lattice basis vectors.

135
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:10,025
Finally, we can also consider the zero zero l plane.

136
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:13,770
And that in turn, will have a reciprocal lattice vector d star zero zero

137
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:20,215
l equal to l times c star.

138
00:10:20,215 --> 00:10:23,475
Now taking these findings,

139
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:26,050
together with the vectorial addition for

140
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,455
the reciprocal lattice vectors that we saw earlier,

141
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:36,095
for a general plane with miller indices hkl,

142
00:10:36,095 --> 00:10:44,154
we obtain a reciprocal lattice vector d star hkl equals to

143
00:10:44,154 --> 00:10:54,293
d star h zero zero plus d star zero

144
00:10:54,293 --> 00:11:02,840
k zero plus d star zero zero l so equal to h

145
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:13,180
times a star plus k times b star plus l times c star.

146
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,895
Thereby relating this plane's reciprocal lattice vector to

147
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:26,747
the minute indices hkl and the reciprocal lattice basis factors a star b star and c star.

148
00:11:26,747 --> 00:11:29,265
On this slide we will now look in a bit more detail

149
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:32,685
at these properties of the reciprocal lattice basis vectors.

150
00:11:32,685 --> 00:11:39,715
Already, we have established that d star hkl equals ha star plus kb star plus lc star.

151
00:11:39,715 --> 00:11:44,095
We also know that a star is the normal to the plane,

152
00:11:44,095 --> 00:11:49,480
which contains the real lattice axes b and c. And we

153
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,950
will have time to scalar product a star dot b equals zero and a star at c equal zero.

154
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:02,605
Equally b star a equals zero b dot c equals zero

155
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:11,780
and c star dot a equals zero and c star dot b equals zero.

156
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,530
It can also be easily obtained the a dot a star equals 1. b dot b star equals 1.

157
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,955
And c dot c star equals 1.

158
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:23,935
Finally, because a star is perpendicular to b and c,

159
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,740
it's clear that a star is going to be parallel to

160
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,130
b cross c. And with a bit more derivation,

161
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,810
it can be shown that a star equals b cross c divided by V_C,

162
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,625
where V_C is the volume of the unit cell.

163
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:41,236
And similarly, for b star and c star.

164
00:12:41,236 --> 00:12:43,270
The previous slides have introduced the logic

165
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,110
behind the reciprocal lattice vector and discussed

166
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:52,570
the derivation of the reciprocal lattice basis vectors a star, b star, and c star.

167
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,440
However, what's more important in the lectures to come is to understand

168
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:02,305
the reciprocal lattice as something visualized by a series of reciprocal lattice nodes,

169
00:13:02,305 --> 00:13:05,620
where each node represents the reciprocal lattice vector for

170
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,190
a plane hkl in what we will call reciprocal space.

171
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,885
To illustrate this idea,

172
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:15,685
I'm going to show a section of a reciprocal lattice for BCC metal.

173
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:18,635
And then later on, we have the origin 000.

174
00:13:18,635 --> 00:13:26,670
I'm now going to say that the basis vector b star lies along here. And has this length.

175
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,000
And the basis vector c start is here.

176
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,930
Because it's cubic, the lengths of b start and

177
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,375
c star are identical to each other and they have a 90 degree angle between them.

178
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,410
Now considering the systematic absences for BCC,

179
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:46,172
if we go along the vector b star,

180
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:50,080
then the first diffraction plane we can have with a normal parallel to

181
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,490
this vector will be zero to zero plane.

182
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,780
And we know that the 020 plane will have a diffraction vector,

183
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,685
which will be two times the length of b star,

184
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:04,910
since b star corresponds to d star 010.

185
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:11,530
Therefore, we represent the reciprocal lattice vector for that 020 plane as a node here.

186
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,530
Note that rather than drawing a vector to that node,

187
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,795
we just represented it as a spot,

188
00:14:16,795 --> 00:14:20,945
which corresponds to a possible diffraction event.

189
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:25,060
If that is the node for the 020 plane on this axis,

190
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,038
parallel to c star,

191
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:31,825
we will have the 002 node here.

192
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:36,980
Between them, we will have another node for the 011 plane.

193
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,865
We can carry on identifying these different nodes.

194
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:46,360
By symmetry here we will have the zero zero bar two and here the zero bar two zero.

195
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,800
Here, the zero one bar one and so on.

196
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,300
Now for simplicity, this is

197
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,605
just a two dimensional section of what would be a three dimensional lattice.

198
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,560
And we'll see next time how by interacting

199
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,640
this three dimensional lattice with the Ewald sphere,

200
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,233
we can identify which planes

201
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:13,030
are going to refract under certain conditions or for instance,

202
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,795
sample orientation with respect to the electron beam.

203
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:19,360
To summarize, I have introduced the concept of

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,770
the reciprocal lattice vector for a plane hkl.

205
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:29,590
And further seen how this reciprocal lattice vector d star hkl can be described in terms

206
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:38,060
of the reciprocal lattice units own basis vectors a star, b star, and c star.

207
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:45,125
Further to that, by assigning the reciprocal lattice vector for each plane a node,

208
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:49,490
we can consider schematically or

209
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,695
a three dimensional reciprocal lattice made up of a framework of nodes,

210
00:15:54,695 --> 00:15:58,950
where each of these nodes represents a possible diffracting plane.

211
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,395
Finally, as a last note I'll point out that

212
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:07,645
the reciprocal lattice is in fact the Fourier transform of the real lattice.

213
00:16:07,645 --> 00:16:10,820
And this is something that will become important for

214
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,720
understanding the nature of electron diffraction in a few lectures time.
