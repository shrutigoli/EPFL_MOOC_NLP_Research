00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Welcome to CIME’s lectures on Transmission Electron Microscopy for Materials Science and the

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
first of my lectures on dynamical scattering so far in this course

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we have considered electron refraction through the framework of the ewald sphere interacting

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
with the reciprocal lattice. This framework is very successful for identifying which

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
planes to diffract under certain conditions of the orientation of the

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
incident electron beam relative to that of the crystal lattice. It is further

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
very successful for identifying the position of each diffraction spot

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
in a diffraction pattern. If electron scattering was

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
kinematical In other words if we had a single scattering such

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that a beam was diffracted at most one time as it transmits through the sample.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Additionally the intensity of diffract a beam would be proportional to

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
FHKL square, that is proportional to the square of the structure

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
factor of the corresponding deflecting plane.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Indeed an x ray diffraction. This is typically the case

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this is because in x ray diffraction the interaction of an x ray with the crystal lattice is rather

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
weak therefore the probability of having two consecutive scattering events is very

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
small. In contrast in electron diffraction the interaction

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
of the electron beam with the sample is very strong. This is because the transmitting

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
electrons are charged particles and they are scattered by the Coolum field of the atoms

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
in the crystal lattice because of this strong interaction. Typically we have what

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
is called dynamical scattering. This means a strong

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
multiple elastic scattering of the electron beam as it transmits through

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the sample. Essentially the electron beam is re-diffracted

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
in a multi beam ozone access diffraction pattern. This has an important consequence

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
because a refracted beam can be read refracted into other beam.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As a result the different diffracted beams interact with each other and so

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
their intensities are interdependent and we lose the kinematical

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
relationship of diffracted intensity to the structure factor.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Therefore unlike for X-ray diffraction the intensities in the election

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
diffraction pattern are typically not readily interpretable in

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
this lecture. We're going to look at this dynamical scattering to simplify

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
matters. We will study it with the idealized case of to be an electron diffraction and

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
look at the consequences of dynamical scattering on the intensities of both the diffracted beam

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and the direct beam. We're first going to look at this dynamical scattering where the

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
simplified radiogram are being, being scattered by a plane diffracted at the

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
bragg angle as this beam transmits across the sample.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now we know for this to be diffraction geometry and the diffraction pattern

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
we should see two spots one for the direct beam the 0 0 0 and

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for G would diffracting beam, if we

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
put in an incident rate here which was scatter from this black plane. So this

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
ray is at the bragg angle 0B

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
relative to that plane. It is clear if we're high up

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
in the sample. So we had a very very thin sample then the

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
amount of scattering would be very small. Thus if we looked at the

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
diffraction pattern the 0 0 0 spot would

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
be very intense. And in contrast the spot for the

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
diffracted beam would be very weak in intensity as the sovereign

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
becomes thicker. There will be more and more scattering into the refracting beam

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
in the diffraction pattern. This leads to a redistribution of intensity

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
from the direct beam spot to the diffracted beams spot which in turn now

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
becomes much more intense. However if we look at ray diagram

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we can see that this ray for the defective beam is at the perfect bragg angle

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
to be scattered from this plane here. When it does this

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
it will be scattered at the bragg angle and will end up in a re

55
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
parallel to that of the incident beam. Now as the sample

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
gets thicker the probability of this double scattering event will increase. Thus if we looked at

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
this thickness we would again see a redistribution of intensity.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Now from the Beam G back end to the direct beam

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Zero and so the direct beam

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
becomes very strong and the refracting beam becomes very weak.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
As the beams continue to propagate across the sample we can see that this

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
beam is again the perfect bragg angle and so can be

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
redirected yet another time. Giving another way which is

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
parallel to the ray for the distracting beam G. Thus

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
as the sample becomes thicker yet again we can have a redistribution of

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
intensity from that direct beam back into the

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
refracting beam and this scenario can

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
continue as the electron beam propagates across the sampled

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
following the simple schematic for the fraction followed by re-diffraction fraction.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We can imagine that there will be a certain thickness at which the diffraction

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
beam here will have zero intensity and all of the intensity will be back in the direct

72
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
beam. Indeed we will see that this thickness corresponds to

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
sage G

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When I sage G is the extinction distance for this particular defecting plane

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
considering an amplitude of the incident electron beam on the sample equal to

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
1 in this case of two beams scattering

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
under dynamical conditions that has been the rise that the

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
amplitudes of the resulting direct beam and refracting beam leaving

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the sample are given by these expressions here.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well first we have the amplitude of the direct beam

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
and then we have the amplitude of the deflected beam

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
in these expressions.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I is simply the imaginary number T is the

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
specimen thickness and S is the excitation error that was

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
introduced in the last lecture on deviation from the bragge condition.

86
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Finally we have this parameter sage G. Where sage G is the extinction distance for the

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
reflection where V0 is the volume of

88
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the unit so 0 B is the bragg angle

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
lambda is the wavelength of the electron and

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
FG is the structure factor for the defrocking plane. I know that in the

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
idealized case where there is no absorption of the electron beam in the sample

92
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
then F G is a real number.

93
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
However if you want to treat absorption this can be modeled by introducing an

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
imaginary component into F G and also into f 0. The

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
structure factor for the 0 0 0. These expressions given here have been derived by a

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
number of different ways. In the literature perhaps the most popular of those ways

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
is the block wave theory as first proposed by beater

98
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
this block wave approach involves finding the solution of the Schrödinger equation for

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
an electron wave moving in the periodic potential of the crystal lattice.

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The solution results in wave functions known as block waves.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
These block waves or plane waves which propagate across the sample

102
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
parallel to the diffraction Crystal plane and they have amplitudes which are motivated

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
by the periodic lattice potential unlike the so-called Howi wheel and

104
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
equations the block wave approach is fully scaleable to many beams.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So for M defecting beams there are M block waves.

106
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Each of these block waves has m components one for each of the resulting deflecting

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
beam. Thus in the two in case there are two block waves.

108
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now if we consider an incident electron beam at the

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
bragg angle relative to this crystal plane so far we have only considered

110
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
one diffraction wave vector. However in the block wave approach we now

111
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
consider that there are two block waves which propagate across the sample and each

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
block wave has a way vector component corresponding to the direct beam.

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And that affected beam this here for instance we have the wave vector

114
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
components from block wave one.

115
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So here's the component from Brockway one for the direct beam

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and here the defrocking bean.

117
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And then we also draw on corresponding wave vectors for the second block wave.

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which again have components for the direct beam

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and for the distracting beam so after the block waves

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
have propagated across the sample the components for the direct beam would add up to give

121
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
the direct beam amplitude and the components for that refracting being would add up to give the amplitude of

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
the distracting beam following Hashimoto.

123
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
These block waves can be schematically illustrated as follows. So here is block wave 1

124
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
and here is block wave 2. In this

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
illustration we're looking at a simple cubic lattice with these being the bragge

126
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
reflecting planes.

127
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
As explained in the last slide each of these block waves has components

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
corresponding to the direct and diffracted beams

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
with this curve representing the amplitude of block wave one we can see that this

130
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
amplitude is centered in between the atomic planes.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
In contrast the amplitude of block wave 2 is centered on the atomic

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
planes as a result of being centered on the atomic

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
nuclei. This block wave 2 experience has a stronger negative

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
potential as it propagates through the crystal lattice the stronger

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
potential accelerates as block wave to more. Compared to block wave 1

136
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
decreasing its wavelength or equally increasing its wave

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
vector relative to block wave 1 as a result of phase difference

138
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
develops between block wave 1 and block wave 2 as they propagate across the crystal

139
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
lattice a result of this phase difference is that there is a beating between the two block waves

140
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
as they propagate across the crystal lattice. And it is this beating that gives result to the

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
thickness dependence in the signed term of the amplitude of the resulting

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
deflecting beam in the case where we assume that there is no

143
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
absorption when the excitation area s equals zero. In other words we're in the

144
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
exact Bragg condition than the amplitudes of the two block waves are identical.

145
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
However if we leave this perfect Bragg condition by tilting slightly away from it

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
creating either a positive or negative excitation error then the amplitude of the

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
two block waves cease to be equal. And this gives rise to the averages of the

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
resulting direct and interacting beams being also in function of the excitation area

149
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
S finally considering absorption

150
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
the block wave to being centered on the atomic nuclei is

151
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
absorbed more strongly than the block wave one. And this gives rise to so-called

152
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
anomalous absorption effects in the intensities of the diffracted and direct

153
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
beam. It also connects to channeling effects which you might come

154
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
across in chemical analysis returning to these

155
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
expressions for the amplitudes of the direct beam and the diffracted beam.

156
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We can easily determine the intensity of the diffracted beam by calculating the

157
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
square of the modalists of sage G. Since

158
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
this term here is a phase term.

159
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It just contributes a factor of 1 to the intensity and then the intensity of the refracted

160
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
beam is simply going to be

161
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
1/1 + G2S2 X  sin2? T v(1/(G )  )2  + S2

162
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
1/1 + G2S2 X  sin2? T v(1/(G )  )2  + S2

163
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
1/1 + G2S2 X  sin2? T v(1/(G )  )2  + S2

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
1/1 + G2S2 X  sin2? T v(1/(G )  )2  + S2

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So we have some science squared modulation in function or both thickness and the

166
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
excitation error s. If you also calculate the intensity

167
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
of the direct beam which can simply be

168
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
done by multiplying this term here by complex conjugate

169
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
you find that this intensity equals 1 minus

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
IG. In other words we have conservation of intensity with the incident

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
amplitude of one the incidence intensity is one and this intensity is

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
conserved into the two beams such that they are complementary to each

173
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
other having in the last lecture looked at the kinematical case

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
or the intensity of a defective beam as a function of the

175
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
excitation era as we're now going to use this expression to look at that

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
intensity in the dynamical case. So here this intensity has been

177
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
modeled using an extinction distance of 100 nanometers for

178
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
various specimen thicknesses. T looking first of this curve

179
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
for fatigue was 150 nanometers. We can see that there are oscillations in

180
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
intensity inside an envelope where now this envelope

181
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
corresponds to 1 over 1 plus sage

182
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
G squared X squired, and otherwise this envelope does not

183
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
depend on thickness it only depends on the excitation era and the

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
extinction distance what does depend on thickness is the

185
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
frequency of these modulations. We can see as we go through a thicker sample

186
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
the moderations go to smaller excitation areas. S

187
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
similarly to the kinematical case when as equals zero we

188
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
can see that the intensity and the defective beam is simply given by IGY equals

189
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
sin squared of Pi t over

190
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
sage G. And these posts here I have specifically chosen

191
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
thicknesses are the thickness T equals

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sage G times 2 and plus 1 divided by 2 n where n is an

193
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
integer. Because in this case when s equals zero the intensity in the

194
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
diffract beam equals 1 that we see here and here.

195
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
However we can ask ourselves what happens when we deviate from this nice condition.

196
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's what I've done on this slide here I've kept the T 150 nanometers curve.

197
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Whereas here I plotted the curve with for T equals 220 nanometers.

198
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Now we can see there's a marked effect on the intensity as equal zero

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
intensity is no longer a maximum. Indeed there is a dip in intensity

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
as equals zero. Now what will happen if we reduce

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
T further to 200 nanometers when T will become an integer

202
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
multiple of the extinction distance. We look at that on this light. Now we

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
have T equals n times sage G where n is an integer. In this

204
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
case when s equals zero here we now take the sign square of pi

205
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
times n which will be 0.

206
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Therefore the intensity in the deflecting beam is zero. Indeed looking at this

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
T because 200 nanometers curve we can see that that S equals

208
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
zero. There is no intensity in the diffracted beam. So all the

209
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
intensity would now be in the direct beam with zero in the diffracted beam. For

210
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
this thickness at the exact bragg condition. To summarize on this

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
lecture I have introduced dynamical scattering as being the multiple elastic scattering of

212
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
the electron beam as it transmits through the sample in transmission

213
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
electron microscopy. This is the typical case because the interactions of the electron beam with

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
the sample are very strong. In the tubing condition this

215
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
can be interpreted in a rather simple way as a diffraction and then read or fraction

216
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
of an electron beam as it propagates across the sample. And depending on the number of

217
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
diffraction events there is a moderation in the intensity of the diffracted and

218
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
direct beams as a result of this further we have looked at the full expressions for the

219
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
intensity of the direct and diffracted beings which are a simple function of the

220
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
specimen thickness t the excitation area s and the extinction distance

221
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
sage G. And then we have looked to the consequence of these expressions

222
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
on these curves of intensity versus excitation

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
era. I know that in the literature these curves are often referred to as

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
rooking curves. This expression comes from a

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
technique known as rooking electron diffraction where the incident electron

226
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
beam is tilted or rocked from side to side.

227
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And as it changes an angle relative to the sample you're able to measure the

228
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
intensity of a beam at different excitation areas as having

229
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
introduced dynamical scattering in this lecture. And the next lecture we're going to look at another

230
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
dynamical effect in imaging mode in the formation of thickness fringes and

231
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Bright field and dark field images.
