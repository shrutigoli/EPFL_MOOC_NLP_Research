00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,500
Welcome to Seemings lectures on transmission electron microscopy for material science.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,090
In the last two lectures,

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,240
we have looked at two effects of dynamical scattering on

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,661
the contrast scene and Bright-field and Dark-field imaging of crystalline samples,

5
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:22,740
what might be known as diffraction contrast imaging effects.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,120
In this lecture, we're instead going to look at an effect of

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,450
dynamical scattering on diffraction pattern formation,

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,698
with a particular case known as double diffraction,

9
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:35,390
where the multiple elastic scattering of

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,300
the beam as it propagates across the sample leads to

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,463
the formation of diffraction spots for crystal planes which are kinematically forbidden.

12
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:47,160
We should look at double diffraction in what is probably

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,185
the most common and hence best known case,

14
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:55,140
that are silicon aligned on a one one zero zone axis.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,310
Silicon has the diamond structure and for this structure,

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,190
if you consider the family of zero zero two planes,

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:12,130
they have a structure factor say F zero zero two, which equals zero.

18
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,870
In other words, if scattering was kinematical,

19
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,790
such planes would not be visible at diffraction spots in a diffraction pattern.

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:23,160
They are also known as forbidden planes

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:31,300
whose diffraction spots are systematic absences.

22
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,850
So, if we made a kinematic simulation of

23
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:39,247
diffraction pattern of silicon on this one one zero zone axis,

24
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:41,000
it would look like this;

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,527
where by applying the vice zonal HU plus KV plus LW equals zero,

26
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:50,445
we could index the diffraction pattern as follows.

27
00:01:50,445 --> 00:01:53,195
In the center, we of course have the direct beam

28
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:58,860
zero zero zero and it's surrounded by four one one one type planes,

29
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,008
which we could for instance index as one bar one one here.

30
00:02:04,008 --> 00:02:07,810
One bar one bar one here.

31
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,240
Bar one one bar one here.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,192
And finally, bar one one one here.

33
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:20,085
Looking at this plane here,

34
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:23,035
we can see that by adding these two diffraction vectors,

35
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:27,775
it corresponds to an index of two bar two zero.

36
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,740
And therefore this one here is,

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,475
bar two two zero.

38
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:36,285
And then looking along this axis we see a spot

39
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:40,480
here which corresponds to the zero zero four plane.

40
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,355
And then the zero zero bar four here.

41
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:49,995
What's noticeable is that there's no diffraction spot here for the zero zero two,

42
00:02:49,995 --> 00:02:52,164
or here for the zero zero bar two,

43
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:56,240
because they are systematic absences,

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,550
they are kinematically forbidden.

45
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,680
Whereas this simulation is kinematical,

46
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,890
we know that experimentally,

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,720
when on a zone axis we have

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,390
strong dynamical scattering as the case for this real diffraction pattern here.

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,261
Comparing this experimental case to the simulation,

50
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:17,890
one thing stands out,

51
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:26,175
that in the experimental case we see intensity for these two forbidden planes.

52
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:31,877
So we have a diffraction spot for the zero zero three and the zero zero bar two.

53
00:03:31,877 --> 00:03:35,476
We will now look at why that is.

54
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,340
We know that dynamical scattering

55
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,900
can lead to diffraction followed by re-diffraction of a beam.

56
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,825
This can lead to addition of diffraction vectors,

57
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:49,745
G vectors, as one beam scatters into another beam.

58
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,697
We can see that as follows,

59
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:58,140
if we look at our simulation we have a diffraction vector G one bar one one

60
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:05,342
here and here we have G bar one one.

61
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:10,080
Dynamically, we can have

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,080
scattering on this G vector followed by scattering on this G vector.

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,530
In other words, the diffracted beam for this G vector acts as

64
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,142
the direct beam for a subsequent scattering event.

65
00:04:23,142 --> 00:04:29,930
When this happens, we can add this diffraction vector to this diffraction vector,

66
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:42,410
giving a diffraction spot here in the zero zero two plain location.

67
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:46,430
Equally, we could have scattering to this reflection here,

68
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,025
followed by scattering to that reflection there,

69
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:55,235
giving a spot in a zero zero bar two location.

70
00:04:55,235 --> 00:05:00,170
This is known as double diffraction and can be

71
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,330
interpreted in terms of the addition of diffraction vectors.

72
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,345
In this case, we have G bar one one one,

73
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:15,890
plus G one bar one one,

74
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:23,095
which equals zero zero two.

75
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:26,810
This dynamical scattering effect is so strong,

76
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,290
that for a typical high tension of two or three hundred kilovolts,

77
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,220
you would need a sample just a few nanometers thick to avoid having

78
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,891
intensity at these systematic absences.

79
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,935
We're now going to consider in more detail,

80
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:45,820
the formation mechanism for this double diffraction effect

81
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,795
by looking at it within the Ewald sphere reciprocal lattice framework.

82
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:55,390
Here we have a schematic illustration of the reciprocal lattice of

83
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,745
silicon on this one one zero zone axis looking in a pseudo three dimensional projection.

84
00:06:01,745 --> 00:06:06,670
These lines represent the elongated form of the reciprocal lattice rods.

85
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,910
Because we are aligned on the zone axis,

86
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,795
this zero order Laue zone,

87
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:15,040
is perpendicular to the incident electron beam.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:22,475
Therefore, we can draw the wave vector for that incident beam like this.

89
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:28,270
Associated with this incident beam is of course the Ewald sphere,

90
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,020
which will intersect these different reciprocal lattice rods.

91
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,240
To represent this intersection,

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,400
I will draw arcs which correspond to different circumferences on the Ewald sphere,

93
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,299
intersecting different pairs of reflections.

94
00:06:44,299 --> 00:06:55,665
So one here, here, and here.

95
00:06:55,665 --> 00:07:00,230
So giving a diagram that looks like this.

96
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,980
Because these planes are parallel to the incident electron beam,

97
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,640
the Ewald sphere does not intersect at the center of the reciprocal lattice rods

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,080
but instead at a negative excitation error.

99
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:20,010
Therefore, if we consider this one bar one one plane here,

100
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,620
the Ewald sphere intersects somewhere there.

101
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,573
Thus considering that for this illustration,

102
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:31,170
the center of the Ewald sphere is somewhere above the slide;

103
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,198
the diffracted beam wave vector for this plane,

104
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:37,781
and coming down as follows,

105
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:40,250
giving a figure like this.

106
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,395
In double diffraction, this diffracted beam wave vector KD,

107
00:07:44,395 --> 00:07:50,840
now acts as the direct beam for subsequent scattering events.

108
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,335
To represent this, we first center

109
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:59,967
a new reciprocal lattice at the end of this wave vector here.

110
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,208
So it's zero zero zero here.

111
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:08,225
Over here, we will have a reciprocal lattice node

112
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:14,755
for a zero zero four plane and the zero zero bar four here,

113
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:18,040
and then the one one one plane's here,

114
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,240
in line with the original zero zero zero;

115
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,830
somewhere here,

116
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:35,535
here, and here,

117
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:40,847
giving an illustration that looks like this.

118
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,705
As well as marking in a new reciprocal lattice,

119
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:46,450
we also have to mark in a new Ewald sphere,

120
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,325
associated with this wave vector here.

121
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:55,640
Because this wave vector is inclined related to the incident electron beam,

122
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,716
this Ewald sphere will be tilted compared to the original Ewald sphere.

123
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,710
I now draw in arcs for the intersection of

124
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:12,932
this new Ewald sphere with its reciprocal lattice,

125
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:20,230
giving a final diagram which looks like this.

126
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,470
We can see that in the projected electron diffraction pattern,

127
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,750
the intersection of this new Ewald sphere with this reciprocal lattice road here,

128
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,320
will give a diffraction spot in the zero zero two plane location.

129
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,195
Equally, if we consider re-diffraction from this bar one bar one plane here,

130
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:44,961
we would end up with a reciprocal lattice road here,

131
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:52,000
corresponding to the zero zero bar two plane location

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,576
in the electron diffraction pattern.

133
00:09:54,576 --> 00:10:00,320
We can think of this as a convolution of the reciprocal lattice with itself.

134
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,130
So here, this new reciprocal lattice was convoluted with

135
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,220
a reciprocal lattice node of the original reciprocal lattice.

136
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,180
However, it must be noted,

137
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,845
that in reciprocal space,

138
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,260
this new reciprocal lattice is at

139
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,526
a negative excitation error compared to the original reciprocal lattice.

140
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:22,959
In other words, it's higher up.

141
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,080
We're now going to look at a way that we can experimentally

142
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,630
prove that the diffraction spots for

143
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,725
these forbidden planes are the result of dynamical scattering.

144
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,640
If you look at the diffraction pattern,

145
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,270
we know that each spot is associated with a plane which

146
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,084
is perpendicular to its diffraction vector.

147
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:45,575
So for this spot here,

148
00:10:45,575 --> 00:10:48,660
we could mark in a plane like this,

149
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,709
and for this one here, a plane here,

150
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,500
and then planes for this spot here.

151
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:09,550
And then this one here, and

152
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:17,075
this plane here, and another here.

153
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:22,391
And you could continue for all the different spots in the diffraction pattern.

154
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,970
Now we know in the zone access geometry in the zero or the Laue zone,

155
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:33,905
all these planes are parallel to the incident electron beam.

156
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:38,690
Then what we're going to do is tilt the sample on

157
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:46,520
this axis here as follows.

158
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,490
If we look down that tilt axis at the zero,

159
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:56,390
the Laue zone, we will see something like this.

160
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,350
Where this is looking down the tilt axis where we would

161
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,997
see reciprocal latticed rods both for the 000,

162
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:11,295
but also these other planes here.

163
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:17,200
And these are reciprocal lattice rods for planes out here or out here.

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,865
Being in zone access orientation,

165
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:24,402
the ethosphere is tangential with the zero or the Laue zone,

166
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:29,880
so when intersect, the reciprocal lattice rods as follows.

167
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,625
When we now tilt around this axis,

168
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:43,190
we even tilt this zero or the Laue zone around this point here as follows.

169
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,860
We can see that if we tilt far enough,

170
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,950
the ethosphere no longer intersects the reciprocal lattice rods of these planes.

171
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:03,870
However, the ethosphere does still intersect the planes on the axis of rotation.

172
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:10,525
That's because these planes remain parallel to the incident electron beam.

173
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:13,550
Doing this is called exciting a systematic row.

174
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,855
That's because in the diffraction pattern,

175
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:18,515
we will obtain something like this.

176
00:13:18,515 --> 00:13:23,290
The direct beam in the center,

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,425
then a spot for a plain that we will call G,

178
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,680
then another spot the 2G,

179
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,935
the plane which is parallel to the plane for G but has half its spacing,

180
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:44,616
and then 3G and so on,

181
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:51,980
and their negative counterparts.

182
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,330
However, there should be very little intensity in

183
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,750
the other diffraction spots because it is only these planes

184
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,270
which are parallel to the incident electron beam.

185
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:12,250
Now, in this case if we say G equals 002,

186
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,742
then by exciting this systematic row,

187
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,755
we will cut out

188
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:25,035
the 111 planes which are responsible for its formation by double diffraction.

189
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:28,360
Therefore, as we tilt to excite the systematic row,

190
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,310
we should see G and minus G disappear.

191
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,175
And also if we included them on the diffraction pattern,

192
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,857
then 3G and minus 3G.

193
00:14:38,857 --> 00:14:42,136
We should be left only with 2G and minus 2G

194
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:48,225
corresponding to the 004 and 00 bar 4 planes respectively.

195
00:14:48,225 --> 00:14:53,065
To show you this, we look at a video of tilting in this way.

196
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:56,110
At the beginning, we were aligned precisely on

197
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:03,045
the 110 zone axis with the 002 and 00 bar 2 planes strongly excited.

198
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:07,600
Now, we start tilting around this axis.

199
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,380
And as we do this,

200
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:17,170
we will see intensities changes the ethosphere cast planes at different excitation areas.

201
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,785
And then gradually, we will see these 002 planes

202
00:15:22,785 --> 00:15:28,800
disappear when the 111 reflections are completely de-excited.

203
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,845
So then if they've already disappeared, they come back again.

204
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:36,780
And then now as we tilt even further to excite the systematic row very precisely,

205
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,320
the 002 planes have completely

206
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,900
disappeared thus proving that they were a consequence of double diffraction.

207
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,260
To summarize, in this lecture we have looked at

208
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,020
double diffraction which is a particular case of

209
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,340
dynamical scattering that can give rise to the appearance

210
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:02,465
of diffraction spots for kinematically forbidden crystal planes.

211
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:04,120
To look at this,

212
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:11,000
I have used the case of silicon aligned on a 110 type of zone axis.

213
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,740
Where in the experimental diffraction pattern,

214
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,065
we see intensity for forbidden planes 002 and 00 bar 2.

215
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:25,315
We have interpreted this in terms of a diffracted beam from

216
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:31,270
first scattering event that acts as the direct beam for new scattering events.

217
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,800
For instance in the case of silicon,

218
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,220
we can look at scattering on this G vector to this 111 type plane,

219
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,130
combined with scattering on this G vector adding

220
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,905
together to give scattering to this 002 diffraction spot location.

221
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:53,248
Looking at this in more detail,

222
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:57,485
we can conceive it as an additional reciprocal lattice and

223
00:16:57,485 --> 00:17:04,880
ethosphere centered at the end of a way vector for an initial diffracted beam.

224
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,320
Well, here I have demonstrated

225
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,340
double diffraction for the case of scattering across a single crystal.

226
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,980
Double diffraction can also occur when there is scattering from

227
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,915
one crystal lattice into and across another crystal lattice.

228
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,190
In the second case,

229
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,315
it can lead to the formation of what are known as satellites spots which

230
00:17:27,315 --> 00:17:32,445
surround the diffraction spots from the initial crystal lattice.

231
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:38,270
It can further be interpreted via the same ethosphere reciprocal lattice construction,

232
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,520
where the second reciprocal lattice would instead correspond to

233
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,940
the reciprocal lattice of the second phase in the sample.

234
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,580
This brings me to the end of my basic discussion of

235
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,380
dynamical scattering effects for a parallel incident illumination.

236
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,835
If we instead focus the beam to a spot on the sample,

237
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:05,335
the illumination is convergent.

238
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,500
If you then look at the diffraction pattern,

239
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,315
you'll see what's called a convergent beam electron diffraction pattern or CBED pattern.

240
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:18,730
These patterns can show very strong contrasts from dynamical scattering.

241
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,439
And one we've covered so far,

242
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:28,240
this contrast can be highly interpretable to obtain useful information about your sample.

243
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,930
Returning to the case of a parallel incident illumination,

244
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:37,150
there again there can be another kind of multiple scattering,

245
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,380
this time where the coherent elastic scattering that we have considered so

246
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,435
far is preceded by an incoherent scattering event.

247
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:51,970
The combination of this incoherent scattering followed by coherent elastic scattering,

248
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:57,550
can produce bright and dark lines in a selected area diffraction pattern.

249
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,210
These Kikuchi lines can be very useful for precisely

250
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,800
aligning a sample to a specific diffraction condition.

251
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,365
However, these two are a subject for another time.

252
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:14,140
Now that we have created the basics for the theory of electron diffraction,

253
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:19,420
and also seeing some examples of the effects of diffraction on time image contrast,

254
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,286
we will now go into another important category of imaging contrast in TEM,

255
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:27,190
namely face contrast imaging.

256
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,160
And for this I hand over to Cecil.

257
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,892
Thank you Duncan. Face contrast that is

258
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:37,850
from the interference of different elastically scattered beams,

259
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,780
and it's the basis for high resolution TEM also called atomic resolution imaging.

260
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:48,420
We will go through the theory of face contrast in the coming lectures.
