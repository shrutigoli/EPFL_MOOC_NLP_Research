1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Do you remember how to
draw the image produced by

2
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,788
a thin convergent lens?

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,075
Try to reproduce this figure on
a piece of paper and to draw

4
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:17,666
the image of this object,
so this green thing there would

5
00:00:17,762 --> 00:00:24,024
be your object, you have your lens,
the focal points of the lens

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:32,990
F and F prime, and I want to obtain
the image of this object called

7
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:36,145
AB by the lens.

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,813
Okay, it's a very simple rule that
you will have to use all the time

9
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:47,230
and we will use it a lot when
we interpret images and diffraction

10
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:49,614
pattern in the microscope.

11
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,143
There are two rules.

12
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:56,868
The first one is, if I take a ray of
light that is coming out of

13
00:00:56,978 --> 00:01:03,228
my object, if this ray passes
through the central part

14
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:08,725
of the lens, then it will
be undeflected, so if it goes

15
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:13,516
there it will be deflected, but not
if it goes through the center of

16
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:17,522
the lens, so I can draw a first ray

17
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:25,067
this one that comes from the B point
of the object and obviously my image

18
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:28,186
will have to be
somewhere on that line.

19
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:33,071
But with only one line I don't
have the place where to find B.

20
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,731
I can do a second ray,
by taking a ray

21
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:43,251
that is now entering the lens
parallel to the optical axis.

22
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,925
If I do so, the ray will be
deflected exactly through

23
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:57,160
the focal point, I can then
continue it, and at one point

24
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:05,318
it will cross the first ray, so now
I do have a place where I know

25
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:08,250
I have my B point.

26
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:13,168
I know that the image of A
will be on the same height

27
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:19,527
but on the optical axis, so I know
exactly how to draw my image.

28
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:26,913
It's like this, there, I have
A prime and B prime.

29
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:32,248
Okay, for your assignment you
will have to do a few more of

30
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,100
this drawing and this is a language
that you really need to be fluent in

31
00:02:37,196 --> 00:02:40,196
to follow the lecture.
