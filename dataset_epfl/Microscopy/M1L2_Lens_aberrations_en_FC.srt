00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to CIME's lecture

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,279
on Transmission Electron Microscopy
for Material Science.

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:15,509
In this video, we will review the main
aberrations that are relevant

4
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:20,468
to understand the imaging properties
of a transmission electron microscope.

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,493
You remember, from the last lecture,

6
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:29,656
we had this graph that shows you
and tells you that the microscope

7
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,974
has its resolution limited
by aberrations.

8
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:38,241
Actually, the most important one
is the spherical aberration,

9
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,760
and we will start with it.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,058
So, spherical aberration, you probably
remember it from your lecture in optics.

11
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:51,308
First of all, it is characterized
by its coefficient, Cs,

12
00:00:51,508 --> 00:00:52,944
given in millimeter.

13
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:59,154
Then, it tells us that rays that enter
a lens away from the optical axis

14
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:01,257
are more focused.

15
00:01:01,457 --> 00:01:03,933
That's the case for positive Cs.

16
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,326
How does it look if we try to draw
this information?

17
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:11,414
We have, here, a lens,

18
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:15,657
and we will take some rays
that will enter the lens

19
00:01:15,857 --> 00:01:19,038
all parallel to the optical axis.

20
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,324
There we have it.

21
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:26,086
Normally, such rays should be focused
to the focal point of the objective lens.

22
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:28,266
So, something like this,

23
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:31,837
and all rays  coming through
the same point

24
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:39,043
But now, we say that rays that enter
the lens away from the optical axis

25
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:40,389
are more focused.

26
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:42,432
So this one is further away.

27
00:01:42,632 --> 00:01:45,014
So the lens will be stronger,

28
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,530
and the ray will be more deviated.

29
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,226
That continues holding
for the next rays,

30
00:01:51,426 --> 00:01:53,932
which will be even more deviated.

31
00:01:54,132 --> 00:01:58,473
Then, we should draw this
in a symmetrical manner,

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,497
and finishing the drawing,
obtain something like this.

33
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:09,100
That's what you're used to in optics.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,956
But now, generally, in a transmission
microscope,

35
00:02:13,156 --> 00:02:17,223
we are working with very small
specimen parts.

36
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:23,067
So you can consider that everything
comes from the same place on the specimen.

37
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:26,486
What is the effect, now, if we take
a point object?

38
00:02:26,686 --> 00:02:31,122
Let's take the same setup,
but our object is now a point.

39
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:35,362
I first need to find a place
where the image will be formed.

40
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:40,497
For this, I need to imagin
an extended object

41
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:43,306
and draw its image by the lens.

42
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:49,933
This gives me the position
of the image

43
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,693
at that point on the optical axis.

44
00:02:52,893 --> 00:02:56,918
That's where the image of this point
object should be.

45
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:06,042
Now, a point object will emit rays

46
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:08,854
in different directions that will hit
the lens.

47
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:17,241
Those rays will be focused by the lens
to the object point.

48
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,273
The problem is that rays that are
further away from the optical axis

49
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,478
will see a stronger lens

50
00:03:25,678 --> 00:03:28,734
and be focused closer to the lens.

51
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:34,473
It is symmetrical and is even
worse for the further rays.

52
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:40,898
You see that the image of a point
is not a point anymore, but a disk.

53
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,876
Somewhere on the optical axis,

54
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:48,632
I have the place where my disk
has the smallest possible size.

55
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,436
It's the disk of least confusion.

56
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,174
This will blur the image

57
00:03:54,374 --> 00:03:58,682
and, eventually, make some kind
of strange effect,

58
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:01,952
like the one we will see
on the next slide,

59
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,792
which shows a real electron
microscopy picture.

60
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:10,143
Typically, the Cs will make 2 effects.

61
00:04:10,343 --> 00:04:14,612
On one side, it is able to create
ghost images

62
00:04:14,812 --> 00:04:17,469
of strongly defracting specimen.

63
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:22,901
You see, there, that you have the actual
image of the small crystal

64
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:29,227
but also like a bright image on each side,
left and right.

65
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:31,778
That is what we call ghost image,

66
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,978
and this can be obtained due to the Cs.

67
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:38,875
It will also blur interfaces.

68
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:43,040
Here we have a defects in a crystal

69
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,737
which should be only extending
over 1 atomic layer

70
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,415
in this high resolution image,

71
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,879
but if you look at it you have the feeling

72
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,166
that it's extending over 4 or more
atomic layers.

73
00:04:56,366 --> 00:05:01,329
These 2 effects are called delocalisation.

74
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:08,693
You will see this one in the lecture about
imaging with defraction contrast,

75
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:13,111
and this one will be discussed
in the lecture about phase contrast.

76
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:16,125
The next aberration I want to discuss

77
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:19,588
is the so-called chromatic aberration.

78
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:22,031
Again, probably you know it.

79
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:27,449
It is characterized by its coefficient, Cc,
given in millimeters.

80
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:33,454
In that case, it tells us that electrons
at lower energy,

81
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:38,678
or longer wavelength, will be more
focused by the lens.

82
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:42,208
Again, let us try to draw this.

83
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,366
I have there my lens,

84
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:49,024
and I will start this time with a simple
point object

85
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,875
and a the focal points.

86
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:54,633
Again, I should have the image
of that point

87
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:58,030
at the same place than I had before.

88
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,809
Now, I will consider electrons which have
the nominal energy of the electron beam,

89
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:08,009
and I will draw them in blue.

90
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:13,623
They will enter the lens
all with different angles,

91
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:18,020
and I will neglect the spherical aberration.

92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,151
So all those rays will be focused to the same
point, properly, like it should be

93
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,558
by a perfect lens.

94
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:30,153
Finishing the drawing gives me
the following:

95
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:34,670
a nice point image of a nice point
object.

96
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,339
Now, I also have electrons
with lower energy.

97
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,365
I will draw them in red.

98
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:49,524
They will follow the same paths between
the objects and the lens,

99
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:57,091
but then we say that electrons at lower
energy are more focused.

100
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:02,895
So those ones will see a stronger lens.

101
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,736
The same for the one which are there,

102
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:13,303
and the one which is at that point
will also see a stronger lens.

103
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:17,704
Again, I neglect the spherical aberration,

104
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:24,172
which means that, still, my point object
gives me a point image.

105
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,924
Altogether,

106
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:32,440
I will, again, end up with a blurred
image.

107
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,501
This also results in a disk
of least confusion

108
00:07:36,701 --> 00:07:39,021
and, therefore, blurring of the image.

109
00:07:39,221 --> 00:07:41,987
Fortunately, the chromatic aberration

110
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:45,827
is less important than the spherical
aberration

111
00:07:46,027 --> 00:07:47,954
for several reasons.

112
00:07:48,154 --> 00:07:49,441
First of all,

113
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,890
the small energy spread of the probe,

114
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,449
especially if you use a special
monochromator

115
00:07:55,649 --> 00:08:00,633
that will even reduce the energy spread
of the electrons coming out of the gun,

116
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:03,401
will reduce the impact.

117
00:08:03,601 --> 00:08:05,696
If you use a thin specimen,

118
00:08:05,896 --> 00:08:10,036
your electron beam will not interact
too much with the specimen.

119
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:15,512
So the electrons will not have too many
events that will lead to energy loss,

120
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,684
and they will keep the nominal energy
of the beam.

121
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:22,121
So, a thin specimen will also reduce
the impact.

122
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:25,536
Like for spherical aberration,

123
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:31,296
for chromatic aberration, it is in principle
possible to develop correctors,

124
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:34,651
but they are only developed
in very few labs.

125
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:39,536
It is still a research area, while
spherical aberration correction

126
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,680
exists nowadays on commercial
instruments.

127
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,550
It is important to consider it
at very low tension

128
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,119
but also if you want to analyze
the energy loss by the electrons.

129
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:57,942
This will be part of a later module.

130
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:01,760
A short historical note on these
aberrations,

131
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,223
chromatic aberration and spherical
aberration.

132
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:11,089
Actually, they were recognized
to be very important

133
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,954
in limiting the resolution of the TEM,
already in the 30's

134
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:18,764
by Otto Scherzer.

135
00:09:18,964 --> 00:09:23,458
If you look at this paper, published
in 1936,

136
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,224
what Otto Scherzer tells us

137
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:30,123
is that you cannot avoid spherical
and chromatic aberrations

138
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:32,977
for lenses with cylindrical symmetry.

139
00:09:33,177 --> 00:09:37,626
They will limit the resolution
of the microscope.

140
00:09:38,847 --> 00:09:43,308
The same Otto Scherzer proposed,
only 11 years later,

141
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:45,768
some solution for this.

142
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:50,073
One of them is to break
the cylindrical symmetry.

143
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:56,212
Building such a piece of equipment
was so challenging and so difficult

144
00:09:56,412 --> 00:10:03,815
that the 1st successful correction
of a TEM came only in 1997.

145
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:08,180
So now we remain with only 1 aberration,

146
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,089
and this one has a slightly different
position.

147
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,921
It is called astigmatism.

148
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:17,861
Astigmatism is when the focal length

149
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:22,942
is not the same for 2 perpendicular
directions of the lens.

150
00:10:23,142 --> 00:10:27,640
Therefore, we need to represent
astigmatism in a 3-D drawing,

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
which will make the drawing a little
bit more challenging.

152
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,485
Astigmatism affects all electron lenses

153
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:37,774
because of inhomogeneities
in the material or machining,

154
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:41,997
but also because of dust particles
that escape the specimen,

155
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:44,835
contamination on aperture or pole pieces,

156
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:49,437
or even because of the specimen itself,
if it is magnetic.

157
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,926
But I have very good news.

158
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:54,711
It's that astigmatism can be corrected.

159
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:58,499
That is even one of the important steps
that you are doing

160
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,003
when aligning a transmission microscope.

161
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,535
Let us look at it in more detail.

162
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:09,368
First of all, I have my 3 dimensional
lens

163
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:15,512
with the vertical direction
and 1 horizontal direction.

164
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:18,297
So I really have to enter the 3rd
dimension.

165
00:11:18,497 --> 00:11:20,659
This is the optical axis.

166
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:25,160
I will, again, take a point object,

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,714
which has, as an image,
a point image.

168
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:35,912
Let's start with imaging
that we have there.

169
00:11:37,183 --> 00:11:43,672
The image obtained when I have rays

170
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:48,097
that enter the lens on the vertical axis.

171
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:51,662
Now, we say that the focal length

172
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:55,278
is not the same for 2 perpendicular
directions.

173
00:11:55,478 --> 00:12:01,703
If I take rays that enter the lens
on this perpendicular direction,

174
00:12:01,903 --> 00:12:07,398
they will not focus at the same point.

175
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:12,919
So maybe after, maybe before,

176
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:15,871
depending on how the astigmatism
is going,

177
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,807
but not at the position
where it should go.

178
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:24,757
It will look a little bit like this.

179
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:29,791
It is more difficult to imagine
what's really going on there

180
00:12:29,991 --> 00:12:34,244
because that means that my image,
if I look at this plane,

181
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:37,552
is sharp in the vertical direction

182
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:41,538
but completely unsharp
in a horizontal direction.

183
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,673
So let's try to see what is going on

184
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:47,351
on a real transmission electron
microscopy image.

185
00:12:47,551 --> 00:12:52,845
I've taken the simplest case
of a hole that is there,

186
00:12:53,045 --> 00:12:55,476
so I have no specimen on the inside,

187
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,302
and which is in a carbon film.

188
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:00,524
So that's amorphous carbon.

189
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:05,936
If everything works well,
and if my image is in focus,

190
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:10,306
you see, very well, the rim of the hole

191
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,654
with no particular contrast.

192
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,761
If I now over focus the lens,

193
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:20,643
I will see some strange contrast there,

194
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:24,702
which looks like grains appearing
in the carbon film,

195
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:29,576
and this dark rim on the side
of the hole.

196
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,288
In this case, the rim is the same
everywhere.

197
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:38,449
I have no astigmatism in those 2 images.

198
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:40,117
It is perfectly corrected.

199
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,518
But this one is a bit strange, right?

200
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:49,537
It looks like it is in focus there

201
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:54,012
and completely over focused
at that position.

202
00:13:54,212 --> 00:13:58,704
Indeed, this image has a strong
astigmatism.

203
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:03,593
So this image is in focus,
over focus,

204
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:07,330
and this has some part over focused
and some part in focus.

205
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:13,550
If you look carefully, you will
also see that the carbon film

206
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,680
is not homogenous anymore.

207
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,282
It looks like maybe it has been
stretched, or whatever.

208
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:24,603
You see elongated structures
in this direction,

209
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:27,842
which correspond to the direction
of the astigmatism.

210
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:32,192
Again, it is because I'm in focus
in that direction

211
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:35,021
and not in focus in the other direction.

212
00:14:35,221 --> 00:14:39,037
Okay. With this, we have seen the main
aberrations

213
00:14:39,237 --> 00:14:42,347
that are relevant to understand
a transmission electron microscope.

214
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:47,705
In the next video, you will see
how we can take groups of lenses,

215
00:14:47,905 --> 00:14:51,917
put them together, and build a complete
transmission microscope.

216
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:56,328
Before jumping to this, I would like you
to have a look at these links.

217
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:02,074
They will explain to you and show you
that electrons are also waves.
