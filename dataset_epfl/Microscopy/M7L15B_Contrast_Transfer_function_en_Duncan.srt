00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.470
Welcome to CIME's lecture on Transmission Electron Microscopy for material science.

2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.000
In this video will we see how to describe the objective lens with

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.110
the concept of point spread function and contrast transfer function.

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.589
So, let's start with the point spread function.

5
00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.460
As you can guess from the name,

6
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.440
it will tell us how the point is then spread,

7
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.630
which means that we first start with

8
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.725
our objective lens and want it to make the image of a point.

9
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:46.461
The image of a point by the objective lens should normally

10
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:51.625
if we have a perfect lens, be a point like this,

11
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:56.620
but you already have seen and a part about lens aberrations that we have,

12
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.350
for example, the spherical aberration.

13
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.771
With the spherical aberration,

14
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:07.375
the image of a point is spread into a disk of least confusion.

15
00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:11.605
We also had the case of chromatic aberration where

16
00:01:11.605 --> 00:01:16.655
rays of different energy are not focused at the same position.

17
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:20.524
Again this spreads the information.

18
00:01:20.524 --> 00:01:25.514
And finally we may change a little bit the focus of the lens,

19
00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:30.515
which means that we move the position where the image forms

20
00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:36.191
and at the previous position of the image we will have a disk.

21
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:43.070
Finally, the image of a point will turn into a disk.

22
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.925
Let's put some names on all of this.

23
00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:52.984
For example, our object can be described by the function f(r),

24
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:57.275
with r the position in the plane.

25
00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:06.240
The image of our object will be called g(r) in real space.

26
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.975
If our object was a perfect point,

27
00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:20.807
the image "g" corresponds exactly to what we called the point spread function h(r),

28
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:26.025
which is a characteristic of the objective lens.

29
00:02:26.025 --> 00:02:30.965
But it's not very interesting to image point objects.

30
00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:33.420
What's going on for an extended object?

31
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.595
Instead of that point,

32
00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:38.475
I now have a plane,

33
00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:42.330
and I have to consider different points of this plane.

34
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.420
The image will be situated in the image plane and actually,

35
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.075
each of the point of my object will be spread

36
00:02:54.075 --> 00:03:00.410
by the point spread function in the corresponding image plane.

37
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.325
At the end, I have all this information mixed up.

38
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.805
And how is it mixed up?

39
00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:13.537
Well, if I have my object f(r),

40
00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:19.160
my point spread function h(r) describing the objective lens,

41
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.560
at the end, in the image plane,

42
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.446
I will get my image called g(r),

43
00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:34.788
which will be the integral over the whole image of all this mixed information,

44
00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:36.380
which can be described

45
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:47.122
by: f(r').h(r- r')dr'.

46
00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:57.210
This is a convolution product which we can write: f_convoluted_with_h.

47
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:06.440
So the image is the convolution product of the object with the point spread function.

48
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.760
It would be easier if we could get rid of this convolution product.

49
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.130
You've certainly seen in Fourier analysis that the Fourier transform

50
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:23.510
of a convolution product becomes a normal multiplicative product.

51
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.780
So we will use this to get rid of this convolution.

52
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.600
Again we have f(r), our object,

53
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.330
g(r) which is equal to f_convoluted_with_h, our image.

54
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.705
And now to get rid of this convolution product,

55
00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:53.305
I will take the Fourier transform and that would give me a quantity

56
00:04:53.305 --> 00:05:00.988
called G(u) = F(u).H(u).

57
00:05:00.988 --> 00:05:09.805
H(u) is the Fourier transform of h(r).

58
00:05:09.805 --> 00:05:14.530
It is called the contrast transfer function,

59
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.880
but it's also connected to reality.

60
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.945
If we have a real space vector "r",

61
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:27.350
"u" will correspond to spatial frequencies.

62
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.550
It is what we find in the reciprocal space,

63
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.190
"r" is a real space vector;

64
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.530
"u" is a reciprocal space vector.

65
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:43.265
Reciprocal space is found in the back focal plane of the objective lens.

66
00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:48.610
So, what happens there can

67
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:55.095
be understood by looking at the back focal plane of the objective lens.

68
00:05:55.095 --> 00:06:01.240
F(u) is the Fourier transform of the exit wave.

69
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.508
It carries exactly the same information as the exit wave,

70
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:08.940
that's the information we want to access from the specimen.

71
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.940
So now, we will have a closer look at the contrast transfer function.

72
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.045
Back to real space, ideally,

73
00:06:21.045 --> 00:06:24.090
we would have to have the image of a point,

74
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.075
not being a disk but a point,

75
00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:32.550
which means that we would like to have the point spread function not spreading anything,

76
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.900
so, being a delta function.

77
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.090
The Fourier transform of a delta function is unity.

78
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:46.785
Ideally, the contrast transfer function should be one and constant,

79
00:06:46.785 --> 00:06:53.440
which means that I should be able to transmit equally each spatial frequencies.

80
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.605
But it's impossible in a transmission microscope.

81
00:06:57.605 --> 00:07:01.517
First of all, I'm always using an objective aperture,

82
00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:04.685
and even if not I will have some cut off

83
00:07:04.685 --> 00:07:08.830
by the wall of the objective lens pole pieces, for example.

84
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.365
So, I'm always cutting the rays at some angle

85
00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:19.438
which means that I will always cut somewhere the spatial frequencies.

86
00:07:19.438 --> 00:07:27.205
My contrast transfer function will be cut and look like this.

87
00:07:27.205 --> 00:07:33.970
And, at the higher spatial frequencies everything is gone because of the aperture.

88
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:40.255
Secondly, my electron source is not perfect either.

89
00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:41.970
Electrons will, for example,

90
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:48.030
be emitted from several places out of the electron source.

91
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:51.970
As a consequence, electron waves coming from different places of

92
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:56.530
the source will not be perfectly coherent to each other.

93
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.390
If I want to resolve very fine detail,

94
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:05.115
which means have a good transfer function at very high frequency,

95
00:08:05.115 --> 00:08:06.770
I will have a problem.

96
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:13.231
That's called the incoherence of the source and this would damp the higher frequency.

97
00:08:13.231 --> 00:08:18.830
And finally, we also have to take into account the objective lens.

98
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:25.390
The objective lens will not affect the amplitude of the electron wave,

99
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.140
but it will affect the phase,

100
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:33.000
and it would affect the phase in a very complicated manner

101
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.697
that depends on the reciprocal space vector,

102
00:08:37.697 --> 00:08:41.950
or on the angle at which the electrons are scattered.

103
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:51.480
Finally, I can model my contrast

104
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:58.075
transfer function with those three components in the following way.

105
00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:03.940
I use three terms called A(u), B(u), and E(u).

106
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.585
The first one is the aperture term.

107
00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:13.240
It corresponds to the objective aperture in the back focal plane of

108
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.950
the objective lens and it will be a square top hat function.

109
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.815
It's a hard cutoff at high frequencies.

110
00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:29.165
The second term is called envelope function.

111
00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:33.330
The envelope function describes the damping at

112
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:40.145
higher spatial frequency due to the fact that the source is not perfectly coherent.

113
00:09:40.145 --> 00:09:43.895
For example, if we look at different kind of

114
00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:50.115
electron sources that we have classically in electron microscopy,

115
00:09:50.115 --> 00:09:51.780
we can compare, for example,

116
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:58.154
the field emission gun which has a very high coherency,

117
00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:00.210
so it will only damp at

118
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:07.363
relatively high frequencies with lanthanum hexaboride gun which has

119
00:10:07.363 --> 00:10:17.433
lower coherency and will end up with a stronger damping at high spatial frequency,

120
00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:22.690
or even worse tungsten filament that will damp even more.

121
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:32.605
Finally, I have to consider now B(u).

122
00:10:32.605 --> 00:10:37.270
This is the term describing the effect of

123
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.640
the objective lens and this one only applies a phase shift,

124
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.850
which means that I can simplify its expression and write it as exponential_iX(u).

125
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:57.295
Chi  is a real function that depends on the properties of the lens.

126
00:10:57.295 --> 00:11:02.370
For example, chi  would depend on the spherical aberration,

127
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:07.580
chromatic aberration, astigmatism, etc.

128
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:14.884
If we only have defocus of the lens and spherical aberration,

129
00:11:14.884 --> 00:11:20.970
which are two aberrations with cylindrical symmetry,

130
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:27.332
so I don't have to take care of the vector nature of u and the direction.

131
00:11:27.332 --> 00:11:29.300
All you need to know is it's norm.

132
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.875
In that case, the expression of chi is given by

133
00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:42.077
this formula which contains the defocus applied to the objective lens,

134
00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:47.606
the spherical aberration coefficient C_s,

135
00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:54.755
the wavelength of the electrons lambda,

136
00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:58.690
the norm of the reciprocal space vector u.

137
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:04.685
The dimension analysis tells us that everything is okay. This is a length.

138
00:12:04.685 --> 00:12:07.670
This is the lengths times a reciprocal length

139
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.670
squared give something which is unit-less and there I have

140
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.735
length times lengths to the power of three

141
00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:23.140
compensated by this reciprocal unit vector to the power of four.

142
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:31.725
It's interesting to note that this is growing extremely fast with u.

143
00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:34.130
That explains to you the importance of

144
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.955
the spherical aberration coefficient and the fact

145
00:12:37.955 --> 00:12:42.040
that if you have a microscope with strong C_s,

146
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:49.730
very soon your resolution will be limited by the C_s or you will have to cut u.

147
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.330
But, cutting u will not help you any further.

148
00:12:54.330 --> 00:13:01.745
Cutting the high values of u means introducing

149
00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:10.495
an aperture and what you gain on one side by reducing this term,

150
00:13:10.495 --> 00:13:14.295
you lose it on the other side by having

151
00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:19.960
the aperture function that would also kill the resolution of the microscope.

152
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.950
With this you have had the notion of the contrast transfer function which is

153
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:30.780
a very important quantity to describe how

154
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:36.390
well the different spatial frequencies are transferred by the optical system.

155
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.755
In the next video,

156
00:13:38.755 --> 00:13:45.460
we will now introduce the interaction between the electron plane wave and the specimen.
