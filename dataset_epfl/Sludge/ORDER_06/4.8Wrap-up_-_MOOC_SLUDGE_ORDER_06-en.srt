1
00:00:04,548 --> 00:00:07,261
So, following week four,
are you ready to engage

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:10,980
your city more in creating
an enabling environment?

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,230
Engineers and practitioners
must wear many hats 

4
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:19,698
as designers, planners, managers,
advocates, lobbyists

5
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:21,528
community liaisons.

6
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:23,905
If we want to ensure
that the necessary

7
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:26,812
and inter related legal,
organizational

8
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:30,083
financial, political
and cultural aspects

9
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:33,294
that all need to be in place for
effective fecal sludge management

10
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:34,935
have been accounted for.

11
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:40,443
and these factors are all included
as design variables in our approach.

12
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:45,017
it is also important to remember
that fecal sludge management

13
00:00:45,182 --> 00:00:48,170
on it's own is not
a stand-alone solution 

14
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:53,187
it needs to be incorporated into
a city-wide approach to sanitation

15
00:00:53,518 --> 00:00:56,518
This week you've learned
the importance of assessing

16
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,834
and understanding
the initial situation

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:00,928
in specific context

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,003
as sanitation solutions can be
very heterogeneous.

19
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:07,693
Not only between
countries and cities

20
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:10,478
but also within cities themselves.

21
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,637
A thorough assessment ensures
that solutions are tailored

22
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:18,636
to meet the actual needs,
build on what is existing

23
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:24,201
and takes into account the context
specific strengths and constraints.

24
00:01:24,928 --> 00:01:27,315
These preliminary steps are required

25
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:30,178
to understand
the existing situation 

26
00:01:30,352 --> 00:01:33,965
before you can start defining
the problem that needs to be solved.

27
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:37,078
One example is site selection.

28
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,762
Due to the difficulty
of obtaining land 

29
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:44,100
in urban areas, that is expensive,
and not readily available

30
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:48,037
it will already affect
technology selection

31
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:51,331
as treatment options
that are land intensive

32
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:55,094
tend to be much less expensive,
whereas treatment options

33
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:59,282
that don't require a lot of land
tend to be much more expensive.

34
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:03,351
So it's important also to ensure
that this site is accessible

35
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:06,155
so it will really be used.

36
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:08,465
An integrated planning approach

37
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:10,908
can help you link all
your design variables

38
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:13,479
into standard project phases

39
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:17,784
and helps you to manage when
and where to consider each of them.

40
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:22,851
Also, incorporating participatory
processes within traditional

41
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:26,937
project cycles, helps to ensure
commitment and ownership during

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,758
during implementation and operation.

43
00:02:29,925 --> 00:02:34,213
And success is enhanced by
more effective management schemes

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,240
better institutional setups and
integration of the private sector.

45
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,565
Integrating stakeholders
and understanding their interest

46
00:02:43,738 --> 00:02:47,800
and influences should be carried
out through the entire project

47
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:51,684
as it is a continuous
and iterative process.

48
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,381
For more information
on an integrated approach

49
00:02:55,573 --> 00:02:59,260
to city wide sanitation,
please refer to the (INAUDIBLE) MOOC.

50
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:03,791
Planning and design of sanitation
systems and technologies.

51
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,851
you learned the importance
of setting up legal

52
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:10,021
and regulatory frame works
for fecal sludge management

53
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:12,834
and introducing enforcement mechanisms.

54
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:16,702
This is necessary to ensure that
regulation and enforcement

55
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:20,107
of public health and environmental
standards occurs.

56
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,432
As fecal sludge management
is an essential component

57
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:24,958
of urban sanitation

58
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:28,099
it needs to be included
in national policies

59
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,916
and also have clear institutional
roles at the local level

60
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:35,004
to ensure people
take responsibility.

61
00:03:35,927 --> 00:03:39,165
Also, considering different models
of financial transfers

62
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:43,328
will help to formalize this sector
and make it financially sustainable

63
00:03:43,535 --> 00:03:46,672
and could include incentives
as a method of transition

64
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,517
to new management
models in the short term.

65
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:54,710
Financial transfers include capital
and operations and maintenance costs

66
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,328
from the household level

67
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,001
to collection and transport
service providers

68
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,159
to treatment plants
and resource recovery.

69
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,832
These are a combination of
public and/or private parties

70
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:10,023
payments for service,
or discharge fees

71
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:13,332
taxes, tariffs
and licences.

72
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,910
you also learn the importance
of incorporating management 

73
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:21,289
concerns from the beginning
of the project planning.

74
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:26,438
Management aspects need to be linked
to decision on technology options.

75
00:04:26,643 --> 00:04:29,643
This is especially important
when evaluating levels

76
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,108
of established, transferring
and innovative technologies.

77
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,669
It is also important to ensure
operations and maintenances

78
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,936
built into the ongoing
project budget

79
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:44,238
and to ensure demands are
appropriate to the local context.

80
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,690
All too many treatment plants
have failed due to lack

81
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,210
of operations and maintenance.

82
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,221
And lastly financial considerations

83
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:55,877
are obviously
a very important variable

84
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,842
at the decision making process

85
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:00,678
selecting different
management options.

86
00:05:00,982 --> 00:05:03,844
This is complicated with
many technologies because

87
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:06,204
they are not yet
examples of cost data

88
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,597
and it requires many assumptions.

89
00:05:08,728 --> 00:05:13,066
Equivalent cost comparisons
can be used to compare the capital

90
00:05:13,224 --> 00:05:15,699
and operating costs
of different technologies

91
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:20,200
with revenue generated from
resource recovery incorporated

92
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,361
as a positive under operating costs.

93
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:26,090
What design variables did you learn

94
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,714
about this week that
you did not know

95
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:29,138
about before?

96
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,155
Do you think there are any
important ones for your city

97
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,009
that we did not cover?

98
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:37,979
Please contribute your thoughts to
the discussion on the forum website

99
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:40,177
and also visit
the additional resources

100
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,395
to learn more about the topic.

101
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,814
Now we are entering
the final week of the MOOC

102
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,922
where you will learn about
the current status

103
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:51,053
of transferring and
innovative technologies

104
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,101
for collection,
transport, treatment

105
00:05:54,276 --> 00:05:56,901
and resource recovery
of fecal sludge.

106
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,764
This is a very exciting week
as it will provide you

107
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,583
with more of an idea
the ways in which this field

108
00:06:02,755 --> 00:06:04,543
is rapidly changing.

109
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:07,835
Then we will provide you with
an example of the case study

110
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:10,413
of Durban, South Africa

111
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:13,509
a city that was awarded
the Stockholm water prize

112
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:17,200
for their innovative adapted
and integrated approach

113
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,985
to fecal sludge management
and city-wide sanitation.

114
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:24,440
Thanks for joining,
see you next week.
