1
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,101
Following Week 3, are you ready
to start considering

2
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:10,801
what type of treatment technologies
are appropriate in your city?

3
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,453
Important concepts that you
learned this week

4
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:17,405
for evaluating appropriate
treatment technologies

5
00:00:17,605 --> 00:00:21,292
include the level of technology
development established

6
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,365
transferring or innovative. 

7
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:27,215
We have grouped technologies
as established

8
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:31,367
if there is enough operating
experience, the design considerations

9
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:35,331
and operations and maintenance
requirements are established

10
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,369
and can be recommended. 

11
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:39,523
We have grouped technologies
as transferring,

12
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:42,026
if knowledge is currently
being transferred

13
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,630
from other sectors like waste
water treatments.

14
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,461
And we have grouped technologies
as innovative

15
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:51,799
if they show promise but are in
the research and development phase.

16
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:55,330
These distinctions are very
important because they will have

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,167
a direct impact on implementation
and the required

18
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:02,532
level of management and partnerships
for scaling up,

19
00:01:02,732 --> 00:01:06,396
such as private partner partnerships
or with research institutes.

20
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:11,435
Another important concept
that you learned is about linking

21
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,435
treatment technologies
by their treatment objectives.

22
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:18,215
Frequently a treatment chain
will include a combination

23
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:22,278
of treatment technologies, depending
on the overall treatment objectives.

24
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:25,574
This was also illustrated in
the design example

25
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:29,718
of the Lubigi Faecal Sludge
Treatment Plant in Kampala, Uganda.

26
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:33,217
This is why in the engineering
design approach

27
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,490
the first steps include defining
treatment objectives

28
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,204
so that you know what you
are designing

29
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:40,437
treatment technologies for.

30
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:45,458
Once you have defined treatment end
goals or resource recovery options

31
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:49,797
then you can simultaneously consider
the treatment objectives necessary

32
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:54,251
 to achieve them together with
the level of technology development

33
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,848
which is important for the associated
level of required management.

34
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,951
This week you learned about
treatment processes

35
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,534
for six different established
technologies,

36
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,736
operations and maintenance
requirements and design parameters.

37
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,428
These were settling
and thickening tanks,

38
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:15,581
unplanted drying beds,
planted drying beds,

39
00:02:15,781 --> 00:02:19,603
co-composting,
cotreatment with waste water

40
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:22,267
and effluent treatment technologies.

41
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:26,122
In Week 5,  we will continue
to learn more about

42
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:29,776
treatment technologies, specifically
technologies that are in

43
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:32,610
the transferring and innovative
categories.

44
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,686
It is always equally as important
to consider the fate

45
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:40,993
of effluent from treatment processes
and how to safely manage it.

46
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:44,326
Starting at the level of on-site
containment technologies

47
00:02:44,526 --> 00:02:46,374
from the supernatant
and septic tanks,

48
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,880
up to centralized treatment
facilities.

49
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:53,872
What treatment technologies do you
think are appropriate in your city?

50
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:57,375
Can you think of any that
you would consider established

51
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,587
that we did not include here?

52
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,758
Please add your thoughts on
the discussion forum and please

53
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,198
also do not forget to visit
the additional resources

54
00:03:04,398 --> 00:03:07,254
on the platform website.

55
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,456
So now that you have
an understanding

56
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:13,328
of faecal sludge management,
treatment objectives,

57
00:03:13,528 --> 00:03:16,197
and fundamentals
and treatment technologies

58
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:19,292
in Week 4 we're going
to switch gears

59
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,105
and focus on an integrated
approach.

60
00:03:21,305 --> 00:03:24,255
How to incorporate all of
the design variables

61
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,617
and planning and management aspects
that are necessary

62
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,823
to create an enabling environment.

63
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:34,731
A groundwork that includes legal,
organizational, financial,

64
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,234
political and cultural aspects.

65
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,579
You will learn about a planning
frameworks,

66
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:43,381
why it's important to fit
participatory stakeholder

67
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:46,617
processes within traditional
project cycles

68
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:50,025
and to engage and work together
with stakeholders.

69
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:54,207
Other concepts will include
understanding the initial context,

70
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,398
setting up legal and regulatory
frameworks

71
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,736
to define clear roles
and responsibilities

72
00:03:59,936 --> 00:04:03,689
How to consider different models
of financial transfers

73
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:06,468
that are necessary at each step
of the service chain.

74
00:04:06,668 --> 00:04:10,350
And incorporating management
and operations

75
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,053
and maintenance concerns
from the beginning

76
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,443
of the project planning,
and finally,

77
00:04:15,643 --> 00:04:19,777
how to compare the equivalent cost
of different technology options.

78
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:23,466
Thanks for joining,
see you next week.
