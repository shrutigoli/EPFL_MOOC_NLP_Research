00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:05,476
I hope you have enjoyed this

2
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:07,732
introduction to fecal sludge
management

3
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:10,723
and learning about how
to apply some key concepts

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:13,713
a sustainable fecal sludge
management as part of

5
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:17,138
an integrated approach
to city-wide sanitation.

6
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:20,866
Certainly by now you already have
a number of thoughts

7
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,566
ideas and opinions
on what important considerations

8
00:00:24,737 --> 00:00:29,100
for sustainable implementation
of fecal sludge management are

9
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,254
and understand how
to address challenges.

10
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,954
In this module, I will highlight
some of the key learnings

11
00:00:36,117 --> 00:00:39,117
from the last five weeks
that achieve this.

12
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:42,847
The system's level approach
to fecal sludge management

13
00:00:43,022 --> 00:00:45,772
developed in this course
and the associated book

14
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:50,413
should be seen as a building block
for the future design and operation

15
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:54,858
of functional and sustainable
fecal sludge management systems.

16
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,182
Developing solutions for
fecal sludge management

17
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:01,153
and solutions for
city-wide sanitation

18
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:04,466
that include both sewered
and non-sewered solutions

19
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,005
requires tackling large
complicated issues

20
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:10,292
that are all inter related.

21
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,517
It is necessary to understand
how these fields fit together

22
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:16,638
and to understand
the connections

23
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:20,040
and influences of each field
upon the other.

24
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,419
There have been
rapid improvements

25
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:25,046
in gains in knowledge,
and although there is still

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,208
a long way to go,
these advances will continue

27
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:29,836
to build upon each other

28
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:33,012
and improve solutions
and approaches.

29
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:36,019
Some important aspects
for the way forward

30
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:38,185
that you learned
about in this course

31
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,650
include designing
for the final end use

32
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:44,207
or disposal option
of treatment products

33
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:45,761
to ensure treatment objectives

34
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:48,629
are met and public health
is protected.

35
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:53,949
Designing for the actual quantity
and characteristic of fecal sludge

36
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:57,276
to ensure designs
meet the local context

37
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:02,260
improving on-site containment
technologies, transfer stations

38
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:06,647
and emptying methodologies,
safe, efficient and affordable

39
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:10,694
collection and transport will
help to ensure that fecal sludge

40
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,793
is delivered to treatment.

41
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:16,787
Developing and understanding
of treatment mechanisms

42
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:21,239
this will be the basis for
developing new technologies

43
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:24,404
and for adapting existing ones.

44
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:28,881
Incorporating management
concerns from the beginning

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,177
of the project planing,
link operations and maintenance

46
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:36,820
to technologies decisions
and long term budgets.

47
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:38,939
Setting up legal and regulatory

48
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,517
frameworks
and enforcement mechanisms

49
00:02:41,678 --> 00:02:44,741
having one entity of
a city government

50
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:49,008
solely responsible increases
a sense of responsibility

51
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:52,903
that can be lost in more
fragmented management models.

52
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:55,674
Streamlining eliminates any

53
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,805
responsibility overlap
between stakeholders

54
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:02,381
and also avoid gaps in responsibilities.

55
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:06,463
Considering different models
of financial transfers

56
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:10,489
different business models
for sanitation services

57
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:14,026
need to be considered
to reduce the financial burden

58
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,019
at the household level.

59
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:20,930
Assessing and understanding
the initial situation

60
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,329
in specific context, especially
important due to the heterogeneity

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,237
of urban areas in low
and middle income countries

62
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:34,434
characterized by rapid growth rates
in varied diverse landscapes

63
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,271
in terms of income level,
sanitation technologies

64
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:41,434
and formal and informal
settlements in addition

65
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:44,142
to weak enabling environments.

66
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,806
Integrating stakeholders
and understanding their

67
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:51,621
interests and influence
which is key for commitment

68
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,788
to responsibilities.

69
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:58,299
Applying an integrated planning
approach at the city level.

70
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:02,985
This is especially important in
the field of fecal sludge management

71
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:07,844
has globally, experience has showed
time and time again

72
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:11,944
that on-site and decentralized
technologies are prone to failure

73
00:04:12,104 --> 00:04:16,266
if not considered as
a component within a larger system.

74
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,476
For the development

75
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,377
of a sustainable fecal sludge
management systems

76
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:24,273
a significant step requires first

77
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:27,698
the acknowledge of it's
importance by stakeholders.

78
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,624
This includes governments taking

79
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:33,711
responsibility for providing
fecal sludge management

80
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,689
development agencies providing
funding structures for feasible

81
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:39,650
and appropriate solutions

82
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:42,827
and large inter-governmental
organizations

83
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:46,066
promoting safe fecal
sludge management.

84
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:50,599
As this is a relatively new field
much of the existing knowledge

85
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:55,322
remains with practitioners in
the field without a written record

86
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:59,292
and there remains a lack of
affordable and accessible references

87
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:01,732
materials and curriculum.

88
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,667
Hopefully initiatives like this
course will start to fill this gap

89
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,375
and after completing this course
part of the responsibility

90
00:05:09,537 --> 00:05:11,512
also goes to you.

91
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:13,729
There is a great need

92
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,862
for the development
of appropriate technologies

93
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,805
even though solutions will
not rely on technology alone.

94
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:25,229
New technologies are based on
pioneering developments in research

95
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:29,013
which points to a need
for solution oriented research

96
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:32,814
to be conducted in countries
where it is directly relevant.

97
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:35,066
With local researchers working

98
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,091
together with their
urban governments

99
00:05:37,265 --> 00:05:39,840
that are responsible
for fecal sludge management

100
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:44,749
so new knowledge is taken up,
and has an influence on policy.

101
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,724
Due to the urgent need
for technical solutions

102
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:52,365
research and implementation
need to continue to be conducted

103
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:56,900
in parallel, getting to scale
as rapidly as possible.

104
00:05:57,053 --> 00:06:00,916
An example of this was provided
in Durban case study.

105
00:06:01,824 --> 00:06:05,324
Creativity is essential
in every aspect

106
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,036
of fecal sludge management.

107
00:06:07,212 --> 00:06:11,287
To continue to advance solutions
that are globally transferable

108
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:15,669
and applicable for the forty percent
of the people world wide

109
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:18,777
served by on-site
sanitation technologies

110
00:06:18,947 --> 00:06:21,434
and the billions more
that will need to be served

111
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,459
in the decades to come.

112
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,573
Keeping an open mind
will be the key to developing

113
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:29,267
innovative and optimal solutions.

114
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:31,072
Learning from the past

115
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:33,952
but also not limiting
future possibilities

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,470
through biases of what has
or has not worked in the past

117
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:39,685
in other situations.

118
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,037
Undoubtedly, this is a very
exciting and promising time

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,875
for the advancement
of fecal sludge management

120
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:49,015
and the field will continue
to advance with

121
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,642
increasing acknowledgement

122
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,504
of the importance
of fecal sludge management.

123
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:58,309
Along with it, we also need
a new generation of practitioners

124
00:06:58,493 --> 00:07:02,231
scientists and engineers
who are up for the challenge.

125
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:05,225
Who will be the next drivers
of change in realizing

126
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,999
integrated city-wide sanitation.

127
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,395
Hopefully that includes you.

128
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,959
What would your next steps be
following this course

129
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:16,125
to make the best use
of your new knowledge and skills

130
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:19,307
to apply concepts if sustainable
fecal sludge management

131
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:21,076
in your city?

132
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,256
Will you use this in your job

133
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:26,118
professional development or career?

134
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:29,896
Please share your goals and ideas
to the forum discussion.

135
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:34,193
Thank you for joining
and hope to see you again soon.
