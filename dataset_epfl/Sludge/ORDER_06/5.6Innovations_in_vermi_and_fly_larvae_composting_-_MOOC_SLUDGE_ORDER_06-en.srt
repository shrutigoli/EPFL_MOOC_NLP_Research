1
00:00:04,846 --> 00:00:06,698
We already introduced you
to co-composting

2
00:00:06,836 --> 00:00:08,051
 for faecal sludge treatment.

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:10,026
This is a relatively slow process,

4
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:13,683
and to produce compost, may not 
always have a high market value.

5
00:00:13,883 --> 00:00:15,712
In this module
we are going to introduce you

6
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:19,197
to two new processes,
called vermi and fly composting,

7
00:00:19,397 --> 00:00:21,045
that have the potential
to be quicker

8
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:24,358
and produce treatment products
with a higher market value.

9
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:26,980
Such as the black soldier fly
shown behind me.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,710
Following this module,

11
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:31,472
you will be able to explain
the treatment process and operation

12
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:33,499
of vermi- and fly larvae composting.

13
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:35,259
Name advantages and disadvantages

14
00:00:35,459 --> 00:00:37,672
these processes can have
over co-composting.

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:40,872
And discuss important considerations
for the implementation.

16
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:43,151
Vermi and fly larvae composting

17
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:45,734
are processes that use
worms and flies 

18
00:00:45,934 --> 00:00:48,287
for sludge stabilization
(INAUDIBLE) management

19
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:51,698
in addition to microorganisms
used in co-composting 

20
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:55,129
Vermi and fly larvae composting
are two processes

21
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,391
that are currently being researched
and piloted for faecal sludge.

22
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,253
Currently, the knowledge
for faecal sludge

23
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:05,117
is limited to laboratory,
bench scale and pilot scale studies 

24
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,752
and most research
has been conducted with faeces.

25
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,307
Faeces can have
very different characteristics

26
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,631
to faecal sludge collected
from pit latrines and septic tanks.

27
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,977
Vermi and fly larvae
composting processes

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,746
are being transferred
to faecal sludge 

29
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:20,772
from the treatment
of organic solid waste

30
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,972
which is market waste,
restaurant waste or manures.

31
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:25,323
For these wastes, 

32
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:26,991
more knowledge and a few examples

33
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:28,949
of full-scale implementation exists.

34
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,704
Vermi composting, which is also
called worm composting

35
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:35,064
uses worms for sludge stabilization.

36
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:37,742
Worms can have (INAUDIBLE)
with faecal sludge

37
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:39,502
include Eisenia Fetida

38
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:42,276
which is also called tiger worms
or red wiggler.

39
00:01:42,476 --> 00:01:43,895
And Eudrius Eugenia,

40
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:46,521
which is also called
the African nightcrawler.

41
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,024
With organic solid wastes,

42
00:01:48,224 --> 00:01:50,465
Lubricus Rubellus is also common.

43
00:01:50,665 --> 00:01:52,884
These worms are selected
for vermi-composting

44
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:56,916
because they can survive, grow,
feed and reproduce

45
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,808
on a variety
of different feed-stocks

46
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:00,355
and they grow very quickly.

47
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:03,094
This is a picture of Eisenia Fetida.

48
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:05,524
If you would like
to do vermi-composting

49
00:02:05,724 --> 00:02:06,611
and you need worms.

50
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,624
You're likely to find them
in manures or compost.

51
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:12,186
Once placed in a feed-stock,
such as faecal sludge,

52
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:14,891
worms start to feed on it
to meet their energy needs,

53
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,998
grow and reproduce.

54
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:19,988
Anything that the worms
do not take up

55
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:21,986
during this digestion
process in their gut

56
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:24,592
they will poop out
as a solid residual

57
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:26,355
that we call vermi-compost.

58
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,803
Operation of vermi-composting
is commonly in batch or semi-batch.

59
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:34,458
This means that worms are fed once
with faecal sludge

60
00:02:34,619 --> 00:02:36,632
or a smaller batches every day.

61
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,951
Under favorable
environment or conditions,

62
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,715
worm will directly reproduce
within the waste, 

63
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,775
and need to be separated
from the residue

64
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:47,912
after faecal sludge has been
processed into vermi-compost.

65
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,164
This picture shows
such a batch process 

66
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:53,106
at a research facility
in the Philippines.

67
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,820
In these rectangular boxes,

68
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,899
a mixture of manure,
shredded cornstarch and faeces 

69
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,917
are being vermi-composted
with Eisenia Fetida.

70
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:04,823
Three studies in Mexico,
the Philippines and India,

71
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,962
assess vermi-composting of faecal
sludge collected from septic tanks 

72
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,118
and faeces.

73
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,247
These studies highlighted worms
required bedding material

74
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,428
for proper development.

75
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,621
In India,

76
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:19,118
worms do not lie in faeces without
a bedding material below the faeces,

77
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:21,021
such as solid compost.

78
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,442
In vermi-composting of solid waste

79
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:26,268
paper and cardboard
are also commonly used.

80
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:30,513
Worms also did not feed and survive 
on untreated sludge

81
00:03:30,713 --> 00:03:33,248
but required faecal sludge
that was pre-digested.

82
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:35,488
The research also identified

83
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:39,423
that high ammonia concentration
faecal sludge can be toxic to worms

84
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:40,846
and hamper their development.

85
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:44,299
Let's move to another 
fascinating animal use 

86
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:45,583
in faecal sludge treatment.

87
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:47,251
The black soldier fly.

88
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:48,980
The black soldier fly

89
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,514
can be found in most temperate
and tropical climates.

90
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,548
In comparison to other flies,

91
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,743
it has the benefit 

92
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,720
that it doesn't feed
during its adult life.

93
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,169
This means it will likely not move
between different waste

94
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:03,369
and sit on waste
that could contain pathogens

95
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,153
and transmit it through environment

96
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,816
which could transmit diseases.

97
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,389
In waste treatment,

98
00:04:08,589 --> 00:04:10,913
black soldier flies
are usually reared in cages

99
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:13,627
as shown here at a pilot-scale for (INAUDIBLE)
in Nairobi.

100
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,104
In these cages,

101
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:16,686
flies are kept in conditions 

102
00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:19,857
that foster mating
between male and female flies.

103
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,391
Following mating, 

104
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,311
female flies like to lay
their eggs in protected place.

105
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,980
To provide such an environment,

106
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,089
treatment operators commonly provide
perforated cardboard 

107
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:31,509
to lay their eggs, as shown here.

108
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:35,864
This picture shows the egg following
a removal from the cardboard.

109
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:37,400
On this picture

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,176
you can see a few million eggs.

111
00:04:39,376 --> 00:04:41,231
Under favorable
environmental conditions,

112
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,459
within the next three days,

113
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,695
a few million small larvae
with the size around one millimeter

114
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,094
will hatch from these eggs,

115
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,593
and hungry for food.

116
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:52,454
Once placed
on an organic waste feed-stock,

117
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,538
such as faecal sludge,

118
00:04:53,676 --> 00:04:57,036
the larvae will start processing
this waste for the next weeks,

119
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,051
to meet their energy needs and grow.

120
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:02,773
As they do not feed
during their adult lives as a fly,

121
00:05:02,973 --> 00:05:06,724
they have a really big appetite
during their life stage as a larvae.

122
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,088
This video shows
the black soldier fly larvae

123
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:13,415
feeding on faeces during research
in Upsala, Sweden.

124
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:16,240
Based on bench
and pilot scale testing 

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,017
in Sweden, Thailand and Kenya,

126
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,050
with faeces and faecal sludge
from septic tanks,

127
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,182
fly larvae can reduce the mass
of sludge during this period

128
00:05:24,345 --> 00:05:27,437
by between 40-50%
based on dry weight.

129
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:30,921
The feeding of fly larvae
with waste such as faecal sludge,

130
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,547
is commonly done in boxes.

131
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:35,484
And larvae is either fed once
or every few days.

132
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:38,684
The boxes and the feeding

133
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,609
are shown here,
at a treatment facility, in China,

134
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,585
where restaurant waste is treated
with black soldier fly larvae.

135
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,576
Based on research
in Sweden and Kenya,

136
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:52,812
black soldier fly larvae commonly
convert between 10-20% of the sludge

137
00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:54,776
based on dry weight into body mass.

138
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:57,551
This factor is called
the bio-conversion rate.

139
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:58,703
In other words,

140
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,200
it means that following
the processing of 1000 kilo

141
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,125
of total solids,

142
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:07,296
around 100-200 kilo of dried larvae
can be expected.

143
00:06:07,496 --> 00:06:10,732
Are you excited about fly larvae
and vermi-composting?

144
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,696
Here are some
important considerations

145
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:14,809
that are relevant
for its implementation.

146
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:17,668
As with other biological processes,

147
00:06:17,868 --> 00:06:18,824
such as co-composting,

148
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,856
that rely on living organisms,

149
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:24,298
worms and fly larvae only feed,
grow and reproduce

150
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:27,240
if the suitable environmental
conditions are being provided.

151
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,302
In short, keep your worms
and fly larvae happy.

152
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:32,935
For example,

153
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,514
both fly larvae and worms
do not like light,

154
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,636
and should be kept
in a shaded place.

155
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:41,462
They also like environments 
with sufficient supplies of oxygen,

156
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:46,002
and pH, temperature, and humidity
are important environmental factors.

157
00:06:46,202 --> 00:06:49,022
The available literature on the (INAUDIBLE)

158
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,392
organic solid waste
and faecal sludge

159
00:06:51,592 --> 00:06:53,078
suggested a performance

160
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:55,661
really depending
on feed-stock characteristics

161
00:06:55,861 --> 00:06:57,915
microorganisms,
environmental conditions,

162
00:06:58,115 --> 00:07:00,738
and treatment operations,
and can be really variable.

163
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,548
It therefore best 
to determine these parameters

164
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,675
through local bench
and pilot-scale tests

165
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,868
before upscaling.

166
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:11,936
In this module we introduce you
to vermi and fly larvae composting.

167
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:14,400
Two new processes that
are currently in research 

168
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,255
and being implemented
with faecal sludge

169
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:17,797
at a bench and pilot-scale.

170
00:07:17,997 --> 00:07:19,967
In these processes,

171
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,665
worms and fly larvae

172
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:23,978
feed on faecal sludge
and produce animal protein

173
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,557
that has a high market value
in compost.

174
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:29,067
Based on the current level 
of knowledge,

175
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:32,267
the two processes that achieve
low level pathogen inactivation

176
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:33,940
in comparison to co-composting

177
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,834
and the compost
and the worm and larvae products

178
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:38,602
require further treatment.
