1
00:00:04,914 --> 00:00:07,890
The number one treatment objective
in faecal sludge management

2
00:00:08,027 --> 00:00:09,900
is always protection
of public health.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,895
Through protecting people
from pathogens that make them sick.

4
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:16,552
In this module we'll introduce you
to two treatment technologies

5
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:19,162
that can achieve high levels
of pathogen inactivation:

6
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:21,904
Ammonia and lime treatment.

7
00:00:22,104 --> 00:00:23,345
Following this module

8
00:00:23,445 --> 00:00:25,767
you will be able to explain
how pathogen inactivation

9
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:27,716
occurs in ammonia
and lime treatment.

10
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,967
Discuss operational maintenance
requirements of these technologies.

11
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:33,590
And considerations
for their implementation.

12
00:00:33,965 --> 00:00:35,627
Ammonia treatment

13
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,627
for pathogen inactivation
faecal sludge

14
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:40,044
is currently in the research
and development phase.

15
00:00:40,244 --> 00:00:43,144
Ammonia treatment relies
on the toxicity of ammonia

16
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:44,564
to pathogens.

17
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:47,621
Ammonia can be added
to the faeces in the form of urea.

18
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,790
But this treatment technology
is interesting

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,458
because ammonia
can also be provided through urea

20
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:53,820
that is included in urine.

21
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:57,028
Nitrogen urine
is in the form of urea,

22
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:00,360
but which is converted
to ammonia by the urea's enzyme,

23
00:01:00,498 --> 00:01:02,476
that is available
throughout the environment.

24
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:05,102
Ammonium nitrogen
and ammonia nitrogen

25
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,831
are in equilibrium with each other.

26
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,387
This graph shows
the fraction of nitrogen

27
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:14,594
that is available as ammonia
as a function of pH and temperature.

28
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,106
As shown in this graph,

29
00:01:16,306 --> 00:01:17,785
by increasing the pH

30
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:19,876
for example
by the addition of lime or ash,

31
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,850
the ammonia nitrogen
concentration can be increased.

32
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,815
At a pH below 8.5

33
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:27,490
a mixture of urine and faeces

34
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,553
will still have a lower
ammonia concentration

35
00:01:29,753 --> 00:01:31,282
for pathogen inactivation.

36
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:32,242
At this pH,

37
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:34,763
most of the nitrogen
is in the form of ammonia

38
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:36,875
that is not harmful for pathogens.

39
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:40,632
An increase in temperature also
increase ammonia concentrations.

40
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,956
Next to the toxicity of ammonia

41
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,550
the high pH
is also additional mechanism

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,464
for pathogen inactivation
in an ammonia treatment.

43
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,638
Faecal sludge collected
from septic tanks and pit latrines

44
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:52,671
is mostly water,

45
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,792
which dilutes the ammonia
and results in low concentrations

46
00:01:55,992 --> 00:01:58,263
to be available
for pathogen inactivation.

47
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:00,095
Even at an elevated pH.

48
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,438
Loss of ammonia and ammonium

49
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,529
that are volatile
to open manholes and septic tanks,

50
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,052
or drop holes and pit latrines,

51
00:02:07,164 --> 00:02:08,964
also reduce the concentration

52
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:11,834
of ammonia available
for pathogen inactivation.

53
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:14,398
In contrast to this type of sludge,

54
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,368
high levels of pathogen inactivation

55
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:18,435
could be feasible
with faeces and urine

56
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:20,500
when we lower
the amount of flushing water

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,396
and we are in sealed tanks.

58
00:02:22,596 --> 00:02:24,738
In laboratory experiments in Sweden

59
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,867
at 20° C and a pH of 9,

60
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:31,809
ammonia treatment could
inactivate 99% of Ascaris eggs,

61
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:34,760
which is the common
Helminths egg in only 24 days.

62
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,171
A decrease in a temperature
and an increase in flush water,

63
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,572
increase desaturation

64
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:41,909
for the same level
of pathogen inactivation

65
00:02:42,109 --> 00:02:43,007
from several weeks

66
00:02:43,207 --> 00:02:44,160
to several months.

67
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,963
So moving from the laboratory,

68
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:48,115
how could these results
be used in practice?

69
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,538
One attempt
at the safe sludge project

70
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,339
that is based on the collection
of faeces and urine

71
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,022
without any flush water.

72
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:56,348
In the first step,

73
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:59,766
faeces and urine are mixed together
with the contact time of 4 hours,

74
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,090
to convert urea

75
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,842
with the enzyme urease
into ammonium.

76
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,444
Following a (INAUDIBLE) increasing the pH,

77
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,853
which is lime and ash is added

78
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,144
which converts ammonium
into ammonia.

79
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:14,720
Then this is kept for hours or days
for inactivation of pathogens.

80
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,838
It is important to convert
urea into ammonium

81
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,411
before increasing the pH;

82
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:22,900
as an increase in pH
inhibits the enzyme urease.

83
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,558
In the laboratory experiments
in the United States,

84
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:29,770
99% of ascaris eggs were inactivated
through this process.

85
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,567
Such a treatment and process

86
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:33,881
could be implemented
for pathogen inactivation

87
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:36,453
in innovative on-site
sanitation technologies

88
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,410
offer treatment following separate
collection of faeces and urine,

89
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,115
As shown here with these jericans
for urine collection,

90
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:44,424
and a tank for storage,
in Bolivia.

91
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,041
Lime treatment, which is also called
alkaline treatment,

92
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,716
is a common treatment technology
for waste water sludge.

93
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,416
But also has been implemented
full-scale for faecal sludge

94
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,888
for example for the treatment
of septic tank sludge

95
00:03:56,088 --> 00:03:58,150
in the United States
or in the Philippines.

96
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,345
Lime is a fine white powder.

97
00:04:00,545 --> 00:04:03,053
Based on available litterature
on waste water sludge,

98
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:06,168
the most common form of lime
that is used in lime treatment

99
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:09,228
is hydrated lime,
or calcium hydroxide.

100
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,031
In lime treatment,

101
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:12,875
sufficient amount of lime are added

102
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:15,910
to the faecal sludge
to increase the pH to 12

103
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,648
for several hours to a month.

104
00:04:17,848 --> 00:04:21,726
Such a high pH slows down or stops
biological processes

105
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:25,245
that are responsive for odors
and it inactivate pathogens.

106
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,024
As discussed before for ammonia treatment,

107
00:04:29,224 --> 00:04:30,431
the increase in pH

108
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:33,069
also results in the increase
of ammonia concentrations

109
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:35,892
that can contribute to further
pathogen inactivation.

110
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:38,815
Lime can be addible to liquid,

111
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:41,595
sludge, and also sludge following
the watering.

112
00:04:41,795 --> 00:04:44,167
Addition of lime
to more liquid faecal sludge

113
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,484
has the added benefit

114
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:47,921
it could improve
solid-liquid separation processes.

115
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,022
During laboratory research
that we conducted

116
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,062
together with our research partners
in Dakar,

117
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:56,338
lime improved dewatering by 90-95%

118
00:04:56,538 --> 00:04:59,083
compared to an untreated control
without lime.

119
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:02,361
This can reduce the time and space
required for dewatering,

120
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:04,480
for example
on unplanted drying beds.

121
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,754
The dosage of lime
to adequately raise the pH

122
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,265
is an important design
and operational parameter

123
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:11,485
for lime treatment.

124
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,869
The average dosage of several
lime treatment applications

125
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,926
in the United States
with septic tank sludge,

126
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,598
and also application in Philippines

127
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:21,669
was 20% lime per dry mass of sludge.

128
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:24,615
In one study in Blantyre, Malawi,

129
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:28,835
addition to 20-35% lime
per dry mass of sludge

130
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,290
was successful
in increasing the pH to 12.

131
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:34,827
As lime is dosed
as a function of total solids

132
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:36,231
and they can be variable

133
00:05:36,368 --> 00:05:38,418
and also the chemical
characteristics of sludge

134
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,160
can be variable
that influence lime treatment

135
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,084
it is always important to determine

136
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:46,424
the required dosage based
on a local sludge characteristic.

137
00:05:46,624 --> 00:05:50,127
This can be done by a simple
bench and pilot scale experiment

138
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:52,731
where different amounts of lime
are added to faecal sludge

139
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,267
as shown here
in the Philippines.

140
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:57,501
Following mixing of the lime
and the faecal sludge,

141
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,090
the pH can be monitored over time
with a handheld pH meter.

142
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,874
This picture shows an example
of lime treatment

143
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,150
of a septic tank faecal sludge
in the Philippines.

144
00:06:06,338 --> 00:06:08,559
The workers are adding lime
in a mixing tank
The workers are adding lime
in a mixing tank

145
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:10,508
to the faecal sludge in powder form,

146
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,428
or a slurry prepared with water.

147
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:15,866
Lime is highly corrosive
for infrastructure and equipment

148
00:06:16,066 --> 00:06:19,544
and personal protective equipment
such as safety goggles, boots,

149
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,641
long-sleeve clothes and face masks
should always be worn.

150
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,449
This is because the same process

151
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,505
that increase the pH
in faecal sludge,

152
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:29,666
also increase the pH
most surface in humans,

153
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,091
such as the skin, eyes and lungs.

154
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,010
Following addition of lime,

155
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,540
thorough mixing is required

156
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,722
to ensure contact
of faecal sludge with lime.

157
00:06:37,922 --> 00:06:39,519
As shown in this picture,

158
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:40,943
this can be done manually,

159
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,207
but mechanical mixing
can be more effective

160
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:45,771
and has the potential
to produce higher pH values

161
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:47,393
at the same lime dosage.

162
00:06:47,593 --> 00:06:51,659
So how effective is lime treatment
in the inactivation of pathogens?

163
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,941
In one study in Blantyre,

164
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:56,114
and in another study
in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,

165
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:58,802
additional lime reduced
equal concentrations

166
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,855
below the limits recommended
by the World Health Organization

167
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,483
for use in agriculture.

168
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:06,871
However, knowledge from lime
treatment of waste water sludge

169
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,843
is (INAUDIBLE) because Helminth eggs
and more persistent bacteria,

170
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:13,583
treatment may require longer
storage durations at a high pH.

171
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,258
Also the effectiveness
of a pathogen inactivation

172
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,086
will depend on the type
of the pathogen

173
00:07:19,286 --> 00:07:22,804
and the initial concentration
of pathogens in a local context.

174
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:26,418
It is always important to assess
the inactivation of pathogens

175
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:30,068
as a function of pH and time
for the local context.

176
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:33,991
Wrong assumptions can have
a severe public health impact.

177
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:38,634
Lime treatment has the benefit
that is relatively quick, robust

178
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,865
and effective
for pathogen inactivation.

179
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:43,193
It also has a small
treatment footprint.

180
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:45,987
All of these characteristics
also make it suitable

181
00:07:46,187 --> 00:07:47,715
for emergency situations.

182
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,331
However it is important
to consider these benefits

183
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:52,547
and balance them
with the operating cost,

184
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,782
which are mainly
purchase of the lime.

185
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:58,224
Price for lime can vary
considerably between countries.

186
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:02,331
For example, in the Philippines
of price 150-100 dollars per tonne,

187
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:04,970
in Senegal of 250 dollars per tonne,

188
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,294
and in Malawi of 800 US dollars
per tonne has been reported

189
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:09,401
in the literature.

190
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,373
Lime treatment inhibits
biological process

191
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:15,316
in half of the pathogens
by increasing the pH.

192
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:19,802
It is important to consider that
this process can only be temporary

193
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:24,018
and pathogen regrowth might occur
if the pH drop below 11.

194
00:08:24,218 --> 00:08:25,541
For example during storage,

195
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,243
transport, or use
of the treatment product.

196
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:33,412
Pathogen in incubation
only remain safe at a pH of 12.

197
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,990
Another important consideration,

198
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,823
is that lime treatment
does not reduce the sludge volume,

199
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:40,861
as for example (INAUDIBLE) digestion.

200
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,231
In contrast,

201
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:44,594
the addition of lime increase
the mass of sludge

202
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:46,798
that needs to be managed
and disposed.

203
00:08:47,623 --> 00:08:50,868
It is also important to consider
the characteristics of the sludge

204
00:08:51,018 --> 00:08:52,134
following lime treatment

205
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:54,947
as it can influence
subsequent treatment steps

206
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:56,781
and resource recovery.

207
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,448
Co-composting, for example,

208
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,723
is based on microorganisms
that inhibited the lime treatment

209
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,057
and the high pH
following lime treatment

210
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,261
may not be beneficial
for all soils.

211
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,044
Lime is also inorganic

212
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,844
and therefore doesn't contribute
to the fuel value,

213
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:14,256
which means that lime treatment
uses the energy value

214
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:17,024
for it to recover (INAUDIBLE) solid fuels.

215
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,313
In this module,

216
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,454
we introduced lime
and ammonia treatment,

217
00:09:21,654 --> 00:09:24,120
that are two technologies
for pathogen inactivation.

218
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,148
In both treatment technologies,

219
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:29,669
the toxicity of ammonia nitrogen
and a high pH

220
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,137
are the main mechanisms
for pathogen inactivation.

221
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:36,044
The effect of these technologies
for pathogen inactivation

222
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:38,718
will depend on the type
of concentration of pathogens

223
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:42,250
the dosage of lime and ammonia
required to produce environments

224
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,787
that are toxic to pathogens,
and the contact time.

225
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:48,852
For long-term operations
of these treatments

226
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,167
it is important to consider
that both technologies

227
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,976
rely on reliable supply of ammonia

228
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,983
in the form of urine urea and lime.
