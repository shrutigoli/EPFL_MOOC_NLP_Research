1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,681
How can we contribute

2
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:08,526
to establishing an affordable
faecal sludge collection service

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:10,139
for neighborhoods like this?

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:12,937
Where sanitation needs
are mostly met by pit latrines.

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,209
They produce sludge
with a high viscosity. 

6
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:18,377
That is difficult to be pumped,
and accessed by vacuum trucks.

7
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:19,848
In this module,

8
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:21,248
we will look at the few advances

9
00:00:21,323 --> 00:00:24,387
that  work toward making sludge
collection in this context possible.

10
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,423
Following this module,

11
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:29,248
you will be able to list
innovative collection technologies,

12
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,177
name examples of how the design

13
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:34,561
and operation of on-site sanitation
technologies can ease collection,

14
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:37,366
and explain
what container-based sanitation is.

15
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:40,947
Faecal sludge can have a very high
solid content,

16
00:00:41,147 --> 00:00:42,207
a high viscosity. 

17
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,739
As shown here in Lusaka, in Zambia.

18
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,739
Which makes
collection vacuum trucks,

19
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,453
or vacutug,
not possible.

20
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:49,691
In addition,

21
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:52,354
sludge with these characteristics
is often located in areas

22
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:54,069
where they're difficult to access

23
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:56,546
because of the topography,
settlement density,

24
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:57,968
or poor road conditions.

25
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,168


26
00:01:00,963 --> 00:01:02,034
In the following,

27
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:05,255
we will look at three technologies
that were developed for such sludge

28
00:01:05,455 --> 00:01:07,454
that has a high solid content
and viscosity.

29
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:08,930
Searching the internet,

30
00:01:09,055 --> 00:01:10,377
you'll find other technologies

31
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:11,201
such as the MAPET

32
00:01:11,276 --> 00:01:13,587
or the manually operated
diaphragm pump

33
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,700
that could be suitable
for your situation.

34
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,021
The Rammer is one example
of such a technology.

35
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:22,382
and was developed based on operation
experience with the Gulper

36
00:01:22,495 --> 00:01:23,745
in several countries.

37
00:01:23,945 --> 00:01:26,898
The Rammers therefore
also referred to as the Gulper II.

38
00:01:27,098 --> 00:01:30,744
This slide shows the Gulper
and Rammer next to each other.

39
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,313
In contrast to the Gulper,

40
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,336
where the sludge is sucked
through a cylinder

41
00:01:34,536 --> 00:01:36,807
the Rammer lifts sludge
with a raising cylinder.

42
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:40,276
The Rammer is an improvement
of the Gulper in several ways.

43
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:44,431
Firstly, the connecting rods
are located outside of the Rammer.

44
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,544
And it has a lever on,
which makes operations easier.

45
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:49,047
Secondly,

46
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:52,140
the cylinder of the Rammer 
can be extended up to 3 meters.

47
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,004
Whereas it's only 1.5 meter
were possible with the Gulper.

48
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:57,384
This means that sludge
can be collected

49
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,985
from deeper onsite
sanitation technologies.

50
00:02:00,185 --> 00:02:03,185


51
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:04,049
This video shows the Rammer
in operation in Kampala.

52
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,296
A third benefit of the Rammer

53
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:08,528
is that a hosepipe can be connected
to the Rammer,

54
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,078
which makes direct lifting
for transport possible,

55
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:12,979
and increase the protection
of workers. 

56
00:02:13,813 --> 00:02:15,977
Another technology that
has been developed 

57
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,975
for removal of sludge
with a high viscosity,

58
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,868
is the screw auger,
also called excrevator,

59
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:25,117
that has been piled among others
in South Africa, Malawi and India.

60
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,462
As shown in this picture,

61
00:02:26,662 --> 00:02:29,078
a screw auger lifts
the sludge with a screw,

62
00:02:29,278 --> 00:02:30,675
that is located in a pipe.

63
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:34,691
The screw is rotated by a motor
that is located at the top.

64
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:37,797
As also shown in this picture here,

65
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:39,886
the excrevator is placed
on a dolly frame

66
00:02:40,086 --> 00:02:42,032
to increase mobility
and accessibility

67
00:02:42,232 --> 00:02:43,959
of onsite sanitation technologies.

68
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,120
This picture shows the excrevator
in operation in Durban.

69
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,756
As you can see,

70
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:52,374
the outlet of the excrevator
is connected to a hose

71
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,799
which transport it
to a collection container.

72
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,472
The third technology that we would
like to introduce in this module

73
00:02:59,672 --> 00:03:01,429
is the evac.
Shown in this picture.

74
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,429


75
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,379
It is a small vacuum pump located 
on a two-wheel trolley frame.

76
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:08,377
The sludge is collected in the wide
vacuum cylinder.

77
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:10,524
Once these (INAUDIBLE)
is full,

78
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,630
the sludge has to be removed
from the cylinders

79
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,797
before sludge collection
can be continued.

80
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:19,787
This picture shows the evac
in operation in Kigali, in Rwanda.

81
00:03:19,987 --> 00:03:21,210
As you can see,

82
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,114
with a similar power compared
to a small vacuum truck

83
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:27,580
the evac is much smaller
and still mobile for use in areas

84
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,196
with a difficult topography, 

85
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:31,720
poor road conditions
or narrow lanes.

86
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:35,538
A problem for the operation
of all these technologies,

87
00:03:35,738 --> 00:03:36,776
is solid waste 

88
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:39,785
that is frequently disposed of
in onsite sanitation technologies.

89
00:03:40,535 --> 00:03:42,794
Screens at the inlet
of these technologies,

90
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:44,547
such as shown here for the Rammer,

91
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:47,237
can prevent damaging
of the collection technology.

92
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:50,195
But do lead to clogging
and stop the collection process.

93
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,358
As shown in this video from Kampala,

94
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:56,368
A metal rod is frequently used
to remove solid waste

95
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,041
before using sludge
collection technologies.

96
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,638
Or as shown here,

97
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:04,175
from Durban, it needs to be removed
by shovels.

98
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:09,190
Removal of solid waste can be
a very time-consuming activity.

99
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,232
Also, the solid waste requires
management following removal,

100
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:15,111


101
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:15,206
which is likely contains pathogens

102
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,931
and puts workers,
health and safety at risk.

103
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:21,895
The disposal of solid waste
into onsite sanitation technologies

104
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,338
is one example of how
the design and operation 

105
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:28,598
of onsite sanitation technologies
can influence sludge collection.

106
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:31,596
Sludge collection could
for example be improved,

107
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:34,496
by the implementation of different
drop holes for pit latrines,

108
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,665
that do not allow large pieces
of solid waste to enter the pit.

109
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,236
This shown here in a picture
from Kampala.

110
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:41,847
In addition,

111
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:45,110
solid waste should be kept outside
of onsite sanitation technologies,

112
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,504
by implementation
of solid waste management,

113
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,336
or the education of users.

114
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:53,069
Ultimately, removal of solid waste
before sludge collection

115
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:56,574
will increase the service fee
the household has to pay

116
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,364
through collection service provider.

117
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,384
This could be a financial incentive
for change.

118
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,709
Next to solid waste,

119
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:06,383
an access point
to the onsite sanitation technology

120
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,504
can be a constraint for collection.

121
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:10,121
For pit latrines,

122
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:12,553
where sludge might get collected
through the drop hole,

123
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,850
the drop hole potential
needs to be increased

124
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,936
which may affect
its future functionality.

125
00:05:17,136 --> 00:05:19,240
This picture shows an example

126
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,319
of how an access point
was integrated

127
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,526
into the design
of a pit latrine in Kampala.

128
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,132
The access point is located here.

129
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:28,171
And allows easy sludge collection,

130
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:32,515
without affecting the integrity
and functionality of the structure.

131
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,410
This pit is also
fully lined.

132
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,819
This ensure ground water
protection

133
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:38,508
and that sludge can be collected

134
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,887
without risking the collapse
of the pit.

135
00:05:41,087 --> 00:05:43,207
Fecal sludge is mostly water,

136
00:05:43,407 --> 00:05:44,853
which is heavy to transport.

137
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,132
Keeping the water outside
of onsite sanitation technologies,

138
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:51,011
for example in (INAUDIBLE)
dry toilets,

139
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,927
could be another way to facilitate
sludge collection.

140
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:58,505
If (INAUDIBLE) separating dry toilet 
are connected to a collection service

141
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:01,825
they become referred to
as "container based sanitation".

142
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:04,891
This is currently being piloted
in several countries,

143
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,933
for example Haiti, Kenya and Ghana.

144
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,682
This picture shows an example

145
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:13,807
of such an onsite sanitation
technology in Kenya.

146
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,319
The faeces are collected
in the container in the back,

147
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,028
and the urine
in the container at the front.

148
00:06:20,228 --> 00:06:21,896
Every few days,

149
00:06:22,096 --> 00:06:24,041
these containers are then replaced

150
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,213
by empty containers
and transported for treatment.

151
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:30,503
This picture shows such containers

152
00:06:30,703 --> 00:06:34,245
for replacement and collection
of the full containers in Ghana.

153
00:06:35,707 --> 00:06:39,216
In this module we introduce to three
innovative technologies

154
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:41,238
that could contribute
to sludge collection

155
00:06:41,438 --> 00:06:42,630
in urban poor areas 

156
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,610
with difficult accessibility,
topography,

157
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,031
and with sludge that has
a high solid content and viscosity.

158
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,949
These were the rammer,

159
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,972
the excrevator and the evac.

160
00:06:53,172 --> 00:06:56,183
In addition to these
collection technologies,

161
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:59,344
keeping solid waste out
