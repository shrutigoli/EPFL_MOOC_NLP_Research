1
00:00:04,687 --> 00:00:08,187
Imagine you and your family had a
peanut farm.

2
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:10,184
What would you do with the peanuts?

3
00:00:10,384 --> 00:00:15,447
Peanuts can be roasted and eaten,
used to make oil, butter or flour

4
00:00:15,647 --> 00:00:20,469
or even used in industrial 
products like paint, oil, soap

5
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,992
or cellulose for paper. Would you
sell the products raw? 

6
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:28,398
At the local market? To an
industrial manufacturer?

7
00:00:28,592 --> 00:00:32,464
Would you invest in machinery to
refine them yourselves?

8
00:00:32,664 --> 00:00:36,240
One thing you probably do know,
is if you wanted advice on how to

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,785
make this decision, would you seek
out a sanitary engineer? 

10
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,620
Probably not.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,974
Following this module, you will
find out how you could answer those

12
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:49,490
type of questions for the products
from fecal sludge management.

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,514
At the end of the module, you'll
be able to explain how to implement

14
00:00:53,714 --> 00:00:57,315
market driven approach and 
understand how this kind of tool

15
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:01,528
fits into an integrated engineering
design approach.

16
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,779
We wanna to know more about markets
for products that could be made from

17
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,911
treated fecal sludge. Realizing that
we're engineers, we consulted

18
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:14,001
experts in merging markets, 
financial models and business

19
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:18,370
development to develop a method
for the quantitative evaluation

20
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,855
of potential products resulting from
the treatment of fecal sludge.

21
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,986
This method is called the market 
driven approach.

22
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,411
And the developed manual and 
calculation tool can be downloaded

23
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,452
from our website. The manual 
contains all supporting info

24
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,364
for the implementation of this
method.

25
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:40,524
In the absence of clear legal
frameworks for fecal sludge

26
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:45,118
treatment products, identifying the
greatest market attractiveness 

27
00:01:45,318 --> 00:01:48,768
provides a method to help select
products of treatment.

28
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:52,155
Once treatment products are 
identified, then treatment

29
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:57,895
performance goals can be defined for
safe end use to ensure protection

30
00:01:58,095 --> 00:02:01,156
of public and environmental health.

31
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:05,309
In addition to greatest potential
to generate revenue, this can also

32
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,776
help ensure the design of adequate
treatment, and promote sustainable

33
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:14,609
operation as plant managers have
to meet customer demand.

34
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:19,506
In a market driven approach, market
attractiveness takes into account

35
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:24,877
both the current market volume and a
future for potential market growth. 

36
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:29,897
Market volume is defined as the sum
of the value of all available

37
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:35,143
products in a given market. For
example, for animal feed that

38
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:39,702
would be the price and number of
units sold in a defined geographical

39
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:45,229
area. Market growth is defined as
the growth of the type of product

40
00:02:45,429 --> 00:02:49,547
over a specified period. As this
cannot yet be determined,

41
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:54,682
the historical growth of a product
can be extrapolated to estimate

42
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,778
future growth. 

43
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:01,060
A major difficulty with determining
market attractiveness of fecal

44
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,635
sludge treatment products is that
due to the general luck of fecal

45
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:09,117
sludge treatment products don't yet
exist. And, hence, the markets for

46
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:14,921
them also do not exist. To deal with
this, we use proxies, they can help

47
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:19,898
us to estimate market variables.
To do this, we're no longer thinking

48
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:23,570
as engineers, and we're not thinking
about what type of treatment

49
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,415
technologies we would use. 
First, we focus on the type of

50
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:32,832
resource recovery that can be 
achieved. Energy, food, material

51
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:35,510
nutrients, or water. 

52
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,344
Then we think about what type of
products could fill that resource

53
00:03:39,544 --> 00:03:45,465
need. For example, solid fuels vs
liquid fuels. Or soil conditioners

54
00:03:45,665 --> 00:03:51,197
vs fertilizers. Then we think of the
form that treatment products could

55
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:56,169
take to fill that need. For example,
animal feed could be produced

56
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,394
by black soldier fly larvae,
fish from aquaculture, or

57
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:03,643
plants from drying beds. 

58
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,317
Maybe that all sounds a bit
abstract. So, let's look at a real

59
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:12,112
life example from Kampala, Uganda
to understand a bit more how this

60
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,756
method can be implemented.

61
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:18,571
The first step is to review the
list of fecal sludge treatment

62
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,604
products. 

63
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:24,864
From this list we want to decide
what treatment products are actually

64
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:30,003
relevant for our city. In Kampala,
all these products could potentially

65
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:34,070
be produced from treatment of
fecal sludge. 

66
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,409
The second step is defining the 
product application. 

67
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:41,641
Ask yourself, where can these
products be used?

68
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,858
In which industry? Or is it used on
a household level?

69
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:50,324
Then list each application. For 
example, In Kampala, the product

70
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:55,264
solid fuel is used for cooking and
households and is also used to

71
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,370
feed in the brick factories. 

72
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:02,804
The third step is defining products
that are currently used.

73
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:06,345
Because faecal sludge treatment
products do not exist yet,

74
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:10,299
we cannot identify their market 
volume directly. So, for example,

75
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:16,711
as a solid fuel in Kampala, currently
charcoal, firewood, coffee husks

76
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:21,650
are used. These are substitute 
products that could be replaced by

77
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,322
dried faecal sludge. 

78
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:28,743
In the forth step we calculate the
current market volume for each

79
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:33,360
substitute product. To do this, we
review literature and conduct

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,980
 interviews. So, to calculate the
market volume, you could have

81
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,566
the average price per product times
the number of product sold in a city.

82
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:49,468
Alternatively, you could have the
average price per products

83
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:56,166
times the number of products
sold by suppliers times the number

84
00:05:56,366 --> 00:06:02,035
of suppliers in the city. In Kampala
the market volume for charcoal was

85
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:05,235
found to be approximately
73 million.

86
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:10,167
You typically cannot calculate in
exact number, but this method

87
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:14,340
can give you a reasonable estimation
with the aim to be as accurate as

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,902
possible with further crosschecking.

89
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:22,913
The fifth step is assessing the
market growth for each substitute

90
00:06:23,113 --> 00:06:27,968
product. In some cases, there are
trend forecasts available.

91
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,919
In others, it's estimated by 
extrapolation from previous years

92
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:37,371
together with interviews. At the
time of our implementation the

93
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:42,497
estimated marked growth of charcoal
in Kampala was 9 %. 

94
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,369
In the final steps we compare the
market volume and the market growth

95
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:54,022
or each product. By combining
market volume and market growth

96
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:58,241
we can make a judgement as to
which product has the highest

97
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:05,026
market potential or market 
attractiveness.

98
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:10,229
Each substitute product identified
in step 3 is here.

99
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:14,219
The higher the combined market
growth and market volume,

100
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:16,913
the greater the market
attractiveness is.

101
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:22,219
In Kampala, the market for solid
fuel is very large and growing

102
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:25,240
rapidly compared to other treatment
products.

103
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,523
So, you could conclude, that faecal
sludge as a solid fuel has

104
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:34,935
the greatest market attractiveness.
in this case, charcoal release stands

105
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:40,306
out. This indicates that charcoal as
a treatment and product would be

106
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:42,824
a suitable choice. 

107
00:07:43,024 --> 00:07:46,162
So, now that you know how to
evaluate market attractiveness

108
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:50,297
a faecal sludge treatment products,
how can you use that information?

109
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:54,361
Just like your peanut farm, what is
important to remember is that

110
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,896
this information cannot be used in
isolation. 

111
00:07:58,096 --> 00:08:02,291
It needs to be incorporated into a
comprehensive design approach

112
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:05,726
for selection of treatment 
technologies to help make

113
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:10,276
intelligent design decisions. With
the number 1 goal always of

114
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,376
protecting public health. 

115
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:16,814
The engineering design approach is
not only about resource recovery.

116
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:20,683
So, you have to take this information
from the financial perspective of a

117
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:24,829
resource recovery. As just one tool
in a whole process.

118
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,318
Consider it with other factors.
Such as local laws and regulations

119
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:35,205
availability of financial resources,
human capacity, land area available

120
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:39,192
for treatment technologies and
the faecal sludge quantities and

121
00:08:39,392 --> 00:08:43,043
characteristics that will be coming
into treatment facilities.

122
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:48,119
All of these are discussed in more
detail in other modules.

123
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:53,135
The social and cultural acceptance
of treatment products is already

124
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:57,152
incorporated as part of the 
methodology. To further understand

125
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:00,529
the market driven approach we
recommend that you download it

126
00:09:00,729 --> 00:09:04,873
from our website and review it.
So, in summary, in this module

127
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:08,543
you learned about the market driven
approach. How it was developed from

128
00:09:08,743 --> 00:09:12,976
economic perspective. And how it 
fits into an integrated design

129
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:18,246
approach. Thank you for joining!
See you next time.
