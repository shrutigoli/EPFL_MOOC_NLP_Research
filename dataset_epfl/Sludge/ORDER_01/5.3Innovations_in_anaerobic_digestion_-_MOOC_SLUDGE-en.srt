1
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:08,027
What do you think is special
about the flame on this cookstove?

2
00:00:08,227 --> 00:00:11,496
It's filled by biogas
from the anaerobic digestion

3
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:13,496
 of faecal  sludge.

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:16,562
Following this module
you will be able to discuss

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,041
methane potential of faecal sludge,

6
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,966
understand concerns
with centralized treatment.

7
00:00:22,153 --> 00:00:25,441
and about the design overview
of digesters.

8
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:28,813
This module focuses 
on possible applications

9
00:00:29,013 --> 00:00:31,389
of anaerobic digestion
of faecal sludge.

10
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,770
It does not go into depth
on types of technologies,

11
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,364
other types of anaerobic treatment
or the fundamental science

12
00:00:39,564 --> 00:00:42,782
as that has been covered thoroughly
in many other publications.

13
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:45,694
<i>If you would like to learn more
about this topic</i>

14
00:00:45,894 --> 00:00:49,273
<i>I would recommend starting with
the anaerobic digestion modules</i>

15
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:51,960
<i>in the third week
of the Sandec MOOC</i>

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,134
<i>on municipal solid waste,</i>

17
00:00:54,334 --> 00:00:57,799
the Sandec publication
on anaerobic digestion

18
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:01,359
<i>and basic engineering textbook
on wastewater treatment.</i>

19
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,448
There's not been a lot of research
or implementation

20
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:08,990
of the anaerobic digestion 
of faecal sludge

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,117
compared to other more
well established technologies.

22
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:14,106
So what are the possibilities?

23
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,243
Let's start with methane potential,

24
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,312
the amount of methane produced
per gram of COD

25
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,508
which will depend on the level
of stabilization of the sludge.

26
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:26,989
So what does this mean
for faecal sludge?

27
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:29,022
Well, we cannot say conclusively 

28
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,157
because there are not a lot of results
for methane potential

29
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,208
of different types of faecal sludge.

30
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:37,550
But intuitively, one would guess
that fresh sludge

31
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,750
with very short retention times
in containment,

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,142
like many public toilets
or restaurants.

33
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:45,804
would have higher methane potential

34
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,474
than sludge that has been sitting
in a septic tank

35
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:51,674
for ten years,
undergoing digestion.

36
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:54,676
<i>These preliminary results
from researchers</i>

37
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,339
<i>at Cranfield University 
show the results</i>

38
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:01,739
<i>of biomethane potential
from 11 pit latrines,</i>

39
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,863
<i>two public toilets</i>

40
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:07,133
<i>and ten portable
or container-based toilets</i>

41
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,333
<i>compared to primary 
wastewater sludge.</i>

42
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:13,533
<i>They seem to indicate
that our intuition is correct</i>

43
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,455
<i>but based on that
we also would've predicted</i>

44
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:18,902
<i>the public ablution blocks
would've had</i>

45
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,733
<i>higher methane potential.</i>

46
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,441
<i>This highlights the need
for further research</i>

47
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:26,009
<i>and also more results
to confirm</i>

48
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,125
<i>whether results are
due to factors</i>

49
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:30,817
<i>such as the seed
that was used for the test.</i>

50
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,047
<i>This graph show the variability 
of methane potential</i>

51
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,314
<i>just from the pit latrine samples
used in the study.</i>

52
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:42,604
<i>This is also not surprising
since we know that faecal sludge</i>

53
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:44,392
<i>is highly variable.</i>

54
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:47,426
<i>It also illustrates the need
for further research</i>

55
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,385
<i>if we are to better understand
the methane potential</i>

56
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:51,785
<i>of faecal sludge.</i>

57
00:02:51,985 --> 00:02:54,621
So what does this mean
for the anaerobic digestion

58
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,263
of faecal sludge?

59
00:02:56,463 --> 00:03:00,007
I'm going to make a division
of three levels of implementation

60
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,391
based on the scale,
the degree of centralization,

61
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:07,195
the required management level
and operational skill.

62
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,359
<i>A high level 
for all of these categories</i>

63
00:03:10,559 --> 00:03:11,750
<i>is centralized,</i>

64
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,096
<i>like digesters
that are commonly found</i>

65
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,955
<i>at large centralized
wastewater treatment plants</i>

66
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,570
<i>for the digestion
of wastewater sludge.</i>

67
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,834
<i>Medium is community scale.</i>

68
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:25,154
<i>Reactors that
are not fully optimized</i>

69
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:28,342
<i>for operational parameters
and treatment performance,</i>

70
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,946
<i>so require less operation
and capacity.</i>

71
00:03:32,096 --> 00:03:34,549
<i>And low are
household-level systems</i>

72
00:03:34,749 --> 00:03:38,873
<i>that are seen in rural areas,
which are small, passive systems</i>

73
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:41,318
<i>mainly treating manure
and food waste </i>

74
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,003
<i>with some co-treatment
of faecal sludge.</i>

75
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,338
<i>There are millions
of implementations</i>

76
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:48,212
<i>in India and China</i>

77
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:50,873
<i>with mixed results 
when applied in other areas.</i>

78
00:03:51,073 --> 00:03:53,396
<i>I'm not going to cover
household examples</i>

79
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,985
<i>in this module
as it's not relevant</i>

80
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:58,991
<i>for our focus 
on dense urban areas.</i>

81
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,530
So what about the possibility
of operating

82
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,141
large centralized
anaerobic digesters

83
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:06,906
for faecal sludge?

84
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:08,964
Well, it hasn't been done before,

85
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:12,648
but to evaluate the feasibility
one of the first questions is 

86
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:15,398
will there be enough
methane potential?

87
00:04:16,276 --> 00:04:20,571
These are some basic considerations
for designing an anaerobic digester.

88
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:25,667
<i>First, you know 
the temperature</i>

89
00:04:25,855 --> 00:04:27,997
<i>at the ambient air.</i>

90
00:04:28,197 --> 00:04:31,150
<i>Then you have your reactor</i>

91
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:33,699
<i>and you know the temperature</i>

92
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,002
<i>you want to operate
the reactor at.</i>

93
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:38,470
<i>For example, mesophilic.</i>

94
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,887
<i>You can also then select
your solid's retention time</i>

95
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:44,666
<i>based on your treatment
objectives.</i>

96
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:47,240
<i>You know your lodines.</i>

97
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,440
<i>What's gonna be coming
into the reactor.</i>

98
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:55,842
<i>The total solids concentration
and mass loading of the sludge.</i>

99
00:04:56,536 --> 00:05:00,527
<i>You also know
the degradability of the sludge.</i>

100
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,099
<i>Based on this,</i>

101
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:06,009
<i>then you can calculate 
the reactor volume</i>

102
00:05:06,209 --> 00:05:09,541
<i>and you can also calculate
the amount of biogas</i>

103
00:05:09,741 --> 00:05:13,568
<i>that will be produced, including
the methane concentrations.</i>

104
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:17,092
<i>You can then evaluate</i>

105
00:05:17,292 --> 00:05:19,315
<i>whether or not</i>

106
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:21,280
<i>the methane that's produced</i>

107
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,645
<i>is going to be adequate
to generate heat</i>

108
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,153
<i>to bring the reactor
up to the necessary</i>

109
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,374
<i>operating temperature.</i>

110
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:33,574
<i>The problem is, we don't,
with faecal sludge</i>

111
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:37,124
<i>have reliable data
for the degradability.</i>

112
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:40,514
The temperature is critical
as it affects the growth

113
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:42,539
of methanogenic bacteria.

114
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:47,332
At lower operating temperatures
you need much longer retention times

115
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:49,692
or they cannot grow in the reactor.

116
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:52,634
They will be washed out
and you will not get treatment.

117
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:58,038
Primary wastewater sludge is
around 75% to 85% degradable.

118
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,728
And secondary sludge,
around 70% to 80%.

119
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,765
If the sludge is not
degradable enough

120
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:08,608
there will not be enough methane
production to heat the reactor.

121
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:12,090
<i>This is even more of a concern
if you want to operate</i>

122
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,191
<i>at thermophilic temperatures
for pathogen reduction.</i>

123
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,996
<i>Required temperatures and SRTs
for digesting a faecal sludge</i>

124
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:22,775
<i>are questions
that need further research.</i>

125
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:26,468
<i>An additional problem
that is just as difficult</i>

126
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,668
<i>is that anaerobic digestion is
easily upset.</i>

127
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,100
<i>And as we know, faecal sludge
is highly variable.</i>

128
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,463
What are things
that can upset a reactor?

129
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,464
Toxics, like nickel or zinc,
phenolic compounds

130
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:45,017
or even high concentrations
of free ammonia.

131
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:49,092
PH, a build-up
of volatile fatty acids,

132
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:52,292
fats oils and grease,
and shock loadings

133
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,648
resulting in a rapid change
of the digester contents.

134
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:59,922
If a large scale
centralized reactor is upset,

135
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:02,329
 it is a management nightmare.

136
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,754
Potentially what all of this means
for the anaerobic digestions

137
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:08,492
of faecal sludge
at a centralized scale

138
00:07:08,664 --> 00:07:11,354
is that it could only be applied
with codigestion

139
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:14,892
with other organic waste streams
that are more degradable.

140
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,871
And in small concentrations
relative to the other organics

141
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:23,001
to dampen the variability
of faecal sludge going into a reactor.

142
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:25,871
Examples could be brewery wastes,

143
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:28,430
spent grain,
market waste,

144
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,426
or even wastewater sludge.

145
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,705
Community-scale digester
are easier to operate 

146
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:37,081
because they are not
optimized for space,

147
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:40,281
temperature, gas production,
or treatment capacity,

148
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:43,970
but provide an option that is
potentially better septic tanks

149
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,390
or other types
of anaerobic treatment

150
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,774
as they are designed to capture
biogas for resource recovery

151
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:52,482
and reduce greenhouse emissions.

152
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,503
CDD and BORDA have implemented
community-scale systems

153
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:00,453
in India, Nepal and Tanzania. 

154
00:08:00,653 --> 00:08:03,192
There are not yet enough
operational results

155
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:05,652
for detailed design recommendations,

156
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,226
but hey have been sized
up to a maximum

157
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:10,056
of a 6 meter diameter,

158
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,206
based on solids concentrations

159
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,912
collection capacity
and frequency of emptiers.

160
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,953
Solids and hydraulics
retention times

161
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:21,153
are requirements for affluent
and solids treatments.

162
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,786
<i>This is the schematic
for an anaerobic digester</i>

163
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:29,298
<i>built and operated by BORDA
in the Mlalakua area</i>

164
00:08:29,498 --> 00:08:31,621
<i>of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</i>

165
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:35,777
The capacity of the plan
was based on estimations

166
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:39,608
from operating a similar reactor
in the Kigamboni neighborhood

167
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:43,202
with the collection and transport
of faecal sludge for the community,

168
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,026
as shown here.

169
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:48,389
The size of the digester 
was also based

170
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:50,421
on the available land area

171
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,821
and the desired 
complexity of operation

172
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,719
so that it could operate
at a community scale.

173
00:08:57,217 --> 00:09:00,800
<i>The resulting design capacity is
five cubic meters a day</i>

174
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,862
<i>or what is thought to be</i>

175
00:09:03,062 --> 00:09:06,493
<i>twenty thousand
population equivalents.</i>

176
00:09:07,903 --> 00:09:10,681
<i>This is the access road.</i>

177
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:14,862
<i>First, there is 30 square meters
for receiving station</i>

178
00:09:15,062 --> 00:09:16,819
<i>for the trucks to discharge,</i>

179
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,019
<i>then there is another
five square meters</i>

180
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:22,114
<i>for the screening of the sludge.</i>

181
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:26,773
<i>The dome is constructed to be 
50 cubic meters</i>

182
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:32,337
<i>with the expansion chamber, 
another 21 cubic meters.</i>

183
00:09:33,546 --> 00:09:37,559
<i>The liquid from the reactor
then goes to an anaerobic filter.</i>

184
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,757
<i>The sludge goes here
to drying beds</i>

185
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,957
<i>which take up another
55 square meters.</i>

186
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,908
<i>And then, the liquid
from the drying beds</i>

187
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,899
<i>and the anaerobic filters
goes here</i>

188
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:56,297
<i>to a banana plantation.</i>

189
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,494
<i>which takes up another
170 square meters.</i>

190
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,838
<i>Here are some pictures
of what it looks like.</i>

191
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,046
<i>The gate coming
into the facility.</i>

192
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:07,995
<i>The receiving bay.</i>

193
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:12,043
<i>Bar screen cover up the dome
and expansion chamber.</i>

194
00:10:12,749 --> 00:10:14,849
<i>The covered drying beds</i>

195
00:10:16,571 --> 00:10:18,368
<i>and the banana plantation.</i>

196
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:24,064
For more information,  please refer 
to the CDD and BORDA websites

197
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:26,427
and this biogas curriculum,

198
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,627
a tool for trainers to train
masons and technicians

199
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,114
on the complexities of the gas-tight
construction of digesters.

200
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:38,604
In summary,
benefits of anaerobic digestion

201
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,377
include reduced sludge
and required footprint

202
00:10:41,577 --> 00:10:43,570
compared to aerobic treatment,

203
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,770
reduces methane and sludge
for resource recovery,

204
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,066
it can destroy pathogens depending
on the operating conditions.

205
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:55,341
And drawbacks include
that the process is easily upset.

206
00:10:56,327 --> 00:11:00,341
It operates best at controlled
and consistent conditions

207
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,874
and it requires knowledge 
and skill for operation.

208
00:11:04,074 --> 00:11:07,074
In this module we learned about
the methane potential

209
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,706
of faecal sludge, and the design
and operating concerns

210
00:11:10,906 --> 00:11:13,670
with centralized 
and decentralised treatment.

211
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,445
Thanks for joining.

212
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,007
See you next time.
