1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:03,842


2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:07,026
If I told you, 
this is a picture of a man

3
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:09,951
transporting faecal sludge
in Nairobi, Kenya,

4
00:00:10,237 --> 00:00:13,099
from the site of collection
to a transfer station

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:15,699
for delivery to treatment.
Could you tell me

6
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:17,649
what's inside of his barrel?

7
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,907
In this model,  you'll learn
how to answer that question.

8
00:00:22,918 --> 00:00:25,868
Following this model, you'll
be able to distinguish

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,643
varieties of sludge.

10
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:31,368
Name factors influencing faecal
sludge characteristics,

11
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:35,418
and name the main constituents of 
faecal sludge related to treatment.

12
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:38,707
To better understand 
what fecal sludge is,

13
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,069
I think it is helpful to walk through
3 definitions.

14
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:45,994
Excreta, Faecal sludge, 
and waste water.

15
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:49,194
And what's different about them.

16
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:53,603
So excreta, is urine and faeces.

17
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,444
This is different than
faecal sludge

18
00:00:56,644 --> 00:01:01,656
which contains excreta,
but in addition

19
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:06,369
includes anything else that goes into
the on-site containment technology.

20
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,219
And anything else really means
anything else.

21
00:01:09,419 --> 00:01:13,544
From flush water, cleansing materials,
menstrual hygiene products,

22
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:16,856
(INAUDIBLE) your kitchen water,
garbage,

23
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,194
or municipal solid waste.

24
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:22,856
So this then, is the faecal sludge
management service chain.

25
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:26,921
<i>Waste water on the other hand,</i>

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:31,133
also contains excreta, 
but it is transported

27
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:34,496
via a flush toilet to a sewer.

28
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:38,847
And then transported via sewer
to a treatment plant.

29
00:01:40,263 --> 00:01:45,763
So waste water, and faecal sludge
have entirely different service chains.

30
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:49,292
In addition, waste water

31
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:52,167
contains less municipal 
solid waste or garbage,

32
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,017
because it is difficult to flush it
in the toilet.

33
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:59,614
And in addition, it can include
storm water management.

34
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,431
Another way to think about it,

35
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:05,856
is to think about 
different types of sludge.

36
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:09,074
Sludge...

37
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,180
could be transported in a sewer

38
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:16,054
and be part of the waste water
service chain.

39
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:17,892
Or, 

40
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:20,492
It could be transported
without a sewer

41
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:24,552
and be part of the faecal sludge 
management service chain.

42
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:28,372
Waste water sludge,

43
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:31,496
could be sewer sludge,

44
00:02:32,636 --> 00:02:35,211
while it's still been transported 
in the sewer.

45
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:38,292
Or it could be after 
it's been received

46
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,580
at a waste water treatment plant.

47
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:45,617
Examples of this could be
from a waste stabilization pond,

48
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:48,483
from activated sludge,

49
00:02:48,814 --> 00:02:51,114
or following final treatment

50
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:54,064
which is commonly referred 
to as Bio-solids.

51
00:02:55,168 --> 00:02:57,468
Types of on site technologies,

52
00:02:57,668 --> 00:03:00,018
Can include septic tanks,

53
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,154
and also

54
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,048
pit latrines.

55
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:09,887
Septic tank sludge

56
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:13,826
is also commonly referred 
to as septage. 

57
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,035
And it includes the sludge, that's
in the septic tank,

58
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,481
the scum layer,

59
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:24,953
And also the liquid 
that's in there

60
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,016
while it's been emptied.

61
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:31,108
So this chart, is not in
anyway comprehensive.

62
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:33,221
It's just to provide some examples

63
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:36,877
And show the reason why 
faecal sludge is so highly variable.

64
00:03:37,077 --> 00:03:40,440
Is it because it comes from 
the individual household level,

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,840
and is not homogenized 
during transport in the sewer.

66
00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:47,378
Also, it's so highly variable

67
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,228
because it means literally
any type of technology

68
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:54,540
that's not connected to the sewer. 
From dry toilets to flush toilets,

69
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,990
to with or without grey water.

70
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,952
What else contributes to 
the variability of faecal sludge?

71
00:04:01,268 --> 00:04:02,693
Things we've already mentioned

72
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:05,206
like pit latrines
versus septic tanks.

73
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:07,368
This is the type of containment.

74
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:11,431
What is going into the containment?
Is it excreta in black water?

75
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:13,716
With or without forms of grey water?

76
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:18,716
Meaning it can all be a slurry, or
mostly water, all the way to a semi solid.

77
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,541
This is the contents.

78
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:24,567
The emptying frequency which
affects level of stabilization.

79
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:28,005
For example public toilets, 
or commercial buildings,

80
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:31,942
where the containment is emptied
as frequently as daily to weekly.

81
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:35,755
In contrast to systems with emptying
frequencies of years.

82
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:40,198
This means that faecal sludge can
range from fresh, to raw,

83
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:41,911
to partially stabilized.

84
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,448
Which is due to 
the storage duration,

85
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:47,454
but also, how is it emptied?

86
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,667
Was it fully or partially emptied?

87
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,467
Was water added, to help
remove the sludge?

88
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,367
These are emptying practices.

89
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:57,269
Characteristics are also affected

90
00:04:57,469 --> 00:05:00,381
but if technologies are performing
as designed.

91
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:02,494
This is treatment performance.

92
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:07,394
How well technologies were constructed?
Are they lined or unlined?

93
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,219
Are they really water tight?

94
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,656
This is quality of construction.

95
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:15,518
Infiltration, or in flow 
from ground water,

96
00:05:16,133 --> 00:05:19,321
and temperature, which affects
(INAUDIBLE) degradation.

97
00:05:20,626 --> 00:05:24,601
So what does all this variability
actually mean in terms of quantification?

98
00:05:25,218 --> 00:05:28,480
This figure illustrates COD values

99
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:31,763
plotted against Total
Suspended Solids

100
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,100
to Volatile Suspended Solids

101
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,513
for faecal sludge analytical 
results.

102
00:05:36,713 --> 00:05:39,063
from some of SANDEC's 
research studies.

103
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:42,484
In comparison, it also shows values

104
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,629
for in-fluent of waste water
treatment plants

105
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:48,541
taken from the METCALF 
and EDDY reference. 

106
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:52,596
Note also, that it's in 
a logarithmic scale.

107
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:57,765
What you see here, is that faecal sludge
is up to 2 orders of magnitude

108
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:00,065
more concentrated than waste water

109
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:02,565
in addition to being highly variable.

110
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:06,753
The same technologies will have
widely ranging characteristics

111
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:08,790
in comparison to each other.

112
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,590
And areas within the same city will 
have widely ranging characteristics.

113
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:16,953
The main constituents 
of faecal sludge

114
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:20,828
that we will mostly focus on
in regards to treatment objectives

115
00:06:21,235 --> 00:06:25,673
are solids and moisture contents for 
de-watering and drying of faecal sludge.

116
00:06:26,146 --> 00:06:29,946
Forms of organic matter for
the stabilization of faecal sludge.

117
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:35,579
Nutrient management
and Inactivation of pathogens.

118
00:06:38,174 --> 00:06:40,737
Because there's still 
a general lack of information 

119
00:06:40,937 --> 00:06:42,724
on faecal sludge characteristics,

120
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,574
we thought it would be useful
to compile this report

121
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:49,499
of 76 samples that we analysed
in Kampala, Uganda.

122
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:54,267
The samples are presented in 
increasing concentrations of COD.

123
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:58,267
For each sample, there is a picture
of where the sample was taken,

124
00:06:58,654 --> 00:07:00,954
and what it looked like
in the laboratory.

125
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,329
There is characterisation 
information on solids,

126
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:08,533
nutrients, organics, and also
qualitative information.

127
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,821
Like how viscous did it appear?

128
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:14,271
And information on the type
and usage of on site containment.

129
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,803
You can see in these photos, how (INAUDIBLE)
the COD concentration

130
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,703
goes from 1,000 milligrams 
per litre,

131
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:24,903
to 9,000 milligrams per litre,

132
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,993
to 26,000 milligrams per litre.

133
00:07:29,193 --> 00:07:32,193
The visual appearance 
is also quite different.

134
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:36,856
Qualitatively, you can already get
a rough idea of characteristics

135
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:38,393
based on appearance.

136
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,981
Hopefully, you'll find
this report useful

137
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:44,581
to get an idea of the range of
faecal sludge characteristics.

138
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:47,619
It can be downloaded for free
on our website.

139
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,792
So now, if I ask you
what's in the barrel

140
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:53,917
that the man was transporting
in Nairobi?

141
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:57,217
Could you answer?
I hope so.

142
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,342
Actually, I hope your answer 
would have to do more 

143
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,455
with why you could not say
exactly what's in there.

144
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:05,042
Because faecal sludge means
so many things

145
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,555
but provides some insight as to
what could be in there.

146
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,455
Because in this model,  you learned
about the wide varieties

147
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,055
of different sludge types.

148
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:16,671
Factors influencing faecal sludge
characteristics,

149
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:20,571
and the main constituents of faecal
sludge related to treatment.

150
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,692
Thanks for joining.
See you next time.
