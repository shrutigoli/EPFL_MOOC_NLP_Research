What do you think is special about the flame on this cookstove?
It's filled by biogas from the anaerobic digestion
 of faecal  sludge.
Following this module you will be able to discuss methane potential of faecal sludge, understand concerns with centralized treatment. and about the design overview of digesters.
This module focuses on possible applications of anaerobic digestion of faecal sludge.
It does not go into depth on types of technologies, other types of anaerobic treatment or the fundamental science as that has been covered thoroughly in many other publications.
<i>If you would like to learn more about this topic</i>
<i>I would recommend starting with the anaerobic digestion modules</i>
<i>in the third week of the Sandec MOOC</i>
<i>on municipal solid waste,</i> the Sandec publication on anaerobic digestion
<i>and basic engineering textbook on wastewater treatment.</i>
There's not been a lot of research or implementation of the anaerobic digestion of faecal sludge compared to other more well established technologies.
So what are the possibilities?
Let's start with methane potential, the amount of methane produced per gram of COD which will depend on the level of stabilization of the sludge.
So what does this mean for faecal sludge?
Well, we cannot say conclusively because there are not a lot of results for methane potential of different types of faecal sludge.
But intuitively, one would guess that fresh sludge with very short retention times in containment, like many public toilets or restaurants. would have higher methane potential than sludge that has been sitting in a septic tank for ten years, undergoing digestion.
<i>These preliminary results from researchers</i>
<i>at Cranfield University show the results</i>
<i>of biomethane potential from 11 pit latrines,</i>
<i>two public toilets</i>
<i>and ten portable or container-based toilets</i>
<i>compared to primary wastewater sludge.</i>
<i>They seem to indicate that our intuition is correct</i>
<i>but based on that we also would've predicted</i>
<i>the public ablution blocks would've had</i>
<i>higher methane potential.</i>
<i>This highlights the need for further research</i>
<i>and also more results to confirm</i>
<i>whether results are due to factors</i>
<i>such as the seed that was used for the test.</i>
<i>This graph show the variability of methane potential</i>
<i>just from the pit latrine samples used in the study.</i>
<i>This is also not surprising since we know that faecal sludge</i>
<i>is highly variable.</i>
<i>It also illustrates the need for further research</i>
<i>if we are to better understand the methane potential</i>
<i>of faecal sludge.</i>
So what does this mean for the anaerobic digestion of faecal sludge?
I'm going to make a division of three levels of implementation based on the scale, the degree of centralization, the required management level and operational skill.
<i>A high level for all of these categories</i>
<i>is centralized,</i>
<i>like digesters that are commonly found</i>
<i>at large centralized wastewater treatment plants</i>
<i>for the digestion of wastewater sludge.</i>
<i>Medium is community scale.</i>
<i>Reactors that are not fully optimized</i>
<i>for operational parameters and treatment performance,</i>
<i>so require less operation and capacity.</i>
<i>And low are household-level systems</i>
<i>that are seen in rural areas, which are small, passive systems</i>
<i>mainly treating manure and food waste </i>
<i>with some co-treatment of faecal sludge.</i>
<i>There are millions of implementations</i>
<i>in India and China</i>
<i>with mixed results when applied in other areas.</i>
<i>I'm not going to cover household examples</i>
<i>in this module as it's not relevant</i>
<i>for our focus on dense urban areas.</i>
So what about the possibility of operating large centralized anaerobic digesters for faecal sludge?
Well, it hasn't been done before, but to evaluate the feasibility one of the first questions is will there be enough methane potential?
These are some basic considerations for designing an anaerobic digester.
<i>First, you know the temperature</i>
<i>at the ambient air.</i>
<i>Then you have your reactor</i>
<i>and you know the temperature</i>
<i>you want to operate the reactor at.</i>
<i>For example, mesophilic.</i>
<i>You can also then select your solid's retention time</i>
<i>based on your treatment objectives.</i>
<i>You know your lodines.</i>
<i>What's gonna be coming into the reactor.</i>
<i>The total solids concentration and mass loading of the sludge.</i>
<i>You also know the degradability of the sludge.</i>
<i>Based on this,</i>
<i>then you can calculate the reactor volume</i>
<i>and you can also calculate the amount of biogas</i>
<i>that will be produced, including the methane concentrations.</i>
<i>You can then evaluate</i>
<i>whether or not</i>
<i>the methane that's produced</i>
<i>is going to be adequate to generate heat</i>
<i>to bring the reactor up to the necessary</i>
<i>operating temperature.</i>
<i>The problem is, we don't, with faecal sludge</i>
<i>have reliable data for the degradability.</i>
The temperature is critical as it affects the growth of methanogenic bacteria.
At lower operating temperatures you need much longer retention times or they cannot grow in the reactor.
They will be washed out and you will not get treatment.
Primary wastewater sludge is around 75% to 85% degradable.
And secondary sludge, around 70% to 80%.
If the sludge is not degradable enough there will not be enough methane production to heat the reactor.
<i>This is even more of a concern if you want to operate</i>
<i>at thermophilic temperatures for pathogen reduction.</i>
<i>Required temperatures and SRTs for digesting a faecal sludge</i>
<i>are questions that need further research.</i>
<i>An additional problem that is just as difficult</i>
<i>is that anaerobic digestion is easily upset.</i>
<i>And as we know, faecal sludge is highly variable.</i>
What are things that can upset a reactor?
Toxics, like nickel or zinc, phenolic compounds or even high concentrations of free ammonia.
PH, a build-up of volatile fatty acids, fats oils and grease, and shock loadings resulting in a rapid change of the digester contents.
If a large scale centralized reactor is upset,
 it is a management nightmare.
Potentially what all of this means for the anaerobic digestions of faecal sludge at a centralized scale is that it could only be applied with codigestion with other organic waste streams that are more degradable.
And in small concentrations relative to the other organics to dampen the variability of faecal sludge going into a reactor.
Examples could be brewery wastes, spent grain, market waste, or even wastewater sludge.
Community-scale digester are easier to operate because they are not optimized for space, temperature, gas production, or treatment capacity, but provide an option that is potentially better septic tanks or other types of anaerobic treatment as they are designed to capture biogas for resource recovery and reduce greenhouse emissions.
CDD and BORDA have implemented community-scale systems in India, Nepal and Tanzania. 
There are not yet enough operational results for detailed design recommendations, but hey have been sized up to a maximum of a 6 meter diameter, based on solids concentrations collection capacity and frequency of emptiers.
Solids and hydraulics retention times are requirements for affluent and solids treatments.
<i>This is the schematic for an anaerobic digester</i>
<i>built and operated by BORDA in the Mlalakua area</i>
<i>of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</i>
The capacity of the plan was based on estimations from operating a similar reactor in the Kigamboni neighborhood with the collection and transport of faecal sludge for the community, as shown here.
The size of the digester was also based on the available land area and the desired complexity of operation so that it could operate at a community scale.
<i>The resulting design capacity is five cubic meters a day</i>
<i>or what is thought to be</i>
<i>twenty thousand population equivalents.</i>
<i>This is the access road.</i>
<i>First, there is 30 square meters for receiving station</i>
<i>for the trucks to discharge,</i>
<i>then there is another five square meters</i>
<i>for the screening of the sludge.</i>
<i>The dome is constructed to be 
50 cubic meters</i>
<i>with the expansion chamber, another 21 cubic meters.</i>
<i>The liquid from the reactor then goes to an anaerobic filter.</i>
<i>The sludge goes here to drying beds</i>
<i>which take up another
55 square meters.</i>
<i>And then, the liquid from the drying beds</i>
<i>and the anaerobic filters goes here</i>
<i>to a banana plantation.</i>
<i>which takes up another
170 square meters.</i>
<i>Here are some pictures of what it looks like.</i>
<i>The gate coming into the facility.</i>
<i>The receiving bay.</i>
<i>Bar screen cover up the dome and expansion chamber.</i>
<i>The covered drying beds</i>
<i>and the banana plantation.</i>
For more information,  please refer to the CDD and BORDA websites and this biogas curriculum, a tool for trainers to train masons and technicians on the complexities of the gas-tight construction of digesters.
In summary, benefits of anaerobic digestion include reduced sludge and required footprint compared to aerobic treatment, reduces methane and sludge for resource recovery, it can destroy pathogens depending on the operating conditions.
And drawbacks include that the process is easily upset.
It operates best at controlled and consistent conditions and it requires knowledge and skill for operation.
In this module we learned about the methane potential of faecal sludge, and the design and operating concerns with centralized and decentralised treatment.
