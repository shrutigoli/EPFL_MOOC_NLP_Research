00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello, and welcome to this module
on faecal sludge management planning.

2
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:11,290
If you're in charge
of putting in place

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,304
a faecal sludge management system
in a city like this, 

4
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:16,384
what should you do?

5
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,079
Where do you start?

6
00:00:18,857 --> 00:00:21,428
In this module, we will see
how to start

7
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:24,265
and how the different activities
fit together.

8
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:27,653
In the two next modules,
we will then look

9
00:00:27,765 --> 00:00:29,879
at the assessment
of the initial situation

10
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:33,738
and how to analyze and engage
the stakeholders in the planning process.

11
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:38,664
Later, the institutional, financial
and management aspects 

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,297
will be reviewed in more depth.

13
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:44,211
You may know me from our MOOC
on sanitation planning.

14
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:47,906
My name is Philippe Reymond
and I'm working at (INAUDIBLE)

15
00:00:48,106 --> 00:00:49,915
on the planning side of sanitation,

16
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,835
looking at which systems
are best appropriate for which context

17
00:00:54,072 --> 00:00:55,591
and the necessary conditions

18
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,005
for successful sanitation
projects and programs.

19
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:04,219
In this module, I will explain
what is an integrated planning approach

20
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,275
why you should follow
a participatory process

21
00:01:07,452 --> 00:01:09,697
and how it can fit
in the whole planning.

22
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:12,878
And finally, 
how the different activities

23
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,461
can be molded
into a coherent planning process.

24
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:19,331
Cities in low- 
and middle-income countries

25
00:01:19,406 --> 00:01:21,742
are often highly heterogeneous.

26
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,750
Roughly, we can distinguish

27
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,177
between middle- 
and high-income settlements.

28
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:30,323
informal settlements
and the peri-urban interface.

29
00:01:31,786 --> 00:01:33,681
We can add
to these three categories

30
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:35,556
the newly-planned urban areas.

31
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,547
Sometimes, the different contexts
are clearly separated

32
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:40,846
in large neighborhoods.

33
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,390
But sometimes,
they are also more scattered,

34
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,034
like some pockets.

35
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:49,169
Each context may require
different sanitation solutions.

36
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:51,719
Often, when you arrive
in a city,

37
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:54,539
the city center is served
by a sewer network.

38
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:57,344
The main question is then
what to do

39
00:01:57,419 --> 00:01:59,803
with the area surrounding
the city center?

40
00:02:00,434 --> 00:02:02,805
Shall we try to connect them
to the sewer network?

41
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:05,492
Or shall we keep
on-site sanitation systems

42
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,853
and plan for proper
faecal sludge management?

43
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:13,890
Or maybe you would prefer alternatives,
such as decentralized sewer systems.

44
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,623
So, what's an integrated
planning approach?

45
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,631
First of all, it means planning for
the whole sanitation supply chain.

46
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:28,809
as demonstrated behind me
from the latrine to (INAUDIBLE) disposal.

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,329
Too many projects have failed

48
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:35,471
because they only considered
one component, typically latrines.

49
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:37,904
You may recognize on this drawing

50
00:02:37,946 --> 00:02:41,192
the colors representing
the functional groups of the compendium.

51
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:45,084
If you want to learn more
about this system approach sanitation,

52
00:02:45,235 --> 00:02:48,161
I would recommend you
to have a look at this book,

53
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,908
or follow our MOOC
on sanitation planning.

54
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:55,922
An integrated planning approach
means also to have a holistic view

55
00:02:56,101 --> 00:02:58,381
where technology
is just one component,

56
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:00,246
as shown in this figure.

57
00:03:00,331 --> 00:03:02,093
A view that takes into account

58
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:04,148
the different socioeconomic context,

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,617
people's aspirations
or the available financial resources,

60
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,974
skills and management capacities.

61
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:14,432
We need to understand
each area of a city

62
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,256
with its specificities

63
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:20,482
and then see how all can fit together
under one roof.

64
00:03:21,972 --> 00:03:24,804
All the elements I just mentioned
build what we call

65
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:26,430
the enabling environment.

66
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,753
The enabling environment
is a set of conditions

67
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:32,670
that make your scheme work.

68
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:36,429
As you can see, you need support
from the government,

69
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:39,084
the proper legal
and regulatory framework.

70
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,392
You need institutional arrangements,

71
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:44,436
you need to check
the available skills and capacities,

72
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,616
define financial arrangements,

73
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,755
and see if your proposal
is socially and culturally accepted.

74
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,832
This is a kind of checklist

75
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:56,644
for you to identify the gaps
and see how they can be filled.

76
00:03:56,844 --> 00:03:59,291
How would a situation look like
in your city?

77
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,921
Let's start to plan.

78
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,475
You know the project cycle.

79
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:07,881
First, you may have
an exploratory study,

80
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:10,803
which we could also call
the process ignition.

81
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,957
Then, you have the preliminary
or pre-feasibility studies

82
00:04:15,157 --> 00:04:18,749
where the detailed assessment
of the initial situation takes place.

83
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:21,666
After that, 
we have the feasibility study,

84
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,344
where the main tasks
are the identification

85
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:25,629
of service options.

86
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,068
And once the options are selected,

87
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:30,519
you move to the detailed
project development,

88
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:33,136
which finally opens
the way to implementation.

89
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:36,435
So now the question is
where do we fit

90
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,524
all the necessary activities?

91
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:42,033
Clearly, every context is different,

92
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,283
and where you start off
will vary from place to place.

93
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,775
In the faecal sludge management book
and in your course materials,

94
00:04:49,975 --> 00:04:54,286
you will find this figure
called "FSM from A to Z".

95
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,374
There, we listed all the activities
to be carried out

96
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:01,430
from the quantification
and characterization of sludge,

97
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,180
to the involvement of stakeholders,

98
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,610
and fit them
into each planning step.

99
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:11,043
These activities often take place
in parallel.

100
00:05:11,705 --> 00:05:14,754
What is important
is that at the end of each phase,

101
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:16,743
you have all the information
you need

102
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:18,970
and that  you have the stakeholders
on board.

103
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,146
Let's take a closer look.

104
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:26,020
On the left side, as you can see,
you have the standard project phases.

105
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:30,045
In the middle,
we detail the activities.

106
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:32,041
to be done in each phase,

107
00:05:32,813 --> 00:05:34,718
as well as the main outcomes.

108
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,497
Each activity is linked

109
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,747
to the respective chapters
in the book.

110
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,909
On the right side,
we show how these different activities

111
00:05:45,935 --> 00:05:49,768
fit into two of the main
participatory planning frameworks.

112
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:55,605
Clues, which is the planning guideline
for community and neighborhood level.

113
00:05:55,805 --> 00:05:59,552
And Sanitation 21,
which is the planning framework

114
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:04,577
at city level, endorsed by
the International Water Association, IWA.

115
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,094
The key participatory activities
in the process

116
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,643
are highlighted, as you can see here
with initial launching workshop.

117
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:14,164
All these activities
can be embedded

118
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:17,459
in any planning framework
or terms  of reference.

119
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:21,521
Experience shows that 
participation of the stakeholders

120
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:25,092
is crucial for the success
of sanitation projects and programs.

121
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,409
In order to be able to lead
a successful planning process,

122
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:33,791
you often need to create
a city sanitation task force.

123
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:37,215
That is a way to have
all the main stakeholders on board

124
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,040
and to avoid blockages
during the process.

125
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:44,938
You will learn more in the modules
on stakeholder analysis and engagement.

126
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:46,750
and institutional arrangements.

127
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:49,863
For now, please try to identify

128
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:52,058
the activities related
to participation

129
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:54,430
in the "FSM from A to Z" synthesis.

130
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,495
Remember that the main goal
of the exercise

131
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:01,551
is to reach, together,
a city sanitation plan

132
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,581
or an action plan that can be funded
and that can be implemented

133
00:07:05,706 --> 00:07:06,728
without problems.

134
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:10,124
For that, you need to engage
the stakeholders

135
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,312
to understand their needs
and constraints

136
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,510
and, in the end, to be able
to define a design

137
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,003
clear roles and responsibilities,
with a clear commitment from them.

138
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:24,037
In this module,
you were introduced

139
00:07:24,087 --> 00:07:27,311
to the importance of adopting
an integrated planning approach

140
00:07:27,511 --> 00:07:30,765
which includes considering
the entire sanitation supply chain,

141
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,397
then taking into account
all the elements

142
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,960
of the enabling environment.

143
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:39,555
We saw a proposal of how
to translate this approach

144
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:40,877
into the planning process.

145
00:07:41,476 --> 00:07:43,364
The FSM planning from A to Z,

146
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,431
which I really recommend you
to have a closer look at.

147
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:51,750
Finally, we underlined importance
to adopt a participatory approach.

148
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:56,047
In the next module, I will describe
in more detail

149
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:59,407
how to conduct an assessment
of the initial situation.

150
00:08:00,308 --> 00:08:01,440
See you then.
