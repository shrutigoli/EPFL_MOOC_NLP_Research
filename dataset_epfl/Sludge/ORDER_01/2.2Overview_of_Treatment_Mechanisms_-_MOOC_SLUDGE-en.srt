1
00:00:04,187 --> 00:00:07,454
Treatment processes occur by 
different mechanisms.

2
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:10,986
Some treatment relies on physical
forces, such as filtration,

3
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:15,249
evaporation, and gravity. 

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,746
Some treatment relies on the
metabolism of living organisms

5
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:23,463
such as microorganisms, invertebrate
animals, and insects such as

6
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:27,104
these black soldier fly larvae.
And other treatments relay on

7
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:30,944
chemical reactions, such as redox
reactions and altering

8
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:32,730
 chemical bonds.

9
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,504
Following this module you'll know 
the difference between physical,

10
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:44,343
chemical and biological treatment
mechanisms. And be familiar with

11
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:48,170
mechanisms for solid liquid 
separation, stabilization, 

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,643
nutrient management and pathogen
reduction.

13
00:00:52,893 --> 00:00:56,046
What are the most important 
treatment processes and fecal

14
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:59,842
sludge management is dewatering. 
Dewatering is based on physical

15
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:04,862
processes such as evaporation,
evapotranspiration, filtration, 

16
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:09,940
gravity, surface charge attractions,
centrifugal force and pressure.

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,540
Gravity is probably the most 
commonly employed method

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,815
of liquid solid separation, for the
separation of suspended particles

19
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:20,249
and bound water. 

20
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:24,240
Particles that are heavier than 
water set decreasing conditions

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,419
at rates based on size of particles,
suspended solids concentrations, 

22
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:32,128
and flocculation

23
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:35,928
These are the basic fundamentals
used in the design of settling

24
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,758
thickening tanks in grit and 
sand chambers.

25
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:43,988
Filtration is also a commonly 
applied mechanism for dewatering.

26
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:47,976
Many different types of filtration
media are used for water, 

27
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:52,074
waste water and treated sludge or
biosolids processing.

28
00:01:52,274 --> 00:01:56,263
The most common for the treatment
of fecal sludge are drying beds, 

29
00:01:56,463 --> 00:02:01,463
and planted drying beds. Drying beds
used sand and gravel filter media to

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,105
to trap solids on the surface of the
filter bed. While the liquid

31
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:09,793
percolates through the filter bed
and is collected in a drain or

32
00:02:09,993 --> 00:02:12,136
evaporates. 

33
00:02:12,336 --> 00:02:16,896
Water that can be separated through
gravity or filtration is free water 

34
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,154
that is more easily separated from
solids. This is analogous to water

35
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:24,898
that can be run out of a towel. If 
you need more liquid removed from

36
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:29,898
the sludge, then you also need 
drying. For example, by the sun

37
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:33,991
thorough evaporation under surface
of drying beds. 

38
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:38,887
Evaporation occurs when water is
released into the air as a vapor.

39
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:43,970
Transpiration occurs when plants 
release vapor to the air as part of

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,212
their metabolic processes. 
Evapotranspiration is a combination

41
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:54,701
of these two processes. Evaporation
can also occur from other sources of

42
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:58,850
heat, such as thermal drying
or even somewhat from other physical

43
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,564
processes, such as centrifugation.

44
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:05,947
Ok, so next on to biological 
mechanisms.

45
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:09,829
Biology is essential in a 
transformation of organic matter

46
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,952
and nutrients. Biology is also 
essential for understanding

47
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,843
pathogens and pathogenic activation.

48
00:03:18,043 --> 00:03:21,839
Biological treatment harnesses the
metabolism and growth rate of

49
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,716
microorganisms. And even 
invertebrates' unnaturally occurring

50
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:30,370
processes. And employs them in
controlled situations to optimize

51
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,711
the desired outcomes. Treatment 
systems usually rely on complex

52
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:38,957
populations of microorganisms.
As the microbes grow, they are

53
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:43,656
dynamically altering the system by
modifying forms of organic matter

54
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:48,253
and releasing and binding up
nutrients. They also release gasses

55
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:51,407
and other byproducts that can affect
the environment. 

56
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:59,543
Here we see viruses, bacteria,
protozoa and invertebrates.

57
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:04,251
The biodegradable organic matter
in fecal sludge varies depending on

58
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:10,144
the source. But usually needs to be
stabilized prior to final end use or

59
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:15,094
disposal. Stabilization involves the
degradation of readily degradable

60
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:20,164
material, leaving behind more stable
less degradable organics.

61
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:25,113
This is important in order to reduce
the oxygen demand, produce stable

62
00:04:25,313 --> 00:04:29,970
and predictable characteristics,
reduce odors, and allow for easy

63
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,925
storage and manipulation. 

64
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:38,157
Stabilized organic matter does not 
have an exact agreed upon scientific

65
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:42,087
definition. But in general, it
refers to resistance to further

66
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:47,869
biodegradation. Stabilized sludge
consists of particles like cellulose

67
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,279
lignin, inorganic matter, and the 
cellular material of microorganisms

68
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:57,844
that consume the readily degradable
organics. Whereas, unstabilized

69
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:02,452
sludge contains easily degradable
compounds, such as carbohydrates,

70
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:07,109
proteins, and sugars. Stabilization
can be achieved through multiple

71
00:05:07,309 --> 00:05:13,063
types of aerobic and anaerobic
treatments. For example, composting.

72
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:17,136
Nutrient management can also be
achieved thru biological treatment.

73
00:05:17,336 --> 00:05:23,156
For example, through the 
mineralization of organic matter

74
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:29,686
as it is degraded releasing 
nutrients into the environment.

75
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:35,027
Or, through the immobilization of
nutrients as they are taken up 

76
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:38,227
during growth into new cellular
material.

77
00:05:38,427 --> 00:05:42,405
Further information on the role of 
biology and Nitrogen and Phosphorus

78
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:46,924
cycling can be found in the book
Fecal Sludge Management. 

79
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:50,825
Biology is also very important in
managing pathogens. 

80
00:05:51,025 --> 00:05:54,432
As these disease causing organisms
are also biological. 

81
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,487
It's important to have an 
understanding of all of the

82
00:05:57,687 --> 00:06:01,142
interrelated ways to reduce 
pathogens during treatment.

83
00:06:01,342 --> 00:06:04,987
As they can also affect the 
performance of treatment technologies.

84
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:09,429
The main mechanisms of inactivation
that we're concerned with are:

85
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,176
Predation from other organisms. 
Starvation as they run out of food.

86
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:20,126
Temperature, for example in 
treatment processes like composting

87
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:24,657
thermophilic anaerobic digestion
or even Lime treatment. 

88
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:29,415
UV in cases where light rays can
penetrate, such as the surface of

89
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,719
waste stabilization ponds. But not
in tanks and ponds where solids at

90
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,116
the surface are high enough to block
significant transmission of rays.

91
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:43,909
pH, or other chemical changes, as
most microorganisms thrive only

92
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:47,209
within a range of 2-3 pH units.

93
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,255
Time is important in processes
that have long retention times.

94
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:54,692
Like planted drying beds of up to
10 years. 

95
00:06:54,892 --> 00:06:59,398
Desiccation or dehydration. 
For example, in processes like

96
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,802
palletizing that can get to 90% 
dryness and could be combined with

97
00:07:05,002 --> 00:07:10,496
time as storage or temperature as
external heat to achieve safe levels

98
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,686
of pathogen reduction. 

99
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:16,535
Pathogens can also be reduced 
through sorption. For example,  when 

100
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,552
helminth eggs sorbed solids, then set
aloud in settling thickening tanks.

101
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:25,319
or remain with the sludge layer on
a drying bed. 

102
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:31,006
OK, and finally chemical mechanisms.
Chemicals can be mixed with fecal

103
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:34,915
sludge to improve the performance
of other physical mechanisms.

104
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:39,214
Or to inactivate pathogens and
stabilize fecal sludge.

105
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:43,671
Examples include addition of 
polymers or other conditioners to

106
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,802
increase the flocculation and 
settling efficiency 

107
00:07:47,002 --> 00:07:51,077
Anemonia or Lime to increase
pathogene reduction.

108
00:07:51,277 --> 00:07:55,135
Both types of chemical reactions
are covered in more detail in other

109
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:56,567
modules.

110
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:01,072
So, in summary, in this module
you learned about physical,

111
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,591
biological and chemical mechanisms
that occur in treatment processes.

112
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,278
And about treatment mechanisms
that are occurring during these 

113
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,056
four treatment objectives for fecal
sludge. Solid-liquid separation,

114
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:17,218
stabilization, nutrient management
and pathogen reduction.

115
00:08:17,418 --> 00:08:20,719
Thanks for joining! See you
next time!
