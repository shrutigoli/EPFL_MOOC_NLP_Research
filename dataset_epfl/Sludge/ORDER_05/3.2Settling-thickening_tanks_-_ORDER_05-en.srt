1
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:06,691
In urban areas, faecal sludge
often looks like this.

2
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:09,963
It is extremely liquid and contains
few solids.

3
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:14,338
Often, more than 95%
of faecal sludge is water.

4
00:00:14,538 --> 00:00:16,541
Dewatering of this sludge usually
requires a lot of space

5
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,634
that is commonly not available
in urban areas.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:21,976
In this module we introduce you
to settling-thickening tanks

7
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:25,263
that can reduce the volume that
requires dewatering by more than 50%.

8
00:00:25,854 --> 00:00:28,485
No, it's not by magic.
It is by gravity.

9
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,941
Following this module, you will
be able to explain

10
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:34,646
the treatment process and operation
of settling-thickening tanks.

11
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:37,315
Discuss operation and maintenance
requirements,

12
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,559
and name design parameters specific
to settling-thickening tanks.

13
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:44,664
This slide shows a cross-section of
a settling-thickening tank.

14
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:47,786
The treatment of settling-thickening
tank is based on sedimentation.

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,640
Faecal sludge enters the tank through
inlet at the front.

16
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:55,575
As an outlet for the sludge is only
provided at the back end,

17
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:58,401
the sludge has to travel
through the tank.

18
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:03,602
During its way through the tank
dense solids settle out at the bottom.

19
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:08,080
These solids are further compressed
by the weight

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,166
of the settled sludge layer,
as a result of these two processes

21
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:15,014
called settling and thickening,
the sludge that settle

22
00:01:15,214 --> 00:01:17,367
at the bottom of the tank has
a higher solid content,

23
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,217
and the effluent leaving the tank,
a lower solid content

24
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,402
than the thicker sludge discharged
into the settling-thickening tank.

25
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:26,625
So all settling-thickening tanks
really do

26
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,836
is to separate liquids
and solids.

27
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,161
Usually between 50 to 80%  of
suspended solids that are discharged

28
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:36,036
into the settling-thickening tank
stay in the tank, 

29
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,169
where as the remaining solids
stay in the effluent.

30
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,809
This means that both liquids
effluent and the solids

31
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,608
require further treatment.

32
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,105
So what is the benefit of
a settling-thickening tank?

33
00:01:46,576 --> 00:01:48,595
Let's consider a hypothetical
example.

34
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:52,236
This slide shows the change
of sludge volume

35
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:54,163
as a function of the solids content.

36
00:01:54,363 --> 00:01:57,005
As you can see from the slope of
the curve

37
00:01:57,205 --> 00:02:00,248
the reduction sludge volume
is highest at low solid contents.

38
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:04,919
Let's assume we have 1000 liters
of sludge with a solid content of 1%

39
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,709
which is typical for septic
tank sludge.

40
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:10,903
How will this volume change when
we increase

41
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,974
the solid content from 1%
to 5%

42
00:02:14,174 --> 00:02:16,755
of when we increase it from
1% to 10%?

43
00:02:16,955 --> 00:02:20,315
These are typical solids contents
from settling-thickening tanks

44
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,627
in Accra and Dakar.

45
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,244
Increased solid content would reduce
the sludge volume to 200 liters

46
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:29,899
for 5% solids and 100 liters
for 10% solids.

47
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,322
This is a reduction of the initial
volume of 80 and 90%.

48
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:39,086
As the required space for dewatering
technologies, such as drying beds

49
00:02:39,286 --> 00:02:42,139
uses the function of the volume
of sludge that needs to be dewatered

50
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,131
settling-thickening tanks can reduce
the required footprint

51
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,572
of sludge dewatering technologies.

52
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:50,184
Settling-thickening tanks are
usually loaded with sludge

53
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:51,832
for between 1 week to 1 month.

54
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,737
To treat the solid content
in a settled sludge

55
00:02:54,937 --> 00:02:57,573
the sludge can be left for
thickening beyond this period. 

56
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,771
This is usually done for several
days or weeks,

57
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,360
as shown here for anaerobic ponds

58
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,910
another type of settling-thickening
technology in Dakar.

59
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:08,333
Following this period, the sludge
that accumulates at the bottom

60
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,430
requires removal before
another cycle

61
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,894
of loading and thickening
can be started.

62
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,518
This sludge removal should be done
by pumps

63
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,191
to ensure protection of workers.

64
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:22,785
(INAUDIBLE), trekkers, or front-loaders
or a combination of those

65
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,891
may be applied when sludge
is too thick to be pumped.

66
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:30,402
This slide here shows a back hose
in the background removing sludge

67
00:03:30,602 --> 00:03:33,321
from an anaerobic pond
in Dar es Salaam.

68
00:03:34,584 --> 00:03:36,345
As you can see in this picture,
removal of sludge

69
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,936
from settling-thickening tanks
can be a challenge.

70
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:42,595
But is an absolute must to ensure
that they operate as designed.

71
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,182
This will be covered in more detail
in another module

72
00:03:46,382 --> 00:03:49,082
with an example of
a settling-thickening tank.

73
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:53,434
Maintenance of pumps and tractors,
as shown in Kampala,

74
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:57,560
is the most important maintenance 
activity for settling-thickening tanks.

75
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,658
In order to ensure that faecal sludge
can be treated

76
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:03,924
 during thickening, sludge removal
and also maintenance activities,

77
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,093
2 settling-thickening tanks are
usually operate

78
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:08,087
in parallel or alternately.

79
00:04:09,038 --> 00:04:12,562
In this picture from Dakar,
1 settling-thickening tank

80
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:16,255
is being loaded, while the other one
is left for settling and thickening.

81
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:20,866
What you also notice on this picture
is that this settling-thickening

82
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:23,241
tank is covered with a layer.

83
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,255
We call this layer the scum layer.

84
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:29,463
This layer also requires removal
and management

85
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:32,911
after settling-thickening period
of a settling-thickening tank.

86
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,538
The settling velocity and the solid
liquid separation effeciency

87
00:04:36,738 --> 00:04:39,903
are design parameters that are
specific to settling-thickening tanks.

88
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:44,043
The settling velocity is an estimate
of the speed with which

89
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,300
solids settle to the bottom
of a settling-thickening tank.

90
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:49,412
If the speed with which the solids
travel through 

91
00:04:49,612 --> 00:04:53,462
the settling-thickening tank
is faster than the settling velocity

92
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:56,662
the sludge will leave the tank
with the effluent.

93
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:00,145
For example, with this pathway here.

94
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,599
If the settling velocity is faster
than the velocity with which

95
00:05:03,799 --> 00:05:07,848
the solids travel through the tank,
the solids will settle out at the bottom.

96
00:05:08,681 --> 00:05:11,477
Based on experience from Accra, 
Kampala, and Dakar,

97
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:16,257
the settling will also equal
a smaller than 0.5 meters/second

98
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:20,110
seems to be appropriate for faecal
sludge in settling-thickening tanks.

99
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:23,033
But in contrast to waste water
sludge treatment

100
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:26,095
experience is lacking on
the appropriate design values

101
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:28,330
for settling velocity
of faecal sludge.

102
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,750
Due to the wide range of faecal
sludge characteristics,

103
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,849
from different on-site 
sanitation technologies or cities.

104
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,415


105
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:37,129
In general, unstabilized faecal
sludge

106
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:39,455
for example, from public toilets
as shown here 

107
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,866
appear to have poorer solid liquid
separation in settling-thickening

108
00:05:43,072 --> 00:05:45,881
tanks, for example as compared
to septic tank sludge.

109
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,650


110
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:49,040
Due to this high variability
in characteristics,

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,573
the design of settling-thickening
tanks requires bench skill testing

112
00:05:52,773 --> 00:05:55,119
with Imhoff cones,
when the actual sludge

113
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,620
that would be treated in
the settling-thickening tanks.

114
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,987
This slide shows 4 Imhoff
cones.

115
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:04,781
To estimate the sludge volume index,
1 liter of sludge

116
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:09,120
is settled in these Imhoff
cones for around 30 to 60 minutes.

117
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:13,089
The sludge volume index is then
calculated from the volume

118
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,981
that settles at the bottom of these
Imhoff cones

119
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:17,758
divided by the initial suspended
solids concentration.

120
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,660
Based on waste water sludge
treatment,  

121
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,513
a sludge with a sludge volume index
of equal or smaller than

122
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:29,404
100 milliliters per gram TS,
good solid liquid separation

123
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:32,317
in settling-thickening tank
can be expected.

124
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:36,536
During such laboatory bench
skill test,

125
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:39,651
the solid liquid separation
efficiency can also be calculated.

126
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:43,789
It is an estimate of how many solids
settle at the bottom

127
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:48,119
and would stay in the tank,
and how much of the solids

128
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,011
would leave the tank with
the effluent.

129
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:54,802
A solid liquid separation effeciency
of smaller than 80%

130
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:58,275
could indicate that the sludge
in your city

131
00:06:58,475 --> 00:07:01,885
has poor solid liquid separation
in settling-thickening tanks.

132
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,815
In addition, the solid liquid
separation effeciency

133
00:07:06,015 --> 00:07:08,237
is important for the design
of settling-thickening tanks

134
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,253
and effluent treatment.

135
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,101
This picture shows the effluent of
a settling-thickening tank

136
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:15,079
in Dar es Salaam. 

137
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,034
This effluent is further treated
in waste stabilization ponds.

138
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:22,794
It is important to consider that the
solid liquid separation efficiency

139
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:26,295
that you will have in full-scale
settling-thickening tanks

140
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:27,771
will be lower than
the ones you've obtained

141
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:30,638
in controlled laboratory
or bench skill testing.

142
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,085
A discharge area for sludge, as
shown here before

143
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:37,479
a settling-thickening tank, 
can be a good way

144
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,167
for mitigating this turbulence.

145
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,595
In addition, (INAUDIBLE) at the inflow
and at the outflow

146
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:46,698
of settling-thickening tanks
can be a good way of reducing

147
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:50,188
turbulences and ensure that you have
good solid liquid separation

148
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,369
efficiencies in settling-thickening
tanks.

149
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,559
In this module we learned that
the treatment process

150
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,398
on operation OF
settling-thickening tanks

151
00:07:58,598 --> 00:07:59,800
is based on sedimentation.

152
00:08:00,652 --> 00:08:02,543
Frequent removal of sludge
is important

153
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:05,371
for settling-thickenings is only
operator designed.

154
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,978
This requires maintenance
of mechanical equipment, 

155
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:09,762
such as pumps and front-loaders.

156
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,177
Design parameters specific
to settling-thickening tanks

157
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,984
are related to
the sludge properties.

158
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:19,039
And include the settling velocity,
and solid liquid separation efficiency.
