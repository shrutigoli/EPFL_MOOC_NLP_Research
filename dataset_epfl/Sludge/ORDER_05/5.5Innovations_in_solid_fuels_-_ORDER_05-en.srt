1
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:07,000
Can you believe that these
fuel pellets and these briquettes

2
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:10,378
were made out of faecal sludge?
I understand if you're skeptical.

3
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,185
In this module you will learn about
important considerations

4
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:15,147
for the production
of solid fuels.

5
00:00:15,398 --> 00:00:17,748
Following this module you will be
able to describe

6
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,380
treatment products that can be
used as a solid fuel,

7
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:23,358
name characteristics that are
relevant to assess the potential

8
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,646
and understand what's to be
considered for it's implementation.

9
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:31,155
Why would someone consider producing
solid fuels from faecal sludge

10
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:34,185
especially considering
that it's 95% water?

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,075
Illustrated in this graph is the
market value of different

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:43,187
faecal sludge treatment products in
Dakar, Accra and Kampala.

13
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:50,179
The values are reported as U.S dollar
(USD) per ton dried faecal sludge.

14
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:55,240
The graph demonstrates that
solid fuels such as dried faecal sludge

15
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:57,707
from drying beds can generate
more revenues

16
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,975
in comparison to
other treatment products.

17
00:01:00,157 --> 00:01:03,182
For example in Kampala, the values
of solid industrial fuel

18
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:06,383
was estimated to be
32 USD per ton

19
00:01:06,603 --> 00:01:10,091
in comparison to 16 USD per ton
as a soil conditioner.

20
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:15,416
This study can also be downloaded
free of charge from our website.

21
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:19,195
Based on our more recent research
in Kampala we would even estimate

22
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:22,082
a higher price for dried
faecal sludge as a solid fuel

23
00:01:22,336 --> 00:01:26,749
of 60 to 80 USD per ton.
Lack of financial resources

24
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:30,219
is a frequent reason for the failure
of faecal sludge treatment services.

25
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:33,124
Increased revenues
generated from solid fuels

26
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:35,776
in comparison to a soil conditioner
could be used to

27
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:38,426
partially offset faecal
sludge treatments costs

28
00:01:38,652 --> 00:01:41,577
or discharge fees at
faecal sludge treatment plants.

29
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:44,468
Due to the low solid content
in faecal sludge

30
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:48,333
de-watering and drying are important
for the production of solid fuels.

31
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:51,129
Next to settling thickening tanks
and drying beds

32
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,180
innovative and established
technologies from waste water

33
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,289
sludge treatment such as
conditioning, pelletizing and

34
00:01:57,516 --> 00:02:00,878
the use of green houses
as shown here, should be considered.

35
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:03,611
Let's have a closer look
into pelletizing.

36
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,375
Pelletizing is
the processing

37
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:10,179
of de-watered sludge into
a pellet form such as these.

38
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:13,826
As part of our research,
we implemented a bioburn pelletizer

39
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:17,137
at a faecal sludge and waste water
treatment plant in Kampala.

40
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:20,216
The research demonstrated that
faecal sludge from drying beds

41
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:24,349
could be pelettized at a moisture
content ranging from 40% to 60%.

42
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:35,667
Following pelettizing, we then
evaluated drying of pellets

43
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:40,805
to 10% moisture. 10% is the moisture
content of most solid fuels.

44
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,959
Drying of pellets only
took around 1 week

45
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:47,201
in comparison to weeks
or a month on drying beds.

46
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:54,776
Dried sludge in a crushed or in
a pellet form is 1 treatment product

47
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:58,167
that can be produced from faecal
sludge with drying technologies.

48
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:01,635
Here you can see dried faecal sludge
being used as a fuel

49
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,948
for firing of clay bricks in a
pale skillet kiln in Kampala.

50
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,769
Using dried faecal sludge
as a fuel, we were able

51
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,528
to achieve the required
temperatures for brick production

52
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:13,139
and the heating performance
was comparable to coffee husks

53
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:15,708
which are commonly used
in Kampala.

54
00:03:16,936 --> 00:03:19,586
Char briquettes are another
energy recovery product

55
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,221
that can be produced from
dried faecal sludge.

56
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,091
The process of
char production

57
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,851
is called carbonization
or slow-pyrolysis.

58
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:29,328
Carbonization is a thermal
chemical conversion of

59
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,679
dry biomass
in the absence of oxygen

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,937
at temperatures ranging from
300 to 600 °C.

61
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,160
This is the same process that
converts wood into charcoal.

62
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,467
Carbonization products
includes gases

63
00:03:48,672 --> 00:03:51,559
that can be used to provide heat
for the carbonization process

64
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,811
or sludge drying and char that can
be used to produce char briquettes.

65
00:03:56,825 --> 00:04:00,124
Following carbonization, char is in
a powdery form in which it cannot

66
00:04:00,332 --> 00:04:04,295
usually be directly used for energy
recovery in households or institutions.

67
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,633
Briquetting of char with a binder
such as molasses or

68
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,847
as cassava flour can convert
the char from a powder

69
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:14,074
in a form that is comparable
to wood-based charcoal.

70
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:18,125
In the market place solid fuels
produced from faecal sludge

71
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:21,648
have to compete with existing fuels
such as coal, sawdust,

72
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,814
coffee husks, char briquettes
and charcoal.

73
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,107
Let me walk you through a
few parameters that

74
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:30,954
you will be likely to be confronted
with when talking about solid fuels.

75
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:33,868
The calorific value, an estimate
of the energy content,

76
00:04:34,076 --> 00:04:36,551
is an important
characterization parameter.

77
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:39,630
The unit of the energy content is
megajoules per kilogram

78
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,522
100% dried faecal sludge
(MJ/Kg).

79
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:46,072
This graph shows the energy content
of dried faecal sludge

80
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,152
in Kumasi, Dakar and Kampala
and compares the values to fuels

81
00:04:50,365 --> 00:04:53,677
commonly used in these cities
such as coal, coffee husks,

82
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:56,633
rice husks and saw dust.
As you can see,

83
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,708
the calorific value of
dried faecal sludge is comparable

84
00:04:59,928 --> 00:05:01,753
to other commonly used
biofuels.

85
00:05:01,973 --> 00:05:05,085
On average, you have
17 MJ/Kg dried sludge

86
00:05:06,202 --> 00:05:09,002
however depending on the
faecal sludge characteristics

87
00:05:09,212 --> 00:05:12,212
and the treatment technology used
sludge can also have lower

88
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:17,830
and higher calorific values ranging
from 10 to 19 MJ/Kg dried sludge.

89
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:21,266
Among others, the difference in
calorific values can be explained

90
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,526
by the high concentrations of
inorganic material in the sludge.

91
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:28,236
Inorganic material is estimated
by the parameter ash content.

92
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,859
It is the proportion of fuel
that does not burn

93
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:34,067
and therefore does not
contribute to the calorific value.

94
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:37,515
Potential contributions to
inorganic material come from soil

95
00:05:37,736 --> 00:05:40,361
in unlined or partially lined
pit latrines, from sand

96
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,890
and soil entering onsite sanitation
technology through a drop hole

97
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,343
and sand from drying beds
during treatment.

98
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,851
Ways to keep sand out of faecal
sludge need to be improved upon

99
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:53,055
to increase the energy recovery
potential of faecal sludge.

100
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:56,744
Carbonization of sludge also
increased the ash content

101
00:05:56,948 --> 00:05:58,723
by removal
of volatile gases.

102
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,905
In one study conducted by Sandec
and in research partners

103
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:05,610
in Dar es Salaam and Kampala, char
produced from dried faecal sludge

104
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:09,678
had calorific values of
7 to 11 MJ/Kg dried sludge

105
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:13,833
and ash contents of 55 to 70%.
These are high

106
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,363
for use as solid fuels considering
that based on the literature

107
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:22,476
charcoal has a calorific value of
31 to 33 MJ/Kg

108
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:27,320
and an ash content below 5%.
Co-processing of char

109
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:29,886
produced from faecal sludge
and wood-based char dust

110
00:06:30,104 --> 00:06:32,304
has the potential to increase
the fuel properties.

111
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:35,424
These pictures show charcoal and
briquettes from a fuel comparison

112
00:06:35,607 --> 00:06:39,857
conducted in Kampala. In this study
which was based on calorific value,

113
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:44,199
ash content, the time to boil
5 liters of water and emissions

114
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,374
the performance of coal processed
faecal sludge char briquettes

115
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,278
were comparable to char briquettes
sold in Kampala

116
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:52,721
and produced
from agricultural waste.

117
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:56,373
The calorific value was
19 to 20 MJ/Kg

118
00:06:56,845 --> 00:07:00,857
and the ash content
22 to 37%.

119
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:05,117
Do you think solid fuels could be
a good resource recovery option

120
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,430
for your city? Here are some
additional considerations.

121
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,427
Existing examples of the use of
fuels produced from

122
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,628
faecal sludge are few.
This means marketing

123
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:16,997
will be required to
demonstrate that these fuels

124
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,416
can be a competitive
alternative to existing fuels.

125
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:24,078
Large industries such as cement
or brick companies

126
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:27,482
could be important customers for the
use of dried faecal sludge

127
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:30,255
and they could provide a large
and consistent revenue stream

128
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:33,564
for treatment operators.
However, quantities of fuel

129
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:37,114
that large industries require
for full scale implementation

130
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,391
may exceed the quantities of sludge
that are currently being treated.

131
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:45,140
For example, in Kampala in 2015
around 4 tons of dried sludge

132
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,953
were produced daily at the Lubigi Waste
Water and Faecal Sludge Treatment plant

133
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,222
whereas interviewed cement companies
said they required at least

134
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,327
10 tons per day
for use fuel in their kilns.

135
00:07:55,695 --> 00:07:58,695
Faecal sludge also contains elements
that can produce emissions

136
00:07:58,902 --> 00:08:01,089
during carbonization and
combustion such as

137
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:05,470
nitrogen and sulfur oxides,
particulate matter or black carbon.

138
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:08,489
These can all have negative impacts
on the environment and

139
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:11,761
litigation needs to be considered
before implementation.

140
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:15,649
In this module we learned about
2 treatment products that can be used

141
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,067
as solid fuels. We also learned
about relevant characterization

142
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:22,052
parameters for these products
such as ash content

143
00:08:22,273 --> 00:08:25,448
or calorific value. Important for
implementation will be

144
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,977
research on carbonization
technologies and related emissions.

145
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,740
In addition, marketing and increasing
available sludge quantities

146
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:36,274
are important for the success of
faecal sludge as solid fuels.
