1
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:06,518
Imagine you're in
an urban area similar to this

2
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:08,783
where limited space
available for treatment.

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:09,805
How could you increase

4
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,916
the treatment capacity
of an existing plant?

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,967
Or how could you design

6
00:00:13,126 --> 00:00:15,301
treatment plants
that need less space?

7
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:17,615
In this module, you will learn
about one technology

8
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,798
that could contribute towards
finding a solution.

9
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:22,086
Following this module

10
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:24,029
you'll be able
to explain conditioning

11
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:26,919
name types of conditioners
and understand considerations

12
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:30,007
for the design and implementation
of conditioners at fecal sludge 

13
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,550
treatment plants.

14
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,575
Conditioning is the increase in
the separation of liquids and solids

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,853
in fecal sludge by
the addition of chemicals

16
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:39,559
before settling
and dewatering technologies.

17
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,464
These chemical lead to
destabilization of solid particles

18
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:43,789
called coagulation

19
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:46,716
and produce larger flocs
called flocculation.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,143
Depending on the chemical used

21
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:50,246
these flocs have
a better settling thickening

22
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,847
faster dewatering or result
in increased solid concentration.

23
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,143
Conditioners have
been used for decades

24
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,493
in the dewatering
of the different types

25
00:00:57,663 --> 00:00:58,800
of waste water sludge.

26
00:00:58,964 --> 00:01:02,276
Polyelectrolytes, also called
Polymers, Lime

27
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:04,636
Ferric chloride or Alum
are common conditioners

28
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:06,469
for waste water sludge.

29
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:09,655
Conditioning can have a large
influence in sludge treatment

30
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:12,221
by increased settling thickening
conditioners can increase

31
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,714
the effluent quality
from settling thickening tanks

32
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:17,616
and thereby reduce the sold
and organic concentration

33
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,954
that require further treatment.

34
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:23,590
By increased dewatering,
conditioners can reduce

35
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:26,893
the time of dewatering and thereby
increase the treatment capacity

36
00:01:27,062 --> 00:01:29,874
of existing treatment plants
or decrease the treatment (INAUDIBLE)

37
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,189
of new plants.

38
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:38,618
The selection of conditioners
and the optimal dosage

39
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:41,825
is specific to the sludge type
and dewatering technologies

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
for example, a centrifuge
versus the drying bed.

41
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:48,329
In comparison to waste water sludge,
hardly any experience is available 

42
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,127
for conditioning of fecal sludge.

43
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,969
To transfer the use of
conditioners to fecal sludge

44
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:57,795
information for manufacturers and
laboratory experiments are required.

45
00:01:57,955 --> 00:01:59,655
In the laboratory,
mixing conditioner

46
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:05,916
with fecal sludge in jar tests,
shown here, followed by

47
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,487
observing the settling
and thickening performance

48
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,717
in Imhoff cones,
as show here

49
00:02:10,894 --> 00:02:13,131
by comparing unconditioned
fecal sludge

50
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,972
to conditioned fecal sludge

51
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,455
and determination
of capillary suction time

52
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:20,250
as shown here, can be used
to assess the performance

53
00:02:20,413 --> 00:02:22,251
of the conditioner in dose.

54
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,264
The capillary suction time
is and indicator for the dewatering

55
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,726
raid of sludge

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,255
Similar experiments can be conducted
an a bench and pilot scale

57
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,333
with settling thickening
dewatering columns

58
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,924
as shown here.

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,608
Conventional conditioners
used for waster water sludge

60
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:40,785
are expensive and commonly rely
on a complex supply chain.

61
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:43,905
In a study in Dakar, Senegal,
we assessed the potential

62
00:02:44,086 --> 00:02:46,061
of conditioners they
could be produced locally

63
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:49,803
such as moringa oleifera seeds
and Chitosan, that could be reduced

64
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:51,026
from shrimp waste.

65
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:54,194
The goal was to increase
settling and dewatering.

66
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,967
Locally available conditions were
compared to commercial products

67
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,917
used in waste water sludge treatment
such as Lime and Polymers.

68
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,949
This graph, for example,
shows the results of specific

69
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,810
resistance of filtration.

70
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:09,981
Specific resistance of filtration
is another metric to measure

71
00:03:10,168 --> 00:03:11,443
the dewatering rate.

72
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:15,027
A lower resistance of filtration
means fast dewatering.

73
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,841
From this graph we can
draw two conclusions

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
firstly, the dewatering rate
od unconditioned fecal sludge

75
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:24,437
is significantly lower than
those compared to waste water

76
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:27,619
and water treatment sludge
results from the literature.

77
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,928
Secondly, moringa oleifera
and Chitosan were as effective

78
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,939
increasing dewatering than
commercial Polymers

79
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,315
used in waste water
sludge treatment.

80
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:40,978
In this study, conditioning
of septic tank fecal sludge

81
00:03:41,146 --> 00:03:43,133
could be used to suspend
solids in the effluent

82
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:47,217
of settling thickening
technologies by 80-90%

83
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:52,850
The dewatering rate for the example
on drying beds could be improved

84
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,145
by 70-90%.

85
00:03:57,565 --> 00:04:00,328
This could reduce the dewatering
time of sludge on drying beds

86
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,616
by 60-95%.

87
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,942
Next to the treatment performance
we also looked at the feasibility

88
00:04:07,103 --> 00:04:09,603
of these conditioners
to be produced locally.

89
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:13,179
In Dakar, insufficient quantities
of moringa oleifera seeds

90
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,638
for conditioning of fecal sludge
at Dakars treatment plant

91
00:04:15,813 --> 00:04:17,088
were available.

92
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,780
In contrast, it appears
that sufficient quantities

93
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,999
of shrimp waste could be sourced
and available for the production

94
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:25,208
of Chitosan as conditioner.

95
00:04:25,394 --> 00:04:29,394
This study can also be downloaded
for no charge from our website.

96
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:33,529
Could fecal sludge conditioning
be a solution for your city?

97
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,707
Here's some additional
important considerations

98
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:37,616
for it's implementation.

99
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:41,066
Conditionings are commonly dosed
as a function of total solids.

100
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:45,204
This is challenging for fecal sludge
and it's highly variable.

101
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,012
Next to a tank for additional
storage and dosage device

102
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,343
a homogenization tank may
therefore be required.

103
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,441
Complete mixing of fecal sludge
with the conditioner

104
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:57,317
is important for optimal
conditioner usage

105
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,851
however mixing speed should be
selected to avoid floc destruction.

106
00:05:02,124 --> 00:05:05,074
This should also be considered
during the selection of pumps

107
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:08,296
for example, for the transfer
of conditioned fecal sludge

108
00:05:08,492 --> 00:05:09,942
from a settling thickening tank

109
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,609
to a drying bed.

110
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,078
In this module you have received
an introduction to conditioning

111
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:17,147
learned about the conventional
conditioners 

112
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,731
and learned important considerations

113
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,578
for the implementation
of conditioners in fecal sludge.

114
00:05:21,917 --> 00:05:24,454
These include identification
of the optimal dosage

115
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,680
and availability.
