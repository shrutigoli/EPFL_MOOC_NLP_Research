1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,779
This faecal includes the effluent
from the settling sickening tank.

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:11,336
Do you think that this effluent
is safe for discharging to water body?

3
00:00:11,536 --> 00:00:13,646
Or for use 
for irrigation agriculture?

4
00:00:13,846 --> 00:00:16,139
What if I tell you 
this is higher concentrates

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,619
of organics and nutrients,
and waste water.

6
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:21,676
And that the salt concentrates
could be harmful to plants.

7
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,759
In this module introduce you
to treatment technologies to treat

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,412
such an effluent.  

9
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:29,353
Following this module, you'll be able
to name potential difference

10
00:00:29,553 --> 00:00:31,780
between effluents 
from treatment technologies

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,585
and compared to waste water.

12
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:36,883
You will also be able to name potential
effluent treatment technologies

13
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:40,211
and discuss potential challenges
with effluent treatment.

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:44,303
Because of high concentration
faecal sludge of solids and organics,

15
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,039
solid liquid separation technologies
are often the first treatment technology

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,542
at a treatment plant. 

17
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:52,999
Followed by further separate treatment
of the solids and the liquid effluent.

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,005
This liquid effluent is also called
(INAUDIBLE) or supernatant

19
00:00:58,205 --> 00:01:00,087
This table shows values
from the literature

20
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,946
 for suspended solids

21
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,521
Chemical Oxygen demand
also called COD

22
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,890
Ammonium Nitrogen in the liquid
effluent from unplanted drying beds

23
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,611
Planted drying beds and in comparison
to domestic waste water

24
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,884
and common discharge standards.

25
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:17,084
There are three main messages
that you should take away from this table.

26
00:01:17,284 --> 00:01:20,253
Firstly, the effluent concentration
can be very different

27
00:01:20,453 --> 00:01:22,100
depending
on the treatment technology.

28
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:25,381
For example, based on this values
unplanted drying beds 

29
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:29,230
were higher in COD and Ammonium
Nitrogen than planted drying beds.

30
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,325
This means that concentration
liquid effluents from different

31
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,345
solid liquid
separature technologies

32
00:01:34,545 --> 00:01:39,087
need to be taken into account for design
of effluent treatment technologies.

33
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,900
Secondly,

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,518
Effluent concentrations do not mean
common discharge requirements

35
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:48,421
for suspended solids, COD,
and Ammonium Nitrogen.

36
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:51,628
And further treatment is required
to protect environmental health.

37
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:55,849
Liquid effluents also commonly
have high salt concentrations,

38
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,700
they can can harmful to plants,

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,450
and contain pathogens that require
inactivation before discharge.

40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,311
Thirdly, even after
solid liquid separation 

41
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:09,060
these effluents can have much higher
concentrations than influent

42
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,258
of a domestic water treatment plant.

43
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:14,592
For example, ways to suspend
solids concentrations

44
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,502
In the (INAUDIBLE) from drying beds
are somehow similar to domestic

45
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:18,470
waste water. 

46
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,457
COD and ammonium concentrations
can be (INAUDIBLE) magnitude higher.

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,932
Technologies that are used to treat
effluents from the solid liquid

48
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:29,838
separation technologies
include different types of waste

49
00:02:30,038 --> 00:02:34,087
stabilisation ponds, constructed
wetlands, planted drying beds,

50
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:37,533
anaerobic baffled reactors
and anaerobic filters.

51
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,970
Let's have a look at two examples
of currently operating effluent

52
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,911
treatment configurations
at faecal sludge treatment plants.

53
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,244
One in the Philippines
and another one in India.

54
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:50,506
This picture shows the feacal sludge
treatment plant in Damaguete

55
00:02:50,706 --> 00:02:53,472
the Philippines that is introduced
in another module.

56
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,838
Damaguete is a treatment capacity
of 80 cubical faecal sludge.

57
00:02:57,038 --> 00:03:01,140
Is mainly collected from septic
tanks by vacuum trucks.

58
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:05,684
Falling this chart through a screen
solids and liquids are separating

59
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,420
in one anaerobic waste stabilization
ponds.

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,032
Solids are then being dewatered
on drying beds.

61
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:16,106
The treatment chain for the liquid
effluent from the anaerobic waste

62
00:03:16,306 --> 00:03:18,894
stabilization ponds include one
facultative pond,

63
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:21,535
two maturation ponds in series

64
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:24,421
and then a constructive wetland
prior to discharge.

65
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,942
Waste stabilization ponds
also called lagoons

66
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:34,734
treat effluents in large
engineer designed basins.

67
00:03:34,934 --> 00:03:36,983
Facultative ponds that are used
at Damaguete

68
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,901
following solid liquid separation

69
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:42,411
have a depth of 1 to 2.5 meters
and are designed for move

70
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,980
of dissolved and suspended organics.

71
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,430
They are called facultative ponds
because (INAUDIBLE) into a top level

72
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,403
which is predominantly aerobic.

73
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:54,715
and a bottom layer which is
predominantly anaerobic, so has no Oxygen

74
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:59,463
At Damaguete maturation ponds
follow these facultative ponds.

75
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:03,486
Maturation ponds usually have
a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 meters.

76
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:06,934
Are aerobic and are designed
for inactivation of pathogens.

77
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:10,871
The hydraulic retention time
of these ponds is usually several days

78
00:04:11,071 --> 00:04:12,041
to weeks.

79
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:16,053
Which explains why they are planned
intensive and require a lot of space.

80
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:19,896
At Damaguete the effluent from
the maturation ponds

81
00:04:20,096 --> 00:04:23,511
is further treating constructed
wetlands as shown behind me.

82
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,017
This slide shows the schematic
of a constructive wetland.

83
00:04:27,217 --> 00:04:30,704
Which is also called planted gravel
filters and is very asimilar

84
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:34,409
to a planted drying bed
in its design and operation.

85
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,615
Constructive wetlands are basins
filled with gravel and sand

86
00:04:37,815 --> 00:04:40,963
which plants that can grow in these
conditions such as antelope grass

87
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:43,241
or Echinochloa pyramidalis.

88
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:46,174
Constructive wetlands can be
distinguished and operate as

89
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:49,858
horizontal flow, so when the effluent
flows from one end to the other end

90
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:51,013
horizontally.

91
00:04:51,213 --> 00:04:53,764
Or vertical flow, where it flows 
from the top to the bottom.

92
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:56,352
Similar to unplanted drying bed.

93
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:59,552
During its passage suspended
and resolved organics are separated

94
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:02,333
by filtration and removed
from the liquid effluent

95
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:06,403
by microorganisms attached
to the filter media and the plant roots.

96
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,306
The purpose of this plant
is to ensure permeability

97
00:05:09,506 --> 00:05:13,082
of the filter media, provide surface
for growth of microorganisms

98
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:14,705
and take up nutrients.

99
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:17,714
Efficient solid liquid separation
required before the use

100
00:05:17,914 --> 00:05:21,554
of constructed wetlands to prevent
clogging of the filter media.

101
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,754
This picture shows a research
facility of Sandag

102
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:26,726
at the university of Yaounde
in Cameroon.

103
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,926
Here are series of planted drying
beds where (INAUDIBLE) use

104
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:33,126
concentration organics and nutrients
by 80%.

105
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:35,644
You can download a publication
of this research

106
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:38,008
 for free from our website.

107
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,416
This picture shows the faecal sludge
treatment plant in Devanahalli

108
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,376
 north of Bangalore in India.

109
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:47,436
In contrast to Damaguete, Devanahalli
only has a treatment capacity

110
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:51,381
of 6 cubic meters per day and receives
mostly charge from pit latrines.

111
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,178
This is one reason why different
treatment technologies were selected

112
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:57,004
for the effluent treatment.

113
00:05:57,216 --> 00:05:59,950
Following this shows through a screen

114
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,038
solids and liquid are separated
by a settling tank.

115
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:07,717
Following solid liquid separation
the solids are treated in parallel 

116
00:06:07,917 --> 00:06:10,678
by anaerobic digesters.

117
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,830
Followed by another settling tank

118
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:17,636
after which solids are dewatered
on unplanted drying beds.

119
00:06:18,448 --> 00:06:21,550
Instead of waste stabilization
ponds used at Damaguete

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,391
the liquid effluent 
from the settling tanks

121
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:28,180
is treated in an anaerobic baffled
reactor which is also called ABR

122
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,937
followed by a treatment in
constructed wetlands.

123
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:37,113
This slide shows a schematic
of anaerobic baffled reactor

124
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,200
as used in Devanahalli.

125
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,448
They are concrete or plastic
tanks with a series of baffles.

126
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:45,265
In the schematic they are 5.

127
00:06:45,465 --> 00:06:48,198
They're designed for a move 
of organics.

128
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:51,635
The baffles force the effluent
to flow down into next chamber

129
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,814
and up through a sludge layer.

130
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,026
The scum take increase the performance
of the move of organics.

131
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:00,293
For example, in comparison
to a septic tank.

132
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,790
We have now introduced you to some
treatment technologies

133
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,549
 for the liquid effluent from solid
liquid separation technologies.

134
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,585
If you would like to learn more
about these technologies

135
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:12,499
you could have a look at these
three publications developed

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,935
for waste water. 

137
00:07:14,135 --> 00:07:16,985
They can be downloaded for free
from these websites.

138
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:19,922
Currently, the design
of the technologies discussed

139
00:07:20,122 --> 00:07:22,769
in this module are based in existing
technologies.

140
00:07:22,969 --> 00:07:25,448
They need to be adapted
for effluents from solid liquid

141
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,658
 separation of faecal sludge.

142
00:07:27,858 --> 00:07:30,138
This could carry certain risk
for reliable treatment

143
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,278
that you should consider.

144
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:33,539
For example,

145
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,638
organics in faecal sludge
may already be partially digested

146
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:40,137
which could reduce the effectiveness
of anaerobic treatment technologies.

147
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:43,390
Such as anaerobic baffled reactors
discussed before.

148
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,948
This is likely due to long storage
duration

149
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,884
 in onsite sanitation technologies.

150
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,520
As discussed at the beginning
of this module

151
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,433
faecal sludge can have
high Ammonium concentrations.

152
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:57,220
As a function of pH and temperatures

153
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,819
this means that faecal sludge
can have high Ammoniac concentrations

154
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,825
that can be caused by bacteria
and algae and inhibit

155
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:07,353
treatment processes, for example,
in facultative ponds

156
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,577
or anaerobic baffled reactors.

157
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,513
With smaller faecal sludge
treatment plants as the one shown

158
00:08:12,713 --> 00:08:13,943
in Devanahalli, India.

159
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:18,287
 Hydraulic shock loads, for example,
by a discharge of one big vacuum truck

160
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,487
can also be a challenge because
it can flush out the sludge

161
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:24,294
and microorganisms
that are valuable for treatment.

162
00:08:24,494 --> 00:08:28,643
Variable treatment characteristics,
for example, from septic tanks

163
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,201
versus the pit latrine are also
challenging for such technologies.

164
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,505
In this module we discussed
that treatment plants can reduce

165
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,241
several liquids that require
further treatment. 

166
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:43,047
In general, these liquids
of high concentration organics

167
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:46,543
nutrients and (INAUDIBLE)
which are often high in waste water.

168
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:50,354
As shown for two treatment plants
one in the Philippines

169
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:53,204
and another one in India, 
waste stabilization ponds,

170
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:57,119
constructed wetlands, and anaerobic
baffled reactors among the treatment

171
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:59,958
technologies used for effluent
treatment.

172
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:04,707
A low fraction of biodegradable
organics, high Ammonia concentration

173
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:08,363
or hydraulic shock loads
can be challenges with effluent

174
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:10,812
treatment and should be considered.

175
00:09:11,012 --> 00:09:14,012
