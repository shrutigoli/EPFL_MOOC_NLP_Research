1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:07,062
We have by now introduced you
to several treatment technologies

2
00:00:07,262 --> 00:00:08,052
for faecal sludge.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,138
Treatment that provides an adequate
level of environmental and public

4
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,612
health protection requires
the combination of several

5
00:00:13,812 --> 00:00:17,006
of these treatment technologies
which are different treatment objectives.

6
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:19,986
In this module walk you through
process flow of this treatment plant

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,516
here in Kampala, Uganda.

8
00:00:21,716 --> 00:00:24,833
And have a closer look at the design
of settling sickening tanks

9
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,047
and unplanted drying beds.

10
00:00:27,247 --> 00:00:30,483
Following this module you'll
be able to draw a process flow

11
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,458
of the faecal sludge
treatment in Kampala

12
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,539
and design settling sickening tanks
and unplanted drying beds.

13
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:39,781
Welcome to the Lubigi waste water
faecal sludge treatment plant

14
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,976
in Kampala, which is being operated
by the National Water and Sewerage

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,469
Cooperation since 2013.

16
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,664
Thanks to Fishnam Water
and Transportation

17
00:00:47,864 --> 00:00:50,236
that designed this treatment plant
we are able to share

18
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,825
the design example of this treatment
plant with you.

19
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:55,651
Which is slightly modified
for training purposes.

20
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:00,398
Lubigi is designed for the treatment
of 400 cubical faecal sludge

21
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:02,518
that are mostly delivered
by vacuum trucks

22
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,553
that collect faecal sludge
from septic tanks and pit latrines.

23
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:09,103
A characterization study conducted
before the treatment design

24
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:13,406
estimated average concentration
of solids, organics, nutrients

25
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,695
and pathogens.

26
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:19,814
For example, 26.4 kg total solids
per cubic meter of faecal sludge.

27
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:23,455
Following discharge at Lubigi
faecal sludge passes through

28
00:01:23,655 --> 00:01:25,386
screens for (INAUDIBLE) of solid waste

29
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,953
and falls by gravity into settling
sickening tanks

30
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:30,215
for solid and liquid separation.

31
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:34,948
As discussed in another module
the design of settling sickening tanks

32
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:36,640
is based on the settling velocity

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,648
and a solid liquid
separation efficiency.

34
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,081
For Lubigi a settling velocity
of 0.125 meters per hour

35
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,568
and a solid liquid separation
efficiency of 80%

36
00:01:45,768 --> 00:01:47,426
were used in the design.

37
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:50,493
These values were selected
from preliminary guidelines

38
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,526
developed at Sandag and its research
partners in Ghana.

39
00:01:53,726 --> 00:01:56,465
The first step in the design
of the settling sickening tank

40
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:59,665
 at Lubigi was calculation
of the surface area based

41
00:01:59,865 --> 00:02:01,976
on the maximum amount of faecal
sludge per hour.

42
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,702
which is called the peak flow.

43
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:06,943
In the design of Lubigi
it was assumed that at some days

44
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,645
a maximum of 600 cubical faecal
sludge will be delivered per day

45
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,869
within ten hours of operation.

46
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,253
We can calculate the peak flow
by dividing the maximum daily

47
00:02:16,453 --> 00:02:18,492
discharge volume

48
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,644
by the operating hours.

49
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:25,433
With this information we calculate
the peak flow to 60 cubic meters

50
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:26,382
per hour. 

51
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:30,077
We can then calculate
the required surface area

52
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:33,369
by dividing the peak flow
by the settling velocity.

53
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,171
This results in an area requirement
of the settling sickening tank

54
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,480
of 480 square meters.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,996
The second step in the design
of the settling thickening tank

56
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:47,888
at Lubigi was to determine
the tank depth.

57
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:51,537
This slide shows a cross section
of a settling thickening tank.

58
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,839
Settling thickening tanks are commonly
separated in the different layers.

59
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:58,357
These are called the scum layer,
the clear water of supernatant layer

60
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:01,337
the separation layer
and a thickening layer.

61
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:04,537
The scum layer is the layer
where the scum accumulates.

62
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:07,374
The clear water layer includes
the liquid effluent

63
00:03:07,574 --> 00:03:10,782
and the separation thickening layer
is where settling & thickening occurs.

64
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,336
Based on the preliminary guidelines
developed in Ghana

65
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:19,233
for Lubigi a scum layer of 0.8 meter,
a clear water of 0.5 meter,

66
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,335
and a separation layer of 0.5 meter
was considered for the design.

67
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:26,919
The depth of the thickening layer
needs to be calculated

68
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,901
based on the volume of sludge
that needs to be stored in this layer.

69
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,061
The settling sickening tank
in Kampala was designed

70
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:35,115
based on the loading period
of 30 days.

71
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,063
With this information we can
calculate the mass of total solids

72
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:42,474
that will accumulate in the settling
sickening tanks during this period

73
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,534
by multiplying the average daily
discharge volume

74
00:03:45,734 --> 00:03:48,145
by the total solids concentration
of the sludge

75
00:03:48,345 --> 00:03:51,038
and the solid liquid
separation efficiency.

76
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,661
with 30 days.

77
00:03:56,698 --> 00:04:00,939
This results in a mass of 253 tons
of total solids.

78
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,631
The design of Lubigi considered
that 50% of this sludge is pumped

79
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,220
once a week onto
unplanted drying beds.

80
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,622
And only the remaining 127 tons
total solids require storage capacity

81
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:15,767
and the four settling thickening
tank layers.

82
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:20,142
According to the design
the sludge that would not be pumped

83
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:23,342
would be removed falling
the 30 day thickening period

84
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:26,456
with front loader and transported
to covered storage areas

85
00:04:26,656 --> 00:04:28,984
as shown here.

86
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:32,596
To calculate how much
of this 127 tons accumulate

87
00:04:32,796 --> 00:04:35,405
in the thickening layer, the design
need to estimate the amount

88
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:39,624
of total solids in the four layers
of the settling thickening tank.

89
00:04:39,824 --> 00:04:43,341
Lubigi assumed similar total solids
concentration in those included

90
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,541
in the preliminary guidelines
from Ghana of 160 kg

91
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:50,467
per cubic in a scum layer,
5 kg per cubic in a clear water layer

92
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:53,085
60 kg per cubic in the separation
layer

93
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:56,401
and 140 cubic per cubic meter
in a thickening layer.

94
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,836
With this information
and the surface area

95
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:02,036
that we calculated before, we can
calculate how much total solids

96
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,695
are included in the scum,
clear water and separation layer

97
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,895
by multiplying the area
with the depth

98
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:12,095
and a total solids concentration
of the layer.

99
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:18,843
As the total amount was 127 tons TS
this means that 77 tons total solids

100
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:20,608
will be stored in these layers

101
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:23,308
whereas 15 tons total solids
will require storage

102
00:05:23,508 --> 00:05:25,462
 in the thickening layer.

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,030
We can then calculate the volume
of the thickening layer

104
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,724
by dividing this mass by a total
solids concentration

105
00:05:31,924 --> 00:05:33,212
 in the thickening layer.

106
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:35,939
This results in 357 cubic.

107
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:40,090
By dividing this volume
by the surface area of the tank

108
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,426
we calculated depth
of the thickening layer

109
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:44,470
to around 0.7 meters.

110
00:05:46,608 --> 00:05:49,656
This means that the settling
thickening tank has a total depth

111
00:05:49,856 --> 00:05:51,781
of 2.5 meters

112
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:55,165
and a total volume of 1200 cubic.

113
00:05:59,928 --> 00:06:02,410
The third step in design
of the settling thickening tank

114
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,656
in Lubigi was to select the width
and the length.

115
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:08,590
This slide shows the top few
of the two settling thickening tanks

116
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,337
With sludge throwing from the right
to the left side.

117
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,271
Settling thickening tanks
are usually 5 to 10 meters longer

118
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,557
than they are wide to allow
settling and thickening of particles.

119
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:22,864
At Lubigi settling thickening
tanks were sizes 10 meters wide

120
00:06:23,064 --> 00:06:24,622
and 50 meters long.

121
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:28,378
This picture shows the settling
thickening tanks in Lubigi

122
00:06:28,578 --> 00:06:29,940
as they were constructed.

123
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,092
Two tanks were constructed
to allow reliable operation

124
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,543
during sludge removal
and maintenance.

125
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:40,061
Faecal sludge pumped from the settling
thickening tanks during the 30-day

126
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:43,236
period requires further dewatering
and drying.

127
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,198
At Lubigi sludge from the settling
thickening tanks

128
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:49,429
is dewatered and dried
on unplanted drying beds.

129
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:52,656
As discussed in another module
the hydraulic loading rate

130
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:55,162
and the solid loading rate
are design parameters

131
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,509
that are specific to unplanted
drying beds.

132
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,709
For the design of Lubigi
hydraulic load of 0.3 meters

133
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:04,469
and a solid loading rate
of 300 kg total solids

134
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:07,405
per square meter in year
was used for the design.

135
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,464
The first step in the design
of the drying beds in Lubigi

136
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,258
was calculation of the drying bed
area based on hydraulic loading rate.

137
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,460
We calculated before that 127 tons
of total solids

138
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,393
 will require treatment on planted
drying beds within the 30-day period.

139
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:26,752
The design assumes that sludge
pumped from settling thickening tanks

140
00:07:26,952 --> 00:07:30,528
has a total solids concentration
of 80 kg per cubic meter.

141
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,006
Which means that 12.5 cubic meter
of sludge

142
00:07:33,206 --> 00:07:35,366
 are around 1 ton of total solids.

143
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:39,153
With this information
we can calculate the volume of sludge

144
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:42,894
that will be pumped on drying beds
within 30 days.

145
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:47,269
By multiplying the mass of sludge
to be pumped by 12.5 cubic meter

146
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:48,824
per ton total solids.

147
00:07:49,024 --> 00:07:52,489
These are 1588 cubic meter. 

148
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,689
Based on the local climate
design assumes that a loading,

149
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,710
dewatering, drying and unloading
cycle on these drying beds,

150
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,280
which are covered, 
will take around 30 days.

151
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,464
With this information we can
calculate the required

152
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:09,710
drying bed area by dividing
the volume discharge onto drying beds

153
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,927
by hydraulic loading rate.

154
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:17,676
This means that 5,292 square meters
are required.

155
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,480
In the second step the required
drying bed area was validated

156
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,769
with the maximum
solid loading rate.

157
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:28,146
By dividing the number
of operation days per year

158
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:31,569
by the days of one drying cycle

159
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:33,801
we calculate the drying beds
will be loaded

160
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,760
 around 12.2 times per year.

161
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,749
By multiplying the number of cycles
with the mass of sludge loaded

162
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,338
onto one drying bed per cycle
divided by the drying bed area

163
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,797
we can calculate
the solid loading rate

164
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:52,491
as 293 kg total solids per square
meter in year.

165
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,089
This isn't reason to the solid
loading rate considered

166
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,827
for the design.

167
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,490
This slide shows the drying beds
in Lubigi.

168
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,133
As you can see they were covered

169
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,926
and they drying bed area
was distributed to 18 equally sized

170
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,802
drying beds.

171
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,664
As shown in this picture
at Lubigi

172
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:12,791
effluents from settling thickening
tanks and drying beds

173
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:16,422
and waste water are co-treated
in parallel in 3 anaerobic waste

174
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,816
stabilization ponds.

175
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,646
Followed by 2 facultative waste
stabilization ponds.

176
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:24,055
Sludge from this waste stabilization
ponds is then being dewatered

177
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,357
and dried on these uncovered
drying beds shown here.

178
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:32,108
In this module we walked you through
process flow of the Lubigi

179
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,942
waste water and faecal sludge
treatment plant in Kampala.

180
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:37,459
Where settling thickening tanks,
drying beds,

181
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,221
waste stabilization ponds
and storage

182
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,932
are combined for treatment.

183
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:45,354
We also introduced you the design
of settling thickening tanks

184
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:46,912
and drying beds.

185
00:09:47,112 --> 00:09:49,749
These designs were based
on preliminary guidelines

186
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,395
developed in Ghana.

187
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:54,308
In the absence of clear design
standards or faecal sludge

188
00:09:54,508 --> 00:09:56,826
treatment technologies
monitoring treatment plants

189
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,506
like Lubigi could be really
important to improve the designs

190
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,774
for future implementations.
