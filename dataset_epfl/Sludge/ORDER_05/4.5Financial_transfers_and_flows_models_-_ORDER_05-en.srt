1
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:06,575
If you buy vegetables from a vendor
at a market

2
00:00:06,775 --> 00:00:09,130
what do you thing the vendor
does with this money?

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,754
Most likely vendors have to make
a number of payments with this money.

4
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,589
Some have to buy vegetables
from a farmer

5
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,439
or they have to pay to produce them.

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,393
Maybe they also have to pay
the employees,

7
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:20,972
pay rent for the stall,

8
00:00:21,172 --> 00:00:22,881
or tax in the transaction. 

9
00:00:23,081 --> 00:00:26,882
We call of these payments
financial transfers.

10
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:30,321
In this module we introduce you
to different financial transfers

11
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,793
and flows in faecal
sludge management.

12
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:36,867
Following this module, you'll be able
to list different financial transfers

13
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,867
in faecal sludge management.

14
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,307
Name stakeholders involved
in financial transfers.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,445
And be able to discuss different
financial flow models.

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,427
Money matters.

17
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:50,158
This is also true for the management
of faecal sludge.

18
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:51,967
In faecal sludge management

19
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:54,457
money's exchange
by different stakeholders

20
00:00:54,657 --> 00:00:57,984
to cover their capital
and operational maintenance costs.

21
00:00:58,234 --> 00:01:01,908
Let's look at some of these cost before
we look in how they are balanced

22
00:01:02,108 --> 00:01:04,936
by financial transfers between
stakeholders.

23
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:09,159
Capital costs that are paid when
buying equipment or infrastructure.

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,740
Let's consider for example
this collection service provider

25
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,546
shown in this picture in Kampala.

26
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:17,920
Before you could start operating
he had to buy a gulper

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,714
for faecal sludge collection.

28
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,914
And a pickup for transport
of this sludge to a treatment plant.

29
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:26,670
In addition, he had to buy
other personal protection equipment

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,368
such as gumboots, face mask
and gloves

31
00:01:29,568 --> 00:01:31,010
and other tools of trade.

32
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,430
Such as these blue barrels. 

33
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,975
These are capital costs. 

34
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:39,167
In contrast to these capital costs
which are paid one time

35
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,773
or only every few years

36
00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:43,604
operational maintenance costs incure
more regularly

37
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:45,584
often on day to day basis

38
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:48,784
for operation and maintenance
of different faecal sludge management

39
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,271
services.

40
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:52,938
Let us consider again
our previous example.

41
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,346
What would be operational
maintenance cost

42
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:57,302
 for this service provider?

43
00:01:57,502 --> 00:02:01,879
Fuel for the pickup or payment
of the salary of his staff

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,934
are examples for operational
maintenance costs.

45
00:02:05,134 --> 00:02:07,778
Replacing of personal production
equipment

46
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:09,129
or cleaning supplies

47
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,823
or paying of a discharge fee
at a treatment plant

48
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,420
are examples.

49
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,995
In this case the pickup is least
and the rent for the pickup

50
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:19,511
and additional operation cost.

51
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:22,936
Next to this example of this
collection service provider in Kampala

52
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:27,332
Kaplan operation and maintenance cost
incure for all stakeholders involved

53
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:29,159
in faecal sludge management.

54
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,668
This includes environmental
management authorities, 

55
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:36,468
utilities, municipalities, private
companies,

56
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:40,045
non-governmental or community
based organizations 

57
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,312
and household level users. 

58
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:45,609
These costs can be at very different
magnitudes and frequencies.

59
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:48,019
So, whereas the capital cost
for the gulper

60
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,386
is usually several hundred
US dollars

61
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:53,141
depending on in which country
it is being manufactured.

62
00:02:53,354 --> 00:02:55,344
A vacuum truck, as shown
in this picture,

63
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:58,199
may cost several thousand
or 10 thousand US dollars

64
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,959
And a city scale treatment plant
as shown here in Kampala

65
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,013
several million dollars.

66
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:06,991
So that faecal sludge management
service can be operated

67
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,482
over a long period of time.

68
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,992
Financial transfers need to balance
these costs of the different stakeholders.

69
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,479
For example, our service provider
would commonly cover

70
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,576
capital, and operational maintenance
cost.

71
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,953
Through a service fee that
he receives from a household

72
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:25,249
for the collection of faecal sludge
and transport to a treatment plant.

73
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:32,237
If this service fee is the only
revenue stream

74
00:03:32,437 --> 00:03:33,994
and cannot cover its cost

75
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,948
it will likely result in poor
performance of the service

76
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:39,535
or it would go out of business.

77
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:42,224
The number of financial transfers
in faecal sludge management

78
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:45,088
strongly depends on the stakeholder
arrangement.

79
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:48,143
This slide shows different
stakeholder arrangements

80
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:50,112
for faecal sludge management.

81
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:52,541
Each block represents
one stakeholder.

82
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:56,100
In the first arrangement one
stakeholder manages the entire

83
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,001
faecal sludge management
service chain

84
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:01,201
and there are no financial transfers
between stakeholders.

85
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:04,999
In contrast, other arrangements
such as the last one

86
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,669
where four main, four stakeholders
managing

87
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:09,522
the faecal sludge management
service chain

88
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:11,230
includes more stakeholders

89
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,071
and also potentially more financial
transfers between these stakeholders.

90
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:19,480
This slide shows a common example
of institution arrangements

91
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,133
in faecal sludge management.

92
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:24,586
That consists of a household,
a private company for faecal sludge

93
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:26,237
collection and transport,

94
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:28,406
a public utility
for faecal sludge treatment,

95
00:04:28,606 --> 00:04:31,778
And a farmer/industries that uses
faecal sludge treatment products.

96
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:35,537
In a common financial flow model
for this institution arrangement

97
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:38,625
the households pay a service fee

98
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,449
to the private service provider

99
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:43,826
for collection and transport
of faecal sludge treatment.

100
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:47,771
At a treatment plant, the company
pays a discharge fee.

101
00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:51,546
This allows the service provider
to legally discharge sludge.

102
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:55,073
This fee is paid in return
for transfer and responsibility

103
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:57,576
managing the sludge
from the collection and transport

104
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,334
service provider to treatment
service provider.

105
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:04,537
The sale of treatment products
by the utility provides revenue

106
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:05,944
for the utility.

107
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:09,892
So in this example, the service fee,
the discharge fee, 

108
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,592
and the revenue from the sales
of treatment products

109
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:14,306
are financial transfers.

110
00:05:14,506 --> 00:05:17,198
The direction of the arrows
indicating which direction

111
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:18,388
the money flows.

112
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:21,384
This is why we also call this
financial flow models.

113
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,499
Financial traces have an effect
up and down the service chain.

114
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,150
For example, in a model
we just discussed

115
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,350
one application could be when
the utility chain has a very high

116
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,650
discharge fee.

117
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,918
It will likely be passed on
to the household

118
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:39,309
by a high service fee charge
by the collection and transport

119
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,979
service provider.

120
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,992
This could prohibit customers
being able to afford collection

121
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,694
and transport services.

122
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:47,979
Especially they're poor households.

123
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:50,509
Another implication could be

124
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,319
even when sludge is collected

125
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,092
collection transport service
providers illegally dump sludge

126
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:58,429
to avoid the high discharge fee
as shown here.

127
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:03,158
In addition, as the public utility
operates without financial effort

128
00:06:03,358 --> 00:06:06,358
from the government authority
treatment could be less subject

129
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:09,850
to regulations which could result
in a poor treatment performance

130
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,780
or poor effluent quality.

131
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:15,687
How could this financial flow model
be modified

132
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,962
to reduce fees at the household level?

133
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,052
Ensure that faecal sludge is safely
collected,

134
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:23,510
reduce cost for the collection
transport service providers

135
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,560
that it can make sustainable business.

136
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,689
and ensure quality treatment.

137
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,739
One modification could be
budget support

138
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,450
of the utility
by a government authority.

139
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:40,136
The budget support could be funded
through a sanitation tax.

140
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:45,332
A sanitation tax if the payment
from households

141
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:49,067
to a government authority
in return for service such as water,

142
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,209
waste water or faecal
sludge management.

143
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,225
Sanitation's a public good.

144
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:57,934
And good sanitation has significant
health and economic benefits.

145
00:06:58,134 --> 00:07:01,493
This justifies that a budget support
to the utility

146
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,488
 can also be paid from other taxes.

147
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,558
Such as the property tax.

148
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,414
With this budget support
the public utility does not entirely

149
00:07:09,614 --> 00:07:12,970
rely on the discharge fee
and revenues from treatment products.

150
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,624
It has initial revenues and thereby
can reduce the discharge fee

151
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,483
which in turn reduce the total cost
for this private collection

152
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:22,275
transport service provider.

153
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,865
And also maybe the service fee
for collection and transport.

154
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:30,276
In some parts of the Philippines
households paid 10 to 20%

155
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:32,828
of their water bill to cover
collection, transport

156
00:07:33,028 --> 00:07:34,319
 and treatment costs.

157
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,956
This means that households produce
less water

158
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,723
and which also maybe have less money
pay less for faecal sludge management.

159
00:07:40,923 --> 00:07:44,106
This is one example how the social
economic realities

160
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:47,449
could be considered
in the sanitation tax.

161
00:07:47,662 --> 00:07:49,726
In parallel to the sanitation tax

162
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,796
government authorities could
also consider issuing of operational

163
00:07:52,996 --> 00:07:54,457
licences

164
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,282
for the collection and transport
service providers.

165
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:01,018
This would be in return
for the action of the discharge fee

166
00:08:01,218 --> 00:08:05,535
to operate in a certain area
offer issuing of a discharge license. 

167
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:09,937
Such licensing could be a first step
to formalize the collection

168
00:08:10,137 --> 00:08:11,193
transport sector.

169
00:08:11,393 --> 00:08:14,716
Improve standards and be enter point
for further interventions

170
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,691
For example, for schedule
faecal sludge collection.

171
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:21,511
As you have seen now they more or less
become more and more complex

172
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,224
and includes more stakeholders.

173
00:08:23,424 --> 00:08:27,236
Reliable denotation of a financial
flow model with more stakeholders

174
00:08:27,436 --> 00:08:29,229
and more financial transfers

175
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,568
requires good coordination
and management.

176
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:34,373
Such a model could be prone
to corruption

177
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,857
and relies on reliable tax collection

178
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,058
that can be challenging

179
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,657
especially in urban poor areas

180
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:42,188
with difficult accessibility
and tenure.

181
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:46,939
However, a sanitation tax could have
the benefit of providing a reliable

182
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,852
income for the public utility

183
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:51,502
that's required for reliable
operation and maintenance

184
00:08:51,702 --> 00:08:53,390
of the treatment plant.

185
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,882
One tool to manage this
increased complexity

186
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,989
could be to make financial transfers
electronic.

187
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:01,919
For example, with phone based
money transfer.

188
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:04,243
At the treatment plant in Kampala

189
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,323
collection transport
service providers

190
00:09:06,523 --> 00:09:08,959
paid a discharge fee
by transferring money

191
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:12,072
with their mobile phones
to their kind of utility.

192
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:15,253
So there's actually no cash being
handled.

193
00:09:16,353 --> 00:09:19,111
These were some examples
of financial flow models

194
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:20,993
developed for training purposes

195
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,825
and based
on available literature

196
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,677
and our work in Uganda,
Senegal and Tanzania.

197
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:29,115
There's no single financial
flow model that has been shown

198
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:32,728
to be effective for faecal sludge
management all situations.

199
00:09:32,928 --> 00:09:35,785
With a number of different
stakeholders that can be both public

200
00:09:35,985 --> 00:09:37,408
and also private.

201
00:09:37,608 --> 00:09:39,236
And the number of financial
transfers

202
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:41,520
A large number of different
financial flow models

203
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,109
could be developed.

204
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:46,747
In reality, as the urban areas
in which they exist

205
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:49,942
these financial flow models
can be much more complex

206
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:54,399
and dynamic will develop over time
and maybe also exist in parallel

207
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,372
to each other in one area.

208
00:09:57,435 --> 00:10:00,567
In this module we learned
about different financial transfers

209
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,310
in faecal sludge management

210
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,836
depending on different
stakeholder arrangements.

211
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:07,822
Financial transfers include
a sanitation tax,

212
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,551
service or discharge fee,
budget support,

213
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:12,761
a discharge
and operational licenses,

214
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:15,460
and sales revenue from treatment
products.

215
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
We also learned to read and discuss
financial flow models.

216
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,860
What is the financial
flow model in your city?

217
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,060
We hope that examples provided
in this module inspired you

218
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
to explore what could work best
in your city.
