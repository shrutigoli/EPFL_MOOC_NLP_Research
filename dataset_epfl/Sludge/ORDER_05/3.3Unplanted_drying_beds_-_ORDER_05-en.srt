1
00:00:04,163 --> 00:00:06,217
Even after settling-thickening
technologies, 

2
00:00:06,417 --> 00:00:08,403
faecal sludge is typically
mostly water.

3
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:13,032
So how can you convert it into
a solid product like as shown here?

4
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:16,302
It could be used, for example, as
a soil conditioner or a solid fuel.

5
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:18,969
In this module we will cover how
to achieve this

6
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:21,423
with unplanted drying beds.

7
00:00:21,623 --> 00:00:24,012
Following this module, you will
be able to explain

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,854
the treatment process and operation
of unplanted drying beds.

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,883
You will be able to discuss operation
and maintenance requirements

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:33,614
and name design parameters that are
specific to unplanted drying beds.

11
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:39,455
Welcome to the Niayes Waste Water
and Faecal Sludge Treatment Plant in Dakar. 

12
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:43,190
Here, faecal sludge and waste water
sludge are dewatered

13
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,488
and dried separately on unplanted
drying beds.

14
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:48,478
You can see sludge on the surface
of the drying bed.

15
00:00:48,678 --> 00:00:52,002
But the heart of a drying bed really
lies below the surface

16
00:00:52,202 --> 00:00:53,541
in the filter media.

17
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:56,404
Let's have a closer look.

18
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:59,636
This slide shows a cross-section
of an unplanted drying bed.

19
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:02,714
The filter media in a drying bed
typically consists

20
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:06,158
of different layers of gravel
and sand in decreasing diameter.

21
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:10,100
The bottom layer is typically made
of different layers of gravel

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,484
as shown here as a layer
of coarse gravel

23
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:15,866
and a layer of fine gravel.

24
00:01:16,722 --> 00:01:19,229
Based on designs from Kampala,
Dakar and Accra

25
00:01:19,429 --> 00:01:23,879
the coarse gravel layer typically
has a depth of 15 to 20 centimeters

26
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:27,314
and the fine gravel
of 10 centimeters.

27
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,711
The size of the gravel is commonly
10 to 40 millimeters

28
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:35,699
for the coarse gravel

29
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,392
and 5 to 40 millimeters
for the fine gravel.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,801
Below the bottom layer there  is
a perforated pipe

31
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,176
for the collection of the effluent.

32
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:49,092
This picture shows
the perforated pipe

33
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:51,256
and the coarse gravel layer
during filling in

34
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:54,272
at our pilot-scale research facility
in Dar es Salaam.

35
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:58,781
The top layer of the filter media
is typically sand

36
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:03,146
with a depth
of 10 to 20 centimeters.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,255
Sludge is loaded on the surface
of the central layer

38
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:11,697
for solid-liquid separation.

39
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:15,129
This picture shows the surface of an
unplanted drying bed

40
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,198
next to a drying bed that has been
loaded with faecal sludge.

41
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:23,607
The treatment process on drying beds
can be separated into two stages.

42
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:25,990
Dewatering and drying.

43
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:30,442
During dewatering, liquids
and solids are separated by filtration.

44
00:02:30,642 --> 00:02:34,658
The free water and sludge percolates
through the sand

45
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,897
and the gravel filter layers,
and is collected at the bottom

46
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:40,524
with a drainage pipe
for further treatment.

47
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,282
The sludge accumulates on top
of the sand filter layer.

48
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:49,710
Following dewatering during drying,
liquids and solids

49
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,703
are further separated
by evaporation.

50
00:02:54,754 --> 00:02:57,708
Dewatering usually takes several
hours to days.

51
00:02:57,908 --> 00:03:00,265
Where as the duration of drying
is usually longer

52
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,746
and takes several weeks to months.

53
00:03:02,946 --> 00:03:06,441
Similar to settling-thickening tanks,
drying beds are designed for

54
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,308
solid-liquid separation, and not
sludge stabilization,

55
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,036
nutrient management or pathogen
inactivation.

56
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:17,225
From a mass balance perspective, 
solids, organics, nutrients,

57
00:03:17,456 --> 00:03:20,653
pathogens, for the most part
either stay in the liquids and leave

58
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,740
with the drainage pipe or the solids
on the top of the sand filter layer.

59
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:29,533
For example, typically 95%
of the solids remain on the surface

60
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:32,046
of the sand filter layer
as shown here in Kampala,

61
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:35,163
where as the remaining solids 
stay in the liquid effluent.

62
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:39,106
These effluents also called (INAUDIBLE)
or (INAUDIBLE).

63
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:42,509
Depending on intended use, for
example in agriculture

64
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,364
both liquids and solids usually
require further treatment.

65
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:50,015
Solid-liquid separation on drying
beds is a batch process.

66
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,129
This means that beds are loaded
once with sludge

67
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,274
and once the desired silicone
has been obtained, 

68
00:03:56,474 --> 00:03:58,729
for example for use in agriculture
or for co-composting,  

69
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,914
the sludge has to be removed from
the surface of the sand filter layer.

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,194
This can either be done manually
with shovels and wheelbarrows

71
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,125
or mechanically with front-loaders.

72
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:11,070
During unloading of sludge,
care should be taken

73
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,017
to not remove (INAUDIBLE)  
with the sludge.

74
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:14,765
This increase the frequency
of the replacement

75
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,572
of the sand filter layer, and also
reduce the volume

76
00:04:17,772 --> 00:04:21,203
of the sludge for resource recovery,
for example,  as a solid fuel.

77
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,560
Drying beds have relatively low
maintenance requirements. 

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,439
But they are equally important
to ensure that

79
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,067
they operate as designed.

80
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:33,250
During each drying cycle, some sand
sticks to the faecal sludge

81
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,594
and is removed with it.

82
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:37,936
This means that the sand filter
layer needs to be replaced  regularly

83
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,729
as shown here at our facility
in Dar es Salaam.

84
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:44,287
A replacement of the sand filter
layer may also be required

85
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,487
when solids clog the filter layer.

86
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:50,320
The design and operation
of drying bed is typically based 

87
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,824
on the hydraulic
and solid loading rate.

88
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:55,812
Hydraulic loading rate is the height
of sludge

89
00:04:56,012 --> 00:04:58,440
that is loading on a drying bed
in one cycle. 

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,479
It is usually between 25 and 30 cm.

91
00:05:02,103 --> 00:05:05,052
The solid loading rate is the amount
of solids that can be loaded

92
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:10,158
on one square meter of drying bed
per year without risking clogging.

93
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:15,151
It is usually between 50 and 300 kg
total solids square meter a year.

94
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:19,288
In tropical countries
100 to 200 kg total solids

95
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:22,622
per square meter a year
are appropriate.

96
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,538
We'll use these design parameters
in another module

97
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:27,596
for the design of unplanted
drying beds.

98
00:05:28,471 --> 00:05:32,730
So what is the dewatering time with
unplanted drying bed in your city?

99
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,585
Here are some important
considerations to determine

100
00:05:35,785 --> 00:05:38,033
these times for your city
which are important

101
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,802
for the design of unplanted
drying beds.

102
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:43,205
It is important to consider
the dewatering properties

103
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,647
of faecal sludge in your city
as they can be very variable.

104
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,160
In our research, 
we saw significant difference

105
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,204
in the dewatering properties
of sludge from pit latrines

106
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:54,427
in comparison to sludge
from septic tanks.

107
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,795
In addition to these sludge
properties, the local climate

108
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,133
also has an influence
on the actual drying time. 

109
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,641
A high ambient temperature,
low relative humidity

110
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,283
so a dry climate, 
are optimal for drying.

111
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,940
In climates with frequent rainfall,
dewatering 

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,545
and drying times can be prolonged.

113
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,021
In these climates
with frequent rainfall

114
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:20,098
a cover over the drying beds
should be considered

115
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:24,834
as here shown in Lusaka, to ensure
year round operation.

116
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:29,129
Research from Ghana identified that
the dewatering time on a drying bed

117
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,455
will also depend on
the sand's diameter.

118
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:36,226
A coarser sand, say for example,
with a diameter of 1 to 1.5 millimeters

119
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:39,901
means faster filtration,
but an increased risk of clogging

120
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,733
to the accumulation of solids
in the sand filter layer.

121
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,982
In contrast, a finer sand,
for example 0.1 to 0.5 millimeters

122
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:52,627
means slower filtration, but also
less risk of clogging.

123
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:57,035
This diameter is often preferred
over coarse sand.

124
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,976
And ultimately, the drying time
will also depend

125
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:02,233
on the desired dryness
you want to achieve.

126
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:06,622
If you would like to use as fuel
90% dryness is usually required

127
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:09,678
whereas a much lower dryness
is required if you want

128
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:11,518
to do (INAUDIBLE)
or co-composting

129
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,963
or you want to produce the feedstuff
for fly larvae composting.

130
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,493
All these factors and different
drying by designs,

131
00:07:18,693 --> 00:07:22,015
operations and conditions, explain
the large variability

132
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,885
in dewatering and drying times
reported in literature.

133
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:28,194
Literature values can provide
general references.

134
00:07:28,394 --> 00:07:31,552
However, characterization of
the specific faecal sludge

135
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,187
and band skill testing
are always required

136
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:36,445
for the design of large-scale urban
treatment plants.

137
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,589
Based on operating experience
from unplanted drying beds

138
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,177
in various countries, some defined
element are specially important 

139
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,620
to consider for reliable
and long-term operation.

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,161
Here they are.
As you can see here

141
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:53,343
Pumps transferring sludge
often have a high pressure.

142
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,850
This could disrupt
the sand filter layer.

143
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,958
This can be mitigated by flash point
or separate inflow chambers.

144
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,058
Next to the particle size
of the sand filter layer

145
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:05,830
the uniformity of particles
is important.

146
00:08:06,524 --> 00:08:09,503
Fine particles need to be washed out
before they are used.

147
00:08:09,703 --> 00:08:12,026
You can see this process
at our pilot -scale 

148
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:14,321
research facility in Dar es Salaam.

149
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,250
Over here there were still a lot
of fine particles

150
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,494
which would then continuously
remove by washing.

151
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:23,303
This is important to prevent
clogging of the sand filter layer. .

152
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:26,690
It is worth to invest in
the development of a local supply

153
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,464
for the sand filter layer,
considering that it has

154
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:31,542
to be replaced regularly. 

155
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:35,524
The design also has to ensure
the side walls are high enough

156
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,540
and correspond to the hydraulic
loading rate

157
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,809
used in design plus a freeboard.

158
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,059
In addition, a ramp can be helpful
when removing 

159
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:44,828
the sludge from the drying beds.

160
00:08:45,864 --> 00:08:48,477
Unplanted drying beds
require a lot of space.

161
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:51,385
For example, in comparison
to mechanically watering equipment

162
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,702
such as screw press
or filter press. 

163
00:08:54,395 --> 00:08:56,676
Modification of drying beds
have the potential

164
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,305
to reduce the treatment times, 
and so also

165
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,080
reduce the treatment footprint
that is required. 

166
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,354
This for example, includes turning
of the sludge

167
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:05,894
from the surface of the drying beds.

168
00:09:06,094 --> 00:09:08,408
During our research in Dakar, 
we could reduce

169
00:09:08,608 --> 00:09:11,083
with these drying times by 20%.

170
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:13,989
In this module, we learned that
the treatment process

171
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:17,541
of unplanted drying beds is based
on filtration and evaporation.

172
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:21,416
Unplanted drying beds are operated
in batch mode and require

173
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:24,092
removal of sludge from
the surface of the drying beds.

174
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:26,861
In addition, the replacement
with sand filter layer

175
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,230
 is required for reliable operation.

176
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,056
Drying beds need to be designed
based on the local climate

177
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,942
and sludge characteristics.

178
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,263
The most important
design parameters include

179
00:09:36,488 --> 00:09:38,630
the hydraulic and the solid
loading rate.
