1
00:00:04,512 --> 00:00:05,974
Imagine have a bicycle.

2
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:09,553
What do you have to do so it run
smoothly over a long period of time?

3
00:00:09,753 --> 00:00:12,753
You have to put air into the tire
or fix the tube in case

4
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:13,959
you have a flat tire.

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:16,628
Also you have to grease the chain
and maintain breaks

6
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:19,239
so it runs smoothly
and is safe in traffic.

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,839
And you also need to lock it.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,748
Otherwise, it might get stollen.

9
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:26,317
As with the bicycle, operation
and maintenance is required

10
00:00:26,517 --> 00:00:28,103
for faecal sludge treatment plants.

11
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:31,000
In this module we'll introduce you
to important considerations

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,184
for long term operation.

13
00:00:33,397 --> 00:00:36,491
Following this module you'll be able
to list operation and maintenance

14
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:39,149
activities important for faecal sludge
treatment plants.

15
00:00:39,349 --> 00:00:42,492
Explain a manifest system
and know what operation and maintenance

16
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,770
plans include.

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,859
Operation and maintenance includes
a long list of activities.

18
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,337
They are very depending on the size
and the technology of a treatment plant.

19
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:54,005
In general, operation refers to all
activities that ensure

20
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:57,285
that the treatment plant delivers
delivers treatment as designed.

21
00:00:57,485 --> 00:01:00,631
Activities to ensure the operation
of a treatment plant starts

22
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,674
with coordinating
the sludge discharge.

23
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:05,961
This typically includes reporting
the sludge volume and origin

24
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:08,941
and payment of the discharge fee
by the collection or transport

25
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,950
service provider and coordination
of the sludge discharge.

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,059
By the private or public utility
managing the treatment plant.

27
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,053
This is shown here the faecal
sludge treatment plant in Kampala.

28
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,099
Many other activities associate
with the operation

29
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,818
of treatment technologies.

30
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:28,049
This, for example, includes cleaning
of screens at the inflow

31
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:30,626
of settling sickening tanks
or drying beds.

32
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:33,947
And also disposal of the solid waste.

33
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:37,860
Another example is the cleaning
of inlets and outsets.

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,789
For example, at waste stabilization
ponds, as shown here.

35
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,940
Other examples
are the loading/unloading

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,840
for example, of settling
sickening tanks

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,810
of drying beds

38
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,346
or the turning in co-composting.

39
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,490
Also treatment products need
to be managed.

40
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,206
You can see workers of a treatment
plant loading sludge from a drying bed

41
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:02,738
on a truck of a farmer for use
as soil conditioner in agriculture.

42
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:06,944
For more formalized resource recovery
from faecal sludge treatment product

43
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:09,220
this can also include
other activities.

44
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,685
For example, baying of the resource
recovery product

45
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,026
for example, compost

46
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,595
or marketing.

47
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:18,165
Operation of treatment technologies
may also require consumables

48
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:19,855
that need to be managed,
so they're available

49
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,059
when they're required.

50
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:23,286
They also might need to prepare
for their use.

51
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:26,926
Example of such consumables
are polymers aligned for conditioning

52
00:02:27,126 --> 00:02:29,868
to increase the dewatering
properties of faecal sludge.

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,312
Next to all these activities
which are linked to the operation

54
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,068
of the treatment technologies.

55
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,992
Monitoring of the treatment process
is important to asses whether

56
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:40,460
treatment plant operates
as designed.

57
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,797
Monitoring, for example, includes
records of the sludge volume

58
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,649
that is discharged
at a treatment plant.

59
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,798
This is important to asses whether
the treatment plant receives small

60
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,459
or less largely designed and this
will affect the performance

61
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,828
of the treatment plant.

62
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:56,992
In addition to records on a sludge
volume, characteristics of faecal

63
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:58,910
sludge discharge
at a treatment plant

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,727
and of treatment products
from treatment technologies

65
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:04,345
can be used to estimate
the treatments performance.

66
00:03:04,545 --> 00:03:07,106
So, for example, the settling
sickening efficiency

67
00:03:07,306 --> 00:03:08,793
in a settling sickening tank

68
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:12,317
can tell you how good
that settling tank is operating.

69
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:15,517
Also other process parameters, 
such as temperature in co-composting

70
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:16,762
can be important.

71
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:19,211
In co-composting the temperature
can be an indicator

72
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:20,685
 for pathogen inactivation.

73
00:03:20,898 --> 00:03:24,527
Such information is also helpful
to optimize the treatment plant

74
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:26,874
and potentially increase
its treatment capacity.

75
00:03:29,236 --> 00:03:32,854
Monitoring of a treatment plant
is also required to assess the quality

76
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,945
of treatment products
before its use.

77
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:38,145
Especially pathogens such as
e coli and helminth eggs

78
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:41,053
and to report authorities
on discharge concentrations.

79
00:03:41,253 --> 00:03:44,530
These include, for example,
Chemical Oxygen Demand,

80
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,841
suspended solids
and Ammonia Nitrogen.

81
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,019
In addition to recording the sludge
volume and characteristics

82
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,253
and to process parameters

83
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:56,614
a manifest system can be useful
tool for a treatment operator.

84
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:59,113
Let's have a close look.

85
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,586
The manifests form
has to be filled out

86
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,466
during the collection of faecal
sludge by the service provider.

87
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:07,402
It includes the name and other
details of the client.

88
00:04:07,602 --> 00:04:10,164
And also includes the type of onsite
sanitation technology

89
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:11,991
from which the sludge
is being collected.

90
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:13,823
In this case from the Philippines

91
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,005
only septic tank faecal sludge
is collected

92
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:18,061
but it can also include
other sludge types

93
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:21,087
such as pit latrine sludge
or sludge from public toilets.

94
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:23,862
The manifest also indicate
if the sludge is collected

95
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:27,500
from residential, commercial-industrial
or institutional onsite sanitation

96
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,491
technologies.

97
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:32,144
The manifest form also includes
details on the service provider.

98
00:04:32,344 --> 00:04:35,272
Following completion
of the collection service

99
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:37,871
the manifest form has to be signed
by a client.

100
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:41,924
Upon arrival at a treatment plant
the treatment operator has to approve

101
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:45,154
this manifest form in line with
the capacity of the treatment plant.

102
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:48,316
This could be a way to end
the defined industrial contaminations.

103
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:51,227
For example, when sludge
from industries is delivered.

104
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:54,420
The contribution of sludge
from different onsite sanitation

105
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,413
technologies, for example,
septic tank vs pit latrines

106
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,233
could also be important
as it has implications for treatment.

107
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,276
For example, the solid liquid
separation efficiency

108
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:05,961
on drying bed or in settling
sickening tanks.

109
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,710
The system should always
be complement of these visual

110
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,307
observations, such as the sludge
color.

111
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:14,440
Any other color than brown or black
could indicate industrial

112
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,509
contaminations which could disrupt
the treatment operation.

113
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,335
A signature of this manifest form
by the treatment operator

114
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:25,461
could also be a proof to the client
or government authority

115
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,720
that the service provider
discharge at legal location.

116
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,873
Maintenance activities ensure
the longterm operation

117
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:34,760
of equipment and infrastructure
at a treatment plant.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,524
This, for example, includes physical
inspection of servicing of pumps

119
00:05:38,724 --> 00:05:40,412
or tractors, or backup generators,

120
00:05:40,612 --> 00:05:43,065
that are relevant for settling
sickening technologies.

121
00:05:43,265 --> 00:05:46,555
Water replacement of (INAUDIBLE)
for drying beds.

122
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:50,162
This means that operation
and maintenance are interlinked.

123
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,788
Suboptimal operation can increase
the maintenance.

124
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:54,824
For example, by the failure of pumps

125
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:58,697
and suboptimal maintenance
will luckily lead to poor operation.

126
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:03,206
Every feacal sludge treatment plant
should have operation and maintenance

127
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,599
plans.

128
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,009
In general, operation and maintenance
plans document a procedure

129
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,036
of their operation
and maintenance activity.

130
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,340
It also includes tools that
are required to conduct the activity

131
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,299
and show how often the activity
has to be performed.

132
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:19,822
It also includes performance
indicators to measure

133
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:21,372
if the activity was successful.

134
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,729
And includes
health and safety precautions.

135
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:26,714
Such precautions should prevent
employees from getting sick.

136
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,352
For example, from pathogens

137
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,936
or electrocuted
from electrical devices.

138
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:33,850
An example of operation
and maintenance plans

139
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,134
are standard operating procedures
for the analysis of faecal sludge.

140
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:40,183
This can be downloaded
for free of charge from our website.

141
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,828
Documentation of the operation
and maintenance activities

142
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,426
document in these operation
and maintenance plans

143
00:06:46,626 --> 00:06:49,969
in log books and data summaries
are really important for internal

144
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:52,716
and external reporting
and decision making.

145
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,513
Operation and maintenance needs
to be performed

146
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:58,480
once a treatment plant
has been designed and constructed.

147
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,879
But it's really important
to consider these activities

148
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:03,948
at the early planning stages
of a faecal sludge management program.

149
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:06,752
Otherwise, treatment plans can fail.

150
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:10,628
Let's take this example
of a settling sickening tank.

151
00:07:10,828 --> 00:07:13,646
If a pump for sludge removal
cannot be operated

152
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,382
due to a lack of electricity

153
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:18,137
or the tank can't be maintained
because of the lack of funds

154
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,731
the tank will have a poor
performance.

155
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:24,122
This will affect subsequent
treatment steps and ultimately

156
00:07:24,322 --> 00:07:26,605
the effluent concentrations
of the treatment plant.

157
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:29,643
This shows that the selection
of a treatment technologies

158
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:32,226
has to consider the operation
and maintenance cost

159
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:36,115
and require operational capacities
of the lifetime of a treatment plant.

160
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:40,102
As in a lot of contexts realistic
operation and maintenance plan

161
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,896
would likely demonstrate
insufficient capacities.

162
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,636
These could be developed in parallel
to the construction

163
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:46,831
of a treatment plant

164
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,119
to ensure a longterm
and reliable operation.

165
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:53,541
In this module we learned about
typical operation and maintenance

166
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,149
activities such as coordination
of the sludge discharge,

167
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:59,272
cleaning of screens and tanks,
and monitoring.

168
00:07:59,472 --> 00:08:03,654
A manifest system can be helpful
tool to monitor the sludge discharge

169
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:07,111
into a treatment plant and to identify
industrial contamination.

170
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:10,488
These activities should always
be documented in operation

171
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:12,428
and maintenance plans.

172
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,800
Following these plans will ensure
that treatment plants operate

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,744
as designed and protect public
and environmental health.

174
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,944
In addition, to producing
marketable treatment products.
