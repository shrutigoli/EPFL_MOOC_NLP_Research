1
00:00:04,524 --> 00:00:07,149
Is city wide faecal sludge 
management

2
00:00:07,349 --> 00:00:08,937
just a pipe dream?

3
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:12,788
Like anything that is accomplished
at a city wide scale,

4
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:16,438
faecal sludge management requires
planning and management

5
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:18,651
for a sustainable implementation.

6
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:23,490
But at the same time, we need to
think of steps to start taking now.

7
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:27,881
We can't wait for years until
a city wide sanitation plan

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:32,694
has been developed and implemented,
and find a way to fully fund it,

9
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:35,469
then wait to get buyin
from all the stake holders...

10
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:39,181
We can't wait for all that before 
we start to take the first step.

11
00:00:39,557 --> 00:00:42,357
So in this module, I'm going
to share with you

12
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:44,782
now what's currently working

13
00:00:44,982 --> 00:00:46,582
in 3 different cities.

14
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:50,856
Following this model, you'll be able
to distinguish differences

15
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:54,543
in faecal sludge management among
the 3 presented cities

16
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:58,597
and identify examples of what is
and is not working

17
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,585
in the service chain of each city.

18
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:03,880
In faecal sludge management,

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,255
we are coming up with solutions
for existing cities

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,832
and for the current situation.

21
00:01:10,032 --> 00:01:14,433
So we need to be able to adapt
to the specific local situation

22
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:15,930
and most likely

23
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:18,792
no 2 solutions will look the same.

24
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:23,807
We need to distinguish between solutions 
we can start to implement now

25
00:01:24,445 --> 00:01:26,782
to manage the current sludge crises

26
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:29,982
And the most optimal and
sustainable solutions

27
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:33,307
that we can continue to strive
towards in the future.

28
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:38,622
<i>In this model, I'm going 
to focus on Hanoi, Vietnam,</i>

29
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:43,036
<i>Kampala, Uganda, and
Toyokawa, Japan.</i>

30
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,522
<i>I will introduce you to
the current reality</i>

31
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:50,397
<i>of how faecal sludge management 
is evolving in different regions.</i>

32
00:01:50,923 --> 00:01:53,461
<i>And what is working 
in these cities</i>

33
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,661
<i>that is better than many
other cities.</i>

34
00:01:56,985 --> 00:01:59,785
<i>But what are still some of
the remaining challenges?</i>

35
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:03,898
Vietnam, is a unique situation.

36
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:08,464
Since 1996, the building code
has stipulated

37
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:11,952
that any new construction
includes septic tanks.

38
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:15,843
In Hanoi, the access
to improved sanitation

39
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:18,243
is greater than 95%.

40
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:21,351
So the building code requires
septic tanks

41
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:25,189
but, it does not account for
the emptying of faecal sludge

42
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:28,264
which is also the reason,
public entities

43
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:31,201
do not have strategies in place
to manage it.

44
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:37,769
<i>In fact, septic tanks are typically
constructed under the house</i>

45
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,582
<i>without access.</i>

46
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:44,368
<i>And so a hole needs to be made
in the floor of the kitchen</i>

47
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:48,752
<i>to access the tank if sludge
is going to be removed.</i>

48
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:52,136
<i>This is what it looks like.</i>

49
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,808
<i>After several years 
of operation,</i>

50
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,021
<i>sludge accumulates 
in septic tanks.</i>

51
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:02,049
<i>If it is not removed, it results
in emergency situations</i>

52
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,849
<i>such as toilets backing up
into houses.</i>

53
00:03:05,373 --> 00:03:09,885
<i>This demand has resulted in private
emptying transportation companies</i>

54
00:03:10,186 --> 00:03:12,024
<i>springing up to meet 
this need.</i>

55
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:16,025
<i>In Hanoi, there are now
over 40 private companies</i>

56
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,075
<i>with over 100 trucks.</i>

57
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:21,523
<i>So far, it sounds reasonably
efficient and effective</i>

58
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:23,986
<i>for faecal sludge management,
right?</i>

59
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,966
<i>Everyone has septic tanks, there's
tons of companies and trucks</i>

60
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,754
<i>running around to empty them.</i>

61
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:32,366
<i>The law originally didn't
plan for that.</i>

62
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:35,566
<i>The private industry stepped
in and filled the role.</i>

63
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,708
<i>But unfortunately, that's not
exactly the whole picture.</i>

64
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:43,121
<i>What happens to the faecal sludge
after it's emptied?</i>

65
00:03:44,901 --> 00:03:47,964
<i>Collection and transport 
companies are official</i>

66
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:50,176
<i>and legally registered 
companies.</i>

67
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,864
<i>And they have the right
to empty septic tanks</i>

68
00:03:53,264 --> 00:03:56,914
<i>but they do not actually have 
the right to discharge that sludge.</i>

69
00:03:57,559 --> 00:04:00,559
<i>In fact, that's because there's
no designated place</i>

70
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,909
<i>within the city, for these private
companies to discharge.</i>

71
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,761
<i>So the service chain just
stops there</i>

72
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,111
<i>and the trucks just dump the sludge
wherever they can find a place.</i>

73
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:12,975
<i>So virtually all 
the faecal sludge</i>

74
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,713
<i>ends up directly 
in the environment.</i>

75
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:20,683
<i>This is illustrated in the shift
flow diagram of Hanoi</i>

76
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,521
<i>prepared by SANDEC.</i>

77
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,646
<i>It shows in green, what 
percentage of excreta in the city</i>

78
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:28,358
<i>is safely managed.</i>

79
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,247
<i>And in red, what percentage
is unsafely managed.</i>

80
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:36,921
However, as of last year,

81
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,521
there is a new decree in place
for the regulation of sludge.

82
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,463
And faecal sludge, 
is specifically mentioned

83
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,926
as one type of sludge
in this decree.

84
00:04:46,505 --> 00:04:48,755
Changes are not yet apparent

85
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,418
but this obviously takes some
time to figure out

86
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:53,905
after instituting the legal
framework.

87
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:57,443
It is very positive, that 
the Vietnamese government

88
00:04:57,643 --> 00:04:59,793
has officially recognised
the need

89
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:01,580
to manage faecal sludge.

90
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,893
And now, people understand 
the importance at a political level.

91
00:05:06,524 --> 00:05:09,274
Certainly, with such a strong
government structure,

92
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:11,312
changes will start to happen.

93
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,974
Okay. And now, moving
to Uganda.

94
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:19,979
Most people in Kampala also
have access to a toilet.

95
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:24,702
<i>However, that may mean
30 people are sharing it</i>

96
00:05:24,902 --> 00:05:27,277
<i>and it's not actually clean
enough to be used.</i>

97
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:32,249
<i>Around 80% of the population
are served by on site systems.</i>

98
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:35,271
<i>Of these, 70% are 
pit latrines.</i>

99
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,971
<i>About half lined, 
and half unlined.</i>

100
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,871
<i>And the other 30% 
are septic tanks.</i>

101
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,919
<i>To collect and transport all 
this faecal sludge</i>

102
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:47,206
<i>there are around 70 privately
owned trucks operating</i>

103
00:05:47,536 --> 00:05:51,149
<i>that belong to 2 well organised
pit emptyers associations.</i>

104
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:55,215
<i>There are also 6 manual
emptying businesses</i>

105
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:59,190
<i>using the gulper, working together
with Water For People.</i>

106
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:03,585
<i>KCCA, the Kampala Capital
City Authority</i>

107
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:07,792
<i>wants to formalise the faecal sludge
collection and transport sector</i>

108
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,079
<i>and this is high
on their agenda.</i>

109
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:14,504
<i>And there is also an operational
treatment plant</i>

110
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,860
<i>to deliver all that 
faecal sludge to,</i>

111
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,835
<i>which is operated by NWSC,</i>

112
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,722
<i>the National Water and
Sewage Corporation.</i>

113
00:06:22,922 --> 00:06:27,172
<i>2 years ago, the Lubigi Faecal
Sludge Plant opened up</i>

114
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:31,047
<i>with a designed capacity of 400
cubic metres per day.</i>

115
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:36,097
NWSC is also forward in 
thinking of solutions.

116
00:06:36,476 --> 00:06:40,114
For example, they had this tender 
out for private companies

117
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:43,426
interested in the design, build,
and operation 

118
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:45,839
of waste energy business models

119
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,751
at their treatment facility.

120
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:51,385
<i>There's also lots of applied
research being conducted</i>

121
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:55,635
<i>by the Universities, research 
institutes including SANDEC,</i>

122
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,527
<i>NGOs, and NWSC.</i>

123
00:06:58,942 --> 00:07:02,004
<i>Here you see research on
increasing rates of drain</i>

124
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,817
<i>generating fuel from faecal 
sludge for use in the kiln.</i>

125
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:09,156
<i>An optimisation of 
collection logistics.</i>

126
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,173
<i>These are pictures of the pit
emptyers association.</i>

127
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:16,998
<i>Another thing NWSC has done</i>

128
00:07:17,198 --> 00:07:20,873
<i>is set the fee for discharge that
collection and transport companies</i>

129
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,760
<i>have to pay, low enough</i>

130
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,123
<i>and is much cheaper than what
they charge households.</i>

131
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,235
<i>So the incentive of trucks
for illegal dumping</i>

132
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,760
<i>is quite low.</i>

133
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:34,516
<i>In addition, NWSC</i>

134
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:37,316
<i>provides space at their 
treatment plants</i>

135
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:40,979
<i>to locate their associations
and park their trucks.</i>

136
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:45,628
So what are the challenges still
being faced in Kampala?

137
00:07:45,915 --> 00:07:48,228
This is the SFT for Kampala

138
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:50,490
also prepared by SANDEC.

139
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,090
<i>We see safely managed 
excreta at 48%.</i>

140
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:59,331
<i>And unsafely managed
at 52%.</i>

141
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,731
<i>There's not enough treatment
capacity.</i>

142
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:07,309
<i>The Lubigi Treatment Plant was
already operating at capacity</i>

143
00:08:07,896 --> 00:08:10,034
<i>within the first month
it was built.</i>

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,938
<i>To address this,</i>

145
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:16,402
<i>NWSC reopened the Bugoloobi
Waste Water Treatment Plant</i>

146
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,896
<i>for discharge of 
faecal sludge</i>

147
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:22,446
<i>which is not ideal as it's now
over capacitated,</i>

148
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:26,108
<i>but much better than the 
alternative of illegal dumping.</i>

149
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,155
<i>In good news, Bugoloobi
is under renovation</i>

150
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,435
<i>and there are 2 more faecal
sludge treatment plants called for</i>

151
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:36,848
<i>in the sanitation master plan.</i>

152
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:39,460
<i>One of which, is in
the planning phase</i>

153
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,885
<i>but not yet in the
construction phase.</i>

154
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,429
Japan is a country
where on site

155
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,517
and centralised sewer based 
solutions  have evolved in parallel.

156
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,916
Japan can be held up
as an example

157
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,828
of how faecal sludge 
management can work

158
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:57,778
as a long term solution.

159
00:08:58,654 --> 00:09:02,467
<i>There is an effective system of
collection and transport in place</i>

160
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,842
<i>with discharge to treatment
plants subsidised.</i>

161
00:09:07,153 --> 00:09:10,428
<i>There are well organised and 
functioning treatment plants.</i>

162
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:17,920
<i>30% of Toyokawa is served
by on site systems.</i>

163
00:09:18,426 --> 00:09:23,026
<i>And 100% of excreta is
safely managed</i>

164
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:27,957
<i>as shown in this SFT, prepared
by Professor Hidenori Harada</i>

165
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:29,932
<i>of Kyoto University.</i>

166
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,708
So why does faecal sludge management
works so well in Japan?

167
00:09:35,938 --> 00:09:38,125
Due to the enabling environment.

168
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,811
<i>There's a system of laws
and enforcement in place</i>

169
00:09:42,011 --> 00:09:46,011
<i>to ensure that every year,
on site systems are inspected</i>

170
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,861
<i>and maintained by a licensed
service provider.</i>

171
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:55,301
<i>Collection and transport companies
are licensed and regulated.</i>

172
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:59,226
<i>Legal discharge of faecal 
sludge is subsidised.</i>

173
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:03,964
<i>The installation and manufacture
of on site systems</i>

174
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:08,639
<i>is regulated and as our on site
discharge standards.</i>

175
00:10:10,123 --> 00:10:14,035
So what has generated the successes
in all 3 of these cities?

176
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:17,566
We see that there is support
and acceptance

177
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:21,841
of the importance of sanitation
and now faecal sludge management

178
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,953
at the governmental level.

179
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,224
In Hanoi and Kampala,

180
00:10:26,424 --> 00:10:29,499
the municipalities are willing 
to look for new

181
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:32,699
and alternative solutions, 
which is critical.

182
00:10:33,248 --> 00:10:36,848
They have to be leaders to implement
successful solutions

183
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,530
as there are not a lot of 
models of success to follow.

184
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:42,976
This is in combination

185
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:46,089
with strong participation
by the private sector

186
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:48,890
which is now being acknowledged
by the government.

187
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:53,087
So even though these governments
are having to retrofit solutions

188
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:55,212
to their existing situations,

189
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:59,020
they are managing to piece together
city wide approaches

190
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,545
which can be implemented
and then improved upon.

191
00:11:04,494 --> 00:11:06,731
For more information on SFTs,

192
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:10,569
please visit the SFT promotion
initiative project

193
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,944
posted on the susana website.

194
00:11:13,144 --> 00:11:16,144
And also watch the model
shift flow diagrams

195
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:20,344
in our MOOC on planning and 
design of sanitation systems

196
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,944
and technologies.

197
00:11:22,832 --> 00:11:25,470
In this module, you learned
about differences

198
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,832
in faecal sludge management in 
Hanoi, Kampala and Toyokawa.

199
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:33,278
Examples of what is,
and is not working

200
00:11:33,478 --> 00:11:34,928
in each of the cities,

201
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,903
and we're introduced to
the shift flow diagrams

202
00:11:38,103 --> 00:11:41,903
illustrating safely and unsafely
managed excreta

203
00:11:42,103 --> 00:11:43,865
for each of the cities.

204
00:11:44,444 --> 00:11:47,057
Thanks for joining,
see you next time.
