1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,432
This is an F diagram.
It is called that

2
00:00:07,654 --> 00:00:12,142
because there 6 important
"F" words covered in the diagram.

3
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:19,417
They are feces, fingers,
flies, fields, food and fluids.

4
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:23,956
Do you know what these 6 F words
have to do with treatment objectives?

5
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,080
You'll learn about that
in this module.

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,901
Following this module
you'll be able to name

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,512
different treatment objectives,
relate health and environmental

8
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:35,997
impacts to these
treatment objectives

9
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:40,194
and understand that there are different
levels of appropriate treatment

10
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:43,408
depending on end-use
of treatment products.

11
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:48,425
The F diagram depicts fecal oral
routes of contamination

12
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,661
which is what we need to prevent
to ensure public health.

13
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,877
Fluids, if excreta contaminates
drinking water,

14
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:59,616
fields, if excreta contaminates
food crops,

15
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:03,509
flies, as flies are vector.
They are attracted to both

16
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:07,111
feces and food resulting
in cross contamination

17
00:01:07,364 --> 00:01:10,177
and fingers; not adequately
washing your hands

18
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:12,770
before touching food
or eating.

19
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:17,031
Our number 1 goal in
Sanitary Engineering

20
00:01:17,247 --> 00:01:21,697
and Fecal Sludge Management is always
the protection of public health.

21
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:26,080
Protection of environmental health
is also very important

22
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,170
and as shown in the
F diagram, these first 2 goals are

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,873
often very closely
linked together.

24
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:35,160
If excreta is contaminating
the urban environment,

25
00:01:35,534 --> 00:01:37,784
then it is a
public health risk.

26
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:41,612
A third goal that is important to
meet whenever possible

27
00:01:41,843 --> 00:01:44,856
is resource recovery
from treatment products

28
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,697
which is also tied closely
to the first 2 objectives.

29
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:53,078
Resource recovery is covered in more
detail in other modules.

30
00:01:53,318 --> 00:01:57,081
If it's not possible, then safe
disposal is a requirement

31
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:59,424
to ensure
the first 2 goals.

32
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,841
To achieve these goals
during treatment processes

33
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:05,495
we focus on 4
main treatment objectives:

34
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:07,671
The first one is
de-watering.

35
00:02:07,873 --> 00:02:11,148
Fecal sludge is typically
over 90% water

36
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:14,164
so de-watering to seperate
the liquid and solids

37
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:17,990
is very important.
De-watering is the removal

38
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,940
of more easily
separated water

39
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:24,649
like wringing out
this dripping wet towel

40
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,222
whereas drying is the further
removal of water that is bound

41
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:34,056
with the solids; like then
hanging the towel on a laundry line.

42
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:37,734
De-watering is important
because water is heavy

43
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:41,439
and expensive to transport.
Prior to effluent discharge

44
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,110
into the environment, solids
and liquids need to be seperated

45
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:47,906
to ensure adequate treatment
can take place

46
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,310
for public and
environmental health

47
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,450
and de-watering is typically
required for resource recovery.

48
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,987
Also important
is stabilization.

49
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,789
Stabalization is the process
of readily degradable

50
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:07,571
organic matter being coverted
as a result of biodegradation

51
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,690
to more stable
complex molecules.

52
00:03:10,946 --> 00:03:13,522
Here we see that happening
in composting

53
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:17,862
with heat being released during
the active decomposition phase.

54
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:23,323
This is important for treatment as
readily degradable organic matter

55
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,482
consumes significant amounts
of oxygen during degradation.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,595
For example, the classic
Streeter-Phelps equation

57
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:35,611
illustrates what happens if
waste water is discharged to a river

58
00:03:35,835 --> 00:03:38,522
with high concentrations
of BOD

59
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:42,697
resulting in the dissolved oxygen
in the river being consumed

60
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:46,399
which can gradually be recovered
with time or distance travelled

61
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:49,875
in the river until readily
degradable organic matter

62
00:03:50,122 --> 00:03:54,559
has been consumed and there
was no longer an oxygen demand.

63
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:58,072
Why do we care
about oxygen demand?

64
00:03:58,302 --> 00:04:02,601
Because aquatic organisms
need dissolved oxygen to live.

65
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:06,536
Stabalization also results in
nutrient stabalization

66
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,019
and odor
reduction.

67
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:12,462
Also important
is nutrient management.

68
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,064
Fecal sludge contains nutrients
which can be beneficial

69
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:18,712
if harnessed
for resource recovery

70
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:23,419
but if not managed properly, result
in environmental contamination.

71
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,025
Environmental impacts from nutrients
include nitrification

72
00:04:28,232 --> 00:04:33,431
and alga blooms in surface waters
and contamination of drinking water.

73
00:04:33,679 --> 00:04:38,391
In pathogen reduction, to revisit
what we learned from the F diagram

74
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,026
fecal sludge contains large amounts
of micro-organisms

75
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:44,588
mainly resulting
from feces.

76
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,472
These micro-organisms can
be pathogenic

77
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:50,707
and exposure to untreated
fecal sludge constitutes

78
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,979
a significant health risk
to humans either through

79
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:57,529
direct contact or
indirect exposure.

80
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,676
The transmission cycle of pathogens
can be interrupted

81
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:05,702
by putting barriers in place
to block transmission pathways

82
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:07,946
and prevent
cycle completion.

83
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,174
The appropriate level of treatment
will depend on the resource recovery

84
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,439
or disposal option.
For example,

85
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:19,114
drying fecal sludge to use it
as a fuel in combustion,

86
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:23,980
our number 1 objective is to
de-water to increase fuel potential

87
00:05:24,306 --> 00:05:27,744
and in this case pathogen reduction
is not so important

88
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:30,106
as the sludge
will be incinerated.

89
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:33,143
Whereas on the other hand
if treatment products

90
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:36,375
are to be used as soil
conditioners in agriculture

91
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:39,872
then pathogen reduction is an
extremely important

92
00:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,740
treatment objective.

93
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:45,094
The first barrier for 
beneficial use is provided

94
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,512
by the level of
pathogen reduction

95
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:50,297
achieved through the treatment
of fecal sludge.

96
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:53,642
A selection of further
post-treatment barriers may include

97
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,891
restriction of use on crops
that are eaten raw,

98
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,344
withholding periods between
application and harvest

99
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:03,930
to allow pathogen die off,
drip or sub-surface

100
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:08,617
irrigation methods,
restricting worker and public access

101
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:13,245
during application and
use of personal protective equipment

102
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:17,448
and safe food preparation methods
such as thorough cooking,

103
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,929
washing or peeling.

104
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,540
When considering risk of infection,
all potential exposure groups

105
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:28,340
should be accounted for which can
be broadly categorized

106
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,269
as workers and their families,
surrounding communities

107
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,779
and product consumers.

108
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:39,425
For more information on a
multi-barrier risk based approach

109
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,167
to ensure adequate protection
of public health

110
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:47,548
I recommend the WHO guidelines
for safe use of waste-water,

111
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:52,475
excreta and grey-water in
agriculture and aquaculture.

112
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:55,265
The Sanitation Safety
Planning Manual

113
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,108
and the Sanitation Safety
Planning Module

114
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,605
in Sandec's Mooc
on sanitation systems.

115
00:07:02,231 --> 00:07:05,457
Monitoring to ensure treatment
objectives have been met

116
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:09,667
is an important part of ongoing
operations and maintenance.

117
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,945
In summary,
in this module you learned about

118
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,119
treatment objectives
of de-watering,

119
00:07:15,346 --> 00:07:18,020
stabalization,
nutrient managment

120
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:22,162
and pathogen reduction.
Why they are all important

121
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:25,104
for the protection of
human and environmental health

122
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:28,107
and that appropriate levels of
treatment will depend

123
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,384
on the intended
end-use.

124
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,517
Thanks for joining.
See you next time.
