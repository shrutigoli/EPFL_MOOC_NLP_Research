1
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:06,706
This is a schematic of a Japanese

2
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:10,170
sludge vacuum truck that
includes de-watering.

3
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:12,963
My colleague,
professor Hidanori Hirada

4
00:00:13,043 --> 00:00:16,043
from Kyoto university
shared it with me.

5
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:19,211
<i>Nihongo ga wakarimasen.</i>

6
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:22,368
Unfortunately, that means my
Japanese is not good enough to

7
00:00:22,494 --> 00:00:26,044
translate this slide for you.,
but in this module I will tell you

8
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:29,259
a bit about de-watering trucks,
and we will also learn about other

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,298
innovations that are being made
in transportation of fecal sludge.

10
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:37,474
Following this module you
will be able to list alternatives

11
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:40,111
for optimizing the transport
of fecal sludge that

12
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:41,904
are ready for scaling up,

13
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:46,600
provide examples of potential ways
to improve collection of fecal sludge

14
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:51,157
and understand considerations
for implementation.

15
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:56,289
I will cover the following four
ideas to optimize surface provision

16
00:00:56,409 --> 00:00:58,534
of collection and transport.

17
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:05,061
A call center, GIS tools, transfer
stations and de-watering trucks.

18
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:09,201
All of these concepts have to do
with reducing distances that

19
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:12,242
water has to be trucked
or moved around the city

20
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:16,006
because water is heavy
and expensive to transport.

21
00:01:16,104 --> 00:01:19,029
These concepts can also help
increase service provision

22
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,604
at the house hold level
and reduce illegal dumping.

23
00:01:23,498 --> 00:01:27,323
ONAS - the National
Sanitation Utility of Senegal

24
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:30,441
with support from Bill
and Melinda Gates foundation

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,163
is piloting a call center for
emptying services in Dakar, Senegal.

26
00:01:35,289 --> 00:01:39,127
The concept is that instead of
individually calling truck or

27
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:42,688
service providers, when customers
want their on-site containment

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,033
emptied, they can directly
phone the call center.

29
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:50,381
The operator knows the location
of the house and then gets bids

30
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:53,942
from three different truck drivers
for the cost of emptying.

31
00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:57,262
The one with the lowest
bid gets the job.

32
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:01,832
Over three years they've
had over five thousand calls

33
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:07,440
as shown in blue, many of which
end up in emptying being performed.

34
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,807
It is thought that the calls that
do not end up in emptying

35
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:15,123
might be used to get a competitive
bid for another empty-er.

36
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:19,645
The average price for emptying with
an eight cubic meter truck before

37
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:27,485
the call center was $49 and after
three years had gone down to $42.

38
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:31,238
The call center is relatively
straight forward to run

39
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:35,473
with only one supervisor and
two people to answer the phones.

40
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:40,152
A business model was developed and
first piloted prior to the current

41
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:42,282
scaling up phase.

42
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:46,379
Other critical aspects of
the project, including organised

43
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:49,320
group of formerly
recognized empty-ers

44
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,738
committed on improving the sector

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,677
and training, certification, and
supervision of empty-ers to ensure

46
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,802
that they are doing their
work in a hygienic fashion.

47
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:03,716
It is also being evaluated whether
the trucks would be willing to

48
00:03:03,905 --> 00:03:08,481
install GPS trackers, so the call
center could select the drivers

49
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,804
closest to the customers, reducing
transport distances.

50
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:16,744
Also important is adequate
communication, and promotion

51
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:19,127
to customers.

52
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:27,738
This is a commercial that was used
in the promotion campaign in Dakar.

53
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:54,572
This is a study we conducted in
Kampala, Uganda, where

54
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:59,472
thirty four trucks voluntarily
let us outfit them with GPS trackers

55
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:06,131
and we checked 5653 emptying
operations over three months.

56
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,184
The GIS analysis of all these
emptying events provided

57
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:12,459
a powerful tool to understand

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,528
emptying service
provision in Kampala.

59
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:18,734
The results together with
demographic data were used

60
00:04:18,894 --> 00:04:23,007
to identify service provision
by density, income level in

61
00:04:23,107 --> 00:04:25,395
non-residential areas.

62
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:30,263
GIS data could also be used
as a powerful planning tool

63
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,763
for example, optimal
locations for transfer stations.

64
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:39,829
Key, again to this study, was
a strong empty-ers association

65
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:44,359
with a desire to improve the sector,
and voluntary commitment to

66
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:46,761
participate by the empty-ers.

67
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:50,698
The publication in this report with
all the maps can be downloaded

68
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,674
on our website.

69
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:56,126
Another innovation that is
frequently discussed

70
00:04:56,243 --> 00:05:00,293
but in reality rarely implemented
is transfer stations.

71
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,319
The goal of transfer stations is
to reduce the transport distances

72
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,472
and make transport more efficient

73
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,605
thereby also reducing
illegal dumping.

74
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:14,032
Transfer stations could be mobile
or fixed like the tank shown on

75
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:17,860
the cover of this report, which
can be downloaded on the internet.

76
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:19,942
More information can also be found

77
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,530
in chapter four, of the fecal
sludge management book.

78
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:27,211
Transfer stations could
be especially valuable

79
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:29,301
for areas that are not accessible by

80
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,008
trucks and are served by
manual empty-ers who can

81
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:36,126
only transport sludge
very short distances.

82
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,366
The transfer station could then be
emptied by a truck and driver to

83
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:45,532
a treatment plant, however, units
trialed in Ghana failed due to

84
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,499
the secondary collection which
was not frequent enough

85
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:52,136
so sludge settled too
much or over-flowed

86
00:05:52,278 --> 00:05:55,891
and garbage was also
the problem for the vacuum trucks.

87
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:00,653
If de-watering could be incorporated
into transfer stations, then they

88
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:04,267
could even be located
near existing sewer networks.

89
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,875
Once solids are removed,
it could be discharged to the sewer

90
00:06:08,964 --> 00:06:12,014
and only de-watered solids
would have to be transported

91
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:14,956
greatly reducing transport
volumes and cost.

92
00:06:15,063 --> 00:06:19,800
For example, here in Kampala, where
only about 20% of the poplulation

93
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:24,482
is served by sewers, our GIS
analysis shows there are lots of

94
00:06:24,594 --> 00:06:28,857
emptying events located near
the existing sewer network.

95
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,790
Of course, the impact to
down-stream treatment plants

96
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,367
would have to be
carefully evaluated.

97
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:37,850
Other difficulties with transfer
stations are that it is always

98
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:41,658
difficult to find available
space in urban areas.

99
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,560
They can be expensive and nimby,
convincing people to accept fecal

100
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,671
sludge handling in their back yard.

101
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:53,006
This brings us to the truck that
we saw in the introduction

102
00:06:53,106 --> 00:06:57,493
which is a de-watering vacuum
truck for fecal sludge in Japan.

103
00:06:57,946 --> 00:07:01,671
Trucks like this were first
in use there from 1980.

104
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:07,098
In the 90's the technology was
improved and in 2006

105
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:11,066
the ministry of environment
started promoting their use.

106
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:14,362
There are now several
hundred in operation.

107
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:18,754
There is a submerged pump and
a drum screen for solid-liquid

108
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:23,635
separation, this portal is
the inspection window where

109
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,235
the empty-er observes the sludge
and manually adjusts doses of

110
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:32,912
coagulants for de-watering
and aeration for mixing. 

111
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:36,845
The affluent goes directly
back into the on-site system

112
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:40,599
as treatment relies on
the bacterial community.

113
00:07:41,606 --> 00:07:46,694
This example is from Brasil used
for de-sludging of septic tanks.

114
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:51,787
This, on the other hand, is a mobile
de-watering unit for waste-water

115
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,440
treatment plants.

116
00:07:53,555 --> 00:07:56,555
In smaller towns, where it
is too expensive to build

117
00:07:56,687 --> 00:08:00,400
the water treatment plants,
this unit can travel around

118
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:03,902
and de-water sludge for
multiple treatment plants.

119
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:08,386
You can see how the concept of
the de-watering trucks could be

120
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:13,383
developed into mobile or fixed
de-watering transfer stations.

121
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:18,110
To further this concept,
the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation

122
00:08:18,218 --> 00:08:20,955
has been working on
the Omni-ingester.

123
00:08:21,064 --> 00:08:25,164
The goal of this project is to
develop a de-watering truck

124
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:29,130
that can also fully treat
the affluent so it can be directly

125
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,927
discharged to the environment.

126
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:36,969
Empty-ers would be able to empty
a lot more system in fewer trips

127
00:08:37,086 --> 00:08:40,086
by safely eliminating
the liquid on site.

128
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,499
The goal is also that it would be
able to empty any type of on-site

129
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,672
system in contrast to
the previous examples

130
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,370
which are for more specific
applications, like septic tank

131
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:54,063
sludge, or waste water sludge.

132
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:58,181
Therefore it would need to be
two types of units, one for more

133
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:01,294
wet systems and another for dryer.

134
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:05,089
It would have a pit-side unit
allowing access to sites

135
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,280
not accessible by truck, and be
able to empty all material within

136
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,570
including rubbish.

137
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,167
The truck has not
been actualized yet

138
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:19,521
but research has included
investigating mobile pumps

139
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:24,926
ways to separate
and clean debris

140
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:30,054
an electro-chlorinator
for affluent treatment

141
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,469
and of course, mechanisms for
de-watering the sludge.

142
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:38,130
This is a rotary drum thickener,
the biggest challenge of these

143
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:43,961
trucks so far is developing online
real-time dosing of coagulants

144
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:48,531
to be able to deal with such a wide
range of sludge characteristics.

145
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:52,562
This is a research question
for more development.

146
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,917
In this module you
learned about innovations

147
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:58,922
that are ready to be
scaled up for fecal sludge

148
00:09:59,028 --> 00:10:02,253
in addition to the ones that
are still being developed.

149
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:05,676
All of the examples could improve
the collection of fecal sludge

150
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:09,334
but all have different difficulties
in terms of what to manage

151
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,053
for scaling up.

152
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,641
Thanks for joining and
see you next time.
