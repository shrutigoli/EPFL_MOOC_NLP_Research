1
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:07,383
What type of financial 
considerations do you need to make

2
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:10,245
if you want to buy something
expensive, like a car?

3
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,671
How much money do you have?
How much money can you borrow?

4
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:16,868
The cost of borrowing money,

5
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:19,093
like time and interest
on a loan.

6
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:22,606
What model? Number of seats?
Fuel mileage?

7
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:26,269
Do you buy used or new?
What are the maintenance costs?

8
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:28,632
What's the useful lifetime
of the car?

9
00:00:28,832 --> 00:00:31,832
How long will you own it? And
do you plan to sell it afterwards?

10
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,670
These are the same types
of considerations

11
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:37,220
you need to apply in 
engineering economics

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,420
when deciding between
different treatment technologies.

13
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:44,636
Following this module, you'll
be able to understand

14
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,236
the difference between capital
and operating cost.

15
00:00:47,436 --> 00:00:50,986
Be able to calculate costs of
2 equivalent technologies

16
00:00:51,174 --> 00:00:53,911
with annualised capital and
operating costs,

17
00:00:54,111 --> 00:00:58,824
and explain how to include resource 
recovery into engineering economics.

18
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:03,360
Capital costs are fixed
one time expenses

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,260
incurred on the purchase of land,
buildings, construction, equipment used.

20
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:11,671
So for example, if you wanted to
build a treatment plant,

21
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,921
it would include the cost
of the property,

22
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,858
and the construction of
the entire facility.

23
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:20,358
But with sanitation, 
it also includes infrastructure

24
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:24,096
to get waste water or faecal sludge
to the treatment plant

25
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:26,885
because there's no point
in having a treatment plant

26
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:29,098
without a way to get
the waste water there.

27
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:33,405
Operating costs are the expenses
which are related

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,555
to the operation of a business
or equipment

29
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:38,368
or treatment facility.

30
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:39,993
With faecal sludge management,

31
00:01:40,193 --> 00:01:42,743
this could be collection in
transport businesses,

32
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:48,030
vacuum trucks, treatment facilities,
or the operations budget of the utility.

33
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,530
It is the cost of resources just
to maintain their existence.

34
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:56,413
Net operating costs, can
be offset by revenues

35
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:59,251
such as the sale of
treatment and products.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,875
If we think about the wide range of
faecal sludge treatment technologies

37
00:02:04,075 --> 00:02:06,738
that are available and covered
in other models,

38
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,238
it is already apparent 

39
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,963
that they will all have very
different costs of construction,

40
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:14,538
capital costs. But also different
operating costs

41
00:02:14,738 --> 00:02:17,225
based on the complexity
of operation.

42
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:20,966
In addition, they're going to
have very different lifetimes.

43
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,879
For example, comparing
infrastructure costs,

44
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,791
for how many years will 
a vacuum truck work?

45
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:30,554
Compare that to say, what is the
operational lifetime of a sewer?

46
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:35,182
<i>For example, the Cloaca Maxima
drainage system in Rome</i>

47
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:38,382
<i>is still operating
after 2500 years.</i>

48
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:42,139
It's like comparing
apples and oranges.

49
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:45,827
When costs and benefits differ over 
time, between different options,

50
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:48,960
we need to apply equivalent
equations

51
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:52,685
for the comparison of the relative
economic value.

52
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:58,159
To achieve this, we can apply 
concepts like annualised costs.

53
00:02:58,597 --> 00:03:00,022
If we know the capital costs,

54
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:05,261
operating costs, service lifetime,
and real interest rate,

55
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:09,899
we can use this equation to compare
the relative equivalent costs

56
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,099
of 2 different technologies.

57
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:16,532
As an example, I will walk
you through the case study

58
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,358
presented in this paper.

59
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:21,445
Comparing existing side 
by side sewer

60
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,908
and faecal sludge management
systems in Dakar, Senegal.

61
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:29,367
First, let's compare both 
of the process flows.

62
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:31,392
For the sewer based system,

63
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:34,229
there are sewer lines and
pumping stations,

64
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:36,829
followed by a waste water
treatment plant.

65
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:40,029
The process flow has screening
and grit removal,

66
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,946
<i>primary settling, </i>

67
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:46,460
<i>activated sludge, </i>

68
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:53,350
<i>clarifiers, with the effluent 
going to tertiary treatment</i>

69
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,250
<i>with some water reclamation
at a neighbouring golf course,</i>

70
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,963
<i>and the remainder discharged
to ocean.</i>

71
00:04:01,545 --> 00:04:04,795
<i>The solids, go to anaerobic
digestion</i>

72
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,770
<i>with some of the remaining solids
sold to public works</i>

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,720
<i>for use in green ways.</i>

74
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:13,840
<i>The faecal sludge 
management chain</i>

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,427
<i>has septic tanks, with vacuum 
trucks  for collection and transport,</i>

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,028
<i>with settling tanks, followed
by drying beds.</i>

77
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:30,296
<i>The effluent from both
the settling and drying beds</i>

78
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,358
<i>goes to the activated
sludge treatment</i>

79
00:04:32,558 --> 00:04:34,496
<i>in the waste water
treatment chain.</i>

80
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:38,721
<i>And the solids from the drying 
beds are also used in green ways.</i>

81
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:43,149
<i>These are the stake holders
and financial flows</i>

82
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,712
<i>that we considered in
the evaluation.</i>

83
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:49,942
<i>With the sewer based system, we
start at the household level user</i>

84
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:53,142
<i>who pays a sanitation 
tax to ONAS.</i>

85
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:56,735
<i>ONAS is the national 
sanitation utility.</i>

86
00:04:56,935 --> 00:05:00,898
<i>The sanitation tax, is included
as a drinking water tariff</i>

87
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:04,907
<i>to fund the sewer based waste
water treatment infrastructure.</i>

88
00:05:05,614 --> 00:05:08,264
<i>The end user of 
the reclaimed water</i>

89
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,964
<i>and the treated sludge,</i>

90
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:13,664
<i>also pays a fee to ONAS
for those products.</i>

91
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:16,751
<i>With the faecal sludge
management chain,</i>

92
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,501
<i>again starting with
the household level user,</i>

93
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:22,701
<i>they have to pay for construction
of their septic tank.</i>

94
00:05:23,345 --> 00:05:25,982
<i>They still pay 
the sanitation tax</i>

95
00:05:26,182 --> 00:05:28,982
<i>because it's incorporated
in the drinking water tariff</i>

96
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:31,057
<i>even though they are not
using the sewer.</i>

97
00:05:31,612 --> 00:05:34,062
<i>They also then pay
emptying services</i>

98
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>from a collection and 
transport company.</i>

99
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:40,947
<i>The collection and transport company
then pays an unloading fee</i>

100
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:44,035
<i>to ONAS, when they discharge
the faecal sludge</i>

101
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,560
<i>at the treatment plant.
Then again,</i>

102
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,010
<i>the end users are paying ONAS for
the resource recovery product.</i>

103
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:55,788
All of the calculations, data
and assumptions we used

104
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,175
are included in the supplemental
information

105
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,575
of the paper from the spreadsheet.

106
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:04,275
For all calculations, the real
interest rate of 5%

107
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,488
is assumed for the lending
interest rate

108
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:08,325
adjusted for inflation

109
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:11,013
based on values used
by the World Bank.

110
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:15,413
To estimate annualised capital
cost for the sewer based system,

111
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:18,024
we first had to assume lifetimes.

112
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,195
<i>For the household connections,
we selected 20 years.</i>

113
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,470
For the sewer, we used the
relatively conservative estimate

114
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,495
based on PBC construction
of 30 years.

115
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:31,292
Also 30 years for the pumping
station and treatment plant.

116
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:34,975
Then we needed to determine
the total capital cost.

117
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,774
This information was obtained
from ONAS directly

118
00:06:38,974 --> 00:06:41,186
from their operating information.

119
00:06:41,682 --> 00:06:43,957
And we had to derive a number

120
00:06:44,157 --> 00:06:47,157
for the number of household
sewer connections.

121
00:06:47,357 --> 00:06:51,607
This was based on the original number,
the number of people per household,

122
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,294
the growth rate to determine
a per capita value.

123
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,991
We then use annualised cost
equation

124
00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:05,031
to determine annualised
capital value.

125
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:08,936
In addition, we have
itemisation 

126
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,448
of annual operating costs

127
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,648
which are also provided
in a supplemental information.

128
00:07:16,188 --> 00:07:20,176
We then did similar calculations for
the faecal sludge management system.

129
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:22,876
<i>Well first, we had 
to assume lifetimes</i>

130
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:27,176
<i>here, 50 years for a septic tank,
15 years for an emptying truck,</i>

131
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:29,476
<i>and 30 years for 
the treatment plant.</i>

132
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:32,043
<i>Then we have total
capital cost</i>

133
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,368
<i>for septic tanks, vacuum trucks,
and for the treatment plant.</i>

134
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,404
<i>Again, then we have 
the number of per capita</i>

135
00:07:41,308 --> 00:07:43,795
<i>people that are served 
by the system.</i>

136
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:49,850
<i>We then annualised
these capital values</i>

137
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,050
<i>and itemised annual
operating costs,</i>

138
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:55,900
<i>also presented in 
the supplemental information.</i>

139
00:07:57,707 --> 00:08:00,819
This table from the paper
summarises the results.

140
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:03,707
<i>What we see is with
the capital costs,</i>

141
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,940
<i>the sewer based system,</i>

142
00:08:08,557 --> 00:08:11,457
<i>compared to the faecal
sludge management system</i>

143
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,217
<i>is ten times more expensive.</i>

144
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,142
<i>And with operating costs,</i>

145
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,409
<i>evaluated annually, </i>

146
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:29,527
<i>1.5 times more expensive.</i>

147
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,177
<i>So the overall sewer
based system</i>

148
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,477
<i>for both capital and annual
operating costs</i>

149
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,888
<i>was 5 times more expensive.</i>

150
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,639
What else we see from the results
is that with the sewer based system,

151
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,926
the costs are mainly borne
by ONAS.

152
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:50,889
Whereas in the faecal service 
management chain

153
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:54,314
the costs are much more
spread out among the stakeholders.

154
00:08:54,941 --> 00:08:56,816
It is also important
to note

155
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:59,866
that this is not equitable
as poor households

156
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,953
in the faecal sludge
management system

157
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:04,916
<i>are having to pay 
twice for sanitation.</i>

158
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:08,642
<i>Once with the sewer tariff,
included in their drinking water,</i>

159
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:12,750
<i>and 2nd, when they are paying for
faecal sludge management services.</i>

160
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,613
<i>This is where it is
also interesting</i>

161
00:09:15,813 --> 00:09:18,251
<i>to think about how resource
recovery options</i>

162
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,988
<i>could offset costs.</i>

163
00:09:20,188 --> 00:09:22,451
<i>In this model, 
resource recovery</i>

164
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:24,838
<i>is generating
almost no income.</i>

165
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,995
<i>What if we could find
an option</i>

166
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,529
<i>to get 10 dollars for a truck load
of 5 cubic metres of faecal sludge?</i>

167
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,151
<i>And in the car, </i>

168
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:39,951
<i>they have 2.2 million cubic metres 
of faecal sludge produced per year.</i>

169
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,470
<i>That would work out as
an annualised cost</i>

170
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,901
<i>of 8.8 per capita 
net operating gain</i>

171
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,214
<i>because it is something that
could be brought in each year</i>

172
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:55,276
<i>to offset operating costs.</i>

173
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:59,336
<i>This could have a significant effect
on the financial balance</i>

174
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,661
<i>of the faecal sludge
management system,</i>

175
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:04,586
<i>making it close to a net
zero total cost.</i>

176
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,054
<i>Could this be used to reduce
the financial burden</i>

177
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,554
<i>to poor households?</i>

178
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:12,331
<i>This is where we organising
financial flows</i>

179
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:15,381
<i>and thinking about business
models comes into play.</i>

180
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,688
When applying this type
of analyses, 

181
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:21,438
you also need to consider
other complexities.

182
00:10:21,638 --> 00:10:26,588
Like inflation, taxes, 
depreciation, economy of scale,

183
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,463
and salvage value.

184
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:31,476
And also, conduct 
a sensitivity analysis

185
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:34,676
to evaluate the effect of
any assumptions you make.

186
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:38,631
In addition, this example
was based on the assumption

187
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:41,417
that both systems are providing
the same level

188
00:10:41,617 --> 00:10:44,017
of public and environmental
health protection.

189
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,355
This model provided in
introduction

190
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,292
of one type of equivalent
equation method

191
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:52,592
that can be used 
to compare costs.

192
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,792
There are also many others, like
net present value.

193
00:10:56,337 --> 00:10:59,512
These type of calculations are
also further complicated

194
00:10:59,712 --> 00:11:01,475
with faecal sludge management

195
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:04,237
because many technologies
that we want to compare

196
00:11:04,437 --> 00:11:08,000
have not yet been implemented,
so we don't have experience

197
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,775
on which to base estimated
capital and operating cost,

198
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:14,587
and so we need to make
a series of assumptions.

199
00:11:15,135 --> 00:11:17,573
These estimates will
continue to improve

200
00:11:17,773 --> 00:11:19,910
with increased implementations.

201
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,557
So, like making a decision
about which car to buy,

202
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,820
it's not purely about the cost.

203
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,470
You also have to include
economic analysis

204
00:11:29,657 --> 00:11:32,207
with other variables
in the design approach.

205
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,745
Like environmental
and social impacts,

206
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:39,320
local laws and regulations, and
regional economic development.

207
00:11:39,772 --> 00:11:43,110
In conclusion, in this model
you learn the difference

208
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,497
between capital
and operating costs,

209
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,847
how to calculate the equivalent
costs of 2 different types of systems

210
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:52,887
and consider how to
include resource recovery

211
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,575
into the analyses.

212
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:57,293
Thanks for joining,
see you next time.
