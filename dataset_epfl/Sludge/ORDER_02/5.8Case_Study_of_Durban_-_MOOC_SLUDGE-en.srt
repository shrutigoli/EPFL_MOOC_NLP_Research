1
00:00:04,062 --> 00:00:07,211
In this introduction to faecal 
sludge management, you've

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:10,712
learned a lot about different
elements that need to be considered

3
00:00:10,912 --> 00:00:13,240
and integrated into one system.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,069
Including treatment objectives, 
multiple technologies, operations

5
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:22,965
and maintenance, resource recovery,
qualification and characterization,

6
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:27,771
financial considerations, legal
frameworks and planning.

7
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:32,050
In this module I'm gonna provide
you with an example of a city

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,820
where these aspects have all been
applied in a systems level approach.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,873
for an innovative adaptive and 
integrated approach

10
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:43,554
to faecal sludge management. 

11
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:47,451
Following this module, you will be
able to distinguish different

12
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:50,870
approached to faecal sludge 
management taken in Durban.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,086
Identify examples of what has worked
in the service chain in Durban

14
00:00:55,286 --> 00:01:00,551
and consider how management examples
could be applied in other locations.

15
00:01:00,764 --> 00:01:04,745
Now I will take you to the city of 
Durban, South Africa with Ethekwini

16
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:09,408
municipality that employs an approach
to faecal sludge management

17
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:14,024
that is innovative, adaptive, and
integrated. 

18
00:01:14,249 --> 00:01:20,268
We'll start the story in August 2000
when a cholera outbreak started

19
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:23,950
in the KwaZulu-Natal province where
Durban is located.

20
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,652
During one year there were over
100 000 cases with 260 deaths.

21
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:34,199
A positive outcome of this 
unfortunate crisis was that

22
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:38,443
it brought funding and recognition
to sanitation and lead to a policy

23
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:44,810
review and propagation of a national
sanitation policy in 2001.

24
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:49,751
Also in 2001, the current Ethekwini
municipality was formed

25
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:54,007
when the boundaries of the previous
Durban, what is now Central Durban

26
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:56,079
were greatly expanded.

27
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:02,641
With this change the city went from
400 sq. km to 2600 sq. km.

28
00:02:02,841 --> 00:02:05,915
The new boundaries were very 
complex.

29
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:11,052
Demographically, geographically, and
in terms of existing infrastructure.

30
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:16,408
They include urban, peri urban,
and rural areas.

31
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:21,681
Of 3 million residents in 2001
it was estimated that 1 million

32
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,823
did not have water or sanitation
services.

33
00:02:25,023 --> 00:02:29,505
Another million was supplied with
severely rundown services,

34
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,177
and 1 million had a high level of
service with flush toilets

35
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,842
and tap water.

36
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:40,428
In addition, HIV/AIDS and 
tuberculosis are rive.

37
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:44,668
Poverty is high. And it is a 
water scarce region.

38
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:49,957
In South Africa national policy 
states that all people have a right

39
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:53,180
to basic and free sanitation and
water. 

40
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,110
eThekwini Water and Sanitation
or EWS was now faced with

41
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,508
fulfilling the right of basic 
sanitation to everyone within

42
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,517
new boundaries. 

43
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:09,116
In addition, the new Durban
metropolitan area is undergoing

44
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:14,358
rapid growth. The goal of eThekwini
was to find solutions that would

45
00:03:14,558 --> 00:03:18,025
satisfy everyone, but they had
to act immediately

46
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:21,622
and could not wait for perfect 
solutions before doing anything.

47
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:26,567
Solutions needed to be developed
and perfected over time.

48
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:31,452
EWS set the following wash guiding
principles:

49
00:03:31,652 --> 00:03:34,931
working within the boundaries of a
water-scarce environment by

50
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:40,174
linking sanitation systems to water
supply; following the law of ecosan

51
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:44,137
by investigating ways in which
nutrients can be recovered for use

52
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:49,885
in agriculture. Ensuring that 
implementation is backed by sound

53
00:03:50,085 --> 00:03:53,761
scientific research through creating
partnerships with local

54
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:56,443
and international organisations. 

55
00:03:56,643 --> 00:04:00,081
Regularly interacting with the
people they serve to ensure

56
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:04,123
two-way communication and
awareness through an extensive

57
00:04:04,323 --> 00:04:08,610
educational outreach program. And
sharing of expertise with other

58
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,685
municipalities through the 
MILE initiative.

59
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:16,808
EWS also instituted a business
approach to management.

60
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,687
First built on the basis of their
own human resources to ensure

61
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,263
adequate capacity. 

62
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:26,566
Then building on that foundation
with a key focus on customer service.

63
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:30,825
If customers are happy, they will
pay for their services, so you can

64
00:04:31,025 --> 00:04:33,974
generate adequate revenue to run
your business.

65
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,677
Revenue then needs to be spent on
asset management and network

66
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:39,807
expansion.

67
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:44,350
EWS came up with a multi-faceted
approach that included waterborn

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,267
sanitation in a dense urban center
where a sewer was possible,

69
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:53,931
shown by the blue lines in this
figure. Dry toilets outside of this

70
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,433
area where sewers would never be
accessible due to the terrain and

71
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,309
population density. 

72
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,097
Septic tanks were home owners
wanting to take responsibility to

73
00:05:04,297 --> 00:05:08,644
install them. An ablution blocks
for informal settlements.

74
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:13,451
An integrated approach does not
only mean multidisciplinary, 

75
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:17,859
it means employing different
solutions throughout an area

76
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:21,867
that are appropriate for our context
into one integrated overall

77
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,846
management solution.

78
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:28,819
With the increased boundaries, 
EWS also inherited responsibility

79
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:33,701
for 35 000 pit latrines that became
a management problem as they became

80
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:38,662
full. And most of the areas are
difficult to access with trucks.

81
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:43,083
An emptying model was piloted
and then scaled up.

82
00:05:43,283 --> 00:05:47,249
And currently the existing pit
latrines are emptied by EWS

83
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,219
on a five years cycle.

84
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:54,428
Starting in 2002 for sanitation
provision outside the area that could

85
00:05:54,628 --> 00:05:59,085
be served by the sewer, EWS
implemented an innovative solution

86
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:01,212
with urine diversion toilets. 

87
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:05,737
These were two chamber systems
with alternate usage and storage

88
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:07,907
with a urine going to a soakaway.

89
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:12,381
This technology was selected as it
was expected that during

90
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:16,823
containment sludge would degrade,
become dry and spadable

91
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:20,534
and have reduced pathogens, so
people could manage faecal sludge

92
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:24,179
themselves instead of relying on
emptying services. 

93
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:28,534
Most of these areas are very 
difficult to access by truck. 

94
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,901
There was a massive rollout at these
innovative new toilets with 1000

95
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:38,762
installations per month. And 75 000
built by 2011.

96
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,022
As shown in this figure, this 
included an intensive monitoring

97
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:46,675
and evaluation program. That
included effectiveness of the

98
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:51,029
community education program.
Community acceptance, 

99
00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:54,937
maintenance by households, and
quality and durability of

100
00:06:55,137 --> 00:06:57,068
construction and hygiene.

101
00:06:57,268 --> 00:07:01,602
Reported problems included
dissatisfaction with odors, 

102
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:06,120
doors, vault covers, vent pipes and
poor construction.

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,304
Problems that were all addressed
by EWS.

104
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:16,422
However, following implementation
85% of respondents reported using

105
00:07:16,622 --> 00:07:21,731
the urine diverting dry toilets, but
only 34% reported satisfaction

106
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:26,013
with using them. One of the main
reasons was that they had to empty

107
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,420
and manage faecal sludge themselves.

108
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,972
And 80% of respondents were found
not to be maintaining them properly.

109
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:37,911
In addition, researchers found that
viable pathogens remained in the

110
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:41,303
sludge even after the two years
of storage.

111
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,055
It wasn't acceptable that the health
risk was transferred to the homes

112
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:48,359
instead or professional collection
services. 

113
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:51,957
To address these realities of 
customers wanting the same level

114
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:56,230
of services pit latrines, pathogen
destruction not as effective as

115
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,797
thought. Households that didn't
empty overflowing chambers,

116
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:05,312
in densifying areas where it was no 
longer possible to burry the sludge.

117
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:11,827
As of 2017, EWS has started a pilot
project to provide collection,

118
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:16,109
transport and off-site treatment
services for the urine diverting

119
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,994
dry toilet faecal sludge. With
service provided to households,

120
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:21,954
every two years.

121
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:26,550
Researchers are also evaluating
the possibility of incorporating

122
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,534
pour-flush toilets.

123
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:33,022
In areas that still have older pit
latrines EWS continues  to provide

124
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,844
emptying services on a 5 year
cycle

125
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:40,990
and has registered all of the 
locations on a municipal GIS system.

126
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,287
To meet sanitation needs in informal
settlements within the water born

127
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:49,833
area, community ablution blocks
with male and female facilities

128
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:54,498
including toilets, urinals, washing
basins and showers they all

129
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:57,944
drained to the sewer have been
installed to serve people within

130
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:01,056
a maximum walking distance of
100 meters.

131
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:05,022
The ablution blocks also initially
encountered problems due to theft

132
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,408
and vandalism. 

133
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:10,373
But to solve this the blocks were
remanufactured with robust and

134
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:12,421
non-valuable materials. 

135
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:16,040
Each block is also now allocated
with the care taker to manage

136
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,530
the facility. 

137
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,848
EWS provides consumables such as
toilet paper and cleaning materials

138
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:26,988
and responds to water leaks, toilet
blockages and vandalism.

139
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:32,306
Outside the water born urban edge,
ABR is followed by wet lands are

140
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,971
being investigated.

141
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:38,238
For treatment of faecal sludge
the LaDePa Pelletizer was developed

142
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:41,803
for pit latrine sludge after 
discharging of waste water treatment

143
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:44,748
facilities with causing them 
to fail.

144
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:48,991
Deep row entranchment has been
studied and currently black soldier

145
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:52,921
fly larvae are being evaluated
for the urine diverting sludge.

146
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:57,666
At the same time in parallel, EWS
maintains the sewer network

147
00:09:57,866 --> 00:10:01,234
and 43 waste water treatment plans.

148
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:06,046
The result over a relatively short
period of time has been an enourmous

149
00:10:06,246 --> 00:10:08,004
improvement in sanitation.

150
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:12,545
With 74% of excreting now considered
safely managed

151
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,672
and 26% not safely managed.

152
00:10:15,872 --> 00:10:19,501
But with 16% of that due to sludge
that is considered unsafely

153
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:22,962
contained in informal pit latrines.

154
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:26,803
So, what are the corner stones of
this case study that could replicated

155
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:28,453
in other cities?

156
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,873
That produce these successes and
what could have been seen as

157
00:10:32,073 --> 00:10:35,221
insurmountable management 
challenges.

158
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:39,007
EWS has practiced solution-based
thinking.

159
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:43,213
They thought outside the box, 
selected and implemented solutions

160
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:46,683
and then continued to learn from 
them and adapt. 

161
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:50,464
They recognized the importance of
progressive realization

162
00:10:50,664 --> 00:10:52,778
building on what is in place.

163
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:57,513
There's a strong, but also dynamic
regulatory framework in place to

164
00:10:57,713 --> 00:11:00,012
allow for this and manage risk.

165
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:03,584
New solutions are first trialed at a
pilot scale

166
00:11:03,784 --> 00:11:07,539
which is in official status 
recognized by the municipal council

167
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:11,978
during which projects are closely
monitored and include intensive

168
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:13,858
public participation. 

169
00:11:14,058 --> 00:11:17,813
Only after this phase can they be 
rolled out on a larger scale.

170
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:23,167
In this way, policy makers and
sector leaders encourage calculated

171
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:27,588
risk to continue improving service
delivery.

172
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:31,651
There is acknowledgement,
involvement, and commitment 

173
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:35,524
from the public sector, from the
national and local levels

174
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:39,682
with a commitment to the need for 
safe management of excreta

175
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:43,009
throughout the entire service chain.

176
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:46,652
Research is a foundation of this
innovative approach. 

177
00:11:46,852 --> 00:11:50,752
In technology, but also in 
understanding of community needs

178
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:52,730
and underlying factors.

179
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,274
EWS has a very strong collaboration
and participatory process with the

180
00:11:58,474 --> 00:12:01,766
universities in applied research to
address solutions.

181
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:05,797
With the strong commitment to open
communication and sharing of

182
00:12:05,997 --> 00:12:07,531
information.

183
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:11,948
The focus is not just on building
toilets or implementing technologies

184
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,735
operation and maintenance budgets
receive equal importance.

185
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:19,272
The whole program is built on
customer care.

186
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:25,405
The national principle with people
as the customers first.

187
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:29,182
A switch from an infrastructural 
approach to a service delivery

188
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,890
approach with a commitment to
comprehensive long-term community

189
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,266
engagement and education for mutual
trust and understanding.

190
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:43,957
Monitoring to ensure compliance
for public environmental health

191
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:46,958
but also success of the whole 
program.

192
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:51,563
The solutions are context specific.
But can also be time specific.

193
00:12:51,763 --> 00:12:55,367
What is right now will not 
necessarily be right tomorrow.

194
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,743
For example, in rural areas 
satisfaction with the urine

195
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,777
diverting toilets was higher.

196
00:13:01,977 --> 00:13:05,409
Whereas close to the water born 
infrastructure there was much less

197
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,292
satisfaction. 

198
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:11,258
Engagement of the private sector
throughout the service chain

199
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,769
including construction of toilets,
collection and transport of

200
00:13:14,969 --> 00:13:19,383
faecal sludge, operation of treatment
facilities and, importantly, 

201
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:22,952
recognition of the innovation 
they bring.

202
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:27,110
And finally, there is no "one size 
fits all" approach.

203
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,079
EWS has a culture which encourages
innovation and allows mistakes.

204
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,441
As long as they are learned from and
not repeated.

205
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:38,655
For more information about
the approaching eThekwini

206
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:42,205
I recommend these additional
sources.

207
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,664
In summary, in this module we
learned about different approaches

208
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:48,555
to faecal sludge management
taken in Durban.

209
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,952
Examples of what has worked in
the service chain.

210
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:56,423
And factors for success that
could be applied in other locations.

211
00:13:56,623 --> 00:14:00,219
Thanks for joining! 
See you next time.
