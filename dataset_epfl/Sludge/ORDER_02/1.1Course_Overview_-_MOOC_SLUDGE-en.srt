1
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,890
Welcome.
I'm Linda Strande.

2
00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:08,960
I'll be your host for
this introduction

3
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:10,943
to Fecal Sludge
Management.

4
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:13,856
I am an environmental
engineering scientist

5
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:17,403
at Sandec at Eawag.
My focus is on the 

6
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:21,482
management of excreta,
waste water and sludge

7
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,162
in low and middle
income countries.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,622
This course is part of a
4 part series by Sandec:

9
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:32,203
Sanitation, Water and
Solid Waste for Development.

10
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:35,593
In this course we will
teach you about how to

11
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:39,166
apply concepts of
sustainable fecal sludge managment

12
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:43,441
as a component
of achieving city-wide sanitation.

13
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,468
The target audience
for this course is you

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:50,146
because by being here you've already
shown interest in the subject

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,937
and by doing so I'm going to assume
that you're already aware

16
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:56,161
of the global relevance
and need for

17
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,830
sustainable sanitation
solutions.

18
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:01,908
A general background
in environmental engineering

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,313
urban planning
or natural science

20
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:06,956
might help to fully
benefit from this course

21
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:09,937
but to accomodate a wide
audience including anyone

22
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:12,587
having enthusiasm for
the topic,

23
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:15,876
we have provided additional
resources throughout the course.

24
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,878
If you would like to learn more,
learn more indepth

25
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,939
or get more up to
speed on a topic,

26
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:22,895
the possibilities
are endless.

27
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,365
Our mutual goal
is achieving

28
00:01:25,597 --> 00:01:27,810
global access
to sanitation.

29
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:31,248
As one part of achieving
city-wide sanitation

30
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:34,062
this course focuses
specifically on

31
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,267
fecal sludge management
in urban areas

32
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:39,791
of low and middle
income countries.

33
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:43,847
Specifically what happens
from the time that onsite systems

34
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,713
like pit latrines or
septic tanks become full.

35
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,887
How are they emptied?
How is that sludge transported

36
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:54,182
away from the community?
How is it treated

37
00:01:54,412 --> 00:01:58,612
and then safely used for
resource recovery or disposal?

38
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,918
We will address immediate solutions
for getting excreta

39
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:05,794
safely out of communities
but with a long-term vision

40
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,878
of developing new
and innovative solutions

41
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,980
that have
global relevance.

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,862
Before telling you
more about this course,

43
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,141
let me tell you
a bit more about myself.

44
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:20,116
My profession was previously called
Sanitary Engineering

45
00:02:20,352 --> 00:02:22,289
or Public Health
Engineering.

46
00:02:22,525 --> 00:02:26,413
The goal of Sanitary Engineering
is the safe removal of human waste

47
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:30,894
from communities while 
Public Health is by definition

48
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:35,373
a mulit-disciplinary science
with the goal of disease prevention

49
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:39,116
achieved through engagement
and education of society;

50
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:43,041
both communities and individuals
and organizations;

51
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,680
both public and private.
Hence in my profession

52
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:51,513
we need to engage technology but as
Sanitary and Public Health Engineers

53
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:55,755
we have to think beyond technology
in a multi-faceted approach

54
00:02:56,024 --> 00:02:58,962
to develop long-term
sustainable solutions

55
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:02,383
that include community health,
environmental health,

56
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:07,063
behavior change,
economics and public policy.

57
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,934
This is my motivation for
the approach in this course

58
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:15,269
which stresses that technology
on it's own is not a solution

59
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:18,885
and acknowledges the importance
of an integrated approach

60
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,819
which also builds on
the approach of the book

61
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,786
Fecal Sludge Managment;
Systems Approach for

62
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:29,699
Implementation and Operation
of which I am an editor and author.

63
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,272
The need for Fecal Sludge
Management is not new.

64
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:37,217
The focus on developing
solutions that work is what is new

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,078
and this is an exciting
time in the field.

66
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,056
It is rapidly growing
hence we engaged with

67
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:46,032
practitioners and scientists
around the world

68
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,977
to provide updated information
examples and case studies

69
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,960
in addition to the
basis provided by the book.

70
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,504
There is still a lot of work
to be done but

71
00:03:56,738 --> 00:04:00,963
research and implementation
are filling knowledge gaps.

72
00:04:01,782 --> 00:04:04,395
This course provides
an introduction to the topic

73
00:04:04,595 --> 00:04:07,020
with the goal of
providing you with the framework

74
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,523
so you can dive in
further on your own.

75
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,526
Although it's an introduction
at the same time it is quite dense.

76
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,708
To keep your learning
as active as possible

77
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,269
we will provide weekly wrap up
to summarize important points

78
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,085
and introduce the coming topics
in video questions

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,080
and opportunities for feedback,
a discussion forum,

80
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,261
additional resources
for self-guided learning,

81
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,250
3 quizzes
and a final exam.

82
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,993
This course is taught by me
together with Moritz Gold

83
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,497
an engineer who has worked with me
on the research and development

84
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,190
of solutions for
fecal sludge management.

85
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:48,241
We will also have guest lectures
from 2 of our colleagues.

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,072
Charles Niwagaba from
Makerere University

87
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:54,184
in Kampala, Uganda
and Philippe Reymond

88
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,685
from the Strategic
Environmental Sanitation

89
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:59,257
Planning Group
at Sandec.

90
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:03,308
To assist in your learning,
learning objectives are provided

91
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,297
for  each module
together with

92
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,290
these overall learning
objectives for the course.

93
00:05:08,577 --> 00:05:11,265
Following this course,
you will have an understanding

94
00:05:11,497 --> 00:05:13,710
of the importance of
fecal sludge managment

95
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,867
and what is currently lacking;
know fundamentals of

96
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,979
an integrated approach to
fecal sludge management

97
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:23,587
that includes technology,
management and planning;

98
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:27,137
be able to identify required
information for the

99
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,906
design and selection
of technologies;

100
00:05:30,143 --> 00:05:33,693
understand managment and
planning approaches that help ensure

101
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:38,126
sustainable solutions;
be able to explain current research

102
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:40,936
and innovations in
fecal sludge management;

103
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:46,107
and discuss how to approach the
implementation of solutions.

104
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:49,046
This is how the
5 week course is structured:

105
00:05:49,262 --> 00:05:52,687
Before you can do problem solving
you have to do problem finding

106
00:05:52,929 --> 00:05:55,492
so we will start out
the course in week 1

107
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,916
by showing you the problem
and then in subsequent weeks

108
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,518
buildup knowledge to be
able to work on it

109
00:06:01,784 --> 00:06:04,522
and make sound decisions
in deriving solutions.

110
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:08,954
We will start out with an
introduction to fecal sludge

111
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:12,045
and fecal sludge management
including the importance of

112
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,810
an integrated approach,
what is currently lacking,

113
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:18,587
what weak links
in the service chain are

114
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:22,376
and some examples of what
are and are not working.

115
00:06:22,988 --> 00:06:26,051
How do you build something
when you don't know what to build?

116
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,417
In week 2 we will introduce
fundamental knowledge

117
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,108
for understanding the treatment
of fecal sludge

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,860
and that is necessary for
the design and selection

119
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:39,464
of treatment technologies based on
an engineering design approach

120
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:43,648
including treatment objectives,
mechanisms, resource recovery

121
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:46,798
and quantification
and characterization.

122
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:51,078
In week 3 we will introduce examples
of established technologies

123
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:54,964
for the treatment of fecal sludge
including the treatment processes

124
00:06:55,201 --> 00:07:00,701
operation and maintenance requirements
and engineering design parameters.

125
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:03,795
Sanitation solutions in
low income countries

126
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:06,215
do not rely on
technology alone

127
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:09,581
and are prone to failure if an
integrated approach

128
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,886
that includes technology,
management and planning

129
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,285
in parallel
is not implemented.

130
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:18,123
So in week 4
we present the full picture;

131
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:22,298
in addition to technology,
aspects that need to be considered

132
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,657
to help ensure
sustainable solutions.

133
00:07:26,765 --> 00:07:30,240
Week 5 will then provide examples of
current research

134
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:35,061
and innovations in technology to
provide you with a solid understanding

135
00:07:35,276 --> 00:07:38,888
of the most up to date options
and what needs to be considered

136
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:42,001
for further development
and implementation;

137
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,427
including with a case study of
how all of these principles

138
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,887
have been applied
in one city.

139
00:07:49,114 --> 00:07:51,864
Maybe you will find it frustrating
that we're not here

140
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,755
to tell you the answers but
there is not a right answer

141
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:58,218
other than public health.
You need to be an innovator.

142
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,610
We want to challenge you in this
course to have a curious mindset

143
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,890
and be open to
the unknown.

144
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:07,572
Our goal is to inspire you
to understand the problem

145
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,067
and then think about
ways to address it.

146
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,867
Up to this point there's been
a relatively small group

147
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,633
of people working on the topic
and now we want to engage

148
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,767
all of you collectively.
What solutions can you come up with?

149
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:23,216
We will ask you to think about what
can you do in your city

150
00:08:23,425 --> 00:08:26,550
and contribute to an ongoing
discussion in the forum.

151
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:30,718
So please commit to participating
in the entire series

152
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:35,059
Each week presents a different theme
all of which is equally important

153
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:38,580
in understanding the topic
and the way forward.

154
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:42,955
So thanks for joining and
looking forward to seeing you in class.
