1
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:07,917
If you have ever taken care of plants
you know that they need to be

2
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,910
watered so that they don't welt.
That's because plants take water up

3
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:16,074
into their cells and this water
pressure helps keep them upright.

4
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,741
But have you ever seen on a really
hot day, plants welting

5
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:22,256
even though they appear
to have enough water?

6
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:26,391
That's because a plant's respiration
includes transpiration

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,311
of moisture out of their leaves.
On a hot day this transpiration

8
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:34,598
can occur faster than plants can
take up more water

9
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:38,961
causing them to welt even when
they do have access to water.

10
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:42,449
Following this module you
will be able to explain

11
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:46,278
treatments processes and operation
of planted drying beds,

12
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:49,411
discuss operation and
maintenance requirements

13
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:52,833
and name
important design parameters.

14
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:57,246
Over the last 20 years Sandec has
collaborated with researchers

15
00:00:57,495 --> 00:01:02,520
in Thailand, Cameroon and Senegal
to transfer the knowledge of

16
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:06,462
operating planed drying beds
in Europe with waste water and

17
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,230
bio-solid sludge to the treatment
of faecal sludge.

18
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:13,882
The technology has now been
successfully proven

19
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:17,622
but there is still not enough full
scale operating experience

20
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:21,194
to provide precise design and
operational parameters

21
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:25,716
for different contexts and so
implementation of this technology

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,995
still requires special
care and attention.

23
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:32,820
Planted drying beds are similar
to unplanted drying beds.

24
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,986
They consist of a gravel
and sand filter bed.

25
00:01:36,203 --> 00:01:39,540
Sludge is loaded onto the top
and the leachate percolates

26
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:43,722
through the bed and is drained
away in a perforated pipe.

27
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:47,224
The differences are
in planted drying beds

28
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,928
the filter bed is used
for growing plants.

29
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,870
This means that in
addition to evaporation

30
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:56,642
de-watering is occurring
through plant transpiration.

31
00:01:56,862 --> 00:02:01,050
Both of these together are called
evapotranspiration.

32
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,950
The plant roots also function
to help keep the bed from clogging

33
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:08,475
and provide a more complex
environment for the growth of bacteria

34
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:12,199
within the bed.
Planted drying beds are also

35
00:02:12,418 --> 00:02:16,593
operated in continuous mode;
not as a batch

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,238
so sludge is continually
loaded onto the beds

37
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,929
but only removed
after a period of years.

38
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,496
One of the most important
considerations for the

39
00:02:27,705 --> 00:02:32,092
design and operation of planted
drying beds are the plants.

40
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:36,162
They need to be able to grow in
relatively hostile faecal sludge

41
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,498
conditions and be tolerant to 
fluctuating water levels and salinity.

42
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:44,258


43
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:47,412
They need be fast growing,
have high transpiration rates,

44
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,639
deep-growing rhizomes and roots
and be non-invasive.

45
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:58,606
In Europe, reeds or Phragmites and
cattails or Typha

46
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,186
are the most
commonly used plants.

47
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,417
In Africa, Asia and Latin America,
indigenous plants are being explored

48
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,638
for adaption such as
Antelope Grass or Echinochloa 

49
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,700
and papyrus
or Cyperus.

50
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:19,594
An example is this paper identifying
3 new indigenous species in Senegal

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,165
that are good candidates for use
in planted drying beds.

52
00:03:23,606 --> 00:03:27,669
Echinochloa crus-galli, 
Paspalidium geminatum

53
00:03:27,887 --> 00:03:30,400
and Pasplaum
veginatum.

54
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:34,858
This is a drying bed following
harvesting of plants

55
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:38,075
also showing the plants
starting to grow back.

56
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,089
Plants are harvested by cutting
them at the surface of the bed

57
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:43,995
not by pulling them out
which could damage the bed

58
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:48,222
and prevent regrowth. Plants
are harvested when sludge is removed

59
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:52,399
but can also be harvested more
frequently for maintenance or

60
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,925
to sell as fodder.
For example,

61
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,286
this paper found that in Cameroon,
sale of the plants as fodder

62
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:04,646
could offset 7% of the annual
operating costs.

63
00:04:05,132 --> 00:04:08,369
Another important design and
operating parameter

64
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,845
is the aclimazation phase
required by plants

65
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,020
prior to growing in
full-strength faecal sludge.

66
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:18,199
The start-up phase takes
on average around 6 months

67
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:21,713
and in arid climates it should
start during the rainy season

68
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:25,352
for best growth. Examples of
how to do this

69
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:31,876
are going gradually from a loading
rate of 50 to 200kg total solids

70
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,123
per meter square per year with
a feeding frequency of 

71
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:37,344


72
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:38,654
of at least twice a week.
Another way would be

73
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,900
starting out with dilute waste
water or for example

74
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,691
effluent from a settling
thickening tank

75
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,966
and gradually moving to
full-strength faecal sludge.

76
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,380
During this period, visual
indicators of plant stress

77
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:55,673
such as yellowish color
or slow growth rates

78
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,425
should be carefully
looked out for.

79
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:02,554
Ponding to retain liquid
in the bed can also be used

80
00:05:02,787 --> 00:05:05,624
to prevent welting
in tropical climates

81
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,966
and potentially increase
treatment performance

82
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,046


83
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:16,511
but the bed should then be left
to fully drain before reloading.

84
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,874
This is sludge on a bed
without loading for 1 week.

85
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:27,019
Sludge loading rates can be based
on hydraulic loadings

86
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:30,844
or the amount of total solids.
Loading frequencies

87
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,934
are also going to depend on the
types of plants,

88
00:05:34,141 --> 00:05:36,479
climate and
treatment goals.

89
00:05:36,706 --> 00:05:40,269
For example, this paper found
that increased loading frequency

90
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:45,411
can increase plant growth, liquid
lost to evapotranspiration,

91
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:48,552
and the nitrification
of leachate.

92
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:52,526
If you base loading
rates on total solids,

93
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,084
to determine the required
surface area

94
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:03,673
you need to know
the total volume of sludge

95
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:07,346
that will be treated
on an annual basis.

96
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:14,904
The average total solids
concentration of the sludge;

97
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:19,580
then we just convert the
units here

98
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:24,540
divided by the loading rate
that you're going to use

99
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:29,296
and this tells you
the required surface area.

100
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:33,726
Desludging frequencies are
going to depend on factors

101
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,031
such as loading rate
and climate.

102
00:06:36,264 --> 00:06:38,514
Experimental data
from Cameroon

103
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,859
suggests that a loading rate of
200kg total solid

104
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:48,247
per square meter per year had
50 to 70cm per year

105
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:50,933
sludge accumulation.
That means

106
00:06:51,166 --> 00:06:55,678
if you had a free board of 2m,
this could result in

107
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,418
3 to 4 years
for desludging.

108
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:03,996
However other studies have had
lower accumulation rates

109
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:08,098
and desludging intervals can
even be up to 10 years long.

110
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:12,078
This is a hole looking down
into the sludge layer.

111
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:16,361
After the last loading, sludge
should be then left for a few months

112
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,317
for increased moisture
and pathogen reduction.

113
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,843
These long sludge
retention times

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,060
also mean that following removal,
the sludge is much more

115
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,451
stabilized than with the short
retention times of

116
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,839
unplanted
drying beds.

117
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,515
This table from the Fecal Sludge
Management book

118
00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:38,087
summarizes observed
treatment performances

119
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:43,176
with loading rates.
Percent removals

120
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:47,043
meaning what percent stays with
the sludge layer versus the leachate

121
00:07:47,246 --> 00:07:50,721
are quite high but what is
important to remember with

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,895
percent removals is that starting
with very high concentrations

123
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:58,468
that are in faecal sludge,
you still end up with

124
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:01,530
concentrations in the leachate
that are higher than

125
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:05,484
discharged standards.
Ways to treat dewatering liquid

126
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:08,487
from sludge are discussed in
Co-treatment

127
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,405
and Leachate Treatment
modules.

128
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,824
In summary, important design
and operating parameters

129
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:20,655
are loading, feeding frequency,
resting periods,

130
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:26,947
plant density, plant acclimatization,
and plant harvesting.

131
00:08:27,767 --> 00:08:30,379
Conclusions from Sandec's
collaborative research

132
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,858
on adapting planted drying beds
for the treatment of

133
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:37,058
faecal sludge include, planted
drying beds are viable

134
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,754
for faecal sludge treatment;
they're resistant to highly variable

135
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:45,272
hydraulic loadings;
higher loading rates

136
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:50,652
can be used in tropical climates;
plants need to be selected

137
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:55,108
for the local context;
fodder production can offset

138
00:08:55,332 --> 00:09:01,307
some of the operation costs;
sludge can be stabilized on the beds

139
00:09:01,636 --> 00:09:06,424
however it needs further treatment
for safe use in agriculture.

140
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,105
Desludging periods can be
up to 5-10 years long.

141
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:15,302
Pre-treatment with settling tanks
results in better de-watering

142
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:20,050
on planted drying beds.
The leachate requires further

143
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:26,093
treatment and research as it remains
one of the biggest challenges.

144
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:30,112
In this module we learned about
treatment processes and

145
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:32,471
operation of
planted drying beds,

146
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:35,038
operation and
maintenance requirements

147
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,710
and design
parameters.

148
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,892
Thanks for joining 
and see you next time.
