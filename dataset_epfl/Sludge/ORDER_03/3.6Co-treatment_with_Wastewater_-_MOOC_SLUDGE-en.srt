1
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:08,289
Why do you think this waste
water treatment plant failed?

2
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,980
Examples of failed waste
water treatment plants

3
00:00:11,128 --> 00:00:14,391
are abundant throughout
low income countries.

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:17,855
One common reason why is
people try to use them

5
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,531
for the treatment of fecal sludge
even thought they were designed to

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,287
only treat waste water.

7
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:27,226
In this module, we will learn
about ways the fecal sludge

8
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:30,522
and waste water could
be co-treated together.

9
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,527
Following this module,
you will be able to understand

10
00:00:34,699 --> 00:00:37,524
key considerations and
potential impacts 

11
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:42,256
of co-treatment of sewer-based
waste water treatment systems

12
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:46,168
explain the importance of
influent characteristic

13
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:49,982
on modeling of waste water
treatment plant performance

14
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,139
and understand that waste
water treatment plants

15
00:00:53,298 --> 00:00:56,998
are complex systems with
processes that could be upset.

16
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,879
As you are well aware by now,
fecal sludge is different from

17
00:01:02,043 --> 00:01:05,431
waste water and cannot
just be treated the same.

18
00:01:05,596 --> 00:01:10,921
It is much more concentrated,
variable, and is partially degraded.

19
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,843
There are possibilities for
co-treating fecal sludge

20
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:18,267
and waste water, but the possibility
of failure is high and

21
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:21,914
the consequences to failure
are very significant as then

22
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:25,071
neither waste would be
receiving treatment.

23
00:01:25,606 --> 00:01:29,106
Waste water treatment
plants are not black boxes

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,710
they are basically very complex
factories that are receiving

25
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,109
polluted water and turning it into
clean water and sludge.

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,984
The basis for stabilization
treatment are very diverse

27
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:48,075
from Lagoons, to activated
sludge, to trickling filters

28
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:54,667
as for de-watering from drying beds
to, centrifuges, to screw presses.

29
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:59,924
What is possible for co-treatment if
anything will depend on the type

30
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:05,007
and design of technologies,
the quantities and characteristics

31
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:09,823
of waste water and fecal sludge
including most importantly

32
00:02:09,992 --> 00:02:13,930
is the treatment plant
currently at capacity or not

33
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,774
and existing infrastructure.

34
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:21,575
It will also require a competent
waste water engineer who also

35
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:26,708
understands the complexities
of fecal sludge to model any

36
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:33,710
proposed modifications, and
also verify with in field testing.

37
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:37,762
If you have a waste water
treatment plant that is currently

38
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,780
under capacity there are three ways
you can investigate co-treatment

39
00:02:42,943 --> 00:02:44,268
with fecal sludge.

40
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:49,134
One, de-water the fecal sludge 
and send the resulting solid and

41
00:02:49,297 --> 00:02:51,622
liquid streams for treatment with

42
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,770
the solid and liquid
waste water streams.

43
00:02:55,472 --> 00:03:00,985
Two, treat the fecal sludge together
with the bio-solids starting from

44
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,180
the de-watering stage.

45
00:03:03,347 --> 00:03:09,510
And three, directly treat the fecal
sludge with the influent waste water.

46
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:14,119
In general, three is
not recommended

47
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:19,383
and it needs to be stressed that
fecal sludge should never be added

48
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:22,760
directly into secondary
waste water treatment.

49
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,467
The preferred option for
co-treatment is starting

50
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,631
with de-watering of fecal sludge.

51
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:32,963
This could include settling
thickening tanks

52
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:36,323
drying beds,
or mechanical de-watering.

53
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:38,720
If you're looking for
fecal sludge de-watering

54
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:43,526
solutions prior to the development
of additional infrastructure

55
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:48,889
temporary options like geo-textile
bags could be considered.

56
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:54,110
The afluent could then either go
into primary or the secondary 

57
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,282
treatment for co-treatment
with the waste water depending

58
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:03,449
on the characteristics and
the solids could be co-treated

59
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:07,911
together with the waste
sludge or bio solids.

60
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:12,558
With this option, waste increased
de-watering and frying of

61
00:04:12,726 --> 00:04:17,426
both solid streams could be
investigated thereby increasing

62
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:20,074
the treatment
capacity of the plant

63
00:04:20,217 --> 00:04:24,830
for example, with conditioning
the bio-burn pelletizer

64
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:29,626
mixing of sludge on drying beds,
or thermal options.

65
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:36,086
The second option is very similar,
but the fecal sludge going directly

66
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:39,689
to the waste water solids
de-watering step of

67
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:45,424
the treatment plant, for example,
de-watering on drying beds.

68
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:51,328
This figure is from the 1984.
US EPA publication on

69
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:56,201
how to co-treat septic sludge
in waste water treatment plants.

70
00:04:56,355 --> 00:05:01,805
The allowed loading depends whether
the treatment plant is a capacity

71
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:06,605
and what type of treatment
technologies are employed.

72
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,832
Now think about this,
if only 10% of operational

73
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:17,127
capacity within the aerated
lagoon you can still only add

74
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:22,343
3% of the total volume
as septic tank sludge.

75
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,458
For treatment plants that
are operating at 90%

76
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:31,540
of their capacity, the allowed
loading volume metrically

77
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:38,308
is less than one half of 1%
of the total influent volume.

78
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,829
But what is even more
important to consider

79
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:45,988
is that these calculations
were based on selected values

80
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,338
for septic tank sludge
in the united states

81
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,771
in the 1980's.

82
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:57,173
If we put the design value for
that figure onto our figure

83
00:05:57,331 --> 00:06:02,019
It's obvious that the diverse range
of fecal sludge that we're working

84
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:06,218
with in general a lot
more concentrated.

85
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:11,302
This means the possible loadings
would have to be adjusted to be

86
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:13,349
even much lower.

87
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,362
This stresses the importance of
when implementing anything

88
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:20,678
the tests need to be
made on local sludge

89
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:26,285
that will be treated to understand
the settling, de-watering behavior

90
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,102
and the characteristics and
the quantities that will be

91
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:30,548
treated.

92
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,146
Chapter 9 in the fecal sludge
management book

93
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,599
covers detailed modeling
and more depth, it cover

94
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:42,747
the impacts that fecal sludge with
different strengths, concentrations

95
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:47,214
degradable organic matter
and also inert solids have

96
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:50,381
on the loading on the waste
water treatment plants.

97
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,827
Impacts on operations
that can lead to failures

98
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,979
include reduced afluent quality,
maxed out aeration resulting

99
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,852
in an aerobic process
turning anaerobic

100
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:06,395
incomplete oxidation,
filament bacteria

101
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:10,237
and overloading of settling
tanks and clarifiers.

102
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:14,866
Overloading of anaerobic systems
can also lead to inhibition of 

103
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:19,113
biological processes and
increased sludge production

104
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,034
maxing out solids handling.

105
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:25,498
In addition the US EPA
recommendations are

106
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:27,402
for waste water treatment plants

107
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:30,701
serving areas that
are mostly sewered.

108
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,405
In areas where there is any
significant coverage by

109
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:38,701
on-site systems, which is the case
in most cities we are working in

110
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:43,761
in Asia, Latin America and Africa,
there needs to be separate

111
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,357
designated treatment of
waste water and fecal sludge.

112
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:51,503
For management purposes
it can effectively take place

113
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:56,179
at the same location but it
needs to be carefully planned out.

114
00:07:56,437 --> 00:08:00,075
As covered in other modules,
there are plenty of options for

115
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:03,789
the treatment of fecal sludge
and even many more possibilities 

116
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:08,412
like this process flow for treatment
of septage, or septic tank fecal

117
00:08:08,564 --> 00:08:14,439
sludge with an ABR filter and
wetland from the United States.

118
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:19,559
Finally, one of the most important
considerations when co-treating is

119
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:22,874
when and how to
add the fecal sludge.

120
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:27,470
Fecal sludge should never
be discharged to the sewer

121
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:30,642
unless it has been
de-watered first.

122
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:34,323
And the afluent is
going to the sewer.

123
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:40,725
Sewers are designed for the gravity
flow of waste water and thicker

124
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:44,069
fecal sludge does not have
the same flow properties

125
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:48,805
resulting in blockages
and overflows.

126
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:52,845
To avoid shock loadings
the proffered method 

127
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:57,304
would be a continuous flow at
a rate that is proportional to

128
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:00,218
the waste water influent.

129
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:04,084
To illustrate these points, I will
show you two different examples.

130
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:08,285
The first in the city of Manila,
the capital of the Philippines

131
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:12,358
is a treatment plant operated
by Manila water which is

132
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:17,018
a successful case study of
example one, de-watering

133
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:21,274
of fecal sludge and then co-treating
the liquid and solids with

134
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,302
the separate solid and liquid
streams from waste water.

135
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:29,558
This plant receives 2 million
liters per day of conventional

136
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:34,912
waster water and 0.8 million liters
per day of septic tank sludge

137
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:37,247
or septige.

138
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:40,600
This is the process flow
for the treatment plant.

139
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:45,574
The waste water treatment chain
is conventional activated sludge.

140
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:50,148
The waste water is treated
by primary sedimentation

141
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:54,133
activated sludge,
secondary sedimentation

142
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:58,270
and then disinfected
prior to discharge.

143
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:02,991
For the fecal sludge management,
vacuum trucks empty septic tanks

144
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:07,643
deliver the sludge to the treatment
plant, there is separate

145
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:13,582
pre-treatment for the fecal sludge
and then it is de-watered together

146
00:10:13,742 --> 00:10:17,342
with the solids from the waste
water stream with the addition of

147
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:20,129
polymers and a screw press.

148
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,449
The co-processed waste water
and fecal sludge solids are then

149
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,923
transported off site by an approved
contractor for treatment with drying

150
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:35,617
beds and co-composting with
rice hole and then used as

151
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:37,841
the soil amendment.

152
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:42,749
The second example is a project
developed by the federal university

153
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:47,245
of Minas Gerais, Brazil, as a part
of the international program

154
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,450
financed by the Bill and Melinda
Gates foundation for the project

155
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:54,608
coordinated by the UNESCO-IHE.

156
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:58,689
This is also an example of
the number one de-watering fecal

157
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:02,763
sludge and then co-treating
the liquid and solids together

158
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:07,201
With the separate solid and liquid
streams from the waste water.

159
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:11,369
This project took place in
Belo Horizonte in the state

160
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:15,461
of Minas Gerais, Brazil, which has
a well developed sewer network

161
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,450
together with poor areas
served by septic tanks.

162
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,683
Domestic waste water treatment
occurs in three parallel French

163
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,421
system system treatment wet-lands

164
00:11:25,594 --> 00:11:28,706
that have been
operational since 2009.

165
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,508
They operate in a weekly
cycle of feeding and resting.

166
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:37,724
Waste water is directly loaded in
batches onto one of the beds

167
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:40,535
following screening
and grit removal

168
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:47,139
and they achieve (INAUDIBLE) treatment
efficiency of 80% of COD and 84%

169
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:48,506
of TSS.

170
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:55,321
in 2013. the researchers evaluated
using the wet-lands system

171
00:11:55,494 --> 00:11:59,657
for co-treatment with fecal sludge
form septic tanks, they did this

172
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:03,979
by loading unit one with fecal
sludge and then alternating

173
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:08,644
different loadings onto units two
and three with the fecal sludge

174
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:12,733
leachate from unit one together
with the raw waste water.

175
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:15,356
The research was
focused on whether

176
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,510
the wet-lands system
could effectively

177
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:20,877
co-treat waste water
and fecal sludge

178
00:12:21,024 --> 00:12:24,724
and whether ponding or retaining
the leachate within the fecal

179
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:29,191
sludge bed for one week could
increase treatment performance.

180
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,336
Even with the reduced area
for waste water loading

181
00:12:33,493 --> 00:12:37,493
with only two units being used
instead of three, almost the same

182
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:43,616
treatment efficiency was observed
for waste water of 72% for COD

183
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,579
and 84% for TSS.

184
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:50,451
Ponding in the fecal sludge unit
also had the greatest impact

185
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:55,562
on improving treatment performance
with  removals for the fecal sludge

186
00:12:55,709 --> 00:13:01,034
of COD of 90% and TSS as 72%.

187
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:05,057
Based on their experience this
type of system is effective for

188
00:13:05,211 --> 00:13:09,799
co-treatment of fecal sludge
and waste water with one unit

189
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:13,649
designated for fecal sludge with
the leachage going to co-treatment

190
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,157
with waste water.

191
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:20,025
This full scale pilot could provide
fecal sludge treatment for around

192
00:13:20,184 --> 00:13:26,271
2500 population equivalence
with the 30 square meter surface

193
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:29,212
area for receiving the sludge.

194
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:34,435
And with available land this could
readily be scaled up as necessary.

195
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,102
In this module we've learned about
the complexities and dangers of

196
00:13:39,242 --> 00:13:42,792
co-treating fecal sludge in
waste water treatment plants

197
00:13:42,957 --> 00:13:47,082
and the importance of understanding
influent characteristics on

198
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,853
the complex functioning
of treatment plants.

199
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,655
Do you know of an example
in your city?

200
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:56,406
One that is a failure and why,
or another that's an example

201
00:13:56,566 --> 00:13:58,116
of success?

202
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:01,913
You should add it to the forum so
we can include it for discussion.

203
00:14:02,553 --> 00:14:05,728
Thanks for joining
and see you next time.
