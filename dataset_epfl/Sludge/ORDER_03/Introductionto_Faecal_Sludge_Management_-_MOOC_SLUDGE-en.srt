Hi.

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm Doctor Linda Strande.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,626
I work at Sandec

4
00:00:10,826 --> 00:00:12,098
the Department of Sanitation,

5
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:14,765
Water and Solid Waste
for Development,

6
00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:18,161
at the Swiss Federal Institute 
of Aquatic Science and Technology.

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,760
Have you ever wondered

8
00:00:19,935 --> 00:00:23,139
what happens to excreta
after you use the toilet?

9
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:25,151
- Why sorry!
- Hey, Linda!

10
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,959
I didn't realize
someone was in there.

11
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,289
Hi, I'm Moritz Gold.

12
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:30,424
I work together
with Linda at Sandec.

13
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:32,553
We would like to introduce you
to our new MOOC

14
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:34,314
on faecal sludge management.

15
00:00:34,514 --> 00:00:36,596
40% of the world's population

16
00:00:36,796 --> 00:00:39,016
relies on unsafe
sanitation technologies,

17
00:00:39,216 --> 00:00:41,148
such as  pit latrines
or septic tanks.

18
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,815
Hence, the management
of faecal sludge is imperative

19
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,411
for the protection 
of human and environmental health.

20
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,424
Our course provides
a solid introduction

21
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:50,870
to the essentials
of faecal sludge management. 

22
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,612
Following this MOOC,

23
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,450
you'll be equipped to start working 
on faecal sludge management

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,407
in your city.

25
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,403
with practical tools
that can be applied

26
00:00:58,603 --> 00:01:00,652
and a basis to continue building on.

27
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,394
The course covers aspects
of the service chain;

28
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:07,108
including collection,
transport, treatment,

29
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:10,553
 and end-users resource recovery
of safe disposal.

30
00:01:12,812 --> 00:01:14,782
This course is part
of the MOOC series

31
00:01:14,982 --> 00:01:18,035
Sanitation, Water 
and Solid Waste for Development.

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,009
This course is based on information
presented in the book,

33
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,442
"Faecal Sludge Management

34
00:01:23,642 --> 00:01:26,259
Systems Approach
for Implementation and Operation".

35
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:29,960
Faecal sludge management
is a new and quickly evolving field.

36
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,522
Therefore, this MOOC will include
recent research

37
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:36,419
and promising examples of successful
faecal sludge management.

38
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:42,701
All of this information is available
for free on our website.

39

The course covers
an integrated approach

40
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,947
to faecal sludge management

41
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:48,948
that it includes
planning and management

42
00:01:49,098 --> 00:01:50,073
along with technology

43
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:51,946
to ensure that systems
are integrated

44
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:54,811
into complex and dynamic
urban environments.
