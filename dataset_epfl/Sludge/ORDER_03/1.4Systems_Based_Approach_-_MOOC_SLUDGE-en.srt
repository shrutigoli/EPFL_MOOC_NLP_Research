1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:08,063
Have you ever found yourself
in a situation where you realize

2
00:00:08,263 --> 00:00:09,776
you should've planned better?

3
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,313
One of the most important things
to realize

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:14,067
about faecal sludge management

5
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:16,573
is that planning 
is an essential component

6
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,509
of sustainable solutions.

7
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:22,534
To ensure the system works
requires a complex service chain

8
00:00:22,734 --> 00:00:27,245
that depends on interactions
among people at every step.

9
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:31,199
Including the public, private,
and civil society,

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:35,097
the household level user,
the collection and transport companies,

11
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:38,282
operators of treatment plans,
and the final end user

12
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:39,696
of treated sludge.

13
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:44,767
In this module I will introduce you
to concepts of an integrated approach

14
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,432
that this course is based on.

15
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:51,447
Following this module
you will be able to explain

16
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,766
why an integrated approach
to city-wide faecal sludge management

17
00:00:54,966 --> 00:00:58,334
requires planning, management,
and technology.

18
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:01,183
Understand how the book
Faecal Sludge Management

19
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:04,479
Systems Based Approach
for Implementation and Operation

20
00:01:04,679 --> 00:01:06,423
fits into that framework.

21
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:10,940
And explain why a sound engineering
design approach is required

22
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,077
for the design and selection
of treatment technologies.

23
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:18,961
In the provision of city wide access
to sanitation

24
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,788
and sustainable provision of faecal
sludge management

25
00:01:21,988 --> 00:01:25,413
there are, unfortunately,
many examples of failures.

26
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,389
To help understand the scope
of the problem

27
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,610
and think about what not
to replicate

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,918
here are a few anonymous examples
of failures

29
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:36,094
that are based on real life examples.

30
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:41,158
First, a city where a treatment plan
was designed based on faecal sludge

31
00:01:41,358 --> 00:01:45,055
characteristics that were in published
references from other countries.

32
00:01:45,257 --> 00:01:49,235
The result was that because local
faecal sludge characteristics

33
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:50,480
were not considered,

34
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:53,699
the treatment plant was built
twice as large as required.

35
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,743
This represents a waste
of financial resources

36
00:01:56,943 --> 00:02:00,316
and potential operations problems
as the plant will not operate

37
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:02,326
as designed.

38
00:02:02,526 --> 00:02:06,525
In another city, the treatment plant
was built so far outside of town

39
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:09,871
that truck drivers could not afford
to transport sludge that far.

40
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,108
This is because land for treatment
is difficult to find

41
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:15,025
 in dense urban areas.

42
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,442
But the result was that it was 
never used

43
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:21,403
and trucks continued to dump sludge
directly in the urban environment.

44
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,904
Both of these examples
illustrate the importance

45
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:28,609
of always designing and planning
the faecal sludge management solutions

46
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:31,641
based on the local context.

47
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:34,918
In another city there was one
designated location

48
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:36,705
for dumping the faecal sludge.

49
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,782
Which was directly onto the beach
and in the ocean.

50
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:42,037
So a high core injunction
bended.

51
00:02:42,237 --> 00:02:45,290
However, the injunction had
to be lifted and trucks were allowed

52
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,703
back to dump on the beach

53
00:02:46,903 --> 00:02:48,692
because with no other alternative

54
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:52,756
trucks just had to find other places
to empty their tanks all over the city.

55
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:57,151
In another city there're over 40
legal collection and transport

56
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,805
companies operating,

57
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,721
but there's no legal discharge
or treatment location.

58
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:06,349
So, obviously, the legal businesses
have no other alternative

59
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:10,079
than to illegally dump sludge
wherever they can.

60
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:13,110
Both of these examples
illustrate the importance

61
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:14,898
of institutional frameworks

62
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:17,573
and the importance of clear roles
and responsibilities

63
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,652
for faecal sludge management.

64
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:23,025
Another example 
from countless cities

65
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,374
is a pump breaking
at a treatment plant.

66
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:29,204
Resulting in sludge not being pumped
out of (INAUDIBLE) and tanks

67
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:32,092
greatly reducing hydraulic
retention times

68
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:35,773
and in general leading to failure
and treatment not being achieved.

69
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,891
This illustrates the importance
of planning

70
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:42,763
and having a sound operations
and maintenance plan in place.

71
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:46,743
As design engineers
and practitioners

72
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:50,064
when working on solutions
at any step in the service chain

73
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:53,655
we need to be making intelligent
design decisions

74
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:55,880
based on an integrated approach.

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,655
Engineering design 
is the formulation of a plan

76
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:02,121
to allow you to build a product

77
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,061
or infrastructure with the specified
performance goal.

78
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,429
For waste water treatment plans

79
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,258
that usually means
designing treatment

80
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,854
to to meet affluent
and solid requirements.

81
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:18,015
Instead, frequently
for faecal sludge management

82
00:04:18,215 --> 00:04:20,517
decisions have been made
on available funding

83
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:22,635
by trying to spend all of it

84
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:24,568
or to be as cheap as possible,

85
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:28,682
or, in contrast, just copying
and pasting what worked in entirely

86
00:04:28,882 --> 00:04:30,010
different contexts.

87
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,883
Which has resulted in projects

88
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,163
designed for overly stringent
performance goals.

89
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,794
That also do not perform as intended

90
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,390
and frequently fail.

91
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,368
In an example of an engineering
problem solving methodology

92
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:47,632
you have a client who could,
for example, be a municipality

93
00:04:47,832 --> 00:04:50,170
and you have your specified
performance goal

94
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,944
 that you need to salve for.

95
00:04:52,144 --> 00:04:55,175
Then you determine the relevant
design variables

96
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:57,369
which include technical aspects,

97
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,283
but also social considerations
like cultural preferences.

98
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:04,514
Then you further define the problem,

99
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:07,395
develop alternative solutions,

100
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:10,251
and then can take decisions

101
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:13,359
to finally come
to your project realization.

102
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,917
We cannot effectively solve problems

103
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:21,138
until we have clearly defined
the problem we're trying to solve.

104
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:25,177
In an engineering design approach
for selection and design

105
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:27,008
of treatment technologies

106
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:31,573
this means first defining performance
goals or treatment objectives

107
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:35,346
Frequently, regulations
for the treatment of faecal sludge

108
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,935
do not exist or are not enforced.

109
00:05:38,135 --> 00:05:41,630
Which also greatly complicates
defining performance goals.

110
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,935
One way to do this is to design
for resource recovery,

111
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:49,178
which can define performance goals
that need to be met

112
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:51,894
while increasing financial flows

113
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,299
to offset cost in the service chain.

114
00:05:54,499 --> 00:05:57,914
And providing incentive
for efficient operation

115
00:05:58,114 --> 00:06:01,663
of treatment plans as they're
operating to produce products

116
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:04,062
that meet a market demand.

117
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:07,580
Depending on the form
of resource recovery

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,246
defined performance goals
are quote different. 

119
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:14,295
For example, pathogen reduction
is not as important

120
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:16,456
for use of faecal sludge
in combustion.

121
00:06:16,656 --> 00:06:20,328
Whereas pathogen reduction
is of outmost importance

122
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:23,519
for use as a soil amendment
for edible crops.

123
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:28,447
In week 2 we will present you
with tools that help select

124
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:31,165
optimal treatment products
for your city.

125
00:06:31,365 --> 00:06:35,221
The need for institutional
and regulatory frameworks

126
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,242
to stimulate resource recovery

127
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:40,313
and other aspects
of the enabling environment

128
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,537
are part of the sustainable
implementation

129
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,223
and city wide sanitation planning.

130
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:49,189
However, an engineering
design approach

131
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:51,562
is not only about resource recovery.

132
00:06:51,762 --> 00:06:54,819
It is first and foremost
the protection of public health.

133
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,439
And making intelligent
design decisions

134
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:01,456
starting by defining treatment
objectives is always essential.

135
00:07:01,656 --> 00:07:03,976
For example, if designing
for disposal

136
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:06,991
it still needs to be safe disposal.

137
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:10,054
Once you have defined
treatment objectives,

138
00:07:10,254 --> 00:07:13,998
then you can work backwards
considering all design variables

139
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:16,803
to arrive at a treatment
technology solution

140
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,881
to meet the defined goals.

141
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:24,213
Overdesigning treatment technologies
waste money and resources

142
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:27,950
while underdesigning does not provide
adequate protection

143
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,320
of human and environmental health.

144
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,739
This is why a design approach
is so important.

145
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:40,186
Another obvious design variable
is what will be going into

146
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:41,681
the treatment facility. 

147
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:43,899
So, you can make it the right size.

148
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:48,782
However, no reliable methods
exist yet for the quantification

149
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:52,547
and characterization of faecal 
sludge on a city wide scale.

150
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:55,779
Or relevant scale for the design
of a treatment plan.

151
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,036
So, on week 2, we will discuss
ways to approach

152
00:07:59,236 --> 00:08:01,618
 making reasonable estimates.

153
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,594
But what about all these other
design variables?

154
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:08,655
They include factors
such as existing infrastructure

155
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,569
and services, 
skills and capacities,

156
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:14,769
legal requirements, 
regulations,

157
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,242
norms, social acceptance,
operational maintenance,

158
00:08:19,442 --> 00:08:21,155
financial liability.

159
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:25,217
As engineers and practitioners
working in faecal sludge management

160
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,120
we need to fill many different roles
and realize the importance

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,136
of why solutions will fail

162
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,951
if not part of this larger approach.

163
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,203
As we will introduce in week 4

164
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:40,677
this is where a planning framework
helps you to determine relevant

165
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,494
design variables.

166
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,911
And when in a project cycle
to consider them.

167
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:51,464
A framework will guide practitioners
from the initial project planning phase

168
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:55,525
to implementation and ongoing 
operations and maintenance.

169
00:08:56,887 --> 00:09:01,198
In week 4 we will introduce
planning and management aspects

170
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:02,949
of an integrated approach

171
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,864
that helped form the foundation

172
00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:08,167
that longterm successful systems
are built on.

173
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:12,005
Planning represents the first phase
of designing a system,

174
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:16,098
but is necessary to ensure
a continuum of success

175
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:18,018
throughout a life of a project.

176
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:22,239
Management factors
such as institutionalization,

177
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:26,968
technical capacity,
legal frameworks, enforcement, 

178
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:31,162
fast recovery mechanisms
and operations and maintenance

179
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,993
will also help to ensure long term
project success.

180
00:09:35,968 --> 00:09:39,808
A systems level approach
is necessary to understand

181
00:09:40,008 --> 00:09:44,628
how all the steps are the complete
system integrate and influence other.

182
00:09:44,828 --> 00:09:48,033
To avoid the types of failures
presented at the beginning

183
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,092
of this module.

184
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:51,973
In integrated approach
at the city level

185
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:55,376
is especially important
with the faecal sludge management.

186
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:59,581
As globally experiencing
time and time again

187
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:03,043
that onsite and decentralized
technologies

188
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:05,746
are prone to failure
if not considered

189
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:08,425
as a component within
a larger system.

190
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:13,038
In this module we learned why
an integrated approach

191
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:17,298
to city wide faecal sludge management
requires planning, management

192
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:18,800
and technology.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,518
How the faecal sludge management
book fits into that framework.

194
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:26,160
And why a sound engineering design
approach is required

195
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,562
for the intelligent design
and selection

196
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,751
 of treatment technologies.

197
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:34,722
We will continue to revisit
these concepts in the coming weeks.

198
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:37,552
Thanks for joining!
See you next time.
