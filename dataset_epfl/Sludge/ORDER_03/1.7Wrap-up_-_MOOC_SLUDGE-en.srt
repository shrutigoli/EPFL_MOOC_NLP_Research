1
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,523
After your first week

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:07,882
of an introduction to
faecal sludge management,

3
00:00:08,065 --> 00:00:11,185
hopefully you feel confident
to explain what faecal sludge

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,956
and faecal sludge management are.

5
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:17,646
The goal of the first week
was to get you immersed in the topic,

6
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:21,711
because once you can understand and
define the problem you are working on,

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,627
then you can start thinking
of effective and relevant solutions.

8
00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,815
You should now have an understanding

9
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:32,226
of the global significance
of faecal sludge management,

10
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:37,542
as 40% of the world's population
are using onsite sanitation systems,

11
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:40,300
and that number
will continue to grow

12
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,694
with increasing urbanization.

13
00:00:43,263 --> 00:00:45,155
You know what faecal sludge is,

14
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,975
how it differs from
other types of sludge,

15
00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:51,303
factors influencing
the wide range of variability

16
00:00:51,507 --> 00:00:53,663
and characteristics
that will be important

17
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:56,611
for us to consider
with treatment objectives.

18
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:58,314
Did you have a chance

19
00:00:58,488 --> 00:01:01,370
to look at the examples
provided in this report?

20
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:05,591
You also learned about how
a complete sanitation surface chain

21
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:07,348
for faecal sludge management

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,263
is different than for
sewer based systems.

23
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:12,616
In contrast to flush and forget,

24
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,491
it is about interactions
between people

25
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,597
at every step in the chain.

26
00:01:17,888 --> 00:01:18,803
Along with this,

27
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,722
you also learned about
weak links in the service chain.

28
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:24,767
You saw multiple examples
with pictures

29
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,892
and a video of our FaME and U-ACT
research projects.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,381
Can you already identify
some of the problems

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,909
that need to be addressed?

32
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:36,189
Lack of financial resources?
Lack of existing infrastructure?

33
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:39,172
Lack of legal and
regulatory frameworks?

34
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:42,092
Building pit latrines
without thinking

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,060
what happens when they become full?

36
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,423
Hopefully,

37
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:49,559
you are also starting to think about
the different magnitudes

38
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,781
of problems that need
to be addressed.

39
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:53,515
The immediate problem

40
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,655
of getting excreta out of
communities and cities,

41
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:01,501
and longer term, the most sustainable
globally relevant solutions.

42
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:05,142
Onsite sanitation could provide
a less expensive

43
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,261
and more sustainable solution

44
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,171
that is less resource
and energy intensive,

45
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,032
but only if every step
in the service chain

46
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:14,800
is managed adequately.

47
00:02:15,828 --> 00:02:17,751
Concepts you are learning about

48
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:21,474
for applying sustainable city wide
faecal sludge management

49
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:23,774
include
the engineering design approach,

50
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,731
to think logically about
first defining treatment objectives,

51
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:30,707
then quantifying and
characterizing waste streams

52
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:32,263
that will need to be treated,

53
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:35,520
and then considering all of
the design variables

54
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:38,507
when selecting and designing
treatment technologies

55
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:40,581
to meet these goals and demands.

56
00:02:40,776 --> 00:02:44,211
In week 2, we will present
fundamentals you need

57
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:46,554
before you can start
applying this approach,

58
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,965
which will include
treatment objectives,

59
00:02:49,195 --> 00:02:50,479
resource recovery,

60
00:02:50,687 --> 00:02:52,917
a method to select
treatment products

61
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:54,740
with the greatest market potential

62
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:59,565
and how to quantify and characterize
faecal sludge on a city wide basis

63
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,645
or a scale that's relevant

64
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,166
to the design
of management solutions.

65
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,417
In week 4,

66
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:07,506
you will learn more

67
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,262
about all of the different types
of design variables

68
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:11,749
that you must consider,

69
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:15,391
and how a planning framework
can help you to think about them

70
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:17,677
and at which step
you need to consider them.

71
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,266
However, you are also now aware

72
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:24,985
that solutions are
not only about technology.

73
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:27,539
Finding solutions
are at the bottleneck

74
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:30,931
of planning, management
and technology.

75
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:34,459
This is why the concept
of an integrated systems approach,

76
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:37,471
as laid out in
the faecal sludge management book

77
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:40,893
and this course,
is so important to follow.

78
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,927
Hopefully, by now,
you've had a chance

79
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,061
to download and review the book

80
00:03:45,236 --> 00:03:47,800
and see that
there are 3 distinct sections

81
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,658
on technology, planning
and management,

82
00:03:50,828 --> 00:03:53,156
and also how they're all integrated.

83
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,093
Applying an integrated
planning approach

84
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,393
at the city level is imperative.

85
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:03,152
The entire enabling environment
must be considered.

86
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:06,947
In particular, management
and financial schemes

87
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:11,067
must be defined and validated
prior to making final decisions

88
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:12,609
on technical options.

89
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:15,066
To demonstrate the importance

90
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:17,794
of planning and management
for success,

91
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:21,089
you saw examples
of mistakes people have made.

92
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:24,757
For example, when not
considering the local context,

93
00:04:24,982 --> 00:04:27,521
a lack of institutional frameworks,

94
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,341
clear roles and responsibilities,

95
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:32,312
operations and maintenance,

96
00:04:32,492 --> 00:04:33,665
and planning.

97
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:37,272
In week 4,
we will present more details,

98
00:04:37,457 --> 00:04:39,996
including an integrated
planning approach,

99
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:42,746
legal frameworks and enforcement.

100
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:47,631
You also learned about what is working
and what is not working

101
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,937
in the faecal sludge management
service chain

102
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:51,571
in 3 different cities:

103
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:54,925
Hanoi, Kampala, and Toyokawa.

104
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:58,805
In Hanoi, more people
have access to toilets,

105
00:04:59,094 --> 00:05:00,904
most households have a septic tank,

106
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:04,084
and there are over 40
collection and transport companies.

107
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:07,400
However, there is nowhere
legal to discharge.

108
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:10,018
How will that change
with the new decree 80?

109
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,900
In contrast, in Kampala,

110
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,842
there is faecal sludge treatment

111
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:18,825
but access to toilets is
frequently crowded and unhygienic,

112
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,732
treatment plants are at
or over capacity,

113
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:24,150
and faecal sludge
in informal settlements

114
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:27,690
is frequently directly discharged
to the environment.

115
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,227
How will their sanitation
master plan change that?

116
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,500
In Toyokawa,

117
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:37,231
where 30% of sanitation
is met with onsite solutions,

118
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:41,026
when 100% of excreta
is safely managed.

119
00:05:41,292 --> 00:05:43,126
Have you started thinking about why

120
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,748
different aspects work
in each of these cities?

121
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:51,418
Hopefully, you understand now
the scale of the problem.

122
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,171
Did we overwhelm you?

123
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,379
Don't worry.
Solutions happen step by step,

124
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,410
and now we can start moving ahead
learning about deriving solutions.

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,922
What are steps you think
you could already take in your city?

126
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,940
Do you have any ideas?

127
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,436
Please add them
to the forum for discussion,

128
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,703
and please also be sure
to review the additional resources

129
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,681
we have provided on the platform.

130
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,220
Now, we'll move on to week 2,

131
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,967
where we present more
of the fundamental knowledge

132
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:22,862
that you need to start designing
and selecting treatment technologies,

133
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,255
including treatment objectives,

134
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:27,534
quantification and characterization,

135
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,204
resource recovery,

136
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:32,245
and we will introduce you
to technologies

137
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:35,513
that are used to get sludge
from onsite containment

138
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,167
to treatment plants.

139
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:39,846
Thanks for joining.
See you in week 2.
