1
00:00:04,585 --> 00:00:08,846
What type, and how much of solids,
organics, nutrients and pathogens

2
00:00:09,046 --> 00:00:11,376
are included in faecal sludge
in your city?

3
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:13,517
This is a very important question
to ask

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:15,559
for a selection
of collection technologies

5
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:18,269
and the design and operation
of treatment plants.

6
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:22,453
In this module, we introduce such
relevant characterization parameters.

7
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:24,461
Following this module,

8
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:27,235
you'll be able to explain
the importance of characterization,

9
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,689
select relevant
characterization parameters,

10
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:32,788
and choose existing resources
for characterization.

11
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,455
Characterization of sludge
can be qualitative,

12
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,499
for example,
by monitoring the sludge color

13
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:41,347
that is discharged
at a treatment plant.

14
00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,083
The color is different
from brown or black,

15
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:45,438
as shown in this video,

16
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:48,336
which could indicate
an industrial contamination.

17
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:54,887
Such qualitative characterization
is important for treatment operation

18
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:57,904
but does not replace
quantitative characterization.

19
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,926
It is always required
for the design,

20
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:03,109
operation, and monitoring
of treatment plants.

21
00:01:03,388 --> 00:01:06,749
Missing or unreliable information
on characteristics

22
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:09,956
commonly leads to poor performance
or complete failure

23
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,862
of collection
and treatment services.

24
00:01:12,797 --> 00:01:15,412
Let's consider, for example,
this settling-thickening tank:

25
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,012
one technology
for solid-liquid separation

26
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:20,301
that is discussed
in a separate module.

27
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,969
Among others,
a settling-thickening tank

28
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:24,906
is designed based on
an amount of solid

29
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,183
that requires treatment.

30
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,324
On the one hand, underestimating
a solid's concentration

31
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:31,607
in the design process

32
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:34,707
will likely overload the technology
during operation

33
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,041
and result in
poor effluent characteristics

34
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,421
that can affect subsequent
treatment technologies,

35
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:42,050
and ultimately,
the discharge concentrations.

36
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:43,703
On the other hand,

37
00:01:43,926 --> 00:01:46,308
overestimating solid concentrations

38
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:48,939
will lead to the construction
of tanks that are too big

39
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:53,191
which wastes financial resources,
and also influences its operation.

40
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:57,434
Quantitative sludge characterization
requires laboratories

41
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,779
with equipment and technicians,

42
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:03,380
as shown at a treatment plant here,
in Dakar in Senegal.

43
00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:07,507
As these laboratories
and their operation incur costs,

44
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:10,595
characterization parameters
should be carefully selected

45
00:02:10,824 --> 00:02:13,627
to answer one, or several,
specific questions.

46
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,410
These questions could be,
for example:

47
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,928
What is an appropriate
collection technology?

48
00:02:20,368 --> 00:02:23,273
What are design parameters
for treatment technologies?

49
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,600
Or does the effluent
from a treatment plant

50
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:27,375
meet legal discharge limits?

51
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,437
To answer these questions,
it is helpful to group

52
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,019
characterization parameters

53
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,832
that are relevant for
collection and treatment.

54
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,609
Parameters that are relevant
for resource recovery,

55
00:02:37,842 --> 00:02:40,724
for example, compost,
are discussed in another module.

56
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,005
For the selection 
of sludge collection technologies

57
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:46,727
it is important to know
whether the sludge can be pumped.

58
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,490
Therefore, solid parameters
such as total solids,

59
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,954
total suspended solids,
and viscosity are important.

60
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:57,835
In addition, it is important to know
the amount of solid waste

61
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,749
as it can clog and damage
collection equipment.

62
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:02,730
Characterization parameters

63
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:05,268
that are relevant for different
treatment technologies

64
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:07,803
can be grouped according to
their treatment objectives.

65
00:03:08,295 --> 00:03:11,149
For technologies designed
for solid-liquid separation,

66
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:15,335
solid parameters such as total solids,
also called TS,

67
00:03:15,576 --> 00:03:18,122
and total suspended solids
are important.

68
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,256
Total solids are, for example,

69
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:22,436
important for the dimensioning
of drying beds

70
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:24,866
and other solid-liquid
separation technology,

71
00:03:25,058 --> 00:03:26,911
shown here at
a faecal sludge treatment plant,

72
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,967
close to Bangalore, in India.

73
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,211
Other important parameters

74
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:33,230
for solid-liquid
separation technologies

75
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,216
include the sludge volume index,

76
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:38,933
a metric to estimate solid and
liquid separation of faecal sludge,

77
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:42,123
the amount of solid waste,
oil and grease

78
00:03:42,411 --> 00:03:43,563
and grit and sand.

79
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:48,507
Removal of grit and sand
and solid waste

80
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,537
is often the first treatment step
following discharge,

81
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:55,310
as shown here at a treatment plant
in Kampala in Uganda.

82
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,383
For technologies designed
for sludge stabilization

83
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,604
total volatile solids,
also called TVS,

84
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,876
the chemical oxygen demand,
also called COD,

85
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,138
and the biochemical oxygen demand,
also called BOD,

86
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,705
are important parameters.

87
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,569
The BOD and COD are, for example,

88
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,156
important for the design
of waste stabilization ponds

89
00:04:21,357 --> 00:04:23,156
that can be used for treatment
of effluence

90
00:04:23,338 --> 00:04:25,191
from solid-liquid
separation technologies,

91
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:28,086
such as settling-thickening tanks,
or drying beds.

92
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,924
The ratio of BOD and COD,
and TVS and TS,

93
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:36,078
can also be used as an indicator
for the relative biodegradability

94
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:38,342
of organics and faecal sludge

95
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:40,996
that affects
biological treatment processes.

96
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,400
For technologies designed
for nutrient management,

97
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:49,691
ammonium, nitrate, 
nitrite, and phosphate

98
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,188
are important parameters.

99
00:04:51,828 --> 00:04:55,250
Pathogen inactivation is ultimately
the most important objective

100
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:56,710
in faecal sludge treatment.

101
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,440
Instead of measuring
individual pathogens,

102
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:02,473
indicator organisms are used
to provide a measure

103
00:05:02,775 --> 00:05:06,544
of pathogen concentrations
and inactivation during treatment.

104
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:12,128
Examples of indicator organisms
are viable helminth eggs, and E-coli.

105
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,731
Helminth eggs are commonly used
as an indicator

106
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,460
for pathogens in the solids.

107
00:05:17,653 --> 00:05:20,356
For example, in dried sludge,
or a compost,

108
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:23,666
as shown here in these pictures,
at a faecal sludge treatment plant

109
00:05:23,868 --> 00:05:25,920
in San Jose in Costa Rica.

110
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,413
In contrast, E-coli are important
for the liquid fraction,

111
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,277
for example, from
settling-thickening technologies,

112
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:37,155
drying beds, or the effluent from
a faecal sludge treatment plant.

113
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:41,002
Other important general
characterization parameters

114
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:45,463
include the pH, the temperature,
and the electric conductivity.

115
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,966
In reality, a combination
of these parameters

116
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:51,588
is selected for design, operation,

117
00:05:51,776 --> 00:05:53,901
and monitoring of different
treatment technologies,

118
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,682
and an entire treatment plant.

119
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,087
This could be during research,

120
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,559
or to collect characteristics
for treatment design.

121
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:04,226
In this picture, one of my colleagues
is collecting faecal sludge samples

122
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,656
for a characterization study
in Kampala.

123
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,663
All during operation
of a treatment plant,

124
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,673
as for this treatment plant
in Kampala,

125
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,060
samples may be collected
at in flow,

126
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,432
before and after
treatment technologies,

127
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:19,252
such as the settling-thickening tanks
and drying beds,

128
00:06:19,442 --> 00:06:20,911
to assess their performance.

129
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,077
Only effluent from treatment
to assess the effluent characteristics

130
00:06:25,278 --> 00:06:26,627
meet discharge limits.

131
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,708
You might be overwhelmed
by the number

132
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:32,558
of characterization parameters
presented here.

133
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:35,070
For implementation
of characterization in your city,

134
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:37,800
you can find more information
on sample collection,

135
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:40,047
preparation, protocols,

136
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,208
and considerations
for quality assurance and control

137
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:44,962
In these Sandec reports

138
00:06:45,224 --> 00:06:47,434
that can be downloaded
for free from our website.

139
00:06:48,489 --> 00:06:51,740
Standard operating procedures
are also available from the website

140
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,270
of the Pollution Research Group

141
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:57,528
at the University of KwaZulu-Natal
in Durban, South Africa.

142
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,795
In this module, we introduced you
to characterization parameters

143
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:03,644
that are important for collection,

144
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,894
design, operation and
monitoring of treatment plants.

145
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,310
These parameters are measures
of solids, organics,

146
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:13,745
nutrients and pathogens
in faecal sludge.

147
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:16,788
We hope that you explore the
additional material provided

148
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:19,851
and find it helpful for
faecal sludge characterization

149
00:07:20,032 --> 00:07:20,840
in your city.
