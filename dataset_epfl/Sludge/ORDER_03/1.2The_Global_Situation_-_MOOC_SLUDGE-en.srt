1
00:00:04,423 --> 00:00:08,727
Cellphones have become so pervasive
now that being able to use your cell phone

2
00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:11,475
to make a call is maybe something
you take for granted.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,070
But when you wanna call a friend,
what needs

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,180
to happen for phone calls 
to go through?

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,423
Two people both need to have 
working phones with charged batteries

6
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:23,813
You need to have paid credit 
with a network service provider.

7
00:00:24,013 --> 00:00:27,349
And you need to be within a range 
of a working cell tower.

8
00:00:27,549 --> 00:00:30,209
An entire service chain 
needs to be in place

9
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:32,008
 and functioning for it to work. 

10
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:35,855
This is similar to faecal 
sludge management which also relies

11
00:00:36,055 --> 00:00:39,469
on a complex service chain 
to function properly. 

12
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:43,396
This module provides an introduction
to faecal sludge management

13
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:45,848
and the current global situation.

14
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:48,568
Following this module 
you will be able to describe

15
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:51,768
what faecal sludge and faecal 
sludge management are. 

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,347
 Discuss weak links of the faecal 
sludge management service chain. 

17
00:00:55,547 --> 00:00:59,852
List the components of a complete
faecal sludge management service chain. 

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,798
So, first of all, what is 
faecal sludge?

19
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:07,828
Faecal sludge is any combination
of waste water and excreta

20
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,083
that comes from 
onsite sanitation technologies. 

21
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:15,168
Specifically meaning it has not been
transported through a sewer.

22
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:20,127
Examples include pit latrines, 
unsewered public ablution blocks, 

23
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,063
septic tanks and dry toilets.

24
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:28,144
So, faecal sludge is highly variable 
 in consistency, quantity,

25
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:31,183
and concentration.

26
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:34,583
Here are some examples of what 
faecal sludge looks like. 

27
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,229
This is sludge from septic tanks.

28
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:41,206
You see where samples were taken 
and what they look like in the lab.

29
00:01:41,406 --> 00:01:46,953
How a septic tank is emptied that
is located on an internal courtyard.

30
00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:51,342
Bringing the hose pipe for 
the vacuum truck inside.  

31
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:55,471
And faecal sludge from 
different types of pit latrines. 

32
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:59,679
Emptying of pit latrines with
the vacuum truck. 

33
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:04,639
 And also, manually with 
shovels and forks.

34
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:10,663
And barrels transported with 
the motorized tricycle.  

35
00:02:10,863 --> 00:02:13,863
 Faecal sludge from public toilets

36
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:16,878
does not mean a specific 
type of technology, 

37
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:20,497
but tends to have different 
usage and storage times. 

38
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:28,934
The faecal sludge management or FSM

39
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,989
service chains there's with 
the onsite storage

40
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,166
or containment of faecal sludge

41
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:37,594
shown here in septic tanks 
and pit latrines, 

42
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:41,174
which then needs to be collected
and transported 

43
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,073
to treatment facilities. 

44
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:45,756
Where it's adequately treated

45
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,903
for the intended end use

46
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:51,103
and then ends with resource recovery

47
00:02:51,303 --> 00:02:54,050
or safe disposal.

48
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,222
Faecal sludge management represents
a very significant global need. 

49
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:00,891
This figure made by 
the Boston Consulting Group

50
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,483
illustrates the global population

51
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,457
served by onsite sanitation. 

52
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:09,411
 All of which are in need of faecal
sludge management. 

53
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:17,009
So, globally, 2.7 billion people or
40% of the entire world's population

54
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,159
are served by 
onsite sanitation technologies. 

55
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,066
 In urban areas of Africa,
Asia and Latin America

56
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:27,266
this accounts for around 
1 billion people. 

57
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:32,353
That number is expected to grow 
to 5 billion by 2030.

58
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:34,652
In most of these cities

59
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:38,801
the majority of sanitation is provided 
through onsite technologies. 

60
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:44,838
Nut sewers providing even
up to 100% of sanitation coverage

61
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,343
in urban areas. 

62
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:49,827
However, the reality is

63
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:52,777
that in low and middle income 
countries there's typically

64
00:03:52,977 --> 00:03:56,815
no management system in place 
for the resulting faecal sludge.

65
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:01,041
The result is that it frequently 
ends up dumped directly

66
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,324
into the urban environment.

67
00:04:03,524 --> 00:04:07,074
Problems in the service chain 
are households

68
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:10,819
that cannot afford to pay someone 
to empty their system

69
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,514
they're forced to find alternative solutions, 
like just digging it out themselves.

70
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:20,284
Manual emptiers who,
once they empty the systems,

71
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:24,432
it's physically impossible for them 
to transport at long distances. 

72
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:30,029
Mechanical emptiers that have trucks
that once they empty the sludge

73
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:34,138
the distance is too far for them
to transport it to treatment facilities

74
00:04:34,338 --> 00:04:38,181
or traffic is simply too bad for them
to get to the treatment facility.

75
00:04:38,381 --> 00:04:42,285
The general lack of treatment facilities
in most cities.

76
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:48,262
And faecal sludge that is used
or disposed of in unhygienic ways.

77
00:04:49,074 --> 00:04:51,575
Examples of how this looks

78
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:54,775
 are poorly constructed 
and maintained facilities.

79
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,820
Digging a hole in the street

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,680
right outside of a house

81
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,182
so that the contents of a septic tank

82
00:05:02,382 --> 00:05:05,540
that is illegally emptied 
 manually with buckets

83
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,326
can be illegally dumped into it 
right in the street. 

84
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,600
Breaking a whole in the base 
of the containment, 

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,148
so the faecal sludge will just drain
directly out.

86
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:21,185
Emptiers who have to get inside 
the septic tanks

87
00:05:21,385 --> 00:05:26,526
or other containment technologies 
to remove the sludge with shovels. 

88
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:30,110
A discharged channel
for sludge trucks

89
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,122
that drains directly onto
the beach and into the ocean. 

90
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:37,726
Illegal emptying of sludge trucks

91
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,938
directly into the environment

92
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:45,137
and scavenging faecal sludge 
for unsafe use in urban agriculture.

93
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:51,432
So, clearly, providing adequate 
access to sanitation facilities

94
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:55,037
does not end when
onsite technologies are built.  

95
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,207
That is just the start.

96
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:59,935
 What happens after 
they become full? 

97
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:03,723
It's imperative to also take
a longer term focus 

98
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:06,239
which moves beyond 
the household level. 

99
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:10,478
The sustainable development goals
or STGs 

100
00:06:10,678 --> 00:06:12,705
 will hopefully 
have a positive impact

101
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,737
as they now include 
faecal sludge management.

102
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:21,287
The target to achieve access 
to adequate and equitable sanitation

103
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,487
has been upgraded
to include the safe disposal

104
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:27,263
or offsite treatment of excreta. 

105
00:06:27,463 --> 00:06:29,914
 It is important to keep in mind

106
00:06:30,114 --> 00:06:32,895
that onsite 
or decentralized technologies

107
00:06:33,095 --> 00:06:37,575
can provide sustainable solutions
in all areas of the world. 

108
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:40,591
Sewer based solutions are effective.

109
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,636
But are also very resource intensive
and expensive.

110
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:48,421
In a side by side comparison 
in Dakar, Senegal

111
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:53,067
the sewer service chain was found to be 
5 times more expensive

112
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:56,482
than the existing faecal 
sludge management service chain. 

113
00:06:57,607 --> 00:07:02,586
So, faecal sludge management can
be considered a long term viable option. 

114
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:07,242
And, possibly, more sustainable 
compared to sewer based systems

115
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:12,410
if the entire service chain
is adequately managed.

116
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,912
We need to simultaneously address

117
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:19,872
how to immediately start getting excreta
safely out of the urban environment. 

118
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,721
While simultaneously developing
sustainable

119
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,345
and globally relevant solutions

120
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,320
for managing faecal sludge 
into the future. 

121
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,812
In the following modules, 
we will present examples of solutions 

122
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:36,419
that are being implemented.

123
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:39,624
One of the most important
things to realize

124
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:43,740
is that faecal sludge management 
is not only about technology.

125
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,826
It's about a complex service chain 

126
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:49,913
that depends on the interactions
among people at every step.

127
00:07:50,113 --> 00:07:54,328
The way forward to finding
sustainable future solutions

128
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:58,321
for faecal sludge management 
includes overcoming bottlenecks

129
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:03,043
at the crossroads of planning, 
management, and technology. 

130
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:06,655
All of which you will hear about 
in future modules. 

131
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:10,873
This is the same integrate approach
presented in the book

132
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,845
Faecal Sludge Management,

133
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:16,752
Systems Based Approach
to Implementation and Operation. 

134
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:20,114
In this module, you had 
an introduction 

135
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,812
to what faecal sludge 
and faecal sludge management are.

136
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:26,381
The current status of weak links 
in the service chain

137
00:08:26,581 --> 00:08:27,818
in low income countries.

138
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:31,018
And components of a fully 
functioning service chain

139
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:35,663
from the household level
to the final end use or safe disposal. 

140
00:08:35,863 --> 00:08:39,927
Thanks for joining! 
See you next time.

141
00:08:40,127 --> 00:08:43,127
