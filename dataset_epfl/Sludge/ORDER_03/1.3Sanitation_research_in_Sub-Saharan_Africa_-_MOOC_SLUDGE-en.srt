1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,270
My name is Dr. Charles Niwagaba
and I'm a senior lecturer of sewer

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,043
engineering at Makerere University,
Kampala, Uganda.

3
00:00:13,243 --> 00:00:16,989
I have 16 years experience 
in sanitation.

4
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:22,132
Now, faecal sludge management 
is a new and quickly evolving field.

5
00:00:22,332 --> 00:00:27,471
In this module we present you 
a video, so that you can visualize

6
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:30,238
some of the realities 
of urban sanitation.

7
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:34,858
Lean back, enjoy and please keep
in mind the learning objectives

8
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,268
while viewing. 

9
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:41,925
Following this module you will be
able to understand weak links

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,924
of urban sanitation. 

11
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:49,224
Name potential solutions that the
U-Act and FaME projects identified

12
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:52,424
in order to improve 
urban sanitation.

13
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:58,148
Discuss the benefits that resource
recovery can have in terms of faecal

14
00:00:58,348 --> 00:01:00,482
sludge management. 

15
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:04,750
Adequate sanitation can only be 
fulfilled with management

16
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,315
of the entire service chain.

17
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:09,116
Including safe access 
to clean toilets 

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,897
collection an transport 
of accumulated faecal sludge

19
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:17,023
followed by treatment and some form
of safe end use or disposal.

20
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,257
U-Act is taking place 
in Kampala, Uganda.

21
00:01:26,444 --> 00:01:31,172
Where in poor areas 84% of 
the households rely on shared toilets.

22
00:01:31,372 --> 00:01:32,893
Such as the one shown here. 

23
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,131
These toilets are used on average

24
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:36,890
by 25 people each. 

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,457
But sometimes by up to 500 people 
each.

26
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:44,856
When toilets are overused it is less
likely that they are kept clean.

27
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:47,304
This resulting in people stopping
to use them.

28
00:01:47,504 --> 00:01:49,943
And resorting to open defecation. 

29
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:54,180
Considering cleanliness U-Act 
research has identified that

30
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,063
up to 4 households can actually 
share a toilet while maintaining it

31
00:01:58,263 --> 00:02:00,591
in an acceptably clean and 
functional manner.

32
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,016
And thereby provide

33
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:05,376
affordable and adequate sanitation.

34
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:09,874
Inadequate toilet facilities 
are affecting life in informal

35
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:12,099
 or illegal settlements. 

36
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:18,309
The faecal management enterprises
or FaME project lead by Sandag

37
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:23,883
is taking place in Dakar, Senegal
Akrogala and Kampala, Uganda.

38
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,403
And starts where U-Act leaves off
with accumulated faecal sludge

39
00:02:28,603 --> 00:02:31,666
onsite sanitation technologies.

40
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:35,260
The goal of the FaME project is 
to increase sustainable access

41
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:39,229
to sanitation thorough resource 
recovery from faecal sludge.

42
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:42,946
Which could provide revenue 
to improve collection, transport

43
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:44,613
and treatment services. 

44
00:02:44,813 --> 00:02:48,813
Many households cannot afford 
to have faecal sludge

45
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,258
collected and removed.

46
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,671
Once onsite technologies become full.

47
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:57,288
For example, in poor areas 
of Kampala this costs between

48
00:02:57,498 --> 00:02:59,852
23-46 US dollars. 

49
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:05,083
Which is 15-35% of an entire 
household's monthly income.

50
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,747
Even if households can afford 
the collection service,

51
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:12,050
the toilets are often located 
down narrow pathways

52
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:14,750
and are not accessible 
to vacuum trucks.

53
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,951
As a result manual laborers are hired
to remove faecal sludge

54
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,776
with shovels and buckets. 

55
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,639
Sometimes even getting inside
the onsite technology to dig out

56
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:25,793
the sludge.

57
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:28,943
Commonly, manual laborers 
do not have access

58
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:30,651
 to motorized transport.

59
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,912
They need to carry or push
the faecal sludge away.

60
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:38,555
As shown here, this results in 
faecal sludge being illegally dumped

61
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:41,497
either right next to the house,
or into drainage canals

62
00:03:41,697 --> 00:03:45,466
or water bodies, contaminating
the environment with excreta.

63
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,730
If vacuum trucks can access 
the toilets, they use hoses

64
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,415
to vacuum the faecal sludge
into trucks.

65
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,586
The U-Act toilets are designed
to increase access to collection

66
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,448
through their design.

67
00:04:05,673 --> 00:04:14,122
U-Act has designed and constructed
156 shared improved latrines.

68
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:17,348
These latrines are spread 
all over the city

69
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:18,996
in about 35 slums.

70
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:24,923
These toilets consist of a holding tank
of 6 cubic meters. 

71
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:28,584
Which is fully aligned 
from the bottom.

72
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:32,865
It is lined so as to prevent 
ground water pollution

73
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:36,664
because most of the low income 
areas in Kampala are situated

74
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:38,290
in areas with high water [INAUDIBLE]

75
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,698
And therefore toilets 
which are not lined

76
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,984
contaminate ground water directly.

77
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,184
We have given these toilets 
additional features

78
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,820
(INAUDIBLE). 

79
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,751
For example, on the site we have got
an access point

80
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:58,329
which is covered by a brick
that can be easily removed

81
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,529
whenever the toilet fills 
and needs to be emptied. 

82
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:03,964
The toilet structure 
standing over here

83
00:05:04,164 --> 00:05:06,242
has been there for about two years

84
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:09,268
and in a period of two years 
it has been emptied

85
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,150
about three times.

86
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,998
And this emptying has not affected
the integrity of the structure.

87
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:19,268
And we are very sure that 
it can be used several times

88
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:22,107
for a long time as long as
it is emptied

89
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,452
as and when it feels.

90
00:05:24,652 --> 00:05:27,295
Another way to increase access
to the collection

91
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:30,305
is to reduce fees at the household 
level.

92
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:33,927
Households rely on collection 
and transport companies.

93
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:36,746
Which charge high fees 
because they also incur

94
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:38,058
 many expenses.

95
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:41,583
If the profitability of companies 
could be increased

96
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,235
the fees of the households 
could be reduced.

97
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,516
The collection and treatment
of faecal sludge is complicated

98
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,433
by the high variability 
of its characteristics.

99
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:55,062
For example, faecal sludge 
from septic tanks that consists

100
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:57,294
of washing, cleaning 
and cooking water

101
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:00,472
in addition to excreta 
is very dilute.

102
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:04,368
Faecal sludge from pit latrines
tends to be much thicker.

103
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,399
Well, faecal sludge from public toilets
with a high number of uses 

104
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:10,071
is collected frequently.

105
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:12,006
And so is less stabilized.

106
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,425
The sludge often contains
hygienic products,

107
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,657
batteries, bottles, household waste
and garbage

108
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:21,831
which can clog the hoses
and damage pipes.

109
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,910
And because faecal sludge
is mostly water

110
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,454
and water is heavy

111
00:06:26,654 --> 00:06:28,692
it's expensive to transport.

112
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:32,717
Vacuum truck drivers frequently
get stuck in congested traffic.

113
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:35,273
As shown here in Dakar.

114
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:38,510
And long lines can form
at discharge locations.

115
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:42,157
There are also not enough
legal dischage locations

116
00:06:42,357 --> 00:06:43,589
or treatment facilities.

117
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,476
And drivers 
must pay a fee to discharge.

118
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:49,430
Because of these reasons
and the costs

119
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,053
trucks often resort to dump
untreated faecal sludge

120
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:56,186
directly into urban environments.

121
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,959
If these fees were reduced
or eliminated

122
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:02,013
could the savings 
be passed on to the households

123
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,199
resulting in lower fee?

124
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,399
And with this increase the amount 
of faecal sludge that is delivered

125
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,823
to treatment plants reducing
the dumping of untreated faecal sludge

126
00:07:12,023 --> 00:07:13,942
to the urban environment.

127
00:07:20,342 --> 00:07:24,123
Faecal sludge is higher in organic
matter and nutrients.

128
00:07:24,535 --> 00:07:27,441
One way discharged fees 
could be reduced

129
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:31,295
is if the treatment plant operators
could offset treatment costs.

130
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:34,766
Generating revenue 
from resource recovery of the energy

131
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:38,118
nutrients and water 
from faecal sludge.

132
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:43,682
The FaME project identified that 
there is currently

133
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:47,253
only very limited use 
of faecal sludge as a soil amendment

134
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,354
in agriculture and horticulture.

135
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:53,310
And that the market for the resource
recovery is largely untapped.

136
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,732
Even if treated most faecal sludge
is presently just landfilled

137
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:58,792
or dumped.

138
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:02,867
FaME also found that in addition 
to use as a soil amendment

139
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:06,082
faecal sludge has other
potential end uses.

140
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:09,479
These are as a solid industrial fuel,

141
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,611
biogas from anaerobic digestion,

142
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:16,893
protein for animal feed from larvae
used in treatment,

143
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:23,338
The market demand for different
end products varies greatly

144
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,562
among locations

145
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:26,060
based on such factors

146
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,891
as the availability
of competing products,

147
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,868
local industries and their needs,
and user perceptions.

148
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:35,382
Faecal sludge treatment 
should be designed

149
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:38,945
to meet the demands of local markets, 
so that the end product

150
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:41,719
produced 
the highest possible revenue.

151
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,363
This also ensures that 
treatment plans are not overdesigned

152
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,293
wasting financial resources.

153
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,199
Or underdesigned risking public
or environmental health.

154
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,106
For example, if the end use 
of faecal sludge is combustion

155
00:08:55,306 --> 00:08:56,238
as a fuel.

156
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:58,590
Pathogen reduction
is much less important

157
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,827
than it is when the end use
is soil amendment and food production.

158
00:09:03,027 --> 00:09:04,930
But reducing moisture content

159
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,358
is a much more important
treatment goal

160
00:09:07,558 --> 00:09:10,946
The FaME project focused
on large scale markets

161
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:14,897
such as industrial field to ensure
reliable and consistent demand

162
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,203
and revenue.

163
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,883
In Europe and the US

164
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,207
sludge from wastewater treatment
is already coincinerated 

165
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,102
in cement industries.

166
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:25,611
FaME research found that
if this technology

167
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,689
could be transferred 
to faecal sludge

168
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,509
to meet the energy demand 
of industries in Sub Saharan Africa

169
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,382
it could generate much revenue
as an alternative fuel.

170
00:09:35,582 --> 00:09:38,889
FaME also demonstrated 
that the colorific value

171
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:42,432
of faecal sludge, which is a measure
of its fell potential

172
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:46,095
is comparable to other biofuels
that are currently being used.

173
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:49,093
And it found that the revenues
from this end use

174
00:09:49,293 --> 00:09:53,105
 could be significantly greater
than its use as a soil conditioner.

175
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,045
Dried faecal sludge
has not yet been used

176
00:09:58,245 --> 00:09:59,874
 as an industrial fuel.

177
00:10:00,074 --> 00:10:03,855
Prior to uptake by industries
pilot scale implementations

178
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:07,132
were needed to demonstrate
the feasibility of faecal sludge

179
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:09,162
as a feel to industries.

180
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:12,953
To address this the FaME project 
is designed and constructed

181
00:10:13,153 --> 00:10:16,489
pilot scale kilns
for brick production in Kampala

182
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,473
and waste oil regeneration
in Dakar.

183
00:10:19,673 --> 00:10:22,287
In both kilns
the temperatures achieved

184
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,890
by using dried faecal sludge
met industry's requirements.

185
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:30,419
In the brick kiln a temperature
of 800 degrees Celsius 

186
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:31,715
could be maintained.

187
00:10:31,915 --> 00:10:34,900
And the strength of bricks
fired with dried faecal sludge

188
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,141
was similar to those produced
by brick factories.

189
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:40,620
Industries have expressed 
great interest

190
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,048
 in this alternative fuel.

191
00:10:42,248 --> 00:10:44,332
If there's adequate availability.

192
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:52,699
[INAUDIBLE] treated faecal sludge
as a solid fuel to industries

193
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,123
requires drying the sludge
to around 90% dryness.

194
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,965
given if low solid content.

195
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:03,930
Cost effective drying methods
have to be developed

196
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,819
to meet the needs of industries.

197
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:11,035
FaME researched how to improve
the effectiveness of drying beds

198
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,225
and in Dakar we've experimented
with turning the sludge

199
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,072
and with greenhouses to decrease
the drying time.

200
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:22,479
And both have reduced it.

201
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:27,131
Turning the sludge reduces
the drying time by around 20%.

202
00:11:27,331 --> 00:11:30,406
This increases treatment capacities

203
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,702
at existing treatment plant.

204
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:37,320
But also new plants need
less drying space.

205
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,746
The research findings
of U-Act and FaME

206
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,652
together have identified
innovative solutions

207
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:45,992
to increase access to sanitation

208
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:48,426
at the household and community level.

209
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:52,618
Shared sanitation facilities
can provide adequate sanitation

210
00:11:52,818 --> 00:11:55,576
if the maximum number
of households is set

211
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:58,177
to ensure clean and usable toilets.

212
00:11:58,377 --> 00:12:00,997
Faecal sludge
can be readily collected

213
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:04,544
from onsite technologies
if they are appropriately designed.

214
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,956
Affordability 
of household level services 

215
00:12:08,156 --> 00:12:11,310
could be increased through revenues
from resource recovery.

216
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,623
And designing faecal sludge 
treatment to meet the specific

217
00:12:14,823 --> 00:12:18,418
 local market demand
could maximize these revenues.

218
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:21,737
To insure uptake 
of these research results

219
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,645
sustainable business models
and fee structures

220
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,121
need to be developed.

221
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:28,742
And governments need
to acknowledge the importance

222
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,829
 of faecal sludge management.
