00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:08,355
Hello and welcome to this module on
stakeholder analysis and engagement.

2
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,555
As you have seen throughout
this course

3
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,205
and as you can see behind me,
there are quite a number

4
00:00:14,455 --> 00:00:17,188
of stakeholders that are linked
to faecal sludge management. 

5
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:20,780
That's one of the main differences
between faecal sludge management

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,879
and waste water management.

7
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:25,663
Faecal sludge management
is much more about people.

8
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:31,011
Especially, sewers are replaced by
manual and mechanical service providers.

9
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:35,719
In faecal sludge management, it is
not possible to impose blueprints.

10
00:00:35,919 --> 00:00:38,467
But this is not the only difference. 

11
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,696
Often, the role and responsibilities
for faecal sludge management

12
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,779
are much less clear than 
for waste waster management.

13
00:00:45,288 --> 00:00:49,752
That's why we need stakeholder analysis,
understand them and engage them.

14
00:00:49,952 --> 00:00:54,169
People in organizations are at
the heart of faecal sludge management.

15
00:00:55,153 --> 00:00:58,812
In this module we will see how to
characterize the key stakeholders, 

16
00:00:59,012 --> 00:01:00,991
and their main interests
and constraints.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,066
Then we will see how to determine
the degree

18
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:07,589
to which they should be engaged
with the participation levels.

19
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:12,243
Finally, we will see how to engage
them with an introduction

20
00:01:12,455 --> 00:01:14,272
to different
involvement tools.

21
00:01:15,105 --> 00:01:19,003
The stakeholders in a group,
organization, or individual

22
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:21,262
that can influence
or be influenced

23
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:23,600
by the faecal sludge
management scheme.

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,151
The stakeholder analysis
has identified early

25
00:01:27,368 --> 00:01:30,347
who will be affected by the project
and who could

26
00:01:30,522 --> 00:01:34,373
influence the project, 
positively or negatively. 

27
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:38,190
It helps to understand the social
and institutional context.

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,457
This part of the stakeholder analysis
is sometimes referred to

29
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:44,359
as political economy analysis.

30
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,249
The stakeholder analysis also helps
to assess the needs

31
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,281
and to plan for the participation
of the stakeholders.

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,603
In a field where the informal
sector often plays an important role

33
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,501
this is also about how to empower
them and bring them on board.

34
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:04,846
Finally, it is also about meeting
people and building trust.

35
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:09,225
Let's start with the identification
of the stakeholders.

36
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:14,245
First, of course, you have 
the mechanical and manual emptiers.

37
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:20,202
Then you have the households,
in a way the customers,

38
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:23,315
which we could divide in
landlords and tenants.

39
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:26,842
Moving to the other end of
the sanitation chain,

40
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,160
you have the potential end users,
like farmers

41
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,659
or industries that may use that
as a fuel.

42
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,986
You have then the stakeholders
directly linked to the government

43
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:39,606
which I may call institutions.

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,466
Among them you have the utility,
sometimes named sewage company

45
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,362
and they still don't have
faecal sludge on their agenda. 

46
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:52,249
We have the municipal authorities,
which include

47
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:55,111
the technical services
and the police.

48
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:58,974
On the higher level, you have
the regional and national authorities

49
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:01,528
which may play a role,
especially for

50
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:03,904
the legal and regulatory
framework.

51
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,758
Next, the four major state actors
who we often find

52
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,297
traditional authorities
and influential leaders

53
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:13,689
to whom people may be more willing
to listen to.

54
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:17,379
Then you will also find
non-governmental organizations

55
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,955
active in sanitation, 
like NGOs or CBOs. 

56
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:25,738
and also academic institutions,
who often have important advisory role.

57
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:30,633
And finally, last but not least
you have the international donors

58
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:34,334
which have an important
decision-making power and in some

59
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,613
countries are literally leading
the faecal sludge management agenda.

60
00:03:39,874 --> 00:03:44,161
Once we identify the stakeholders,
we need to characterize them. 

61
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:47,918
In particular, we want to make sure
to identify

62
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:51,316
all potential supporters
and opponents of the project

63
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:55,280
and any vulnerable group
that may not be given a voice.

64
00:03:56,062 --> 00:03:59,709
Typical problems faced by faecal
sludge management stakeholders

65
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:02,009
are a lack of influence
and recognition.

66
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,242
Think, for example, of manual
emptiers, who typically 

67
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:08,661
operate illegally and even in dark
to avoid being seen.

68
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:12,379
For the mechanical emptiers,
you have issues such as

69
00:04:12,579 --> 00:04:16,302
the cost of transport, traffic,
or the lack of dumping sites.

70
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:22,139
Lack of resources and capacities is
often a problem at institutional level.

71
00:04:22,812 --> 00:04:25,750
You may observe tension 
between stakeholders

72
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,023
like power games between
institutions, or competition

73
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:30,953
between private service providers.

74
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:35,860
Lack of awareness, typically at
household level.

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,908
I will let you have a look in the
stakeholder analysis chapter

76
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:43,309
of the FSM book to see how
you can extract this information. 

77
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:47,031
Something important to look at is
who has an interest

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,183
and who has influence,
or lack of influence. 

79
00:04:50,734 --> 00:04:53,208
These figures show the
attributes that are relevant 

80
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:56,331
to either interest, influence,
or both.

81
00:04:56,986 --> 00:05:00,309
For example, stakeholder having
an activity linked

82
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,225
to faecal sludge management
have an interest.

83
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,376
Authority that are not directly
related but still have the power

84
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,596
to block the project,
have influence.

85
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:11,828
Municipal authorities would be
in the middle

86
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,993
having both strong interest
and also influence.

87
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:20,492
Recognizing this, you can then draw
an influence interest matrix.

88
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:25,403
So, for example, if a small company
providing an emptying service

89
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,477
has an interest (INAUDIBLE)
 faecal sludge management scheme,

90
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:32,315
but not much influence, 
we put it here. 

91
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:35,875
A national entity may have
a strong influence, for example

92
00:05:36,132 --> 00:05:38,987
for delivering permit or fans
although it does not have 

93
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:43,015
 the direct interest in the project.
So we would put it here.

94
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,777
Or the municipal authorities, 
as we saw, 

95
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:50,173
have both an interest
and influence, so we put it there.

96
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:56,078
Now the question is how to engage
the stakeholders?

97
00:05:57,036 --> 00:06:00,080
First, we need to define the level
of participation.

98
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,544
There are four main ones,
information which goes one way.

99
00:06:05,744 --> 00:06:07,924
So you give information
to some one. 

100
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:13,233
Consultation, which goes two ways.
So you ask people for their opinion.

101
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:17,245
Collaboration, where you develop
your project together.

102
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:20,059
And finally, empowerment or
delegation

103
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,316
where you give power to the others.

104
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,038
In a simplified approach, we can
try to identify appropriate

105
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:30,900
participation levels, based on
the influence interest matrix. 

106
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:34,303
For example, the stakeholders
located here

107
00:06:34,503 --> 00:06:39,204
with low interest and low influence
just need to be kept informed.

108
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,792
Those with low influence
and high interest

109
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:45,944
need to be consulted
and sometimes empowered.

110
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:49,756
Those with a low interest
but high influence,

111
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:53,295
need to be informed or consulted.

112
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:57,896
And finally with these, you would
rather (INAUDIBLE) consultation,

113
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:01,630
collaboration or even delegation
at the end of the process.

114
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:06,453
Know that the stakeholder analysis
is an iterative process.

115
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:10,950
So a stakeholder that is here at
the beginning, may gain influence

116
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,338
if it is empowered, and may
end up there.

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,836
Typically, this could be the case
with an organized group

118
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,802
of mechanical service providers.

119
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:25,504
There are different tools
to engage stakeholders.

120
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:30,490
For example, personal meetings,
household surveys,

121
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:35,968
focus group discussion, workshops,
site visits,

122
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:39,904
participatory mapping, 
media campaigns,

123
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:43,027
advocacy or lobbying, 
or mediation.

124
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:45,758
Please refer the faecal study
management book

125
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,078
to learn more about these
involvement tools

126
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:51,118
and to which level of participation
they correspond.

127
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,087
You may also have a look at
the module

128
00:07:54,287 --> 00:07:57,728
Tools for Institutional and Political
Economy Analysis

129
00:07:57,928 --> 00:08:01,436
for Sanitation Solutions in our MOOC
on Sanitation Planning.

130
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:06,617
Remember that the goal in the end
is to be able to define

131
00:08:06,817 --> 00:08:10,079
and allocate clear roles
and responsibilities

132
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,749
which the respective stakeholders
will endorse in the long run. 

133
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:18,419
We must be aware and must agree
on what they will have to do

134
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:21,368
and especially, what they
will have to pay.

135
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,619
You don't want your FSM system
to collapse 

136
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,308
because vacuum truck owners
don't agree to pay the tariff,

137
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,867
because emptying fees are
unaffordable for households,

138
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:34,443
or because the utilities
or authorities did not 

139
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:37,072
secure enough funds to run
your treatment plant.

140
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:43,363
It sounds logic, but unfortunately
that issues are often the case.

141
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,537
You will learn more about financial
and institutional arrangements

142
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:48,899
in the two next modules.

143
00:08:49,773 --> 00:08:53,078
What I presented in this module
is a simplified approach

144
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,128
to stakeholder analysis
and involvement

145
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,597
for you to get
introduced the topic.

146
00:08:58,045 --> 00:08:59,951
Of course, there is much more.

147
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,481
You now got a first glimpse into
how to characterize stakeholders,

148
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,147
and into the different
participation levels,

149
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:10,312
and how this can help you decide
how to involve stakeholders.

150
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:13,820
Remember that this is iterative
and should be done

151
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,711
throughout the planning process.

152
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:19,720
Start thinking about who would be
the key stakeholders in your city.

153
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,665
Start mapping the relationships
between them.

154
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:26,686
Try to think on how you could bring
them in the same table.

155
00:09:27,517 --> 00:09:29,677
The social aspect of faecal
sludge management,

156
00:09:29,877 --> 00:09:34,257
is very important and make sure
that at whatever level you are

157
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:36,971
you take people's needs
and constraints into account.

158
00:09:37,965 --> 00:09:42,076
As a key final message, I want 
to say that it is worth to invest 

159
00:09:42,276 --> 00:09:45,057
the time and resources, 
to understand and involve the people

160
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:49,808
because involvement leads
to commitment and project ownership.

161
00:09:50,608 --> 00:09:52,839
Good-bye.
