00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:06,500
Hello and welcome to this module

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:09,133
on the assessment
of the initial situation.

3
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:13,000
We will look at the data that
you need to collect in order

4
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:16,168
to get a comprehensive overview
of the sanitation situation

5
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,251
in your city and to be able to
take informed decisions.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,630
The aim of this module is also
to link the different aspects

7
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:27,749
requiring data collection
presented in this course.

8
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:31,881
The main goals of the assessment
of the initial situation are to set

9
00:00:32,044 --> 00:00:36,481
the scene, understand the context,
get to know the stakeholders

10
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:39,632
and provide enough
information to start elaborating

11
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:42,401
the fecal sludge
management scenarios.

12
00:00:42,567 --> 00:00:46,317
This includes, among others,
the definition of context specific

13
00:00:46,478 --> 00:00:48,590
design parameters.

14
00:00:48,761 --> 00:00:52,248
It would allow you to make
logical plans to move forward.

15
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:55,952
This phase of the planning process
is therefor characterized by data

16
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,705
collection via different means.

17
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:03,364
The question is which data
and by which means?

18
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:06,723
The idea is to get a snapshot
of the situation.

19
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:09,939
Start with a helicopter
view of your city.

20
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:13,276
You can take a map or look
at Google Earth and start by

21
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,753
identifying different
situation context

22
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:18,326
as discussed in the previous module.

23
00:01:18,491 --> 00:01:21,304
What are the existing
infrastructure services?

24
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:23,218
Are there sewer networks?

25
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,623
Which type of toilets
do people have?

26
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,785
Who are the service providers
and how are they organized?

27
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:31,573
Whether they bring the sludge?

28
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:34,557
You can start by looking
at the general context

29
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:39,152
like demographic, water and hygiene,
storm water management

30
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:41,514
and climatic conditions.

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,947
Then collect data about
the sanitation sector

32
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:47,847
considering the whole
sanitation supply chain

33
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:51,015
as mentioned in the last module.

34
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,179
Especially, carry out a stakeholder
analysis and establish the profile

35
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:59,330
and practices of manual and
mechanical service providers.

36
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:03,331
Further on, it is important to
understand the practices

37
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:06,218
a household level and
at the other end of

38
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:09,258
the sanitation chain
the end use practices and

39
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:12,401
the potential market for
the treatment product.

40
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:13,839
Talking about stakeholders

41
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:17,743
we should know what are
the financial transfers between them.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,462
For example, how much do households
currently pay for emptying services?

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,225
At that stage, you should check
the enabling conditions.

44
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,012
How is the government support?

45
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:33,865
What is the legal and
regulatory framework?

46
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,028
What are the rules but
also where are the gaps?

47
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:41,732
Which are the relevant institutions
and how are they organized?

48
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,377
What are the skills and capacities,
especially in terms of

49
00:02:45,526 --> 00:02:47,813
human resources and management?

50
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:50,972
The financial arrangements,
as I mentioned before.

51
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:56,664
And, lastly, the socio-cultural
acceptance of different options.

52
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,878
The environment is rarely fully
enabling in the beginning of

53
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:05,034
the process and identifying the gaps
is the basis to plan for action.

54
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:10,379
A lot of  this information with
a type of (INAUDIBLE), standards

55
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,962
or the stakeholders
needs and interests

56
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,955
will also help you to quantify
and characterize the sludge

57
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:20,794
to be treated and estimate context
specific design parameters for your

58
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,947
future fecal sludge treatment plant.

59
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,765
Talking about treatment plants
you will see if you look at

60
00:03:27,924 --> 00:03:31,249
the FSM from A to Z planning
synthesis presented in the previous

61
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,905
module that it is also the time to

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,598
identify the potential
treatment sites.

63
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,624
As this is also a very
difficult question

64
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:42,581
it is good to start
as soon as possible.

65
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:47,341
Often, there's not available land,
land is expensive or people do not

66
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,949
want a treatment plant
in their back yards.

67
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:53,413
If you're lucky, you will have
several options to choose from

68
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:56,808
by then comes the question
of the level of decentralization.

69
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,099
So we will have one
or several plants.

70
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:03,198
In large urban areas it
makes a lot of sense to have

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,135
several plants at
different locations.

72
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,921
The mechanical service providers

73
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:10,582
should be at the core
of the decision.

74
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:14,283
First, they know all about
the current disposal sites.

75
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:17,915
Then it is crucial to identify what
are the constraints of their business

76
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:22,639
for example, problems with traffic,
the average distance and duration

77
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,966
of the trips and the money they
gain from each of them.

78
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:29,604
They are the ones who can
tell what is practically

79
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:31,897
and financially feasible. 

80
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,638
We have to see that larger treatment
plants require on average longer

81
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,912
haulage distances from the pits,
implying higher costs for

82
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:40,951
the collection companies.

83
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,460
Companies then have two choices

84
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:46,543
either increase the tariff
for the households

85
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,379
which may threaten the affordability
of the service

86
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,556
or use closer,
illegal disposal sites.

87
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,799
There are examples of fecal sludge
treatment plants which were never

88
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:59,718
used because they were too
far away or not accessible.

89
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,276
We talked a lot about data,
but not yet about how to

90
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,563
collect it.

91
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:09,929
It is not that easy to collect
good quality useful data.

92
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:13,481
There is a lot of bad quality data
around and it is important to

93
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:17,394
get your own primary data
as much as possible.

94
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:21,022
The best way to get accurate
information is to get it from

95
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:23,964
different sources
and then cross-check.

96
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,890
Data can be gathered through
literature review, semi-structured

97
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:31,758
interviews, household surveys,
qualitative field observation.

98
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:34,998
We will see a few more tools
in the next module and you

99
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:39,485
will find a few interview guides
in the fecal sludge management book.

100
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:42,917
Finally, what do we
do with our data?

101
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:47,211
Well, we have to analyze it,
and also it is important

102
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:50,959
communicate the results in a form
that is understandable

103
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:54,112
and adjustable by
the different stakeholders.

104
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:57,192
You will get more insight in
the analysis of the different data

105
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,323
in the respective module
of this course, so we'll

106
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,473
not go any deeper here.

107
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:04,157
I would like to mention that in
addition to Sundeck's work

108
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,335
there are a number of
tools and tool boxes

109
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,952
under development to
help you in the collection

110
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:12,788
analysis, and visualization
of your data.

111
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,757
You may have heard
about the FSM toolbox

112
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:19,430
the world bank's diagnostic
 and decision making support tools

113
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,670
about the tool kit
of Sept in India

114
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:24,852
or WHO sanitation safety plans.

115
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:28,823
You will find the links to these
and more in the course materials

116
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:33,289
as well as dedicated modules in
our MOOC on sanitation planning.

117
00:06:33,946 --> 00:06:38,071
Now, let me just show you two ways
to share some of your results.

118
00:06:38,794 --> 00:06:41,494
First, SWOT analysis.

119
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:45,223
With the SWOT analysis you
systematically analyze the strengths

120
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:49,873
weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats, for the implementation

121
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:52,253
of a proper fecal sludge
management scheme

122
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,920
in your city.

123
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:57,822
Strengths and weaknesses describe
existing situations whereas

124
00:06:57,982 --> 00:07:00,607
opportunities and threats
represent the potential

125
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,534
that you've identified.

126
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,363
You can make this assessment more
systematic by doing it for each

127
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:09,515
of the enabling
environment components.

128
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:13,837
Secondly, you were already
introduced to the Shit Flow Diagrams

129
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:15,805
or SFDs.

130
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:18,820
This is an effective way
to represent in one figure

131
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:22,838
the main results of the assessment
of the initial situation and provide

132
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:26,383
a good advocacy tool
to talk to authorities.

133
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,175
The SFD website is there to
help you make your own SFD

134
00:07:30,323 --> 00:07:33,548
and you can learn more about it
by watching the dedicated module 

135
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,705
in our MOOC on sanitation planning.

136
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,520
A large part of your success with

137
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:41,998
the future of fecal sludge
management scheme

138
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,098
actually depends on the quality 

139
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,574
of the assessment of
the initial situation

140
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:49,673
and how it is communicated.

141
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,905
Don't forget the importance of
the human dimension of

142
00:07:53,074 --> 00:07:54,749
this assessment.

143
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:58,617
It is the time for first contact
but also the trust building

144
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:02,757
which is the best way to access
information and get people on board.

145
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,084
It is also paramount for
the selection of the potential

146
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,965
sites for treatment.

147
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:12,131
Now you got a better picture
of how to collect data

148
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,112
and what to do with it.

149
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:17,049
I hope that this module helped
you to link some of your learnings

150
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,806
in the course, that you can better
visualize what an integrated

151
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:25,689
approach practically is and how to
assess the enabling or disabling

152
00:08:25,846 --> 00:08:27,446
conditions.

153
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,895
Creating enabling conditions
has a lot to do with

154
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,832
stakeholder involvement.

155
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:35,539
That's what we will see
in the next module.

156
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,927
See you then!
