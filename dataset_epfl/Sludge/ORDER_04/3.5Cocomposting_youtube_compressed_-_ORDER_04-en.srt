1
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:08,032
Composting is the controlled
decomposition of raw

2
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:13,567
organic material into biologically
stable humic substances.

3
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,353
This is carried out by
micro organisms

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,857
and invertebrates in
the presence of oxygen.

5
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:24,830
The final produced compost is stable
doesn't degrade further

6
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,004
and is an excellent soil amendment.

7
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:29,784
In fact the use of compost as

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,876
a soil amendment is 
o well established

9
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:37,078
that it was first documented
2000 years ago.

10
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,446
Following this module,
you'll be able to explain

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:44,159
co-composting treatment
processing operation

12
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:47,268
discuss operation
and maintenance requirements

13
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:50,346
and name design parameters.

14
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,436
Since composting
is so well established

15
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:56,608
there's already a wealth
of information available.

16
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:58,919
If you want to know
about the science

17
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,063
operation, or technologies
of composting

18
00:01:02,214 --> 00:01:05,051
I recommend watching
the composting modules

19
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:09,315
in the third week of our
MOOC on municipal solid waste.

20
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:11,689
You could also download

21
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:15,074
the decentralized composing
book from our website

22
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:19,536
and also the international water
management association

23
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,097
or IWMI series
on resource recovery and reuse

24
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,309
specifically volumes 2, 3 and 15.

25
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:32,923
in this module I will not focus
on composing science

26
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:37,770
I will focus on the factors that
are specific to co-composting

27
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:43,133
of fecal sludge, based on
the operating experience of IMWI

28
00:01:43,306 --> 00:01:48,306
with co-composting in Ghana
who helped me to prepare this module.

29
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:50,800
So why do you need to co-compost?

30
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:53,982
Why not just compost
fecal sludge on it's own?

31
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:55,968
The Carbon to Nitrogen

32
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:59,594
or C to N ratio is too
low in fecal sludge

33
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,761
so you need to mix it with
carbon rich organic matter.

34
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,739
For example, in Ghana the dewaterd

35
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,036
fecal sludge that IMWI
is working with

36
00:02:08,205 --> 00:02:13,055
has a Carbon to Nitrogen ratio of
11 plus or minus 3

37
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:18,050
so input materials to compost
actually need to have a C to N ratio

38
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:22,624
between 25 to 1 and 35 to 1.

39
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,427
Let's stay in this table
for your reference

40
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:29,369
are types of organic waste that
you could use for co-composting

41
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:33,811
depending on their availability,
cost and qualities.

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,440
Qualities such as moisture,
carbon to nitrogen ratio

43
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,468
and particle size.

44
00:02:39,657 --> 00:02:43,795
the qualities will also affect
required composting times

45
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,567
to achieve stabilization.

46
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,614
For co-composting IWMI
is using food waste with

47
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:52,666
the Carbon to Nitrogen ratio

48
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,937
of between twenty-eight
to thirty-two to one

49
00:02:56,108 --> 00:03:00,758
and sawdust with the Carbon
to Nitrogen ration of about fifty.

50
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,767
Another important
operating consideration

51
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,442
is that fecal sludge
is mostly moisture

52
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:10,064
and so it needs to be dewatered
prior to co-composting

53
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:12,219
for example, with drying beds.

54
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:17,545
IMWI is starting with
fecal sludge that is 93-99% water.

55
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:23,388
Shown here is the sludge in Ghana
just being loaded into drying beds.

56
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:27,337
It's also important to consider
the source of the fecal sludge.

57
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:31,209
A sludge that is very fresh,
with short storage times

58
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,849
will not dewater as well

59
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,030
for example public
or commercial toilets

60
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,910
so then it needs to be mixed
with more stable sludge

61
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:41,583
that has a longer storage time.

62
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:45,402
It also needs to be considered that
the two different types of sludge

63
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:49,433
will have different total
solids concentrations.

64
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:52,601
Following dewatering
the sludge from these beds

65
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:58,597
is 20-35% total solids
or 65-80% moisture.

66
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:02,820
In general it is removed from
drying beds when it is spade-able

67
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,284
meaning that you can shovel it.

68
00:04:05,476 --> 00:04:07,376
The residents time
on the drying beds

69
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,572
depends on the climactic conditions

70
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,951
and in Ghana varies
between 7 to 21 days.

71
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:18,045
The food or market waste
also needs to be sorted

72
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:23,085
to remove inorganic waste that
you want to keep out of the compost.

73
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,198
And in the case of IMWI
also needs to be air dried

74
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:30,031
for two days to reduce
the moisture content

75
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:34,719
from as high as 75%
down to 50% or less.

76
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,089
Sawdust on the other hand
typically does not require drying.

77
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:43,837
Compost feed in general needs
to be around 50-60% moisture

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,387
like a damp but not wet sponge.

79
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,845
The next consideration for
pre-treatment prior

80
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:54,278
to the composting process
is particle size.

81
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:57,789
Feed stock that is too large
will take too long to compost

82
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,672
but if the pieces are too small
it can also reduce pore space

83
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,602
and oxygen transfer.

84
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,835
Shown here is manually breaking up
food waste prior to co-composting.

85
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,851
If the dewatered fecal
sludge is in large clumps

86
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,072
it also needs to be
broken down first.

87
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:18,168
So now you're ready to build
your own compost pile.

88
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,360
Which technology will you use?

89
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:24,008
Obviously prior to this step
a decision would have to been made

90
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,593
on technologies.

91
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:30,178
Factors influence the decision
of a technology including investment

92
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:36,727
maintenance, space, time and labor,
also volumes need to be considered.

93
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:41,623
This decision matrix is covered in
the solid waste management MOOC.

94
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,587
Other important design
factors include a roof

95
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:48,982
to ensure the compost does not
get too wet in the rainy season

96
00:05:49,163 --> 00:05:52,163
or dry out too fast in the sun.

97
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:56,520
Prior to making your compost pile,
you need to determine the correct

98
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,675
ratio of fecal sludge and
organic waste to end up with 

99
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:04,194
the proper moisture,
Carbon to Nitrogen ratio

100
00:06:04,355 --> 00:06:07,355
and particle size for composting.

101
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:11,162
In the case of IMWI
they are mixing 1500kg

102
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:16,497
of organic waste to 500kg
of dewatered fecal sludge

103
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:20,446
to make a pile that's 2000kg.

104
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:24,641
Alternatively they measure
by wheelbarrow, 48 wheelbarrow

105
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,963
organic waste to 16 wheelbarrow
of dewatered fecal sludge.

106
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,210
These two streams are
mixed together in a heap

107
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:36,729
with around 13L of water,
sprinkled in with the watering can

108
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:39,169
and then it's all mixed together.

109
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,480
Here's a heap that was made
with market waste, sawdust

110
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:44,738
and fecal sludge.

111
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:48,721
During the processing you will
need to control the temperature

112
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:49,986
and moisture.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,572
This is done by turning,
aeration, and adding moisture. 

114
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:58,779
PH also needs to be monitored
as does temperature with time

115
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,602
as an indicator
of pathogen reduction.

116
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:05,634
The temperature needs to be
maintained at 50 degrees Celsius

117
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:08,276
or higher for more than four weeks

118
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:11,092
to achieve adequate
pathogen reduction

119
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,981
which is especially important
when composting the fecal sludge.

120
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:18,782
However, you also do not
want the pile to get too hot

121
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:21,154
because although
heat kills pathogens

122
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:25,879
it can also be bad for
the organisms doing the composting.

123
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,405
In IMWI 90-100%
of helminth eggs are inactivated

124
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:35,757
during an 80 day composting period.

125
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:38,062
And for heap composting

126
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,567
stabilization takes
two to for months

127
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:43,143
depending on the feed stock.

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,359
Depending on the technology
and management however

129
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:51,149
the processing time varies
and it could even be up to a year.

130
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,897
Compost piles are turned
by moving them from

131
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,825
one place to another,
to ensure that all parts are

132
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:59,068
evenly treated.

133
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:01,668
This is important
for stabilization

134
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:03,659
and also pathogen reduction.

135
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:05,962
You see, this pile is still
in the active phase

136
00:08:06,122 --> 00:08:07,634
and it's steaming.

137
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:11,325
Water is also added
during the turning process.

138
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,736
Prior to selecting composting
as an option

139
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,921
it is important to evaluate
the potential end users

140
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,962
and the market demand,
as it drives the continuity

141
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,619
of the whole system.

142
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:27,114
If it seems viable,
then other factors to consider

143
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:31,610
include waster volumes,
availability, quality

144
00:08:31,785 --> 00:08:35,285
economic viability, and local laws.

145
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,380
This book, Marketing Compost,
can also be downloaded from

146
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,584
(INAUDIBLE) website.

147
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,530
Depending on the market demand

148
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,673
one way to increase
the market potential

149
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:50,311
of compost is to create a product
that is fortified with nutrients

150
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:52,885
so that it is a fertilizer.

151
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:55,458
In addition because
the compost is bulky

152
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:58,633
transportation costs
need to be considered.

153
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,318
IMWI addresses this by

154
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,459
creating pellets
with added nutrients

155
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,989
from the finished compost,
that they call fortifier.

156
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:09,506
In summary,
variables that are required

157
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,242
for designing a composting facility

158
00:09:12,408 --> 00:09:21,333
include waste streams,
availabilities

159
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:27,725
total volumes, total carbon
and total nitrogen

160
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:30,502
moisture

161
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,880
particle size and porosity

162
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,534
and markets.

163
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:42,891
Important parameters
for operation include

164
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:45,124
temperature

165
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:46,929
moisture

166
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:48,657
turning

167
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,338
aeration

168
00:09:53,463 --> 00:10:00,325
PH, and indicators for things,
such as maturity and quality.

169
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:05,281
In this module we learned about
co-composting treatment process

170
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,450
and operation, design parameters

171
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:11,086
and operations
and maintenance requirements.

172
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,994
Important points to remember
about co-composting

173
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:18,174
include that with properly
maintenance temperature

174
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,341
you can achieve
pathogen reduction

175
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,248
and stabilization

176
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:28,013
dewatering the fecal sludge
is mandatory prior to composting

177
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,265
composting technologies
are low cost

178
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,803
but also require space

179
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,625
and the end product is a compost
which has the same uses

180
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,853
as any compost.

181
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,669
Thank you for joining,
see you next time.
