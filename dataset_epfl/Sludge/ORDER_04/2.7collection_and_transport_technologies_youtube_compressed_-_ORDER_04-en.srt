1
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:08,169
How are you moving
around in your city you live in?

2
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:12,967
By (INAUDIBLE),
by bicycle, on foot, bus

3
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:16,437
(INAUDIBLE), train, or even by boat?

4
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:20,043
Or could it be
a combination of those?

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,525
Similarly, the collection
and transport of fecal sludge

6
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:27,181
uses a variety of technologies
based on local context.

7
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:30,710
For example, how do you collect
and transport fecal sludge

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,767
from a dense neighborhood
to a treatment plant?

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,220
Following this module,
you will be able to explain

10
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:39,096
why urban areas rely on

11
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:42,271
a range of collection
and transport technologies

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,814
name existing
established technologies

13
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,631
for collection and transport

14
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:48,357
and discuss which technologies

15
00:00:48,523 --> 00:00:51,523
are appropriate based
on the local context.

16
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:55,002
Urbane areas include
different physical

17
00:00:55,203 --> 00:00:57,391
and socio-economic realities

18
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:01,175
influencing fecal sludge
collection and transport.

19
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:06,048
Among others, the sludge
characteristics, access

20
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:09,702
the transport distance
and economic status

21
00:01:09,895 --> 00:01:12,958
are important for
collection and transport.

22
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:17,453
For example, in my city
of Kampala, Uganda

23
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:21,246
examples of our on-site
infrastructure include

24
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:26,075
panned middle and high income areas
with good road infrastructure

25
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,731
which are mostly connected
by sewer or septic tanks

26
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:32,716
with a low solid content.

27
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:36,412
Unplanned densely populated
low-income areas

28
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:40,048
with poor accessibility
in fecal sludge from pit latrines

29
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:42,941
has got a very high solid content

30
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,707
and peri-urban areas with
a low population density

31
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:50,908
and therefore long
transport distances.

32
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:56,353
These different realities explain
the large range of collection

33
00:01:56,528 --> 00:02:00,703
and transport technologies
that exist and will be introduced

34
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:02,416
in this module.

35
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,364
Collection technologies can

36
00:02:05,522 --> 00:02:06,810
in general be categorized

37
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,303
into manual,
manually operated mechanical

38
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:14,565
and fully mechanized technologies.

39
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:19,164
Manual collection with buckets
or shovels is often unsafe

40
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,945
and unhygienic.

41
00:02:21,194 --> 00:02:25,231
Frequently it involves the workers
interact directly into the on-site

42
00:02:25,423 --> 00:02:27,336
sanitation technology.

43
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:32,391
However, manual collection can be
an important part of providing

44
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,633
fecal sludge management services,
especially for the poor.

45
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:40,973
In addition, it can collect
thick sludge that is difficult

46
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,986
to collect with
the mechanical technologies.

47
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:48,245
Implementing minimal standards
and their enforcement 

48
00:02:48,572 --> 00:02:52,022
licensing, training
and capacity development

49
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,380
can improve the safety and hygiene

50
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,305
of service providers
and the community.

51
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:00,678
For example as shown
here in Lusaka, Zambia

52
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:05,535
where workers wear protective boots,
gloves and face masks.

53
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:10,711
The gulper shown
in action here in Kenya

54
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:15,111
is one manually operated
collection technology.

55
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:20,178
In comparison to manual
collection with shovels and buckets

56
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:23,569
this can increase
the safety and hygiene

57
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:27,531
by preventing human contact with
the fecal sludge during collection

58
00:03:27,727 --> 00:03:31,652
and increase the amount of sludge
that can be collected per day.

59
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:35,537
With the gulper,
the sludge is pumped out

60
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:39,389
manually by moving a plunger,
up and down.

61
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:43,385
The plunger contains a valve
which opens when the plunger

62
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:47,919
is moved downwards and closes
when the plunger is lifted upwards

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,837
moving the sludge towards
a collection vessel. 

64
00:03:55,573 --> 00:03:58,835
Manual collection technologies
need to be combined

65
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:03,088
with appropriate transport
technologies to ensure sludge

66
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:05,509
reaches a treatment plant.

67
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:11,124
Commonly, manually collected sludge
is pumped into drums

68
00:04:11,361 --> 00:04:15,524
and transported by trolleys,
carts, or on pickups

69
00:04:15,747 --> 00:04:17,097
as shown here.

70
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:23,323
These barrels commonly have the size
of one hundred, two hundred liters.

71
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:26,837
To allow sludge collection
in these areas

72
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:31,938
smaller trucks, shown here,
commonly referred to as vacutugs

73
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,669
have been developed.

74
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:39,771
A common size of these tanks
are between 0.5 and 2 cubic meters.

75
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,822
The technology considered
for transport

76
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,480
of manually
collected sludge

77
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:48,665
must take into account the distance
to the next treatment plant.

78
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,906
For example, carts are at most able
to transport the sludge

79
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,804
for a few kilometers.

80
00:04:55,826 --> 00:04:59,451
Transfer stations as a way
to improve sludge logistics

81
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:02,118
are covered in another module.

82
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,804
Mechanical collection technologies

83
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:08,003
are pumps driven
by electricity or fuel.

84
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:11,622
These technologies can pump
large amounts of sludge per day

85
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:14,179
than manually operated technologies.

86
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,124
Pumps that are mounter
on tractors and trucks

87
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:21,590
as show here, are the most common
mechanical collection technologies

88
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:25,560
and allow transport of
the sludge over long distances.

89
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,493
The vacuum pumps the sludge
through a hose into a tank.

90
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:37,654
Common sizes of these tanks are
between two and twenty cubic meters.

91
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:44,361
Vacuum trucks often
have difficulties

92
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:47,354
accessing on-site
sanitation technologies

93
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:52,042
that can only be accessed through
narrow roads and alleys.

94
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,828
In some areas, different sludge

95
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,974
collection and transport
technologies

96
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,141
have different opportunities
and challenges.

97
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:10,553
Best on sludge characteristics,
economic status of the customer

98
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,532
access and transport distances
that can be covered

99
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:18,397
it is up to you to select one
or several technologies

100
00:06:18,564 --> 00:06:20,927
for your neighborhood or city.

101
00:06:21,307 --> 00:06:23,319
Manual collection
and transport technologies

102
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,508
can collect sludge with
a high solidus content

103
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:31,375
such as from pit latrines,
and can access narrow lands.

104
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:37,038
However, these technologies
only collect small amounts of sludge

105
00:06:37,232 --> 00:06:39,969
and transport of this sludge
to a treatment plant

106
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:41,853
can be a challenge.

107
00:06:42,138 --> 00:06:45,163
This can result in the discharge
of the collected sludge

108
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,655
into the urban environment.

109
00:06:47,838 --> 00:06:50,188
Mechanical collection
and transport technologies

110
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:55,093
are often only appropriate for
sludge with a low solidus content.

111
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:59,903
In addition, access of on-site
sanitation technologies

112
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:01,858
can be a challenge.

113
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,859
In general, per volume
of fecal sludge

114
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,399
manual collection and transport
are more expensive

115
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:11,346
compared to mechanical technologies.

116
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:15,355
This is due to the time and work
spent accessing the on-site

117
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:18,583
sanitation technology,
and the low volumes of sludge

118
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:21,565
collected and transported
for treatment.

119
00:07:21,994 --> 00:07:25,669
This is an inequality for
the urban poor that

120
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,368
should be considered.

121
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:33,656
In this module, we have learned that
a number of different collection

122
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:37,248
and transport technologies
are used in urban areas 

123
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,064
corresponding to different physical
and socio-economic realities.

124
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:45,535
In addition, a number of different

125
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:47,197
collection and transport
technologies

126
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:52,375
were introduced that are appropriate
for different local context

127
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,563
considering accessibility

128
00:07:54,737 --> 00:07:58,212
transport distance,
and service costs.
