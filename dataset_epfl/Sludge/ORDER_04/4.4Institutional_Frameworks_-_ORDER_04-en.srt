1
00:00:04,293 --> 00:00:07,810
Can you imagine trying to get from
one side of your city to another,

2
00:00:08,035 --> 00:00:11,448
if all of a sudden traffic did not
follow any rules at all?

3
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:14,418
Depending on where you live,
certainly sometimes

4
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:17,486
it feels like this, but the reality
could be much worse.

5
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,889
What if there was no consequence
for parking cars in the middle

6
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,989
of the street, or trucks driving
on the wrong side of the road?

7
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:28,183
What if anyone could drive, even
5-year-old children?

8
00:00:28,733 --> 00:00:32,660
Certainly with no clear laws,
responsibilities or enforcement

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,090
the system would be
much more dangerous

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,023
and would not provide as much
protection of public health.

11
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:43,089
Following this module, you will
have an overview

12
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,520
of the importance of legal
frameworks

13
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:48,747
for regulating and enforcing
 roles and responsibilities.

14
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:52,646
Be able to explain difficulties
in implementation

15
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:56,256
with overlapping or gaps
in responsibilities,

16
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:58,696
and understand advantages
and drawbacks

17
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,958
to different institutional
arrangements.

18
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:05,966
As presented in other modules,
there are untold examples

19
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,700
of ways that faecal sludge management
service chain is not working. 

20
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:14,128
From the household level,
when people cannot afford

21
00:01:14,353 --> 00:01:18,184
to have faecal sludge removed,
manual and mechanical emptiers

22
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:21,839
who dump faecal sludge throughout
the urban environment

23
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,996
because they cannot afford transport,
lack of treatment plants,

24
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:31,115
or failed treatment plants,
and unsafe end use or disposal.

25
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,944
Like the traffic analogy,
this is because

26
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:39,527
faecal sludge management and on-site
sanitation are frequently

27
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:43,603
not recognized in law  with no one
mandated to deal with it.

28
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,643
So people are just doing the best
they can by themselves,

29
00:01:46,843 --> 00:01:49,843
frequently with awful results.

30
00:01:50,634 --> 00:01:52,921
Even when there are adequate laws
protecting public

31
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:56,121
and environmental health, they're
frequently not in force

32
00:01:56,321 --> 00:02:00,739
and many projects only consider
one aspect of the service chain.

33
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,387
Subsidizing septic tanks
or building a treatment plant

34
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:07,997
but without considering
the organizational or financial

35
00:02:08,197 --> 00:02:10,984
aspects to coordinate the entire
service chain.

36
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:16,001
To get where we want to be with
a fully functioning service chain

37
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:19,099
the system needs to be overseen
and monitored

38
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,316
by an entity with a clear mandate.

39
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,714
This is why it's so important
to have legal recognition

40
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:28,731
with a specific framework that
includes faecal sludge management.

41
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:31,993
Laws are required for defining
responsibilities

42
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:37,661
of each stakeholder, regulation,
enforcement, managing treatment plants.

43
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:41,793
Basically, adequate functioning
of the entire service chain.

44
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:46,264
Another frequently encountered
problem with incomplete,

45
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,884
institutional and regulatory
frameworks,

46
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:53,604
is overlapping responsibilities
or gaps in responsibilities

47
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:56,437
throughout the service chain,
resulting in a lack

48
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:59,552
of ownership or incentive
to fulfill roles.

49
00:02:59,752 --> 00:03:04,552
If jobs and roles are not clearly
defined, how can people fulfill them?

50
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,752
How can they be monitored
for effectiveness?

51
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:11,797
Or if two people are responsible
for a job, maybe neither one does it

52
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,381
or one rejects the authority
of another?

53
00:03:16,134 --> 00:03:18,156
To illustrate, I'll give you
a few examples.

54
00:03:18,356 --> 00:03:22,738
Imagine in your city, you're designing
a faecal sludge treatment plant.

55
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:26,016
You need to find out
the requirements for the level

56
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:28,856
of treatment required
for use in agriculture.

57
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:32,760
Where do you go?
Ministry of Works?

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,606
Water? Sanitation? 
Ministry of Health?

59
00:03:37,953 --> 00:03:43,406
Ministry of Agriculture?
Environment authority?

60
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:48,424
You want to use treated faecal
sludge as a soil conditioner.

61
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,440
You need to find out if this
is allowed.

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,402
Where do you go?
Ministry of Agriculture?

63
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:58,331
Ministry of Health?

64
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:03,509
You are interested in starting
a  faecal sludge management company.

65
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,312
You need to find out if you are legally
allowed to start your own company.

66
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:11,923
Where do you go?
Ministry of Trade and Industry?

67
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:18,298
Registrar of companies?
Municipal Sanitation Department?

68
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:23,098
So you can see the current reality
in many cities

69
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:27,783
is fractured, duplication and gaps
in roles and responsibilities

70
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:31,028
and a lack of incentives on behalf
of decision makers

71
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:33,364
to change the status quo.

72
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,041
This figure from the faecal
sludge management book

73
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:40,062
represents a hypothetical
example of the number

74
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:43,360
of different stakeholders
that could be responsible

75
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,475
for aspects of the service chain.

76
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:48,968
As you have more stakeholders 
involved, it provides

77
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:53,012
for more operational flexibility
to meet the needs at each step.

78
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:57,441
But also is increasingly complicated
in terms of enforcement,

79
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,894
monitoring and coordination.

80
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:04,709
For example, different stakeholders
for collection and transport

81
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:08,866
maybe results in more job creation,
but complicates

82
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:11,693
the delivery of collected sludge
to transport.

83
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:15,511
Or different stakeholders
responsible for treatment

84
00:05:15,711 --> 00:05:20,342
and resource recovery, maybe results
in more effective marketing

85
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,184
and distribution, but then
the treatment goals

86
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,922
and end use goals need to be
carefully linked and monitored.

87
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:32,537
One entity responsible for
everything could ease coordination

88
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:35,935
but requires highly developed
managerial skills

89
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,675
and financial resources,
and relies on regulation

90
00:05:39,858 --> 00:05:42,964
and enforcement to protect
public health.

91
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:46,235
This table, from the faecal sludge
management book

92
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:50,357
summarizes stakeholders and possible
responsibilities

93
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,140
in the organization of faecal
sludge management.

94
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:56,553
There are advantages
and disadvantages.

95
00:05:56,803 --> 00:05:59,839
The optimal roles in different
countries and cities,

96
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,327
will depend on
the local stakeholders

97
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:05,469
and their intrinsic strengths
and weaknesses.

98
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,719
For example, a private company
might be able to provide

99
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,306
excellent design, build, and
operation of treatment technologies.

100
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:18,493
But obviously, should not be
responsible for setting the laws

101
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:23,539
regulations or enforcement
regarding treatment standards.

102
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:28,134
The private interest of a company
is to maximize profits

103
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:33,447
where sanitation and protection
of public health are of public good.

104
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:39,995
Enforcement needs to have clearly
recognized authority and be impartial.

105
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:44,290
Different arrangements also impact
financial transfers

106
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,827
which is covered in its own module.

107
00:06:47,516 --> 00:06:49,018
So what can you do?

108
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:52,901
What are steps to take in your city
or country to tackle this issue?

109
00:06:53,676 --> 00:06:55,962
First, you could get
politicians interested

110
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:59,152
in a previously unrecognized
sanitation approach.

111
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,325
Work on technical aspects
to draft a content.

112
00:07:03,525 --> 00:07:07,337
Develop legal frameworks.
Obtain approval from politicians.

113
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:10,576
And enactment.
This process is long

114
00:07:10,776 --> 00:07:14,440
but necessary and worth the effort
for sustainable solutions.

115
00:07:15,072 --> 00:07:18,387
For example, based on the experience
of my colleague

116
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:20,766
working for the World Bank
in Maputo,

117
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:25,426
this was 1 year for step 1,
2 years for step 2,

118
00:07:25,626 --> 00:07:32,643
6 months for step 3, and 18 months
for step 4 and 5.

119
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,013
What are further steps
you could take?

120
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:38,621
You could negotiate an agreement
with the relevant authorities

121
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,523
to legally make an exception
to a project.

122
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:44,110
This is called the moratorium.

123
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,389
The success of the project
could help

124
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:49,137
eventually change
the law or standards.

125
00:07:49,337 --> 00:07:53,023
For example, the law on dumping fees
was lifted

126
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,095
for small faecal sludge
management operators,

127
00:07:56,295 --> 00:08:00,845
developing services for
low income areas in Maputo.

128
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,628
Critically review the law
and regulations.

129
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:07,388
Laws are not usually black or white.

130
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:11,388
You can consult with key
stakeholders to see if an idea

131
00:08:11,588 --> 00:08:13,563
fits into the legal framework.

132
00:08:13,763 --> 00:08:18,396
Other possibilities include thinking
of ways to organize more efficiently.

133
00:08:18,596 --> 00:08:22,243
For example, if collection and
transport is by private companies

134
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:26,477
it's more efficient to organize
if there's a strong association

135
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:31,517
for engagement, outreach, education,
regulation, and enforcement. 

136
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:35,811
Also important is to build trust
with the emptiers

137
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:38,636
and consult them on project design
and solutions.

138
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:43,720
For further guidance on action steps,
a valuable reference

139
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,631
is the World Bank's faecal
sludge management tools

140
00:08:46,831 --> 00:08:51,703
which provide application, diagnostic,
and decision support tools

141
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:53,960
for achieving city-wide sanitation

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,716
presented with case studies for how
they relate to five different cities.

143
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,364
This is where SANDEC's technical
expertise 

144
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:03,707
on faecal sludge management
is included.

145
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:09,320
Tool 4, Service Delivery Action
Framework explains what it means

146
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,685
to conceptualize institutional
interventions.

147
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:17,424
This table from the Service Delivery
Action Framework

148
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:20,484
walks you through action steps
for your city

149
00:09:20,684 --> 00:09:23,765
based on where they are in
the development of services.

150
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:28,134
It addresses the national and local
levels, and citizens, 

151
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,002
the users of sanitation
infrastructure.

152
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:35,463
It highlights action steps
based on current levels of basic

153
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:40,095
intermediate, or consolidating
service provision.

154
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:43,408
It is useful to help you address
the 'what next',

155
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:47,433
build on what currently works,
and identify areas

156
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,572
to prioritize and focus actions. 

157
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,811
I recommend downloading the tools.

158
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,375
For additional information,
please refer to chapter 12

159

160
00:10:00,223 --> 00:10:04,569
The case study of Lusaka, presented 
in this module of the SANDEC

161
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,378
Planning and Design of Sanitation
Systems and Technologies MOOC

162
00:10:08,578 --> 00:10:13,161
for an example of a bottom up
approach to incrementally

163
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:15,164
improve service provision.

164
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:19,292
What types of things can you start
to implement now in your city?

165
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:23,300
And this module, for the case study
in Indonesia

166
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,992
as an example of a national program
starting up and going to scale.

167
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,508
In conclusion, in this module
you learned about

168
00:10:32,752 --> 00:10:35,561
the importance of legal frameworks
for regulating

169
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,427
and enforcing roles
and responsibilities.

170
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:43,096
Difficulties with overlapping
or gaps in responsibilities.

171
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:47,568
And advantages and drawbacks
to different institutional arrangements.

172
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,432
Thanks for joining.
See you next time.
