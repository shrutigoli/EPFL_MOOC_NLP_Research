1
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,793
What happens with a plastic bottle

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,976
when you throw it away?

3
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:16,306
Well, it might end up
in a landfill

4
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:19,351
however it could also be collected

5
00:00:19,639 --> 00:00:23,876
often by the informal sector,
transported to a processing site

6
00:00:24,054 --> 00:00:27,591
washed and shredded
into small pieces.

7
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:31,733
These pieces could then
be used as a raw material

8
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:35,858
in the production of fibers
for clothes, carpets

9
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:38,543
or new plastic bottles.

10
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:42,255
This process is a form of
resource recovery 

11
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:45,909
that is probably
happening around you.

12
00:00:46,137 --> 00:00:49,212
In this module we will introduce you

13
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:51,519
to similar forms of
resource recovery

14
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,516
for fecal sludge.

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,274
Following this module,
you will be able

16
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,616
to list different treatment products

17
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,959
identify ways in which
they can be used

18
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,144
and learn important characteristics
of resource recovery products.

19
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:12,004
For over 2000 years
excreta and fecal sludge

20
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:14,049
from animals and humans

21
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:16,642
have been used in
many parts of the world

22
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:19,606
as soil conditioner in agriculture.

23
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:24,484
The water, organic matter
and nutrients in fecal sludge

24
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:28,865
are beneficial for soil properties
and plant growth.

25
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:32,741
The organic matter is beneficial
for water retention

26
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,277
which can increase
water holding capacity

27
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:37,776
and reduce the effects of drought

28
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,361
reduce erosion of soils 

29
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:43,603
and benefit
the soil microbial community

30
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,797
and the water and the nutrients

31
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:48,937
such as nitrogen, phosphorous
and potassium

32
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,844
are essential for plant growth.

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,908
However, there are also
other possible uses

34
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:57,809
and types
of treatment products

35
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:00,566
than just soil amendments.

36
00:02:00,827 --> 00:02:03,952
Products from other established
treatment technologies

37
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:07,794
include compost from
co-composting of fecal sludge

38
00:02:07,972 --> 00:02:10,134
and organic solid waste

39
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:14,449
plants, for example from
planted drying beds

40
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:19,325
and affluent, for example
from waster stabilization ponds.

41
00:02:19,618 --> 00:02:22,618
In addition,
treatment technologies exist

42
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:26,991
that are innovative
and in development.

43
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:31,649
These products
and treatment technologies include

44
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:35,254
Bio-gas, Bio-diesel, and Syngas

45
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,660
for example from
anaerobic digestion of fecal sludge

46
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:43,981
insect larvae from the treatment
of fecal sludge with fly larvae

47
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:47,696
and Char from carbonization
of fecal sludge.

48
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:52,575
These treatment products
can all have different uses.

49
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:57,120
We already mentioned the use
of Dewatered or dried sludge

50
00:02:57,392 --> 00:03:01,967
as soil conditioner,
ranging from deeper entrenchment

51
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,876
or untreated fecal sludge
as soil conditioner.

52
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,516
In addition this treatment product
can also be used as a component

53
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:13,371
in building materials

54
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:16,604
or for the production
of solid fuels.

55
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:26,699
Compost and fertilizer can be used
as soil conditioner, agriculture

56
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,890
horticulture or (INAUDIBLE)

57
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,343
plant as animal feed

58
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:36,530
effluent for irrigation
in agriculture

59
00:03:36,764 --> 00:03:40,126
or for parks or golf courses

60
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:45,910
Bio-gas, Bio-diesel, and Syngas
as liquid bio-fuel

61
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:52,470
insect larvae as animal feed,
such as chicken or fish

62
00:03:52,912 --> 00:03:57,637
Char as a component for Bio-fuel
brickette production 

63
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,813
or as soil conditioner.

64
00:04:02,948 --> 00:04:05,461
The aforementioned
treatment products 

65
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:09,425
can also be further processed
to increase the market value.

66
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:12,241
For example Char

67
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:14,685
from the carbonization
of fecal sludge

68
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,291
may be used for a soil conditioner.

69
00:04:17,877 --> 00:04:23,039
Further processing of Chat
into brickettes puts into a form

70
00:04:23,249 --> 00:04:26,162
that could make it suitable
for recovery of it's energy

71
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,871
in households or institutions.

72
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:34,204
Other examples include
the combustion of Bio-gas or Cyngas

73
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:39,109
to produce heat or electricity,
or pelletizing of compost

74
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:40,971
or dried sludge.

75
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:44,353
Pellets are more
homogeneous in size 

76
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,070
they have a higher density
of nutrients or energy

77
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:53,114
in comparison with the sludge
or compost before pelletizing

78
00:04:53,352 --> 00:04:56,702
and then therefore be easier
to transport and store.

79
00:04:58,102 --> 00:05:01,102
Characterization
of treatment products is important

80
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:04,361
to ensure that they
meet market needs

81
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:07,557
and protect public
an environmental health.

82
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,895
On the next slide we will summarize

83
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,708
what parameters are relevant

84
00:05:13,888 --> 00:05:16,288
for the different
treatment products.

85
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,204
Nutrients such as Nitrogen,
phosphorous and potassium

86
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,796
are essential for plant growth

87
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:26,528
and important for
the use of affluent for irrigation

88
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:30,172
and soil conditioner,
compost or fertilizer.

89
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:33,904
Heavy metal such as
Lead and Cadmium

90
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:38,368
and the salinity are important
as they can be toxic to plants.

91
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:44,087
Indicators of pathogens
such as E coli for affluent 

92
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:46,956
and Helminths eggs
for soil conditioner

93
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:50,606
composts of fertilizer should be
determined to ensure

94
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:54,536
that resource recovery
adequately protects public health.

95
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,210
The calorific value, a measure of
the energy content of the fuel

96
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,664
is important for
the characterization

97
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,860
of treatment products as solid fuel.

98
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,481
The ash in fuels is
an important indicator

99
00:06:10,742 --> 00:06:13,855
for the amount of inorganics
contained in fecal sludge.

100
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,300
it is the proportion of
the fuel that does not ban

101
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:22,114
and therefore does not contribute
to the calorific value.

102
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:25,854
Helminths eggs as an indicator
of human pathogens in sludge

103
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:31,251
is also an important parameter for
the use of fecal sludge as fuel.

104
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,520
The Methane content
and the Carbon Dioxide content

105
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:41,174
and the calorific value
are important parameters for Bio-gas

106
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:46,099
a higher Methane
and lower Carbon Dioxide content

107
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:49,056
increases the calorific value.

108
00:06:50,226 --> 00:06:53,589
The Protein, Fat
and the Mineral content

109
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,808
are important for
the use of insect larvae

110
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,905
and plants as animal feed.

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,525
These parameters can be used

112
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,127
to compare
the product characteristics

113
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:09,478
to the nutritional requirements
of animals.

114
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:16,350
Indicators of human pathogens
such as E coli and Helminths eggs

115
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:21,134
should also be regularly monitored
for animal feeds in order to ensure

116
00:07:21,314 --> 00:07:24,489
that pathogens are
not transmitted to animals. 

117
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:28,099
In this module we have learned

118
00:07:28,304 --> 00:07:31,904
what some products
from treatment are

119
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,536
and how they can be used.

120
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:39,008
This includes affluent for
irrigation and sludge

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,650
compost as the soil conditioner,
solid and liquid Bio-fuels

122
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,449
plants as animal feed

123
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,625
and as a component
in building materials.

124
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:51,498
Characterization
of treatment products

125
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:55,857
for parameters such as
the caloric value as a solid fuel

126
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:59,538
and the ratio of nutrients
as soil conditioner

127
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:01,213
compost of fertilizer

128
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:04,393
are important to meet market needs.

129
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,571
Helminths eggs and E coli
are important indicators

130
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:12,085
to ensure the protection
of public health.
