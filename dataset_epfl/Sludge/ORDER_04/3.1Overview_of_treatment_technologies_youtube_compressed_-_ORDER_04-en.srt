1
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:05,684
In other modules
we've introduced you

2
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:07,470
to treatment objectives
for fecal sludge

3
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,755
and markets for treatment products.

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,042
In this module we will provide you

5
00:00:11,214 --> 00:00:13,264
with an overview
of treatment technologies

6
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,026
to meet these objectives
and market demands.

7
00:00:16,968 --> 00:00:19,680
Following this module you'll
be able to explain different levels

8
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:22,367
of technology development,
list technology based

9
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:24,207
on the level
of technology development

10
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:27,044
and group technologies
by treatment objectives.

11
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:31,442
Many technologies exist for
the treatment of fecal sludge

12
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:38,217
such as planted drying beds,
co-composting, fly larvae composting

13
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:43,596
paralysis , or lime treatment.

14
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:47,216
These different technologies
have different levels of research

15
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:50,397
design, operating
and maintenance experience.

16
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:53,939
for example, unplanted drying beds
have been extensively researched

17
00:00:54,132 --> 00:00:55,957
and implemented for
fecal sludge treatment

18
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,847
in the past twenty years.

19
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,199
This (INAUDIBLE) research facility
in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,363
Such research has produced knowledge
for treatment design and operation

21
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,898
for example, on influent of sand
filter diameter and filter depth

22
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:11,335
on the treatment performance.

23
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:14,788
Here's an example of
a full scale construction operation

24
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:17,646
on drying beds for fecal sludge
treatment in Kampala.

25
00:01:17,822 --> 00:01:20,122
Examples like this
provide further information

26
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,067
or example how to best remove
sludge from drying beds

27
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,507
or dewatering
and drying times.

28
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,907
Such information can then
improve further treatment

29
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,929
designs and operations.

30
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,043
We call technologies with this level

31
00:01:32,214 --> 00:01:33,839
of development
and operating experience

32
00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:35,562
established technologies.

33
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:38,854
Other established technologies
include planted drying beds

34
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:43,225
co-composting, setting-thickening
tanks and deep row entrenchment.

35
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,783
In contrast to
established technologies

36
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:48,113
technologies that are available
that are established for

37
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,468
the treatment of other waste,
such as waste water

38
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,808
and solid waste.

39
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:54,196
We call these technologies
Transferring technologies

40
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,956
as information operation
is currently still being

41
00:01:57,134 --> 00:01:59,522
transferred and adapted
for fecal sludge.

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,382
These technologies include
anaerobic digestion, incineration

43
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,847
vermi-composting, lime treatment

44
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:08,196
and mechanical
dewatering, as shown here

45
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,833
for a fecal sludge
treatment plant in Manila.

46
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,660
These technologies can
be used for treatment

47
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:16,464
by less reliable information
available on their design

48
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:17,675
and operation with fecal sludge

49
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:20,045
compared to
the established technologies.

50
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:22,838
Fecal sludge management
is a really dynamic field

51
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,199
and many innovative technologies
are also being developed.

52
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:29,321
For example pyrolysis,
ammonia treatment

53
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,608
fly larvae composting,
or pelletizing, as shown here

54
00:02:32,787 --> 00:02:35,037
the fecal sludge
treatment plant in Durban.

55
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:37,465
These technologies are currently
in their research stage

56
00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:39,633
in preparation for scaling up.

57
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,195
So why do we distinguish
technologies as established

58
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,797
transferring and innovative?

59
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:49,001
The level of technology development
is and important indicator

60
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:51,435
in selecting
an appropriate technology

61
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:55,534
based on the level of adaption,
research, innovation, as well

62
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:59,594
as design, operation and maintenance
that will be required for successful

63
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,560
implementation of this technology.

64
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,257
Established technologies can
be more reliably implemented

65
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,963
but much less information's
available for the transferring

66
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,669
and innovative technologies.

67
00:03:10,198 --> 00:03:11,860
Therefore, established technologies

68
00:03:12,022 --> 00:03:14,322
should selected when
limited capacity

69
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,443
for this adaption, innovation
and research and development

70
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:18,675
are available.

71
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:22,094
For transferring technologies
and innovative technologies

72
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:24,014
the increased risk,
due to the lower level

73
00:03:24,188 --> 00:03:26,525
of technology development
needs to be considered

74
00:03:26,685 --> 00:03:29,048
and managed, this could be,
for example done through

75
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,869
public private partnerships
or research collaborating

76
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,315
with a university.

77
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,926
This could pay off as transferring
innovative technologies

78
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,886
have the potential
to be more efficient.

79
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:42,635
For example, in space requirements,
and they can also produce products

80
00:03:42,802 --> 00:03:46,177
that have a higher revenue potential
that could off-set treatment costs.

81
00:03:47,371 --> 00:03:48,459
You might be overwhelmed

82
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:50,184
by the large number
of treatment technologies

83
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,668
presented here, and you
just want to know what technology

84
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:56,899
do I need for drying out sludge
or to inactivate pathogens.

85
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,379
To answer this question,
it is best to group technology

86
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,604
based on treatment objectives,
Solid-liquid separation

87
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,362
sludge stabilization,
nutrient management

88
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,501
and pathogen inactivations.

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,362
Technologies for
Solid-liquid separation

90
00:04:11,533 --> 00:04:14,433
include drying beds, mechanically
dewatering technologies 

91
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:16,532
and Settling-thickening tanks.

92
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:18,897
These technologies are designed
to separate solids

93
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,223
and liquid material
in fecal sludge.

94
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,717
For example, on this planted
drying bed in Thailand

95
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:28,085
sludge is loaded on the surface
of the sand filter layer.

96
00:04:30,612 --> 00:04:32,349
Solids and fecal sludge
remain on the surface

97
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:33,428
of this filter layer

98
00:04:33,598 --> 00:04:35,498
while the liquid passes
through the liquid layer

99
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:38,621
and is collected at the bottom of
the filter in the drainage network

100
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,214
for further treatment.

101
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:41,966
Treatment technologies typically

102
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:43,666
achieve several
treatment objectives.

103
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,787
For example, for plated
drying beds sludge can remain

104
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,316
on the surface for up to ten years
and also become stabilized

105
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,861
as you can see with the stabilized
sludge on the surface of this

106
00:04:53,029 --> 00:04:54,267
planted drying bed.

107
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:58,660
Other treatment technologies
of sludge stabilization include

108
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:01,436
co-composting,
anaerobic digestion

109
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,999
fly larvae and Vermi-composting

110
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,203
and incineration
and pyrolysis.

111
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:09,867
Technologies for nutrient management
can include co-composting

112
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:14,579
deep row entrenchment,
and fly larvae and vermi-composting.

113
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:18,126
As always, the appropriate level
of inactivation of pathogens

114
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,440
for the intended use
of treatment products

115
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:23,391
must be a priority
to protect public health.

116
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:30,342
Co-composting, storage,
lime and ammonia treatment

117
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,446
and incinerating and pyrolysis
are technologies that achieve

118
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:36,612
high levels of pathogen
inactivation.

119
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,536
Frequently fecal sludge
is mostly comprised of water.

120
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:43,314
So all technologies for
solid-liquid separation

121
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,501
and also for example,
anaerobic digestion

122
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:48,666
produce liquid effluents
that require further treatment.

123
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:51,771
Technologies for effluent
treatment include infiltration

124
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:54,812
planted drying beds,
waste stabilization ponds

125
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:56,896
anaerobic baffled
reactors and filters

126
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,781
and constructive wetlands.

127
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:01,766
if treatment is located adjacent
to the waste water treatment plant

128
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,878
you can also include co-treatment
with waster stabilization ponds

129
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:08,333
or even technologies based
on activated sludge process.

130
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:11,249
Treatment that adequately

131
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,212
protects public
and environmental health

132
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,660
requires combinations
of different treatment technologies

133
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:17,475
with different treatment objectives.

134
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,485
Let's look at one example.

135
00:06:20,138 --> 00:06:23,426
This picture shows the Dumaguete
treatment plant in the Philippines.

136
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:26,209
It has the capacity to treat
80 cubic meter of fecal sludge

137
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:28,208
from septic tanks per day.

138
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:30,897
At Dumaguete, the sludge (INAUDIBLE)

139
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:33,630
into an anaerobic waste
stabilization pond.

140
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,591
Following the effluent from
this waste stabilization pond

141
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:38,572
is further treated in facultative

142
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,644
and maturation waste
stabilization ponds

143
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:42,602
and constructive wet lands.

144
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,571
The solids that settle in anaerobic
waste stabilization ponds

145
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:48,551
are dewatered
and dried pm dying beds.

146
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,806
In separate modules
you will learn more

147
00:06:50,968 --> 00:06:52,605
about these treatment technologies.

148
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,368
This will enable you
to select technologies

149
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:56,185
for a complete fecal sludge
treatment plant

150
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,655
and know important
design considerations.

151
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:01,785
You now have a good overview
of treatment technologies

152
00:07:01,938 --> 00:07:04,313
for fecal sludge, but remember

153
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:06,948
technology is only
a part of the solution

154
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:10,255
next to the level of technology
development and treatment objectives

155
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,870
presented int his module,
consideration like capital operation

156
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:15,370
and maintenance cost

157
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,384
the existing institution
arrangements and capacity

158
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,703
the enabling environment
and socio-economic characteristics

159
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:25,348
need to be considered and will
be discussed in separate modules.

160
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:29,125
In this module, you were introduced
to different treatment technologies

161
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,539
for fecal sludge.

162
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:33,150
Technologies have different levels
of technology development

163
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,620
based on existing level of knowledge

164
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:38,448
of research, design,
and operation and maintenance.

165
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:41,898
This should be considered when
selecting treatment technologies.

166
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,516
Knowing the treatment objectives
for treatment technologies

167
00:07:44,692 --> 00:07:48,292
so for example, solid-liquid
separation from unplanted drying bed

168
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,554
of sludge stabilization,
nutrient management

169
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,955
and pathogen inactivation
for co-composting

170
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,337
are important to select

171
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,491
and combine fecal sludge
treatment technologies

172
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:59,644
for a complete fecal
sludge treatment plant.
