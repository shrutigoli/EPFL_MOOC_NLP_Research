1
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,768
After your second week
at this introduction

2
00:00:06,928 --> 00:00:09,628
to fecal sludge management,
do you feel like you already

3
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,752
have a grasp on fundamentals?

4
00:00:11,892 --> 00:00:14,892
Are you ready to move on
to the treatment technologies now?

5
00:00:15,112 --> 00:00:17,337
You now know the four
treatment objectives

6
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:19,266
we will focus on in this course:

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,477
Solid-liquid separation,
Stabilization

8
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:25,671
nutrient management,
and pathogen reduction.

9
00:00:26,049 --> 00:00:28,562
How do they relate to health
and environmental impacts

10
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:31,974
and the physical, chemical
and biological mechanisms

11
00:00:32,175 --> 00:00:34,125
for how they're achieved.

12
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:38,019
Developing and understanding
of treatment mechanism

13
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:41,589
is very important,
as it is a basis for applying

14
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,766
existing fecal sludge
treatment technologies

15
00:00:44,975 --> 00:00:48,262
developing new ones
and adapting existing ones

16
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:51,356
from waste water
and sludge treatment practices.

17
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,884
We will start exploring examples
in more detail next week

18
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:58,100
with established treatment
technologies that rely

19
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:01,936
on physical mechanism
such as gravity filtration 

20
00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:05,272
and evaporation,
biological metabolism

21
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,423
applied for stabilization,
nutrient management

22
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:12,199
and pathogen reduction,
mechanisms of pathogen reduction

23
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,372
and chemical treatment.

24
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:17,563
The number one goal
of fecal sludge management

25
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:21,343
is always public health,
but also related and important 

26
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:24,901
are environmental health,
and resource recovery.

27
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:28,587
You now know multiple ways
in which treatment products

28
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:32,626
can be used for resource recovery,
which ones are at different levels

29
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:36,022
of established, innovative
or in development

30
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:39,201
and in way in which
they can be used.

31
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,617
Designing for the final end use

32
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,861
or disposal option
of treatment products

33
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:48,788
is critical to ensure that affluents
and end products achieve adequate

34
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:51,062
and appropriate levels of treatment

35
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:55,479
that systems are not over-designed,
wasting financial resources

36
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,753
and that systems
are not under-designed

37
00:01:57,933 --> 00:02:00,346
risking public
and environmental health. 

38
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:03,047
in addition to setting
treatment objectives

39
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,006
resource recovery can
offset treatment cost

40
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:10,082
and help ensure sustainable
operation of treatment plants.

41
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:13,864
In many cities treatment
does not yet exist

42
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:17,504
and hence treatment
products do not yet exist.

43
00:02:17,683 --> 00:02:20,583
So how can you determine
potential markets for something

44
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,348
that doesn't exist yet?

45
00:02:22,553 --> 00:02:25,428
This is why you learn about
the concept of replacement

46
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,510
or surrogate products that have
an equivalent resource value

47
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:32,932
and can be used
as proxies to explore markets.

48
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:36,103
Were you able to download
and review the guidelines

49
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:39,288
for the implementation of
the market driven approach?

50
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:41,428
We use the example of Kampala.

51
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,934
Have you thought about which
treatment products have

52
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,109
the greatest market
attractiveness in your city?

53
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,292
Please add your comments
in the discussion forum.

54
00:02:50,877 --> 00:02:52,627
You also learned
about the importance

55
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,922
of designing management options for

56
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:58,254
the actual quantity
and characteristics of fecal sludge

57
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,728
based on the local context.

58
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:04,287
Without reasonable estimations
you cannot accurately design

59
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:05,864
a management plan.

60
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,007
You also learned about
the different places in

61
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:12,741
the service chain or characteristics
and quantities can be assessed

62
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,319
to evaluate current and future
demands for management needs

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,842
to help ensure long term
sustainable management.

64
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:24,301
You know what parameters
of characterization are

65
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,397
can select relative parameters

66
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:28,732
depending on
the management question

67
00:03:28,903 --> 00:03:33,128
such as treatment objectives,
type of end use, or collection

68
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:36,167
and name important characteristics
of treatment products

69
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:39,528
for resource recovery,
including irrigation

70
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:45,653
soil conditioner, compost,
fertilizer, solid fuel, liquid fuels

71
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,131
animal feed.

72
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:51,394
Were you able to download
(INAUDIBLE) or PRG resources?

73
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:55,492
Also in week two, you learned about
manual and mechanical ways

74
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,805
in which fecal sludge is collected
and transported from

75
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,685
containment to treatment.

76
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:04,312
Why urban areas rely on
a range of technologies 

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,187
and which are appropriate
based on the context.

78
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:11,779
In week five, we will visit this
in more depth with two more modules

79
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:15,544
one on collection and
another one on transport.

80
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:20,184
Based on week two, what ideas do you
have not for implementation

81
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,970
of fecal sludge management
in your city?

82
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,925
Ideas for resource recovery

83
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:28,459
how would you attempt
to quantify fecal sludge?

84
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:31,443
Please share you ideas
on the discussion forum.

85
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,649
Please, also visit
the platform website

86
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,570
for a complete list of
additional resources.

87
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:39,068
So, now we're ready
to move on to week three

88
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:41,513
where you will learn about
treatment technologies

89
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:44,149
for the centralized
to semi-centralized

90
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,226
treatment of fecal sludge.

91
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,243
The week will start out with
an overview of technologies

92
00:04:49,432 --> 00:04:51,257
based on their level of development

93
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:55,631
whether they are established,
transferring from other technologies

94
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:59,143
or innovative in development,
in an overview of their different

95
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,662
treatment objectives and how they
need to be linked together

96
00:05:02,856 --> 00:05:05,218
to achieve overall objectives.

97
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:07,189
When thinking about
treatment objectives

98
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:08,857
keep in mind how they relate to

99
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,364
different types
of resource recovery.

100
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:14,663
We will present a number
of established technologies

101
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:18,400
and for each one you will learn
about the treatment process

102
00:05:18,597 --> 00:05:23,272
important operation and maintenance
requirements and design parameters.

103
00:05:23,478 --> 00:05:26,328
The week will then wrap up
with an example of how

104
00:05:26,522 --> 00:05:29,860
a number of technologies can
be combined in the design

105
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,688
of the treatment plant.

106
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,640
Treatment technologies will again

107
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:36,819
be covered in more
detail in week five.

108
00:05:37,092 --> 00:05:40,092
Thanks for joining,
see you next week.
