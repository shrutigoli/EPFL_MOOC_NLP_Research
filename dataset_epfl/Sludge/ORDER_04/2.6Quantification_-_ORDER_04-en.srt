1
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:07,421
If I asked you how many fish
were in this lake

2
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:08,829
could you tell me?

3
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:11,636
Even more complicated,
what if I asked you how many

4
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:14,229
of each type of species there were?

5
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,243
It's pretty difficult since you
can't even see them.

6
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,698
This is a similar problem

7
00:00:18,878 --> 00:00:22,153
that faces us with
the quantification of fecal sludge.

8
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,051
Following this module,
you should understand the importance

9
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:30,033
of reasonably accurate estimations
for quantities of fecal sludge

10
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:31,909
on a city wide scale.

11
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:36,388
Be able to explain the difference
between produced, accumulated

12
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:40,074
emptied, dumped,
or discharged fecal sludge

13
00:00:40,268 --> 00:00:42,981
and explain methods that
could be used to estimate

14
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:45,227
quantities of fecal sludge.

15
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,128
To understand why
quantification is important

16
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:51,526
let's go back to our
engineering design approach

17
00:00:51,706 --> 00:00:54,018
where to select
and design technologies

18
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,511
we first need to know
treatment objectives

19
00:00:56,699 --> 00:00:58,737
so we know what
we are designing for

20
00:00:58,913 --> 00:00:59,813
and then we need to know

21
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,680
what is coming into
the treatment plant

22
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,263
so we can appropriately size them.

23
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:08,885
So quantification is very important
for the management and treatment

24
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:10,480
of fecal sludge.

25
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,571
But how can we do this?

26
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:17,099
For waste water it's relatively
straight forward to make assumptions

27
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:19,891
as it is typically know
how many household connections

28
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:21,345
there are to a sewer

29
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:24,311
and average per capita water usage.

30
00:01:24,697 --> 00:01:27,185
But for fecal sludge
they are typically not records

31
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:30,169
of the existing situation,
and so we do not know

32
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,618
how many on-site
sanitation systems there even are

33
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:36,508
or how many different types
of containment technologies

34
00:01:36,693 --> 00:01:40,843
like septic tanks, cesspits,
lined or unlined pit latrines

35
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,392
how many people are using them,
how frequently they are emptied

36
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:45,914
and other factors

37
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:49,673
such as usage patterns
that affect characteristics.

38
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,164
We need to think about how
to start making good estimations now

39
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:56,677
for the design of infrastructure,
but also consider what type

40
00:01:56,852 --> 00:02:00,802
of actions need to be put in place
so that in the future we can

41
00:02:00,982 --> 00:02:03,982
even more accurately assess
the management need.

42
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,088
Starting with the current situation

43
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,010
let's first thing about
the different places

44
00:02:09,185 --> 00:02:12,848
in the service chain where
fecal sludge could be quantified.

45
00:02:13,244 --> 00:02:16,531
Number one is the amount
the excrete that's produced

46
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,279
which is not fecal sludge

47
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:21,911
but can be readily estimated
based on the literature.

48
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:26,562
Number two is the amount
of fecal sludge that's produced

49
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,129
So what is going into containment
along with excreta

50
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:32,569
like cleansing material
or flush water

51
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,072
and can also be estimated
if you know enough about types

52
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:39,529
of containment and water usage
patterns in the city.

53
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:43,584
Number three is the amount
of fecal sludge that actually

54
00:02:43,761 --> 00:02:46,761
accumulates
in containment technologies.

55
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:49,424
For the development
of the fecal sludge management

56
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,427
on a city wide scale,
number three is the number

57
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:55,479
we want to know,
but it is too difficult to calculate

58
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:58,662
because it is a rate equation
that varies depending on

59
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:02,413
lots of different factors,
such as inflow and infiltration

60
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,531
rates of biological degradation

61
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:07,873
which are also affected
by temperature, moisture, Ph

62
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,875
redox potential, etc.

63
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:16,557
Number four is fecal sludge
that is emptied but not collected.

64
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,341
So for example when
people break a containment

65
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,885
and let it drain directly out
into the environment.

66
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:25,193
This is very difficultly to estimate

67
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,098
but mostly we just
want to eradicate it.

68
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:32,223
Number five is the amount
of fecal sludge that is collected

69
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,695
but not delivered to treatment.

70
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,868
This could be manual
or mechanical emptiers.

71
00:03:38,061 --> 00:03:40,223
Reasonable estimations can be made

72
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,390
if dumping is concentrated
in a few areas

73
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,223
or if the current number
and operating capacity

74
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,399
of trucks and emptiers
in a city is known.

75
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:52,809
And number six
is what we want to see.

76
00:03:53,045 --> 00:03:56,533
Fecal sludge that is collected
and delivered to a treatment plant

77
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,969
or legal discharge location.

78
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:03,668
This should be very easy to estimate
based on operating records.

79
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,658
The reason why number three
is so important

80
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:09,613
is that it tells us
the full magnitude of the problem

81
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,142
so we can develop
sustainable management.

82
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:16,529
For example, if a treatment plant
design is based on volume estimates

83
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,127
for the current demand

84
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:21,593
for example current emptying
practices in a community

85
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,923
what is going to happen when
a treatment plant opens?

86
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:27,892
The current demand will
immediately increase

87
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:30,765
because now there is
a legal an convenient option

88
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:33,073
for the disposal of fecal sludge.

89
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:36,043
As it's frequently been observed,
this means as soon as

90
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:39,937
the treatment plant opens,
it will already be under capacity.

91
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:44,555
This is why it is important
to evaluate the current demand

92
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:47,738
but also the future demand,
which is based on

93
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:51,015
the total fecal sludge
accumulation. 

94
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:56,208
So if we cannot precisely calculate
rates of fecal sludge accumulation

95
00:04:56,386 --> 00:04:59,711
in containment technologies,
how could we estimate them

96
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,847
with the current lack of records?

97
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:05,663
One way could be to survey
a select representation

98
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:09,180
of the city wide distribution
during emptying operations. 

99
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:11,209
You could ask
the household questions

100
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:14,192
like when did they last have
their containment emptied

101
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,972
how often do they have it emptied

102
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,537
how many people use it,
what is the containment volume

103
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:22,717
was it full, was it fully emptied?

104
00:05:22,938 --> 00:05:26,088
You could simultaneously ask
the emptying service provider

105
00:05:26,254 --> 00:05:28,416
if they full empty the containment

106
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:32,183
if their truck is full or barrels
with the manual emptier

107
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,707
the truck volume
and emptying practices

108
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,317
like did they add water
while emptying and how much.

109
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:43,782
Based on the possible answers
with the emptying frequency

110
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,977
you can then estimate
accumulation rates.

111
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:51,119
Depending on the infrastructure
in your city or community

112
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:54,551
estimates like this will be
easier or more complicated.

113
00:05:54,797 --> 00:05:58,422
For example if a community is
all on septic tanks

114
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,665
built at a similar time
with a similar design

115
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:05,950
with regularly scheduled emptying
and equatable water usage

116
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:10,176
then sludge accumulation could
also be estimated based on factors

117
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,285
such as influent COD
and hydraulic retention time.

118
00:06:14,903 --> 00:06:18,216
Or in a small town with
similarly sized pit latrines

119
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,801
and usage habits, like whether
or not there's household water

120
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,487
estimates will also be more similar.

121
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,955
Other difficulties with estimating

122
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:29,612
future demand for
fecal sludge management

123
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:33,501
include rapid urbanization
and rapidly growing cities

124
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,417
commuting populations,
meaning many cities

125
00:06:36,587 --> 00:06:38,650
actually double in size
during the day

126
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,878
with people who come in for work

127
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,199
and another important consideration

128
00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:45,393
the people frequently
do not consider

129
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:48,363
is non-household
sources of fecal sludge

130
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:49,924
from commercial enterprises

131
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,840
like restaurants, hotels,
public toilets

132
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,687
toilets for employees of factories,
the commuting population

133
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:00,256
depending on the context
this could easily be half

134
00:07:00,414 --> 00:07:03,639
of all the fecal sludge that
is delivered to treatment.

135
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,019
What can be done
to improve estimations

136
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:08,794
of quantities in the future?

137
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:11,786
The implementation
of data management.

138
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:14,817
For example,
instituting a GPS database

139
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,713
of all existing on-site technologies

140
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:22,388
and maintaining GPS-based records
of how often and the volumes

141
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,353
when they are emptied.

142
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,546
And one more very important point.

143
00:07:27,737 --> 00:07:31,124
Quantities of fecal sludge
can not be considered

144
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,891
without simultaneously
considering characteristics

145
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,618
because as we know,
fecal sludge is highly variable.

146
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:43,286
This is especially important when
designing treatment plants

147
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,403
as on a mass balance basis,
the concentrations can have

148
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:51,615
as much to do with loading
of treatment plants as volumes do.

149
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,336
Setting up a sampling plant

150
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,831
for fully understanding
city-wide characteristics

151
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:02,256
can be just as or even much more
complicated than quantification.

152
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,195
Some of our unpublished research
indicates that one way to do this

153
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:08,736
could be through
designing sampling plants

154
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:11,903
based on spatially
available demographic data.

155
00:08:12,245 --> 00:08:15,245
So stay tuned for further results.

156
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:19,009
In summary, in this module
you've learned about the importance

157
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:22,634
of estimating quantities
of fecal sludge  for designing

158
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:25,219
