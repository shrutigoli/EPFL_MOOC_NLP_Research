1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
In this video, we are going to talk about tridimensional trusses.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,550
We will see that these structures are very interesting,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,640
but that they bring some difficulties because of their nodes.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,960
I will show you some quite exciting examples of structures

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,400
which use tridimensional trusses.

6
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:21,437
The structure here on the right is familiar to the students of EPFL,

7
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:25,407
since this is the typical structure of the elements of EPFL

8
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:27,997
built during the first stage of construction.

9
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:31,644
The principle is quite simple.

10
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:36,214
If we have here a column which gives us a support reaction,

11
00:00:40,112 --> 00:00:43,972
this column will induce a compressive force

12
00:00:43,972 --> 00:00:47,692
on the four bars which it supports.

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:50,198
So that would be here.

14
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,569
And here.

15
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:55,746
So these four bars are in compression.

16
00:00:55,746 --> 00:00:59,736
To have an horizontal equilibrium, it is then necessary

17
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:03,576
to have tension at the upper level.

18
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:08,596
This is the basic principle of the support elements.

19
00:01:08,596 --> 00:01:10,856
So here, we have tension.

20
00:01:10,856 --> 00:01:15,656
The rest of the structure essentially behaves as a truss.

21
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:21,304
So the next diagonal is going to be in tension,

22
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:24,384
the one after in compression, and so forth,

23
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,594
till the middle of the span.

24
00:01:26,594 --> 00:01:32,474
The upper part, the upper chord, is going to be in compression.

25
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:36,474
And the lower chord in tension.

26
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:42,019
This is a bit more complicated than what you have seen in two dimensions,

27
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,679
but the principles are the same.

28
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:46,809
And we could, we are not going to do it, but we could develop

29
00:01:46,809 --> 00:01:49,979
a graphical statics similar to the one we have seen,

30
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,689
but in three dimensions.

31
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:56,882
Here on the left, you can see two variants of the same principle:

32
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:59,862
on the bottom, the system such as it is used at EPFL,

33
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:02,622
with always an outflank beyond the columns,

34
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,692
then, above, a system which never outflanks

35
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:10,082
so which exactly covers the surface delimited by the four columns.

36
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:15,812
This system can also be applied for bridges

37
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:19,812
with the same principles: a tensioned lower chord,

38
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:25,521
compressed upper chords,

39
00:02:26,805 --> 00:02:31,585
and diagonals which are alternately tensioned and compressed.

40
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:38,618
I am maybe going to copy it here, on the bridge.

41
00:02:39,717 --> 00:02:42,467
So the lower chord is in tension.

42
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:46,097
Here, these diagonals are in tension.

43
00:02:47,227 --> 00:02:50,767
So the upper chord is in compression.

44
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:55,754
And then these diagonals here too.

45
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:00,722
This is a very pretty system which is used for this bridge in Lully,

46
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,642
in the canton of Fribourg, with a concrete deck

47
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:08,382
for the vehicles, absolutely classic.

48
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:13,053
Here, a structure which is much less classic, a geodesic dome.

49
00:03:13,053 --> 00:03:15,853
This is the invention of Mr Buckminster Fuller,

50
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:17,883
whose we can see the same, on the bottom.

51
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:23,803
He propagated this type of very interesting structures.

52
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:28,663
This cover of the building of the United States for the Universal Exhibition

53
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:32,263
in Montreal in 1967 is actually not a cover.

54
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:35,253
It is only an open truss.

55
00:03:35,253 --> 00:03:39,343
The real building is behind the trees, inside the dome.

56
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,053
A particularity of these geodesic domes

57
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:46,653
is that they are mainly constituted of hexagons.

58
00:03:49,743 --> 00:03:51,253
There are a lot of hexagons,

59
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:55,853
such as the ones you can see on the surface of a soccer balloon.

60
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:03,111
In some places, it is necessary to introduce not hexagons,

61
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:05,311
but pentagons.

62
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,879
I have not noticed others in this part here,

63
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:12,788
but there are some on this entire dome.

64
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:15,999
I have not any other photos to show it, but

65
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:19,999
this dome is obviously made of tridimensional elements.

66
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:23,189
It is not only curved, but it has a certain thickness,

67
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:25,719
made with tridimensional elements.

68
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:35,526
A problem with this type of structure: the nodes turn out to be very complex.

69
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,816
And the lengths of the bars are highly variable.

70
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:45,636
This is why this Mero system, that is a brand among others,

71
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:51,846
has been developped with standardized spherical links.

72
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:55,166
They have a certain number of threaded holes.

73
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,636
They enable, look at the scheme in the bottom left-hand corner,

74
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:02,776
to add a certain number of bars, not using all the holes,

75
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:07,256
but without being obliged to make nodes to measure.

76
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:14,102
On the right, we can see on the bottom a detail of one of these Mero type spheres,

77
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:18,102
with metalic elements for the connexion, and timber elements.

78
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:23,402
This is used for a small cover of a pedestrian pathway

79
00:05:23,402 --> 00:05:26,752
at ETH, in Zurich.

80
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:34,924
The fact that these structures are composed of trusses,

81
00:05:34,924 --> 00:05:37,274
that is to say that they are not very heavy,

82
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,344
and that on the other hand they can cover surfaces,

83
00:05:40,344 --> 00:05:43,984
makes that they are often used for large dimensions structures.

84
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:48,524
On the left, the cover of a stadium in Saoudia Arabia,

85
00:05:48,524 --> 00:05:56,714
created with tridimensional trusses, covered by membranes which ensure

86
00:05:56,714 --> 00:06:01,114
a protection against the sun, this is the only function of this roof.

87
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:03,724
But it must also obviously resist wind.

88
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:12,647
On the right, the Globe Arena in Stockholm, an entertainement structure,

89
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:15,250
in which entertainement activities take place,

90
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,013
created on the basis of the same principle, with one difference:

91
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:26,313
till now, all the solutions were based on hexagons,

92
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:32,213
and actually triangles, here, the solution is based on rectangles.

93
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:35,763
So it is possible to do it. It is a bit more complicated,

94
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:38,833
since actually they are not exactly rectangles.

95
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:42,813
They rather are trapeziums which become smaller

96
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,453
gradually when we move towards the top of the structure.

97
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:50,193
The dimensions of the facade elements had to be adapted,

98
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:53,413
we can see it well on the pictures on the top which shows the completed structure.

99
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:01,520
Here, again a project a bit more radical, the Eden Project in Cornwall,

100
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,810
in Great Britain. These are huge greenhouses

101
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:08,471
which are sheltered under geodesic domes.

102
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,132
Since they are geodesic domes,

103
00:07:11,132 --> 00:07:16,322
we can recognize, in some places, that there are pentagons.

104
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,939
Here, there is a pentagon for example.

105
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:24,207
And here there is another one.

106
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:28,857
While most of the covers are constituted,

107
00:07:28,857 --> 00:07:32,137
in a classic way, of hexagons.

108
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:38,546
On the left, a connexion sphere system. This is not the same system.

109
00:07:38,546 --> 00:07:43,246
We can see that the holes have been drilled where bars arrive.

110
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:50,536
The cover is constituted of a double-membrane made by light plastic,

111
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,666
filled with air under pressure.

112
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,126
There is always an air pressure which is brought,

113
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:58,986
in such a way that it is used as insulation.

114
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,400
Here, a view of the inside where we can notice the presence of a tridimensional truss.

115
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
And we can also notice the presence of a palm tree,

116
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,570
which means that this greenhouse satisfactorily works,

117
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,070
since it is located in Great Britain,

118
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,130
a place where the palm trees do not naturally grow.

119
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,080
Finally, to talk about spatial trusses, let's take an interest into the space station.

120
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,250
If we zoom in on the space station, we can quickly figure out

121
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,930
that there are tridimensional truss elements.

122
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,090
Here, this is a module which is not liveable, since it is exposed,

123
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:44,400
but all the rest of the station, such as these parts here,

124
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,480
where the astronauts live, are built on the same principle.

125
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,380
Why?

126
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,740
Because it is an external structure which offers strength,

127
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,360
it is just necessary to close it for it to offer in addition,

128
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,160
a liveable zone for the astronauts.

129
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Why use trusses for the space station?

130
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,410
Because they are the most efficient types of structures,

131
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,870
and which thus require the least weight possible to be put into orbit.

132
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:19,925
In this lecture, we have seen real tridimensional structures

133
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:24,745
which use the three dimensions of space to create trusses.

134
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:28,505
We have seen that they are interesting structures but which require

135
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:31,635
particular nodes, as well as construction details,

136
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,345
and variable bar lengths.

137
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:38,345
However, they offer a large freedom for the design of structures,

138
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:41,715
particularly for the large dimensions structures.
