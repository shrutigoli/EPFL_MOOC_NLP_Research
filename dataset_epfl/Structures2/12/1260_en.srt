00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
Hello, in this video, we will deal with truss grids,

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,493
which are the first extension in three dimensions

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:12,755
of truss structures.

4
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:19,474
Of course, real structures are always tridimensional.

5
00:00:19,806 --> 00:00:22,273
When we create a truss, that is for example

6
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:26,803
to use it as the roof of a factory, as the cover of a garage,

7
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:30,488
or maybe as the load-bearing system of a bridge crossing a river.

8
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,362
In every instance, the structure that we are going to use

9
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:34,885
is tridimensional.

10
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:39,756
The question is: &quot;how can we move from 2D to 3D for trusses?&quot;.

11
00:00:39,756 --> 00:00:42,619
And in this video, we will see that we can do it

12
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,313
by juxtaposition of trusses or by crossing of trusses.

13
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:57,832
Here is the plan of the entire course &quot;The Art of Structures&quot;.

14
00:00:57,832 --> 00:01:01,934
Of course for you, in &quot;The Art of Structures II&quot;,

15
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:05,904
we started with the subject of trusses,

16
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:10,907
but after having entirely visited the subject of trusses,

17
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:16,667
we want to go here, below, the transition to the third dimension,

18
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:22,718
where we will look at various solutions, before moving to the next topic of the course.

19
00:01:24,248 --> 00:01:29,954
The first solution to create a tridimensional surface,

20
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:32,605
to cover a surface by trusses,

21
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,441
is simply to juxtapose these trusses.

22
00:01:35,441 --> 00:01:38,677
So here I have a first truss.

23
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:48,358
Then I create a second one next to it, which is exactly the same,

24
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:52,829
then a third one, and so forth.

25
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,764
Obviously, that is not enough to cover the space.

26
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:08,690
Afterwards, it is necessary to introduce a secondary load-bearing system

27
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:16,235
which is going to be used to support the roof elements.

28
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:24,874
If we look at the example here on the right,this is the roof of the Lausanne's station,

29
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:31,519
we have roof-shaped trusses,

30
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,004
with a slightly variable depth in the upper part,

31
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:40,592
but we can clearly identify trusses,

32
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,234
and we have a series of these trusses

33
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:49,243
which are relatively spaced from one another.

34
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:55,067
And between these trusses, we can recognize other trusses,

35
00:02:55,067 --> 00:03:02,924
- here we can very clearly see them, here too, also here -

36
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:11,615
and then between these trusses, to have a complete load-bearing system,

37
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:16,040
we are going to add secondary load-bearing elements,

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,267
-we can see them well in this zone where there is the roof-

39
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:27,849
secondary load-bearing elements and then, finally, tertiary load-bearing elements,

40
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:36,474
here, until we manage to carry

41
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:40,014
the glass panels, and here the roof.

42
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:45,572
So we first have a juxtaposition system,

43
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:49,898
then we add secondary and tertiary elements, etc.,

44
00:03:49,898 --> 00:03:53,522
until we can finally install the roof.

45
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:02,325
So, this is not really a tridimensional system,

46
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,044
I would call this system a &quot;2D+ system&quot;.

47
00:04:06,044 --> 00:04:09,153
That is clearly something which fulfils a 3D function

48
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:13,360
but where the structure itself is not tridimensional,

49
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:18,973
this is a juxtaposition, a superimposition of structures

50
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:22,161
which are in one direction, then in the other, and so forth,

51
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,789
a certain number of trusses and then other types of structures.

52
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:32,663
Here we have a solution which is closer to 3D,

53
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:38,304
where we have two families of beams, the first one which I draw in orange,

54
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:43,597
they are beams which are supported by two supports,

55
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:45,303
simple beams, so;

56
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:50,080
and then, in the other direction, in the same plane,

57
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,838
and with the same depth, the same importance,

58
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:55,438
the same capacity to carry loads,

59
00:04:55,438 --> 00:05:00,440
we have beams in the perpendicular direction.

60
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,251
These green beams,

61
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:09,707
unlike the pink beams of the previous drawing,

62
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:16,790
they really have the same dimension, a comparable load-bearing capacity.

63
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,705
Let's now look at what happens

64
00:05:21,705 --> 00:05:29,986
when I apply a load Q here, in the middle of this system,

65
00:05:29,986 --> 00:05:36,156
the load can decide to go in the direction of the green beam,

66
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:40,355
or in the direction of the orange beam.

67
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:43,594
If the spans and the dimensions of the cross-sections are exactly

68
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:45,739
the same in both directions,

69
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:54,607
then we can say that the internal forces are divided by two.

70
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,439
So I put, &quot;under conditions&quot;, since, I just said it,

71
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,559
that supposes that the spans are the same,

72
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,736
that there are supports everywhere, etc.

73
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:11,103
If we go on with this reasoning, when the load which left here

74
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:13,914
in the direction of the green beam, reaches this point,

75
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:16,488
there is again an intersection where it can decide

76
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,203
to keep going in the direction of the green beam,

77
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:22,697
or to go in the direction of the orange beam.

78
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:30,142
Likewise, if the load keeps going in the direction of the green beam,

79
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:32,070
it will reach the support;

80
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:34,719
if, however, it goes in the direction of the orange beam,

81
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,368
it will reach again another intersection, where it will be able to decide

82
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:43,614
wheter to go in the direction of the green beam, or to keep going in the direction of the orange beam.

83
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:45,582
And so forth.

84
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:53,567
These movements are similar to the ones of a tower in a chess game,

85
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:58,067
which moves in this way.

86
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:08,832
On the right, we have a similar system, but instead of having placed supports

87
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:11,598
at the end of all the beams,

88
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:17,473
there are only supports at the end of beams which are on the edge.

89
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:26,130
This is really advantageous for the use, since there are much less obstacles

90
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,427
for people who would like to take a walk under this structure,

91
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:32,472
or for the vehicles which would pass under,

92
00:07:32,472 --> 00:07:36,126
or for the machines which we would like to install.

93
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,691
However, there is indeed a higher complexity.

94
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:44,317
So here I have two families of beams, the orange beams and the green beams,

95
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:48,355
these orange and green edge beams are supported,

96
00:07:48,355 --> 00:07:53,725
the other beams are indirectly supported,

97
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,114
leaning on, respectively,

98
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:59,206
for the orange beams, the green beams,

99
00:07:59,206 --> 00:08:02,516
or conversely for the green beams, on the orange beams.

100
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:09,256
Let's now look at what happens for my load Q,

101
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:12,632
that I place again in the middle of the structure.

102
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:16,493
Well, from this point here, it will indeed be able to decide

103
00:08:16,493 --> 00:08:20,618
whether to move onto the green beam or onto the orange beam,

104
00:08:20,618 --> 00:08:26,197
at the intersections, it will also be able to decide to keep going;

105
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:31,046
however, when it will arrive here, on the edge, there is no support,

106
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:35,341
so the load will have to be carried over by the orange beam.

107
00:08:35,898 --> 00:08:44,771
If the load passed by here, so likewise, when it will arrive here,

108
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:48,720
it will have to be carried over by the orange beam.

109
00:08:50,431 --> 00:09:03,450
So for this type of trusses, each load is carried twice.

110
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:08,043
That is logical, before we had beams

111
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:11,093
which were spanning in one direction and which could find a support,

112
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,469
now we go in one direction, we do not find any supports,

113
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:15,929
we must go in the other direction;

114
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,940
or if we use the other route, that is the same thing.

115
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,585
So the internal forces will rather be larger.

116
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:31,669
Like before, the displacement is the one of a tower in a chess game.

117
00:09:33,794 --> 00:09:37,674
We still did not reach a real tridimensional system,

118
00:09:37,771 --> 00:09:42,446
I call this kind of solution &quot;2.5D&quot; solutions.

119
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,684
There is admittedly a behavior

120
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:48,522
in which the orange beams cannot not work without the green beams,

121
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:51,003
especially because at the end of these orange beams,

122
00:09:51,003 --> 00:09:53,990
there is a green beam to carry them and vice versa,

123
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,293
but however loads always follow a preferred route,

124
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:04,113
either in the direction of the orange beams, either in the direction of the green beams.

125
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,936
Here we have an example of this type of construction.

126
00:10:08,936 --> 00:10:12,404
That is the USM factory in Münsinger, in Switzerland,

127
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:18,577
where we have here the orange edge beams,

128
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:22,220
which are supported by posts;

129
00:10:23,938 --> 00:10:27,013
the green edge beams,

130
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,882
which are also supported by posts;

131
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:38,649
and then the orange intermediate beams, there are two,

132
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:43,924
we cannot see them well, the second one especially;

133
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:51,977
and then the green intermediate beams, and there are also two.

134
00:10:57,062 --> 00:11:01,880
Otherwise, we can notice that this truss is a truss with N-shaped diagonals in tension,

135
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,111
which is why this structure is very transparent.

136
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:09,045
Here we have a structure which is much more complex,

137
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:13,027
that is the Palexpo exhibition hall, in Geneva.

138
00:11:13,027 --> 00:11:18,637
It is in particular used every year for the Geneva car show.

139
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:23,371
The interest of this hall, is that it only has a very few posts,

140
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:27,982
here you have a post and the others are almost out of sight.

141
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:30,499
And you can see that it creates a very long distance,

142
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:35,017
which enables at once to place the cars quite freely,

143
00:11:35,017 --> 00:11:40,315
and to avoid the visitors having to skirt all the time

144
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:42,202
walls, columns, partitions.

145
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,855
Here we have a picture of the construction of this hall,

146
00:11:46,855 --> 00:11:53,135
and we can clearly recognize trusses which go in on direction

147
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:56,646
and others, in the other direction.

148
00:11:56,646 --> 00:12:02,352
On this cross-section, we can only see the orange truss,

149
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:07,552
the other one is perpendicular to it, we cannot see it.

150
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:14,374
This cross-section has been made in the same state than above.

151
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:22,019
Afterwards, the structure has been raised up and set down onto these pillars

152
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:28,346
to offer a large free area for the exhibitions.

153
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:30,707
If we look on the right,

154
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:35,209
that is not easy to recognize these structures,

155
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,818
because the roof is very dark.

156
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:42,873
We can however recognize a truss which goes in this direction,

157
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:48,617
and then we can guess other trusses which go in this direction.

158
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:52,635
But that is very difficult to clearly identify them.

159
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:55,309
The interest of this type of structure,

160
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:59,359
is that it provides us with a wide range of possibilities for the use,

161
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:04,154
there are also sport events which are organized inside these halls

162
00:13:04,154 --> 00:13:06,645
which offer a very large flexibility.

163
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:11,820
In this course about grids of trusses, we have seen how,

164
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,856
thanks to a juxtaposition or a crossing of trusses,

165
00:13:15,856 --> 00:13:20,558
it is possible to move from two to three dimensions,

166
00:13:20,558 --> 00:13:26,372
or at least to create structures which cover tridimensional surfaces.

167
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:30,551
In the next video, we will see real solutions

168
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,412
of tridimensional trusses.
