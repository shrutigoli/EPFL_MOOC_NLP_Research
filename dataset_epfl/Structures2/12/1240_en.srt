00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:03,661
Hello. In this video, we are going to deal with truss towers and cantilevers,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,570
particularly with bracing systems.

3
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,822
What is a bracing ?

4
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:12,236
That is a structural system,

5
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:16,237
so a structure,

6
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:23,706
which is used to resist forces

7
00:00:23,706 --> 00:00:25,450
- initially wind bracings are used

8
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,540
to resist the wind. - Generally, we can call bracings

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:34,256
all the systems which enable to resist horizontal forces.

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:39,222
It means, the wind on the building, such as this one here,

11
00:00:39,226 --> 00:00:43,377
we have wind which can act at every level.

12
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:47,329
The wind is stronger on the top, and weaker on the bottom,

13
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:48,860
but it acts in all the directions,

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,138
and obviously, it can also act in the other direction.

15
00:00:52,138 --> 00:00:55,917
So the system must be able to resist forces

16
00:00:55,921 --> 00:00:59,031
which, indeed, act in all the directions.

17
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:03,297
In this video, we will make some considerations about the shape and the type

18
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:05,385
that bracings can take.

19
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:07,346
We will see how they are integrated

20
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:11,494
inside buildings, and we will calculate some internal forces

21
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:14,022
for particular types.

22
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:16,745
In this structure, the John Hancok Center in Chicago,

23
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:19,916
- Chicago is known as the Windy City -

24
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,493
it is very important to be able to resist wind forces,

25
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:25,161
and what kind of structure can we recognize here ?

26
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,794
Well, we recognize a truss.

27
00:01:27,794 --> 00:01:33,108
If I say that the loads act at the level of the nodes in this way,

28
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:37,162
- well, I know, it is almost a constant depth truss -

29
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:40,840
I will have tension in this element,

30
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,939
I will have compression

31
00:01:46,939 --> 00:01:49,771
in these elements, in these diagonals,

32
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,326
as well as in the chord here,

33
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:57,508
and then, I will also have tension

34
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,349
in these diagonals.

35
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,116
Of course, the consideration would completely be reversed

36
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,499
if the internal forces were acting in the other direction.

37
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:09,620
So, it means that these elements must be able

38
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,964
to resist tension and compression as well.

39
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:17,349
We can see on this picture of the structure how these diagonals have been integrated 

40
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,259
in the global architecture of the structure.

41
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:26,456
Obviously, some people have their window behind one of these diagonals,

42
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:30,108
but they appreciate this building anyway, but to be able to do this,

43
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:36,200
the facade of the building must be flat, more or less of constant depth,

44
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,876
and then, without any recesses or particularities.

45
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:43,930
This is a solution which is possible, but which is actually not very common,

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,021
precisely because of these limitations.

47
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:48,487
We have here a building which is more creative, we can see it here on the right,

48
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,533
this building is the Library Tower in Los Angeles,

49
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,819
where we have constant part,

50
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,041
and elements which are gradually withdrawn.

51
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,564
So, we have a structure, which is not constant,

52
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:04,249
and furthermore, it is circular with a shape which is a bit softened.

53
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:07,743
That is impossible to place a system of diagonals

54
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:11,591
or of chords in these facades.

55
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,206
So, how did we proceed ?

56
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:17,527
We have introduced a core.

57
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,870
That is this element here, which is located in the middle of the structure.

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:32,649
Inside the core here, we typically place elevators,

59
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,515
but also pipes and other types of ducts 

60
00:03:40,515 --> 00:03:42,900
to bring or to evacuate fluids.

61
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,993
We can also place some elevators inside.

62
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,460
What type of structure can we see here ?

63
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:55,650
We can see here vertical chords.

64
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,977
That is quite easy to see them.

65
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:05,476
And we can see a truss with K-shaped diagonals.

66
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:10,213
We can see that these K-shaped diagonals are a bit particular,

67
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:15,234
because that is not really a K, it is a kind of U or V

68
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:17,150
which is a bit open.

69
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,759
Why do we do that ?

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,520
Because, in this way, we gave ourselves the freedom to create doors.

71
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:28,469
- Here, that is a high building - I have said that we could

72
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,140
put elevators in the cores.

73
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,610
It is necessary to be able to enter in the elevators,

74
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,144
so, creating this truss with quite particular K-shaped diagonals,

75
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:41,984
we can enter in the core to reach the elevators, the stairs,

76
00:04:41,984 --> 00:04:45,210
and the other facilities which are inside the core.

77
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,715
The whole being a large truss system which resists the horizontal loads.

78
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,609
In this video, you can see the construction of a truss cantilever.

79
00:04:55,609 --> 00:05:02,143
It is fixed on a column on the left. Then, I place two loads,

80
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:05,580
and then a third load to have 20 Newtons

81
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,255
at the end of the cantilver

82
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:10,998
and 10 Newtons on the intermediate node.

83
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:17,620
If we want to solve this structure with the applet,

84
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,214
it is absolutely possible to place a load of 10 Newtons here,

85
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,281
and then, a load of 20 Newtons at the end of the cantilever,

86
00:05:30,814 --> 00:05:33,509
and to obtain the resolution.

87
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,410
Here, we can see that the upper chord is rectilinear

88
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,652
- we directly obtain the internal force here -

89
00:05:39,652 --> 00:05:43,232
and then the lower chord is curved.

90
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:47,901
You remember the method used to directly obtain the internal forces:

91
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:50,803
we could isolate this node to obtain these internal forces

92
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,381
(on the basis of these internal forces here),

93
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:55,703
but we are simply going to do it using a free-body.

94
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:58,731
We are going to proceed to the complete analysis of this structure.

95
00:05:59,435 --> 00:06:02,031
I am first going to number the nodes.

96
00:06:03,218 --> 00:06:06,806
One, two, three, four and five.

97
00:06:07,352 --> 00:06:11,965
I am going to start by looking at the free-body

98
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:14,455
around the node five.

99
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:17,865
This free-body is subjected to a load of 20 Newtons:

100
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:21,809
I haved already indicated it in the course's supports,

101
00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:23,406
that you also have.

102
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:25,203
This is a load of 20 Newtons.

103
00:06:25,203 --> 00:06:29,238
Then, we are going to obtain the internal force in the bar three-five.

104
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:34,431
This internal force goes leftwards, so that is a tensile internal force.

105
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:41,498
Here we have a tensile internal force.

106
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:47,970
Then, the internal force in four-five which goes up

107
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,865
towards the beginning of the force of 20 Newtons.

108
00:06:56,865 --> 00:07:01,225
That is a compressive internal force.

109
00:07:01,225 --> 00:07:06,754
Here is the contribution of the node five to the global equilibrium.

110
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:13,414
We take an interest in the node four, which is an unloaded node.

111
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:20,899
This node is subjected to the internal force in four-five in the other direction,

112
00:07:21,368 --> 00:07:25,341
then to the internal force in three-four to go up,

113
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,178
so that is a tensile internal force,

114
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,843
three-four is in tension,

115
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:41,925
then we come back to the beginning of four-five thanks to the internal force in one-four,

116
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,137
which is a compressive internal force.

117
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,545
Here is the contribution of the node four to the Cremona diagram.

118
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:06,627
We now take an interest in the node three with the load of 10 Newtons.

119
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:12,383
This node is subjected to the internal force in three-four in the other direction,

120
00:08:12,383 --> 00:08:17,868
to the internal force in three-five in the other direction,

121
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:21,961
to the load of 10 Newtons,

122
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:31,328
then to the internal force in two-three,

123
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,383
which is a tensile internal force,

124
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,878
and to the internal force in one-four,

125
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,542
which is a compressive internal force.

126
00:08:55,197 --> 00:09:02,165
Here is the contribution of the node three to the Cremona diagram.

127
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:09,259
So we can see that with the classic tools of the resolution of trusses,

128
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:15,523
we obtain methods which are very similar to the ones we have already studied

129
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:18,264
to obtain the internal forces.

130
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,120
We can also notice that

131
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,198
that if we look at the arch-cable,

132
00:09:29,364 --> 00:09:34,403
certain of the rules which we had already determined,

133
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,710
that is to say...

134
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:46,687
that the chord which is on the side of the cable is in tension,

135
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:50,751
while the one which is on the side of the arch is in compression.

136
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:54,782
We can see that this rule is still verified.

137
00:09:54,782 --> 00:10:01,180
We can also see that if the inclination of the diagonals looks like the one of the arch,

138
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,314
then they are in compression, while if it is opposite,

139
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:07,510
it is in tension. So, the things we have seen

140
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,501
for the constant height trusses are valid for truss cantilevers.

141
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:17,649
Here, we have an example of cantilever, of big cantilever,

142
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:24,260
with an approximately 50 meters long span in Geneva for the Hall 6 of Palexpo.

143
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:30,725
We can notice that we have diagonals which are sometimes simply N-shaped,

144
00:10:30,725 --> 00:10:32,311
and some other times X-shaped.

145
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:33,607
Why this ?

146
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:37,937
Because, because of this exhibition, this cantilever is outside,

147
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,728
it is possible to have large wind loads

148
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,299
which can lead to reversals of the internal forces,

149
00:10:43,299 --> 00:10:47,422
that is a bit similar to what happens for a high-rise building.

150
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:55,346
Here is a particular example of cantilever designed by the architect Norman Foster.

151
00:10:55,732 --> 00:11:01,832
We can see a structural system in the central part of a building,

152
00:11:01,832 --> 00:11:06,051
here, with several stories, we have elements in tension.

153
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:10,950
That is to say that all these floors are going to be carried by the central part

154
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,944
by means of these elements in tension. These elements are going to go up

155
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:20,074
into a system, which looks a bit like a crane,

156
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,341
and then to go down in tension on this side here.

157
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:29,145
Likewise, on the other side, we have elements in tension which go down,

158
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:36,813
it occurs at every level where it is necessary.

159
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:42,312
Of course, for it to be in equilibrium, we must have compression

160
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,959
all along, in these elements.

161
00:11:47,438 --> 00:11:51,845
Then, these columns here are also in compression.

162
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:56,660
So, why this system ?

163
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:00,386
This system is quite complex, it is not often used,

164
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:06,480
but it is interesting in this context, because the wish of the architect

165
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:12,650
was to create large free areas. Here, we have this at several levels.

166
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,963
These are zones where there are no supports or doors,

167
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:21,976
but we can have internal yards or restaurants, with little gardens,

168
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:26,668
so a big freedom. Instead of having a very high building

169
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:31,922
- we are located at 30 or 40 stories over a garden or a patio -

170
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:37,461
here, no, we are located at a few stories, it is just necessary to go down of a few stories

171
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:40,863
to reach a more open area.

172
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:43,594
In this lecture about truss towers and cantilevers,

173
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:48,259
we have seen some examples of shapes and types of bracings:

174
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,751
visible bracings on the facade, bracings located inside,

175
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,122
integrated in what we call cores.

176
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:58,429
We have seen how to determine the internal forces

177
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,710
in this type of truss bracings.

178
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,657
We have seen that the rules which we had already established,

179
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:07,429
particularly about the sign of the internal forces for the trusses,

180
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:11,240
still apply to the trusses in cantilever.
