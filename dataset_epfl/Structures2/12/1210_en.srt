00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:02,967
Hello. In this video and the ones which will follow,

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:06,599
we are going to look at the typology of trussees with a constant.

3
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:10,040
There are several videos, because the amount of matter is significant,

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,275
but you will see, they are rather simple.

5
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,358
There will be an introduction in this video,

6
00:00:14,358 --> 00:00:16,774
and a conclusion at the end of the last video,

7
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:19,079
so there will not be any intermediate conclusions.

8
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:21,683
Concerning the typology of trusses with a constant depth,

9
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:24,120
we will see what are the possible configurations;

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,660
since these trusses have a constant depth,

11
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,711
the chords -- there are not a lot of variants,

12
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,951
however, we will see that we can have diverse types of diagonals.

13
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,640
We will check if these structures are statically determinate,

14
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:36,705
-- most of them are, but not all --

15
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,914
we will look a the sign of the internal forces in the chords

16
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,822
and in the diagonals,

17
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,330
and then we will make some comments

18
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,816
about the amplitude of the internal forces, where the internal forces are maximum,

19
00:00:46,816 --> 00:00:47,577
for example.

20
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:50,791
We will start by the trusses with V-shaped diagonals,

21
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:53,902
which we have already seen quite a long time before,

22
00:00:53,946 --> 00:00:56,116
let's check that this structure is statically determinate,

23
00:00:56,147 --> 00:01:00,268
I am not going to do it for all of them, but... here, we have two forces at the support,

24
00:01:00,572 --> 00:01:04,384
and here we have one, three in total,

25
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:07,486
to which we are going to add the number of bars:

26
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:11,689
(counts the bar till 31)

27
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:41,668
Now, we are going to count the nodes:

28
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,444
(counts the nodes till 17)

29
00:01:57,687 --> 00:02:03,969
2 times 17 is equals to 34, which is equal to 3+31, therefore this structure is statically determinate.

30
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:12,942
As we have seen it before, when the heigth of the arch above the cable is maximal,

31
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:17,191
the internal forces in the upper and lower chords are maximal too.

32
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,124
Likewise, when the inclination of the arch is the largest,

33
00:02:20,124 --> 00:02:22,943
that is to say near the supports for the loads which we have applied here,

34
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:26,354
the internal force in the diagonals, both in compression and in tension,

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,164
is maximal.

36
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:32,241
Here is another layout of truss with V-shaped diagonals;

37
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:36,582
the truss is lower because it is located underneath the supports.

38
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:40,343
The observations which I have made before are still valid

39
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,055
-- of course, the structure is statically determinate --

40
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:47,029
the maximum internal forces in the chords are in the middle of the span,

41
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:51,376
and the maximum internal forces in the diagonals are near the supports.

42
00:02:52,065 --> 00:02:56,226
Please note that the sign convention remains valid, that is to say that the diagonals which have

43
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:59,948
an inclination similar to the one of the arch are in compression,

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,852
the others are in tension.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,764
Below, we have a variant of the layout of this truss,

46
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:08,555
in which we have added additional vertical elements.

47
00:03:08,682 --> 00:03:12,489
The interest of these additional elements is to enable to introduce more loads.

48
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:13,961
You can see that the loads are also smaller,

49
00:03:13,963 --> 00:03:16,353
but since there are twice more, it gives us the same total load,

50
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:21,376
because otherwise, it is necessary to carry over the load till the adjacent nodes;

51
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,762
-- in trusses, we cannot apply loads anywhere else than on the nodes --

52
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:28,978
and then it creates a complication, it requires secondary elements,

53
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,703
about which we do not talk here, which are more significant.

54
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,956
So this solution, here, to add vertical elements,

55
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,408
is quite interesting.

56
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:38,050
I am not going to do the calculation,

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,884
but I can tell you because I did it not that long ago:

58
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:47,479
we have three support conditions, plus 47 bars,

59
00:03:47,884 --> 00:03:51,936
which is equal to two times 25 nodes,

60
00:03:52,051 --> 00:03:55,522
therefore this structure is also statically determinate.

61
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:04,562
In what we have already seen before, there are also trusses with N-shaped diagonals;

62
00:04:05,014 --> 00:04:10,244
we have two configurations, this one in which the diagonals are in tension,

63
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:19,530
because they are systematically placed in the opposite direction to the shape of the arch

64
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,718
thus all these diagonals are in tension, here.

65
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:32,756
And then we have, here, this configuration,

66
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,402
in which all the diagonals are in compression;

67
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:42,680
these diagonals, here, are in compression

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:49,527
since they follow the shape of the arch, while the posts

69
00:04:51,027 --> 00:04:52,418
are in tension.

70
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:59,348
Maybe there is no internal force in the middle post.

71
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,096
How do we choose between both configurations ?

72
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:04,579
Well, if I quickly come back to this configuration...

73
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,031
here, the posts are in compression, I am quickly going to draw them...

74
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,587
In this case, the longest elements are in tension,

75
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:17,139
this is a configuration which is suitable for the steel structures,

76
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,769
since this material can accept strong tensile internal forces,

77
00:05:20,773 --> 00:05:23,858
however, there are some problems with compression;

78
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,986
and shorter the elements are, the better they can resist compression.

79
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,855
So here, this is an ideal solution,

80
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,690
because the long elements are in tension,

81
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,195
the shorter elements, the posts, are in compression.

82
00:05:33,195 --> 00:05:38,598
Conversely, here, especially if we look at this structure which is from the 17th century:

83
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,436
we had not much steel,

84
00:05:41,436 --> 00:05:44,709
so we try to make the elements in tension as short as possible,

85
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:48,196
however, the compression can be taken by timber elements,

86
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,720
which resist well to this type of internal force.

87
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:53,740
In the next videos, we will continue to explore

88
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,569
the various possibilities of typology for trusse with a constant depth.
