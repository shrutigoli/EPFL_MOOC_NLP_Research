00:00:03,473 --> 00:00:05,961
Hello. In this video, we are going to talk

2
00:00:05,993 --> 00:00:08,642
about truss structural elements.

3
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:11,752
To do so, we are going to revisit a certain number of structures,

4
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:14,642
which we have seen together, at least those of you

5
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:17,919
who have followed the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

6
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,277
The first picture which we can see here

7
00:00:20,327 --> 00:00:23,080
is that of the Tower Bridge, in London,

8
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:28,276
and we remember that we had represented it as a system

9
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:34,932
with two types of cables: a cable which goes down more on the left,

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,111
for the case in which the loads rather act on the left part

11
00:00:39,111 --> 00:00:42,793
of the structure, and then a cable which goes down

12
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:46,314
a bit more on the right, for the case in which the loads rather

13
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:49,577
act on the right part of the cable.

14
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:52,029
And that is really how it works,

15
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:59,236
but we can also notice that there are here, diagonals and posts,

16
00:00:59,236 --> 00:01:01,587
to stabilize the structure,

17
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:05,479
and then we are actually dealing with a truss.

18
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:10,622
So now, we could completely calculate the internal forces

19
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:13,808
in this truss, simply supposing that it is statically determinate,

20
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:16,392
that will not be the case, because of the X-shaped diagonals,

21
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:18,222
but we could simplify it.

22
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:21,599
But however, the way it works does not change,

23
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,179
that is to say that both these cables which I have drawn in pink and in sky blue

24
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,913
remain elements which are in tension,

25
00:01:27,913 --> 00:01:31,043
actually the diagonals do not carry much internal forces, only in the cases

26
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:33,984
in which there are load eccentricities.

27
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:39,924
For the Golden Gate Bridge, in San Francisco,

28
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:45,236
you remember that the deck is used to stiffen the structure,

29
00:01:45,267 --> 00:01:48,195
in such a way that variable loads

30
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,179
do not make the shape of the cable change too much,

31
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,624
making the utilisation of the structure uncomfortable.

32
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,079
What we can see now is that this deck, to be stiff,

33
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:03,587
is constituted of a truss with V-shaped diagonals,

34
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:08,333
with additional posts, here, vertical;

35
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:12,111
this structure is statically determinate,

36
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:15,807
we could thus calculate the internal forces in this truss. That is obvious that

37
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:20,123
it is favorable to use a truss which, thanks to its large depth,

38
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:22,646
will be stiff, having at the same time a large proportion of void,

39
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,306
which thus does not use too much material.

40
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:32,219
You probably remember this ice stadium in Stockholm,

41
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:36,600
where we had a big load-bearing cable,

42
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:46,682
which works together with a pretensioning cable

43
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,474
which is used to prestress the red cable,

44
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:55,148
in such a way that it does not deform too much: for example,

45
00:02:55,294 --> 00:02:57,580
when there is wind or snow.

46
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:02,019
And then we obviosuly had columns in compression, here,

47
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,663
and we can obviously see that we also have, now, a lot of diagonals,

48
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:09,778
here,

49
00:03:10,417 --> 00:03:15,176
which are added to the structure, and which make it a truss.

50
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:21,556
But fundamentally, the fact that we have a load-bearing cable does not change,

51
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,470
so the upper element is in tension;

52
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,923
a pretensioning cable, the lower element,

53
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,358
it is also in tension,

54
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:34,618
and then the diagonals are here to facilitate the support of assymetrical loads

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,272
on the roof.

56
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:41,064
For the olympic skating rink of Munich, that is the same thing.

57
00:03:41,064 --> 00:03:45,900
We have here a big arch; and you remember that in the arches,

58
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:50,914
it is important that the pressure line can move

59
00:03:50,914 --> 00:03:56,377
inside the arch in such a way that we can have internal forces

60
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,980
which essentially remain in compression.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,943
To create this volume in which the internal forces can move,

62
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,780
three tubes have been placed at a certain distance,

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,820
and to keep the structure stable, well, we have created a truss,

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,894
here we can see it, with diagonals; this is thus a tridimensional structure,

65
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:20,687
this is a truss, very clearly.

66
00:04:23,341 --> 00:04:28,493
The Austerlitz viaduct is a structure which is similar to the one

67
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:31,612
of Tower Bridge, with two arches;

68
00:04:31,714 --> 00:04:34,501
if I take again the colors I used before,

69
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:39,520
we are going to have a blue arch, which is first in the lower part,

70
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,638
then in the upper part,

71
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:45,499
then again in the lower part,

72
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,774
and a second arch, and afterwards we move to the top again,

73
00:04:51,774 --> 00:04:54,869
and then a second arch, which is the pink arch,

74
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:03,258
which is always on the other side of the section, with respect of the blue arch,

75
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:08,473
it enables to carry internal forces which are assymetrical,

76
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:11,429
for example, when the subway is only on the left part

77
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,353
or on the right part of the structure,

78
00:05:13,353 --> 00:05:18,793
but we can also obviously see that there are additional elements,

79
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:23,248
which are diagonals; so, both these arches are materialised

80
00:05:23,248 --> 00:05:25,504
as a truss.

81
00:05:27,267 --> 00:05:31,751
That is the same thing for the Maria Pia bridge in Porto.

82
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:34,633
Here too, we have an arch with two hinges,

83
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:39,791
but the space to enable the variation of the pressure line,

84
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:44,816
this space, is essentially created with void, and then some diagonals,

85
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:47,815
using the shape of a truss.

86
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,433
So here, we clearly have a truss, with X-shaped diagonals,

87
00:05:55,733 --> 00:06:03,152
which is created to create the spacing between the upper arch and the lower arch,

88
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,469
using very little material.

89
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:14,286
Finally, we have seen this structure, this lenticular shape arch-cable,

90
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:19,140
so we have a lower cable, we have seen the lower cable is actually

91
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,694
materialised by two continuous elements: two cables,

92
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:29,771
and then the upper arch; it is also materialised by

93
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:32,702
two elements; we can see that these elements are repeated afterwards,

94
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:35,189
this is a multiple structure.

95
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:41,423
But we have two arches which work together with both cables on the bottom,

96
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:47,007
and one more time, these structures are built with the shape of a truss

97
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:51,487
with diagonals which enable to stabilize this structure.

98
00:06:51,487 --> 00:06:55,477
So we have this in the upper part... in the lower part,

99
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:58,462
but also in the upper part.

100
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,907
What we have seen in this video,

101
00:07:02,907 --> 00:07:06,489
is that the truss is a type of structure in its own right,

102
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:09,428
and we have seen how to solve this type of structure,

103
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:14,433
but it is also a way to build structural elements.

104
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,293
So we can have arch structure, cable structures, arch-cable structures,

105
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:23,795
or else cable-beam structures, which are elements that, indeed,

106
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,980
are made with trusses.

107
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:29,037
What must also be said, and it is probably the time to say it

108
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:32,119
in this course, is that structures are not always pure;

109
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,913
it is very easy to have several types of structure

110
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,468
which act in the same structure.

111
00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:40,937
Obviously, in this course, I try to take

112
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,700
structures which clearly belong to a type.

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,752
They are cables, or arches, or else trusses,

114
00:07:46,752 --> 00:07:51,460
but actually, in reality, combinations are often chosen,

115
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,893
because it is more efficient, because it is easier to build,

116
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:59,167
or simply because that is the choice of the designer of the structure.
