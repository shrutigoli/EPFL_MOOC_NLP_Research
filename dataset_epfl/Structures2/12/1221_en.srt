1
00:00:04,522 --> 00:00:06,901
We can also obviously create variations

2
00:00:09,248 --> 00:00:11,809
changing the way we ditribute the depth

3
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:15,938
for example, with a triangular variation of the depth.

4
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,060
You can notice here that, since we make a division, we almost divide by zero.

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,676
What is the consequence of this ?

6
00:00:31,473 --> 00:00:39,190
We are going to have internal forces which are going to be larger near the supports.

7
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:45,980
They are not going to be zero in the middle, but they are going to be smaller in the middle

8
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:49,618
than they are near the supports.

9
00:00:55,658 --> 00:01:00,670
And then it will be the same for the tensile internal forces.

10
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,113
So we will have something which is a bit particular:

11
00:01:03,185 --> 00:01:05,381
till now, we tended to say:

12
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,314
if we have uniformly distributed loads,

13
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:11,459
the maximum internal forces are in the middle,

14
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,541
but that is not the case when

15
00:01:13,588 --> 00:01:15,618
the depth is varying in this way.

16
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,651
We can also decide to have a trapezoid variation of the depth,

17
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:25,148
as I have represented it on the right,

18
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,636
that is a solution which is often used, for example,

19
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:30,136
for industrial halls.

20
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:33,248
So we make the division,

21
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:36,872
and we get the result, and here, actually,

22
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,060
it must be seen case-by-case.

23
00:01:44,863 --> 00:01:48,345
Since we precisely have on one side, this trend to be close

24
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:51,393
to a triangular solution which would involve

25
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,683
larger internal forces in the chords, near the supports,

26
00:01:54,742 --> 00:01:57,748
and then to a purely rectangular solution which would entail

27
00:01:57,748 --> 00:02:01,143
larger internal forces in the middle, so these can offset each other,

28
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,370
getting a little bit closer to the lenticular solutions,

29
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:06,362
in which the internal forces are almost constant.

30
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:11,106
Here, I have the solution for two of these configurations.

31
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:17,615
For a triangular truss, we can notice

32
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,595
that the internal forces in the chords

33
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:31,569
are maximum near the supports.

34
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:41,853
Now, let's look at the sign of the internal forces in the diagonals:

35
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,057
the inclination of the arch should

36
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,829
usually give us compressive internal forces, and here, we can witness

37
00:02:50,264 --> 00:03:02,387
a reversal of the sign of the internal forces in the diagonals.

38
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:09,801
So, you should really be careful: it is going to depend on the inclination

39
00:03:10,248 --> 00:03:12,338
that we give to this truss and on the type of loads.

40
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,699
Here, we have uniformly distributed loads.

41
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,780
If we have loads which are a little bit more complex,

42
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:20,693
we cannot really say where the diagonals will be in compression,

43
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,464
and where they will be in tension.

44
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:25,340
You need to be careful here, and we can notice that the internal force in the diagonals

45
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:28,141
is larger in the middle that on the edges.

46
00:03:30,222 --> 00:03:32,908
And then here, we can say that the internal forces

47
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:41,674
are more or less constant in the chords,

48
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:46,064
but we can nevertheless notice that they decrease near the supports

49
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:59,334
and then, the internal forces in the diagonals, we cannot say anything.

50
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:10,880
Here you have two examples of variable depth truss structures

51
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:14,924
and we can clearly notice that there are actually, at least

52
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:18,034
on the left structure, two parts:

53
00:04:18,504 --> 00:04:24,837
a part which is linked to the external shape

54
00:04:25,753 --> 00:04:31,746
which we decided to give to the building,

55
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,130
and then this, this is a shape which is induced, for example, by depth limitations,

56
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:41,522
but also by the architectural appearance which we wish to give it,

57
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:47,237
and then, we have another limit, here, which is linked to the internal shape.

58
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:56,307
Here, this is a gymnastics hall, so it is probably necessary to have

59
00:04:56,715 --> 00:04:59,309
a certain depth on the edges, but we can be a little bit lower

60
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:02,460
in the middle, given the fact that we are probably going to hang up equipments after that,

61
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:07,316
and we thus have a shape which results from two famillies of constaints

62
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:10,086
with a structure in the middle which adapts.

63
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:13,592
On the right, this is a kind of structure which we can often see:

64
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:18,114
this is a greenhouse, for example a greenhouse to grow vegetables,

65
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:20,757
but it could also be a greenhouse

66
00:05:21,135 --> 00:05:26,113
to do light industrial work, and we have the external shape:

67
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:30,290
a roof shape which is favorable to the snow evacuation, etc.

68
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:34,805
then an internal shape where we want to have the largest possible depth.

69
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,168
Everything with a very high transparency,

70
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,250
that is obviously important if it is a hall to grow

71
00:05:40,565 --> 00:05:42,679
vegatable .

72
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:47,510
The last type of truss which we are going to see together in this video

73
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,404
is call the Polonceau truss.

74
00:05:49,857 --> 00:05:53,623
This truss has been invented to have a structure which is

75
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:58,165
as light and as transparent as possible, so using as many as possible

76
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:01,179
elements in tension.

77
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,202
That is a structure which is going to be used for a roof,

78
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:07,040
so the part of the roof on the top can easily carry

79
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:10,517
compression, since we are going to have a relatively thick element,

80
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:13,839
however, the lower part is often built with cables.

81
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,643
For this resoltuion, I have decided not to place the loads under,

82
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,829
as it was the case in the video, but over.

83
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:22,643
That is also often the case for these trusses which will have to resist

84
00:06:22,722 --> 00:06:26,903
for example, a wind or a snow load.

85
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,133
Since we have symmetrical loads,

86
00:06:30,364 --> 00:06:34,338
we will have reactions on the left and on the right

87
00:06:34,682 --> 00:06:39,850
which are equal and which have each time a value of 15 Newtons.

88
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:48,624
I am going to start the resolution of this truss by this node on the right,

89
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,634
which is subjected to the right reaction, R7,

90
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:04,210
which is again staggered, for us to be able to see it well, but it should be

91
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:09,715
superimposed on the same vertical axis than the applied loads,

92
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:13,342
and afterwards, we turn counterclockwise

93
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:19,974
around this node and we first meet bar 6-7

94
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:30,469
which pushes on the truss, therefore this bar is in compression,

95
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,763
then bar 5-7,

96
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:45,681
which pulls on the truss,

97
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,253
which is thus in tension.

98
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,000
Here is the contribution

99
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:56,603
of node 7 to the Cremona diagram.

100
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,667
We now move to node 6.

101
00:08:00,936 --> 00:08:06,932
Node 6 is subjected to the internal force in 6-7 in the other direction,

102
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:14,239
to the applied load of 10N, to the internal force in 4-6

103
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:24,403
which is in the same direction than 6-7, which is also a compressive internal force

104
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,379
and to the internal force in 5-6 which also goes in the direction of this node,

105
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:32,826
therefore it is also a compressive internal force.

106
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:42,806
Here is the contribution of the node 6 to the Cremona diagram.

107
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:50,583
We now move to node 5,

108
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,400
an unloaded node, but not without any internal forces,

109
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:59,968
which is subjected to the internal force in 5-7, in the other direction, to the internal force in 5-6,

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:09,383
in the other direction, then to the internal force in 4-5,

111
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:18,376
which pulls on the node, thus a tensile internal force,

112
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:26,193
and to the internal force in 3-5, I draw it in a slightly staggered way,

113
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,355
for us not to lose our way,

114
00:09:32,249 --> 00:09:35,501
which is also a tensile internal force.

115
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,335
The contribution of node 5 to the Cremona diagram

116
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,460
is indicated here.

117
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,617
We now move to node 4.

118
00:09:51,185 --> 00:09:59,294
Node 4 is subjected to the internal force in 4-5, in the other direction, to the internal force in 4-6,

119
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:08,925
in the other direction, to an applied load of 10N, then to the internal force in 2-4

120
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:20,233
which goes in the direction of the node, which is therefore a compressive internal force,

121
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:27,442
and finally to the internal force in 3-4, which is a tensile internal force.

122
00:10:36,858 --> 00:10:46,728
Here is the contribution of the node 4 to the Cremona diagram.

123
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:51,082
We now move to the node 3.

124
00:10:52,067 --> 00:11:02,587
Node 3 is subjected to the internal force in 3-5, in the other direction, to the internal force in 3-4,

125
00:11:04,725 --> 00:11:09,449
in the other direction, to the internal force in 2-3,

126
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:21,736
a compressive internal force,

127
00:11:23,645 --> 00:11:30,777
and finally to the internal force in 1-3 which I draw in a staggered way in relation to 5-7,

128
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,291
which is a tensile internal force.

129
00:11:38,225 --> 00:11:47,412
And the contribution of this node 3 to the Cremona diagram is indicated in yellow here.

130
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:53,310
We now solve node 2.

131
00:11:54,246 --> 00:12:00,957
Node 2 is subjected to the internal force in 2-3, in the other direction, to the internal force in 2-4,

132
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:08,615
in the other direction, to an applied load of 10N, and to the internal force in 1-2

133
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,877
to close the polygon of forces,

134
00:12:16,184 --> 00:12:20,414
which is a compressive internal force and the contribution

135
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:29,503
of this node to the equilibrium is indicated here in grey.

136
00:12:31,593 --> 00:12:34,945
Finally, we check the equilibrium of node 1.

137
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,652
This Node 1 is subjected to the internal force in 5-7,

138
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:46,448
in the other direction... the internal force in 1-3,

139
00:12:46,448 --> 00:12:48,370
in the other direction, to the internal force in 1-2,

140
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:53,286
and finally to the support reaction R1

141
00:12:57,407 --> 00:13:00,456
which is equal to 15N.

142
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:11,316
Here is the contribution of this node to the global equilibrium.

143
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,713
On this figure, we have represented a Polonceau truss which is a bit particular:

144
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:21,349
you can see that, instead of being rectilinear, actually, this Polonceau truss goes a bit up.

145
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:26,461
We have taken this intermediate bar and we have shortened it, inducing

146
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,838
a slight curvature upwards.

147
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:31,737
Reversely, if we had decided to lengthen it, we could have obtained

148
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,466
a Polonceau truss which would be valid as well,

149
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,084
but which we would have curvature downwards,

150
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:41,319
which is absolutely possible, depending on the uses.

151
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,300
On the left, we can see a Polonceau truss

152
00:13:44,354 --> 00:13:47,869
such as it has been built for the East train station in Paris.

153
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,197
We can notice that the structure is opaque in its upper part,

154
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,297
it is a good thing, we can put a lot of matter, timber, metal,

155
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,508
which enables to carry compression,

156
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,130
we have these elements here which are in compression,

157
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:04,259
and all the others are very thin elements, cables,

158
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:09,408
which enable to have a great transparency.

159
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:11,898
It was particularly important at the time of these stations,

160
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:15,801
since they used steam locomotives, it was necessary to ensure

161
00:14:16,077 --> 00:14:20,101
the ventilation and then to have the least elements which could block

162
00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:21,966
the air flow.

163
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,971
If you look at the first image of this video, you will see the cover

164
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,102
of another station which uses the same system.

165
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,961
In this video, we have looked at trusses with a variable depth,

166
00:14:31,961 --> 00:14:34,144
we have seen the influence of the depth,

167
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,662
both on the internal forces in the chords and in the diagonals,

168
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:40,673
which can been quite different of what they are for 

169
00:14:40,925 --> 00:14:41,970
trusses with a constant depth.

170
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,540
We have studied in particular three typologies:

171
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:48,649
lenticular trusses, triangular or trapezoid trusses,

172
00:14:48,902 --> 00:14:51,353
and then finally Polonceau trusses.

173
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,442
But there are many more typologies:

174
00:14:53,856 --> 00:14:57,013
parabolic trusses, or with much more free shapes,

175
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,642
depending on the uses which must be done of the structure.
