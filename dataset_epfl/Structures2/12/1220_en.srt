00:00:00,608 --> 00:00:01,514
Hello.

2
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:05,452
In this lecture, after looked at for quite some time

3
00:00:05,452 --> 00:00:07,298
at trusses with a the constant depth,

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,800
we are going to lokk at trusses with a variable depth.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,637
We will see what is the influence of the depth,

6
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:15,901
which is no longer constant between the supports,

7
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:18,048
on the internal forces in the chords

8
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,161
and in the diagonals

9
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:20,979
And then, we will investigate in detail

10
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,924
some of the typologies of trusses with avariable depth.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,920
What we have previously seen,

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,546
is that starting from the shape of the arch-cable

13
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:47,141
and dividing it by its depth which was constant,

14
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:53,465
of our cross-section,

15
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,692
we could obtain the internal forces in the chords,

16
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:02,623
so compression which had a parabolic shape.

17
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:04,879
So, for the loads I have indicated here,

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,274
that is to say uniformly distributed loads,

19
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:12,010
we had an increase

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,210
with the largest internal forces at mid-span

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,818
and smaller internal forces near the supports.

22
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:21,104
These are internal forces in the chords.

23
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:24,812
You also remember that we had developped rules for

24
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:26,863
the internal forces in the diagonals.

25
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:32,229
The idea we have now

26
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:35,623
is to try with a variable depth

27
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:41,316
so here I make it vary in the form of a parabola

28
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,901
which looks like the shape of the arch,

29
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,692
except that I made this shape symmetrical.

30
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,723
You can note that we could have done it

31
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:54,296
with the same shape than the arch-cable.

32
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:58,338
And we can guess that it will more or less

33
00:01:58,338 --> 00:02:02,940
give us constant internal forces,

34
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,479
maybe a little bit larger that the ones I have just drawn here,

35
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:12,157
approximately constant in both chords.

36
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:26,786
Here, we have the model of a lenticular truss

37
00:02:26,786 --> 00:02:32,963
on which I add three loads of 10 Newtons.

38
00:02:36,253 --> 00:02:41,798
And we want to solve the equilibrium of this structure.

39
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:44,781
First, because it is symmetrical,

40
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:50,185
it is obvious that the support reactions on the left and on the right

41
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,290
are both equal to 15 Newtons.

42
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,690
Before going further, I number the nodes of this structure

43
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,349
from one to seven.

44
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:05,775
To gain time, here, on the right,

45
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:10,369
I have already drawn in grey the directions of the bars

46
00:03:10,369 --> 00:03:13,599
which will interest us for the resolution.

47
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,671
And then, I am going to start the resolution by the right node,

48
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:18,994
node 7,

49
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:25,812
which is subjected to the right support reaction

50
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,538
of 15 Newtons,

51
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:30,597
it is represented here.

52
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:35,270
It is staggered in relation to the applied loads of 10 Newtons,

53
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,189
but obviously, it should be superimposed.

54
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:41,803
This free-body, turning counterclockwise,

55
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:45,038
makes me first meet 6-7,

56
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:46,762
so I turn here,

57
00:03:46,762 --> 00:03:50,498
then I meet bar 6-7,

58
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:58,256
in which the internal force pushes on the free-body,

59
00:03:58,256 --> 00:03:59,591
I already knew it,

60
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:04,830
so this internal force is in blue in bar 6-7,

61
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,463
then I meet bar 5-7

62
00:04:08,463 --> 00:04:11,594
to close the polygon of forces

63
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,212
for this node.

64
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:20,326
And here, this internal force is an internal force which pulls on the free-body,

65
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:22,417
it is therefore a tensile internal force.

66
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:29,541
The contribution of this free-body

67
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,448
to the Cremona diagram is then this one.

68
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:38,455
I now move to the resolution of node 6,

69
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:44,283
which is subjected to the internal force in 6-7

70
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:45,902
in the other direction,

71
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,298
to the load of 10 Newtons,

72
00:04:48,298 --> 00:04:54,484
then to the internal force in 4-6 which pushes on the node,

73
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:57,408
it is therefore a compressive internal force,

74
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:08,503
then to the internal force in 5-6 to close the polygon of forces,

75
00:05:10,085 --> 00:05:14,698
which is also a compressive internal force.

76
00:05:14,698 --> 00:05:19,709
The contribution of this free-body

77
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:22,706
to the Cremona diagram

78
00:05:22,706 --> 00:05:26,716
is indicated here in orange.

79
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:29,709
We now move to node 5,

80
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:31,764
which is an unloaded node

81
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,042
but not without internal forces,

82
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:39,641
since it is subjected to the internal force in 5-7 in the other direction,

83
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:45,407
to the internal force in 5-6 in the other direction,

84
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:56,779
then to the internal force in 4-5 which pushes on the node,

85
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:00,986
it is thus a compressive internal force;

86
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:09,013
and finally, to the internal force in 3-5 which pulls on node,

87
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:12,118
it is therefore a tensile internal force.

88
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:19,314
The contribution of this node to the equilibrium

89
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:29,065
is then 5-7, 5-6, 4-5 and 3-5, as indicated here.

90
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,377
We now move to the resolution of node 4,

91
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:41,350
which is subjected to the internal force in 4-5 in the other direction,

92
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,792
to the internal force in 4-6 in the other direction,

93
00:06:44,792 --> 00:06:48,732
to the applied load of 10 Newtons,

94
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:54,318
then to the internal force in 2-4

95
00:06:54,318 --> 00:06:56,201
which pushes on the node

96
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:59,903
therefore it is a compressive internal force;

97
00:06:59,903 --> 00:07:09,963
and finally to the internal force in 3-4 which also pushes on the node

98
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:13,865
and which is thus, also, a compressive internal force.

99
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:20,082
I indicate in green the contribution of this node

100
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,499
to the Cremona diagram.

101
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,054
Node 3

102
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:31,914
is also an unloaded node.

103
00:07:31,914 --> 00:07:34,793
Well, I guess you have already understood that the resolution

104
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:38,516
is going to be symmetrical since the loads are symmetrical,

105
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,809
but we are going to proceed with this resolution anyway.

106
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:44,493
So, node 3 is subjected to the internal force in 3-5

107
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:46,261
in the other direction,

108
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:49,779
to the internal force in 3-4 in the other direction,

109
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:55,482
then to the internal force in 2-3

110
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:00,988
which is a compressive internal force,

111
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:08,890
and to the internal force in 1-3 which is a tensile internal force.

112
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:22,492
I indicate in yellow the contribution of node 3

113
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,208
to the Cremona diagram.

114
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:29,451
We can see that it is symmetrical to the node 5 which we have seen before.

115
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,544
We now look at the equilibrium of node 2,

116
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:44,341
which is subjected to the internal force in 2-3 in the other direction,

117
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:47,118
to the internal force in 2-4 in the other direction,

118
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:50,410
then to the load of 10 Newtons,

119
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,638
and finally, to close the polygon of forces,

120
00:08:54,638 --> 00:09:01,120
to the internal force in 1-2.

121
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,293
And then, we have this contribution here

122
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:08,490
to the Cremona diagram.

123
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:15,371
Finally, we look at node 1,

124
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:17,566
on the far-left.

125
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:22,137
This node is subjected to the internal force in 1-3 in the other direction,

126
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:25,881
to the internal force in 1-2 in the other direction,

127
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:30,674
and then to the support reaction of 15 Newtons on the left,

128
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:39,508
which I draw again in a staggered way, but it should obviously be superimposed.

129
00:09:39,508 --> 00:09:49,099
Here is the contribution of this node to the global equilibrium

130
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,941
expressed by the Cremona diagram.

131
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,940
I had forgotten to precise that bar 1-2 is in compression

132
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,170
but I think that everyone had seen it.

133
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:03,745
We can see here an example of lenticular truss of the 19th century,

134
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:12,455
with clearly, here, an upper chord in compression,

135
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,869
a lower chord in tension,

136
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:20,465
and then numerous diagonals,

137
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:23,373
which are going to be in compression,

138
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:28,431
at least, when the train load passes.

139
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:33,630
Here, below, I have also sketched it.

140
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,121
So we have a truss with

141
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:39,174
a nearly constant compression in the upper chord,

142
00:10:39,174 --> 00:10:43,168
a nearly constant tension in the lower reinforcement.

143
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:49,798
I am going to make some additional comments at the end of this resolution.

144
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:55,856
Now that we have the internal forces in the various bars,

145
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,229
what do we notice ?

146
00:10:57,229 --> 00:11:02,658
We can notice that the internal force in the chord in compression, here,

147
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:04,630
is approximately always the same.

148
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,026
These length are roughly constant.

149
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:09,530
And if we look at the chords in tension,

150
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,125
that is a bit less the case because the internal force in 3-5

151
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:15,012
is nevertheless smaller than the internal force in 5-7 or in 1-3

152
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,031
but we also have rather constant internal forces.

153
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:25,350
So, we have roughly constant internal forces

154
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,750
in the chords.

155
00:11:31,805 --> 00:11:36,205
Furthermore, we can see that the internal forces in the diagonals which are all here,

156
00:11:36,205 --> 00:11:39,455
are relatively smaller than the internal forces in the chords.

157
00:11:39,455 --> 00:11:45,478
They are quite small

158
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:47,631
in the diagonals.

159
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,301
We can also see that they are relatively constant

160
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:57,198
so we could choose diagonals

161
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:58,712
which have the same shape.

162
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:02,250
On this model, you can see a lenticular truss

163
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,705
with this time, loads which are applied to the upper part.

164
00:12:06,705 --> 00:12:12,191
So I propose you to do it with two loads of 15 Newtons

165
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:15,924
to have the same sum than we had before,

166
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,622
so with forces at the supports

167
00:12:18,622 --> 00:12:21,818
R1 = 15 Newtons

168
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:27,085
and then R7 = 15 Newtons.

169
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:31,111
Here I have set up the calculation, but I have not given to you the grey bars,

170
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:33,302
I am not going to do the resolution this time

171
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:36,312
but, you have the opportunity to do it for yourself

172
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:38,741
to understand well how it works.

173
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:41,182
You will see, it is quite similar to what we have done

174
00:12:41,182 --> 00:12:43,412
but there are nevertheless some small differences,

175
00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:45,771
differences which make it worth to do it

176
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:48,244
as an independant exercise.

177
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:53,498
And here, you have the example of a bridge in the United States,

178
00:12:53,498 --> 00:12:58,777
with an upper chord which is always in compression,

179
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:04,365
a lower chord which is always in tension,

180
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:09,146
and we cannot see them well, but diagonals here,

181
00:13:09,146 --> 00:13:13,806
they are actually very thin, that is why we cannot see them well,

182
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:18,490
very thin diagonals which are in tension.

183
00:13:23,778 --> 00:13:27,551
And likewise, here I have the resolution of the truss

184
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:30,827
with a constant internal force in the upper chord, or almost,

185
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,228
and also in the lower chord,

186
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,438
and then internal forces which are nearly constant

187
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,613
and which are small, in the diagonals.

188
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,322
So, one of the advantages of these parabolic-shaped trusses is

189
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:42,872
to have constant internal forces.

190
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,938
We can particularly see it here for this bridge

191
00:13:44,938 --> 00:13:47,618
on which we can see that the upper chord which is very thin,

192
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:50,531
has a constant width over all its length.

193
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:53,823
Here, you have a more recent example of lenticular truss,

194
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:57,376
this is the tribune of the Formula 1 circuit of Shanghai in China.

195
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:59,301
I do not have a lot of pictures,

196
00:13:59,301 --> 00:14:02,069
but we can clearly notice the lenticular shape

197
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:04,152
of both these parts of the building,

198
00:14:04,152 --> 00:14:06,178
and from this picture of the inside,

199
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,665
we can also clearly see that there are diagonals,

200
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,888
then, we can also see posts,

201
00:14:10,888 --> 00:14:13,450
it is thus a truss which we could also calculate

202
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,981
with the methods we have studied so far.
