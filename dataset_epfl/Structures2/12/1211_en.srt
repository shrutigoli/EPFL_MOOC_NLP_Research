00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,566
Hello.

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:05,454
In this video, we continue to explore the solutions of typology

3
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:07,381
for trusses with a constant depth.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,560
We are going to dedicate ourselves to trusses with X-shaped diagonals.

5
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,604
You can see in this video how we pass from a truss

6
00:00:14,604 --> 00:00:19,716
with N-shaped diagonals in tension to a truss with X-shaped diagonals

7
00:00:19,716 --> 00:00:22,946
adding, in this case, four diagonals.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,948
On the final structure, the bars which were in tension

9
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:29,474
are still in tension

10
00:00:29,474 --> 00:00:33,257
and the timber bars which have been added are in compression.

11
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:37,492
This figure shows the same principle

12
00:00:37,492 --> 00:00:40,915
so we have a truss with N-shaped diagonals in compression on the left,

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:44,511
on which we superimpose a truss with N-shaped diagonals in tension

14
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,606
so if we put half of the loads onto each of both trusses,

15
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:51,015
we obtain a complete truss on which all these loads act.

16
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:52,835
We can already observe,

17
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:55,455
because the results have been made for you,

18
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:59,175
that the internal forces in the diagonals are smaller than before

19
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:01,763
because now we have a diagonal in tension

20
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:03,368
and a diagonal in compression;

21
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:05,827
each time the internal forces are very small in the middle

22
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,997
and even near the supports, they are significantly smaller.

23
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:12,412
We are going to determine if this structure is statically determinate,

24
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:15,763
se we have here two forces at the support,

25
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:18,417
one here, so three in total

26
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:23,342
to which we are going to add the number of bars,

27
00:01:23,342 --> 00:01:30,191
so let's count the bars: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

28
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:37,280
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

29
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,981
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,

30
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:51,987
27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,

31
00:01:51,987 --> 00:02:00,365
33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40

32
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:04,803
and 41, so 3+41.

33
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:07,701
And now, let's count the nodes:

34
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:14,758
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

35
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:21,815
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.

36
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:28,326
2 x 18, so clearly, this is greater, that is equal to 44,

37
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:36,877
which means 36+8,

38
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:41,877
therefore our structure is eight times statically indeterminate.

39
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:47,378
If you remember the previous video, that is logical,

40
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:51,981
we had a truss with N-shaped diagonals, let's say in tension, and then we have added

41
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,627
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 additional bars,

42
00:02:56,637 --> 00:02:59,619
diagonals in compression, to our solution

43
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:02,475
which was initially statically determinate, it is now

44
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,662
eight times statically indeterminate, which means that

45
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:06,573
we will not be able to calculate

46
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,464
this structure within the framework of this course

47
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:11,215
but it does not mean that we cannot understand

48
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:13,795
how it works and you can notice that the diagonals

49
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,141
which have the same inclination

50
00:03:15,141 --> 00:03:17,826
than the arch-cable are still in compression,

51
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:20,569
the ones which are in the other direction are still in tension

52
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,341
and then the upper and lower chords have the largest internal force

53
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:26,403
when the arch is the furthest from the cable.

54
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:28,945
So the rules which we have established together

55
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:31,480
essentially remain valid.

56
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,798
Here, we have the example of a large building from the 19th century,

57
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,421
and we can notice, particularly in the upper part,

58
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:39,567
that they used very simple elements.

59
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,705
They are probably flatirons, I am drawing their cross-section,

60
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:46,081
that is an element which is just a flat steel bar.

61
00:03:46,081 --> 00:03:48,976
Why is it possible in this configuration ?

62
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,012
Well, because the internal forces are small,

63
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:53,161
there is a small compression in this direction,

64
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,850
a small tension in this direction

65
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,419
that is why the internal forces

66
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,130
can be supported by such simple elements.

67
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,907
We can notice here, where there are larger loads,

68
00:04:01,907 --> 00:04:03,987
that the elements are a bit more complicated

69
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:05,388
Here, I have another example,

70
00:04:05,388 --> 00:04:07,939
this is not exactly a constant depth structure

71
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:09,632
though we can clearly recognize

72
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,813
the elements which are here in tension,

73
00:04:11,813 --> 00:04:14,303
which are, again, constituted by flatirons,

74
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,974
and then the elements in compression

75
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:21,533
which are constituted by two angles,

76
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:24,395
that is to say two L-shaped elements.

77
00:04:26,972 --> 00:04:29,281
Obviously in this direction

78
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,272
but the internal forces being quite small,

79
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,824
we can notice that this structure is very transparent,

80
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:37,064
that is an advantage of the structures with X-shaped diagonals.

81
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:40,209
Since the structure is statically indeterminate,

82
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:42,968
we can imagine taking off here all the posts.

83
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:47,781
We have taken off 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 posts.

84
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,781
We can imagine that the structure is thus one time statically indeterminate.

85
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,673
We are going to check it anyway.

86
00:04:53,677 --> 00:04:56,169
So we have here two forces at the support,

87
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,230
here one, so three support reactions in total.

88
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:06,131
Plus 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

89
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:12,982
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

90
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:19,773
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,

91
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:26,823
24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,

92
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:32,073
30, 31, 32, 33, 34 bars

93
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:40,066
and then we still have 2 x 18 nodes

94
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:45,952
so it is larger but we have 37

95
00:05:45,952 --> 00:05:47,838
which is equal to 36 + 1

96
00:05:47,838 --> 00:05:51,724
so this structure is only one time statically indeterminate.

97
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:58,544
We still cannot calculate it but we are closer

98
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:00,813
and we can understand well how it works.

99
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:04,490
You can notice that, one more time, the diagonals which are in compression

100
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,965
are the ones which have the shape of the arch of the arch-cable.

101
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,586
Here, we have a type of construction

102
00:06:10,586 --> 00:06:12,766
for which this type of truss is often used.

103
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:15,733
That is for a temporary installation on a construction site.

104
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:20,704
These elements will be used as support for the setting up of the concrete

105
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,507
before it hardens.

106
00:06:23,529 --> 00:06:26,956
Here, we have a particular case with which the Wright brothers,

107
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:30,617
who are the pioneers of aviation as you may know, have been confronted.

108
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:33,054
It was necessary to create a wing which was sufficiently stiff

109
00:06:33,054 --> 00:06:36,339
to resist to the weight of the machine and of its pilot

110
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:38,577
since it is the wings which carry the machine

111
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:42,432
and also, on the other hand, which must remain sufficiently aerodynamic.

112
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:46,407
So in this case, we can clearly identify

113
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,429
posts, there are two rows,

114
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,876
there are the posts of the front and of the back, which are in compression,

115
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:55,339
I do not draw them all but I draw some

116
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:00,118
and it was necessary to be able to have a system in which...

117
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:03,084
so I am going to draw the air pressure,

118
00:07:03,084 --> 00:07:06,909
the air pressure, it acts in this way upwards,

119
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:13,839
not only on this wing, also obviously on the wing of the top,

120
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,708
so we have loads acting upwards,

121
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:25,645
and then here, we have the weight of the pilot

122
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:32,073
plus the one of the machine,

123
00:07:32,073 --> 00:07:35,971
that is essentially the engine which is heavy in this structure.

124
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,664
And we would quite naturally have,

125
00:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,890
tensile internal forces in certain diagonals

126
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,961
and compressive internal forces in others.

127
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:49,748
What has been done here, that is the diagonals, if we come back here,

128
00:07:49,748 --> 00:07:53,572
these diagonals should normally be in compression,

129
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,479
these diagonals, here, should be in compression.

130
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,100
So, what has been done here is that they used cables

131
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,019
which were stretched before.

132
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,519
Since they were stretched, they were then in tension

133
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:08,227
and then when the compression arrived actually, they were just less tensioned

134
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,633
since a tension plus a compression

135
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,665
is equal to a smaller tension if the tension is large enough.

136
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:17,570
And thanks to this, the internal force still remains a tension,

137
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,534
which is a big advantage.

138
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:23,027
So this is what we call prestressing,

139
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:35,359
which is the preliminary tensioning,

140
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,954
that is to say before putting the loads,

141
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:43,581
of a cable element

142
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:50,634
for it to remain in tension

143
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,280
even if it is subjected

144
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,660
to a compressive internal force.

145
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,443
So we will have the internal force in the bar

146
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,586
which will be equal to the internal force of prestressing

147
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:26,660
which is positive, plus the compressive internal force

148
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,510
and if the internal force of prestressing which we introduced before

149
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,450
is larger than the compressive internal force which has just been added

150
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,380
thus the internal force in the bar will remain in tension.

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,402
This what the Wright brothers did,

152
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:44,512
which enabled them to have, here, very thin diagonals

153
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:48,012
since they are only constituted by cables

154
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:53,911
and thus the structure is extremely light

155
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,671
and aerodynamic since the engine

156
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,837
was not really powerful either.
