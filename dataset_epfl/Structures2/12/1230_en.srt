1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,826
Hello.

2
00:00:00,826 --> 00:00:03,628
In this video, we look at towers and cantilevers,

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:06,730
which are types of structures that we have not studied so far.

4
00:00:07,525 --> 00:00:10,095
We will look at the loads which act on them,

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,695
we will look at how to determine the internal forces,

6
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,675
we will see that the resolution method

7
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,415
which we have previously seen remains applicable.

8
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:19,125
Then, we will make some considerations

9
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,805
related to the shape of these structures.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,020
We have, on the left, a type of structure

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,060
which clearly relates to a tower.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,760
It is the mast of a boat, which is subjected to transversal wind.

13
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:39,765
On the right, a structure classically considered as a cantilever,

14
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:45,815
that is to say, an element which is subjected to a load at the end. In French we have an expression with means &quot;carried wrongly&quot;.

15
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:48,735
The word in French is &quot;porte-à-faux&quot;.

16
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:56,165
I will come back to the meaning of this expression later.

17
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,950
In both cases, loads are transversal

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,170
to the structure, that is to say roughly perpendicular to the axis of the structure.

19
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:09,025
In this video, we can see a cantilever.

20
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:12,385
There is already a small tension in the cable

21
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:15,235
before I add the load of 20 Newtons,

22
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:18,205
because obviously, the self-weight of the structure is acting,

23
00:01:18,205 --> 00:01:21,234
especially the self-weight of the lower timber element.

24
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,684
This element already has a small internal force.

25
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,040
In this video, we have taken the cantilever

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,610
and we have made it rotate 90° to put it vertically and create a tower.

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,210
Obviously, if I took off my finger, the tower would collapse.

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,880
But applying a horizontal load, perpendicular,

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,350
we can see that the structure is in equilibrium.

30
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:47,293
We are going to solve here these two types of structures,

31
00:01:47,293 --> 00:01:52,343
using free-bodies, as usual.

32
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:56,373
I first look at the solution of the tower, on the left.

33
00:01:56,373 --> 00:02:03,473
This tower is subjected to a horizontal load of 10 Newtons.

34
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,415
I draw it here.

35
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:13,343
Turning counterclockwise

36
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:18,603
from my load, I meet this element which is going to pull on the free-body.

37
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:20,944
So I am directly going to draw it in red,

38
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:22,965
not to lose time.

39
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:33,396
Afterwards, I will meet the right element which

40
00:02:33,396 --> 00:02:37,706
is in compression since it pushes on the free-body.

41
00:02:45,113 --> 00:02:48,523
Here, this element is in compression.

42
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:57,428
And the other element is in tension.

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,790
Here is the state of equilibrium for this free-body.

44
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:11,511
We now move to the right, to the resolution of the cantilever

45
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:16,551
for which we are going to look at a very similar free-body,

46
00:03:16,551 --> 00:03:19,901
even if we can see well that it has been rotated of 90°.

47
00:03:20,264 --> 00:03:26,574
This free-body is subjected to a load of 10 Newtons.

48
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,186
Turning counterclockwise,

49
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,740
around this free-body, I first meet this element

50
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,190
which goes up leftwards.

51
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,200
I know that there are tensions, so I am going to draw it in red.

52
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:56,913
Then, I am going to meet the element which goes up rightwards,

53
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:59,403
which is going to be in compression.

54
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:14,516
We have here compression,

55
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,675
and here tension.

56
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:26,955
The equilibrium of this orange free-body is represented here,

57
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,565
by this orange triangle.

58
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:33,045
We can notice that both structures are very similar.

59
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,705
If we take the left structures and rotate clockqise by 90°,

60
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:39,065
we obtain this structure.

61
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:42,095
Likewise, if we take this graphical construction,

62
00:04:42,095 --> 00:04:44,445
and that we rotate it by 90°, we obtain this one.

63
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:46,855
That is why both these types of structures

64
00:04:46,855 --> 00:04:51,385
are structures with which we are going to deal simultaneously.

65
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:57,255
I come back to the expression &quot;porte-à-faux&quot;, a very interesting expression in French.

66
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:00,929
I draw here the internal forces which we have.

67
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,189
Till now, when we had

68
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,309
a vertical load acting on the structure, then

69
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:10,339
we had compression in blue on the top and tension in red on the bottom.

70
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:11,959
However, what can we see here?

71
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,092
Quite the opposite, we have tension on the top,

72
00:05:15,092 --> 00:05:17,745
and compression on the bottom.

73
00:05:17,745 --> 00:05:23,729
So we can understand well the meaning of the &quot;porte-à-faux&quot; (= carries wrongly).

74
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,675
Obviously, this structures does not carry wrongly,

75
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:33,925
but it can lead to make wrong reasonings, since,

76
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:37,925
precisely, tension and compression are swapped.

77
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:41,745
We can thus understand the expression &quot;porte-à-faux&quot; in this context.

78
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:46,641
If we now have a tower which is subjected to two loads,

79
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,781
we are going to do the same thing.

80
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:54,001
On the left, I start with a free-body which is going to include the top of the tower,

81
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,851
and the first load of 10 Newtons.

82
00:05:59,364 --> 00:06:02,464
I draw it here,

83
00:06:05,578 --> 00:06:09,508
smaller than before because there will be two loads of 10 Newtons.

84
00:06:09,508 --> 00:06:12,588
Then, turning counterclockwise,

85
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:16,588
I am first going to meet the part which is inclined leftwards.

86
00:06:16,588 --> 00:06:22,358
I do not know exactly where it is, so I am simply going to draw it like this.

87
00:06:22,358 --> 00:06:26,358
Then, in a systematic way, I am going to draw the part

88
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:31,108
which is going to be in compression.

89
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:35,988
I did not know the shape of my tower, but now I know it.

90
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:41,018
So I start from a point which is obviously

91
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:44,148
at the level of this load of 10 Newtons,

92
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:48,238
and then in the middle, between the supports, from a point here.

93
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:55,598
I am now going to trace the parallel to the red part of my construction

94
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,108
to obtain the shape of my structure.

95
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:01,568
And till the level of the second load, it is going to take this shape

96
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:03,468
for the left part.

97
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:09,788
And the right part is going to take this shape in a more or less systematic way,

98
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:11,478
if my drawing is correct.

99
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:17,568
I now have a second load of 10 Newtons which is going to act here.

100
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:20,608
So I add it.

101
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:26,306
Second load of 10 Newtons here.

102
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,146
So we are dealing with this free-body.

103
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:43,651
I have an internal force which acts in the upper part, I have a load of 10 Newtons.

104
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:54,373
Then I finally obtain this internal force,

105
00:07:54,468 --> 00:08:00,298
which gives the inclination of the lower part of the leg of my tower,

106
00:08:00,298 --> 00:08:08,188
which is going to be like this, till the level of the ground, of the support that I have on the left.

107
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,365
What about the right part?

108
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:20,115
It has not met any other load, so it is simply going to be rectilinear,

109
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:23,615
till the bottom, where we will have another support.

110
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,403
You can notice that I have not exactly

111
00:08:27,403 --> 00:08:30,043
reached the position of the supports drawn in grey.

112
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:33,403
It is not a big deal, but it is a bit embarassing... 

113
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:38,253
- Remember, I had shown you the Eiffel Tower at the beginning of this video -

114
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:41,073
And now, we have a structure which is not symmetrical,

115
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:44,653
strongly inclined on one side, and rectilinear on the other side.

116
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:46,823
You can note that this structure is in equilibrium.

117
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:50,813
We have two free-bodies, maybe that is not useless

118
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:52,533
to draw their contribution.

119
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:56,763
Here, a first free-body, with this equilibrium,

120
00:08:56,763 --> 00:09:02,473
and a second free-body with the equilibrium of the lower part.

121
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:08,793
Let's see how to solve this problem in a more satisfying way.

122
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:15,943
Again, I am going to identify the mid-point as starting point.

123
00:09:15,943 --> 00:09:24,853
I am going to distribute this load of 10 Newtons differently.

124
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,693
For the upper part, that will be the same thing.

125
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:33,203
I am going to take the same inclinations.

126
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:41,843
I have again here a free-body which includes the load of 10 Newtons on the top,

127
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,993
and the top of the tower.

128
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,001
Turning counterclockwise,

129
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:53,861
I am first going to meet the upper part in tension,

130
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:58,671
then the lower part in compression.

131
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:12,430
I can already draw the part of the top of the tower till the level of the first floor.

132
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,210
So here, there is compression.

133
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:23,671
And here, there is tension.

134
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:30,322
Then the load of 10 Newtons is going to be drawn differently:

135
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:36,212
I am going to put 5 Newtons on the left, and 5 Newtons on the right.

136
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:42,732
The first free-body is going to include the left part,

137
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:48,232
with a first load of 5 Newtons which I add here, on the top.

138
00:10:54,038 --> 00:11:01,128
The equilibrium will be the upper part, the load of 5 Newtons, the lower part.

139
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:10,402
I directly copy the lower part on my structure.

140
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:15,322
So we arrive here again, at the level of the ground,

141
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:19,322
again not on the support, but here.

142
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:27,241
I look at another free-body in the right part which includes

143
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:32,971
the second load of 5 Newtons.

144
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:42,024
The internal force in the upper part, then the internal force in the lower part.

145
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:51,661
Then the shape change is transferred to here.

146
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:46,751
Everything in compression.

147
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:58,701
We have here a quite symmetrical shape of the structure.

148
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:07,711
And since it is necessary to make pass the 5 Newtons from the left to the right,

149
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:12,401
this element is going to be in compression with 5 Newtons.

150
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:18,643
To summarize, here are the three contributions to the Cremona diagram

151
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:28,343
of the upper part, the left part and the right part.

152
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:36,325
With this, we have a tower which does not really have the shape

153
00:12:36,325 --> 00:12:38,945
of the Eiffel tower, but which gets closer to it.

154
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:42,958
We are going to use the i-Cremona applet to solve this structure.

155
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:44,938
The supports are already positioned 

156
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:48,108
Let's now do the first resolution such as we did it.

157
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:52,648
So we have placed two loads of 10 Newtons, with an orientation equal to 0,

158
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:54,758
that is to say it is orientated rightwards.

159
00:12:54,758 --> 00:12:57,328
So a first load at this level.

160
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:59,038
A second load at this level.

161
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:04,148
When we activate the resolution and control the polygon

162
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:06,868
to arrive to the top, on the symmetrical part,

163
00:13:06,868 --> 00:13:09,198
we can exactly see what we have seen before,

164
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,588
so a curved part on the left, a rectilinear part on the right.

165
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:16,438
That is not what we want

166
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:28,603
So we start again with another resolution, where we are going to add a load of 10 on the top,

167
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:40,473
and two loads of 5 on the bottom : one on the left and one on the right.

168
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,469
If we now activate the resolution, we have to bring back the structure,

169
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:48,469
and we can see that we have now a structure which is symmetrical.

170
00:13:48,469 --> 00:13:52,949
In the way we have placed the supports, we have directly obtained the correct shape.

171
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:55,729
For the case of the manual resolution, we should have iterated

172
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,649
till we find the proper shape.

173
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,010
You can now notice how the applet i-Cremona works:

174
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,954
if I take this force, and if I put it on the left side of the pink line,

175
00:14:04,964 --> 00:14:08,034
that is to say on the left side of the line which is perpendicular between the supports,

176
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:09,894
so this force acts on the left.

177
00:14:10,193 --> 00:14:12,653
If I put it on the right, it acts on the right.

178
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,613
And if I take both forces, and if I put them on the other side,

179
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:19,013
I have one of these asymmetrical shapes with the internal force on the other side.

180
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:24,466
Here, you can see a first sketch of the 300 m high tower

181
00:14:24,466 --> 00:14:30,106
which was designed by the engineer Koechlin of the Eiffel office.

182
00:14:30,106 --> 00:14:33,096
Mr Koechlin was a Swiss, hired by Gustave Eiffel.

183
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:37,886
He came with this first idea to create a 300 m high tower

184
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:42,726
with one, two, three, four, five and six storeys in total.

185
00:14:42,726 --> 00:14:47,156
While, as you know it, the final tower only has three.

186
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:51,936
But it was a first idea, relatively early in the process.

187
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:55,096
I am not going to show you how to solve this structure,

188
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:59,676
because it is part of the exercise which goes with this video series.

189
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:04,196
I wish you a lot of pleasure thinking about how the internal forces vary

190
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:09,516
and how they are transmitted from the left to the right.

191
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,704
In this lecture about towers and cantilevers, we have seen

192
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,514
what kind of loads act on these types of structures,

193
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:19,034
as well as how to obtain the internal forces.

194
00:15:19,034 --> 00:15:22,240
We have seen that the shape of the structure can result from the loads

195
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,720
which are applied to it.
