00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,068
Hello. In this video,

2
00:00:07,068 --> 00:00:10,447
I will talk to you about the typology of trusses with a constant and

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:13,630
a K-shaped truss configuration,

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,953
as you can see it on this picture.

5
00:00:16,813 --> 00:00:19,997
Let's first find out if this structure is statically determinate or not.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:25,539
We have a fixed support on the left, so we have two support reactions.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,659
On the right, a mobile support, so three support reactions in total.

8
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:35,280
We have one, two, three, four,

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,898
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

10
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:43,377
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:48,616
fifteen, sixteen and seventeen bars.

12
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:53,514
And we have one, two, three, four, five,

13
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:58,222
six, seven, eight, nine, ten nodes.

14
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:00,470
Two times ten.

15
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,215
That is to say three plus seventeen equal to twenty, equal to two times ten,

16
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,982
thus this structure

17
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,379
is a statically determinate.

18
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:16,468
We can calculate it with the methods for trusses we have used so far.

19
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:20,527
In this video, you can see this structure which I am loading

20
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:25,198
with three loads on the upper part.

21
00:01:25,827 --> 00:01:29,908
You can notice that I have also placed weights on the supports to stabilize it

22
00:01:29,918 --> 00:01:33,191
because the structure is very deep so it is not very stable,

23
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,094
it tends a bit to move transversally.

24
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,743
Here is what we see when we look at

25
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:41,270
the internal forces in a truss with K-shaped diagonals.

26
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,012
We could already see it before since I had put

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,754
timber elements, obviously,

28
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,496
to resist compression.

29
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:49,101
We can see that the upper part is similar to a truss

30
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:51,040
with N-shaped diagonals in compression, then

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,071
the lower part is similar to a truss with N-shaped diagonals in tension,

32
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:58,841
the posts being half tensioned in the upper part,

33
00:01:58,841 --> 00:02:01,545
and half compressed in the lower part.

34
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:06,038
Why would we want to create such a configuration?

35
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:08,490
We will look at it again a bit later.

36
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:12,735
This is a large structure which must carry a tall building

37
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:13,831
over several stories.

38
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:16,468
Here, we will have a story slab

39
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:22,099
and the layout of diagonals would thus enable us to have a door here

40
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,298
or else at this level there, a door here.

41
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,755
Thus, it can be quite interesting from an architectural point of view

42
00:02:28,755 --> 00:02:31,205
to have this configuration.

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,541
From a statical point of view, we will talk about it a bit later,

44
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:37,539
this is not a solution which is particularly inefficient.

45
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:41,378
Here, I have a K-shaped truss configuration

46
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:46,317
in which the part of the K goes inwards the structure.

47
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,096
And here, likewise, we can notice that the upper part of the truss

48
00:02:56,096 --> 00:03:00,703
has now diagonals in tension and posts in compression.

49
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:04,785
The lower part has diagonals in compression,

50
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,889
and posts in tension.

51
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,956
The use of either one of these configurations with K-shaped diagonals

52
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:15,504
will really depend on the structure.

53
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:19,026
I am going to show you an example soon in the lecture about towers.

54
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:24,120
We are now arrived at the end of this typology of trusses with a constant

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,406
depth.

56
00:03:25,426 --> 00:03:29,222
Not that I pretend that we have seen everything in terms of configuration.

57
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,431
We can see for example here, that adding intermediate bars,

58
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:35,012
we can obtain variants. We could also add

59
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:39,760
additional posts, these structures would remain statically determinate.

60
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:43,365
Likewise, it is absolutely possible to have the half of a truss

61
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:46,513
which has diagonals in tension, and the other half

62
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,361
diagonals in compression.

63
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,811
But with this, we have seen a wide variety of constructions.

64
00:03:53,305 --> 00:03:59,519
In the next video, you will see an assessment of their relative efficiency.

65
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,356
Are there solutions which are better than others?

66
00:04:04,503 --> 00:04:07,150
We have seen in this video about the typology

67
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,757
of trusses with a constant depth

68
00:04:08,757 --> 00:04:13,765
that the diagonals can have V-shaped, N-shaped, X-shaped, or K-shaped configurations.

69
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:17,232
Some of the solutions we have looked at are not statically determinate

70
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:19,482
but a lot of them are.

71
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:23,799
We have seen that the sign of the internal forces still respect what

72
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:27,054
we have seen about the arch-cable, that is to say that

73
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:29,981
chords in compression are on the side of the arch,

74
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,011
chords in tension on the side of the cable,

75
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:36,298
and that the inclination of the diagonals compared to the one of the arch

76
00:04:36,298 --> 00:04:39,308
indicates us if they are in tension or in compression.

77
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,050
We have also seen that the amplitude

78
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,278
of the internal forces is relatively similar between these various solutions.
