00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:02,760
Hello. In this video, we want to talk about

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,632
the efficiency of the various systems of trusses with a constant depth

3
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:11,131
with V-shaped, N-shaped, X-shaped and K-shaped diagonals,

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:12,898
as we have seen before.

5
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:15,030
After having seen all these systems of trusses,

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,798
you maybe asked yourself the question,

7
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:20,080
&quot;but, which configuration is the most efficient ?

8
00:00:20,082 --> 00:00:23,405
There is maybe one which is terribly unfavorable,

9
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,609
and another one which is very favorable !&quot;

10
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:29,152
We are also going to see principles of dimensioning of the chords

11
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:31,365
and also of the diagonals, for trusses,

12
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:34,527
and then we will look at the bending moments.

13
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:38,037
This picture shows a calculation which has been done

14
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,915
by Professor Muttoni to illustrate

15
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:45,584
the amount of matter which is necessary to build a truss,

16
00:00:45,584 --> 00:00:49,752
with chords with a constant cross-section, or with a variable cross-section.

17
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:54,846
Let's quickly come back to the cover picture to figure out what it is.

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:01:00,074
Here we can see that the chords have constant dimensions

19
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:03,578
over all the length; such as the diagonals and the posts.

20
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:07,426
Of course, it can hide something, because if the cross-section is --

21
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:09,533
and it is probably the case here --

22
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:12,740
if the cross-section is a tube, then it is possible

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,707
that the tube has much thicker walls near the supports

24
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:20,179
than the tube, for example, used for the diagonals which are at mid-span;

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,928
such as here, we use a larger tube,

26
00:01:22,932 --> 00:01:26,012
and maybe with very thick walls compared to here.

27
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:29,570
However, you can realize that it is going to have a certain cost

28
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:35,571
to change, for each diagonal, either the size of the profile used,

29
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:37,010
either the thickness of the tube.

30
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,504
That is thus something which is not always done,

31
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,233
and it is absolutely possible to have profiles which have chords,

32
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:48,561
for instance, with a constant size, the dimension of the cross-section would be choosen

33
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:52,153
for the largest internal force, generally at mid-span,

34
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,882
and then kept constant till the end.

35
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,745
This is what there is here, when we say that the chords

36
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:00,380
have a constant cross-section or a variable cross-section.

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,348
The variable cross-section will lead us

38
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:07,178
to be more economical, but however, to have to work more in the workshop.

39
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,757
Here, we have the volume,

40
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:17,488
the amount of matter used to create the structure,

41
00:02:17,488 --> 00:02:20,804
and it is quite proportionnal to the price of this structure.

42
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:24,618
So, the larger the value is, the more expensive the structure is.

43
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:30,186
Here, we have the slenderness ratio, L/h, that we have already seen earlier,

44
00:02:30,186 --> 00:02:38,621
which qualifies the ratio between the span of our truss, L,

45
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:40,461
and its depth.

46
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:46,799
So, the more slender the truss is, that is to say the larger the ratio L/h is,

47
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:48,607
the more the price increases.

48
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,612
So, how do the various types of trusses compare ?

49
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:57,258
Well, we can see that, for the part of chords with a constant cross-section,

50
00:02:57,258 --> 00:03:01,114
we have a very narrow gap here, represented in blue,

51
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,223
on the top of which we can find, using a bit more matter,

52
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:06,926
the K-shaped and N-shaped trusses,

53
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:09,137
and then, on the bottom, the X-shaped and V-shaped trusses.

54
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:11,253
But you can see that the difference is not very significant.

55
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:13,331
What is decisive is the slenderness ratio:

56
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,958
with a larger slenderness ratio, we use more matter,

57
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,399
the type of diagonal does not have a lot of influence.

58
00:03:19,508 --> 00:03:24,447
If we optimize the size of the chords, that is to say, if we often change

59
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:25,947
the size of the bars used,

60
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:28,391
we will use significantly less matter;

61
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:32,152
but it is not obviously cheaper, because we are going to use more labor:

62
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:34,719
in certain countries, labor is cheap,

63
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,940
we are going to save money; maybe in some others,

64
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,138
it will not be the case.

65
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:41,850
And we can see that here, again, most of our solutions

66
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,933
are located in a quite narrow strip.

67
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,214
On the left part, here, we have, depending on the slenderness ratio,

68
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:58,117
we have the deformability, or the deformation.

69
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:04,056
All this is related to the service limit state,

70
00:04:04,056 --> 00:04:06,262
we can roughly talk about the comfort of the structure.

71
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,709
So we can see that the more slender a structure is,

72
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,661
the more it is going to deform.

73
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:14,003
We find again here our two families of configurations,

74
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,364
the family with constant chords; and since we have used more matter

75
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:22,419
in the chords, it is logical that the structure deforms less.

76
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:28,642
And then the sky blue family, which uses more matter, deforms less,

77
00:04:29,212 --> 00:04:33,795
while the pink familly, which uses less matter,

78
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,171
here, deforms more.

79
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,975
But here again, you can see that the differences

80
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:44,091
between the various systems are quite unsignificant.

81
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:48,459
We have already seen that the internal force in the chords times the depth

82
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:51,429
is equal to the bending moment, which is approximately equal

83
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:55,830
to the shape of the arch-cable. It means that the internal force in the chords is equal

84
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,059
to the shape...

85
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,217
... of the arch-cable...

86
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:12,057
... divided by the depth of its cross-section,

87
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:15,351
that is to say the depth of our beam in each point.

88
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:21,892
So here, I have a graph which shows this depth; here, if I have a truss

89
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:28,273
which has a constant depth, well, I will have a constant depth...

90
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:36,126
I take the shape of the arch-cable, I divide it by its depth,

91
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:38,880
and then I obtain the internal force in the chords;

92
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,414
in the upper chord, I have a compressive internal force.

93
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:47,960
This internal force is going to have the same shape

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,536
than the arch-cable, then a parabolic shape, which is going to increase

95
00:05:55,435 --> 00:06:00,110
to reach its maximum in the middle, and to be roughly equal to zero

96
00:06:01,932 --> 00:06:06,251
at the level of the supports, and then for the lower chord,

97
00:06:06,894 --> 00:06:09,929
it will be the same, except that it will be a tensile internal force.

98
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,274
When we see this, we think:

99
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:20,415
&quot;there are maybe other solutions, when we have a constant chord,

100
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,889
if we keep the cross-section of the chord constant,

101
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,600
while we dimension it for the place where there is the largest internal force,

102
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,169
then, near the supports, or even here, the section is much larger.

103
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,024
Maybe it would be possible to also play with the depth of the cross-section.

104
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,751
This is what we are going to see in the next videos.

105
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:43,350
We have seen, about the configurations with V-shaped,

106
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,273
K-shaped, X-shaped, etc. diagonals, that the efficiency, for these systems,

107
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:49,495
is comparable.

108
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,440
Likewise, the internal forces in the chords are comparable,

109
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,703
which means that we can choose the type of diagonal,

110
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:58,932
for trusses with a constant depth, in a rather free manner,

111
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:01,127
according to, for example, other constraints,

112
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:03,942
whether it be geometrical constraints, to make pass

113
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:07,469
certain installations or people, if the trusses are very large,

114
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:10,967
or else simply linked to a personal choice.
