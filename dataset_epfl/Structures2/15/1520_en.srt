00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,110
Hello.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,053
In this video about the beam grids,

3
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:06,843
I will present you the principle of this kind of structures,

4
00:00:06,843 --> 00:00:10,549
and the type of load-bearing elements that it uses.

5
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:14,493
We will have a look at the most used materials for the construction of beam grids

6
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:18,803
and I will present you several possible geometries for this kind of structures.

7
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:23,197
We have already seen, with truss grids,

8
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:27,738
structures which are very similar to beam grids.

9
00:00:27,738 --> 00:00:32,548
There is a family of beams which span in one direction

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,939
- here the orange beams - well, there are severals,

11
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,742
and so on,

12
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:45,820
until the end,

13
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:52,931
and then in the other direction, we have another family of beams

14
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:54,521
- which I draw here in green -

15
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,905
which can take some loads.

16
00:01:00,723 --> 00:01:03,756
When we place a load at any point, it can go

17
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:08,826
either in the direction of a green beam, either in the direction of an orange beam,

18
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:14,491
either a part in one direction and a part in the other direction, in a general way.

19
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,000
In the same way than for the truss grids,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,476
we are relatively free for the arrangement of the supports:

21
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:25,874
here, we have a beam grid leaning on linear supports

22
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:30,054
- they are not linear but point supports ; however, they are closely distributed

23
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,795
so they can almost be considered as linear -

24
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:37,075
or, on the opposite, we can have a beam grid leaning on point supports,

25
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:45,493
with a small number of supports, which provides the structure

26
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:47,597
with a larger flexibility

27
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:51,766
given the reduced number of interferences with the load-bearing systems,

28
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:54,332
but in principle, we still have the same thing,

29
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:59,228
that is to say that the orange beams will carry in this direction

30
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:04,537
and the green beams in the perpendicular direction.

31
00:02:06,237 --> 00:02:09,747
It should be noted that like for truss grids,

32
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:13,679
if we do not have a lot of load-bearing elements, the load must be carried several times,

33
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:20,199
that is to say that a load which goes from here will be able to go in both directions

34
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:27,378
but once it will reach the end of this structure,

35
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:31,420
it will have to be carried in both directions

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,562
to reach the supports

37
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:35,375
because here, we have not reached the supports yet,

38
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,318
we have to go till there to reach the supports,

39
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:42,492
and to do this, it is necessary that the loads are carried twice,

40
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:47,790
so, the type of beam grids with point supports will have larger internal forces

41
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,140
and will need more material than a beam grid

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,740
on linear supports like this one on the left.

43
00:02:56,423 --> 00:03:00,670
The materials usually used for the construction of beam grids

44
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,230
are on the one hand, reinforced concrete.

45
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,919
Here, you can see a double gymnasium:

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,131
there are indeed two gymnasiums side by side,

47
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:10,308
with a beam grid roofing.

48
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:13,462
It should be noted that here, we have a beam grid on linear supports

49
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:16,812
since there are large concrete beams all around

50
00:03:16,812 --> 00:03:18,681
which are supported on these V-shaped supports,

51
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:23,121
that is a quite audacious arrangement for this construction.

52
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:27,423
Here, you have several examples of steel beam grids,

53
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:30,728
first, on the top, the project of Mies van der Rohe

54
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,998
for an office building

55
00:03:32,998 --> 00:03:36,344
for the rum producer Bacardi in Cuba, in 1957,

56
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,544
- this project has not been built - but we can obviously notice

57
00:03:38,544 --> 00:03:41,019
that one of the biggest advantage of this beam grid

58
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,772
is that the number of supports is very small:

59
00:03:43,772 --> 00:03:46,291
there are only eight supports on the rim

60
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,220
for a large inner area,

61
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,908
and on the left, a project which was built ten years later,

62
00:03:51,908 --> 00:03:55,150
the Art National Gallery in Berlin,

63
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,576
which enabled Mies van der Rohe to make

64
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:02,108
one of its largest steel beam grids.

65
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,399
We can notice again that there are very few supports,

66
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:07,609
which facilitates the use of such a large structure.

67
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:11,585
Here you have a very original structure, so much

68
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:15,651
that it has been used as logo for the course &quot;The Art of Structures II&quot;; 

69
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:18,659
that is a beam grid whose beams,

70
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:22,710
in the horizontal direction in the picture - which we cannot see here -

71
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,100
are steel beams, and then, in the other direction,

72
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,917
there are UHPFRC beams, that is Ultra-High Performance...

73
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:32,654
- I am going to note it for you to know it,

74
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:35,981
even though that is not something I will ask you in the exam,

75
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,951
that is just for you to know what it is.

76
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:49,046
...Fiber Reinforced Concrete.

77
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:54,451
That is a very special concrete, extremely expensive,

78
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:56,905
but which has the advantage to provide us with the opportunity

79
00:04:56,905 --> 00:04:58,776
to make very thin elements,

80
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:04,456
I think these are at most 80mm thick,

81
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,882
which would be impossible with normal concrete,

82
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:09,526
just because of the requirements for the cover,

83
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:13,098
but this Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete is completely watertight,

84
00:05:13,108 --> 00:05:17,751
therefore it is not subjected to the same rules for cover of reinforcing bars.

85
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,764
That is a very beautiful structure anyway, we all agree on that.

86
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:24,678
The typology of beam grids is not limited to the ones we have seen,

87
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,601
where we had two groups of beams

88
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,291
with one going in a direction and the other one in another,

89
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:32,071
well, that is what we have down here,

90
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,941
for this industrial building in Lausanne,

91
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:42,055
so here we have large beams in one direction,

92
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:49,394
and then in the other direction, we have another set of large beams,

93
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:59,657
with only two families of beams perpendicular to each other.

94
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:04,995
Above, we have the art gallery of Yale University,

95
00:06:04,995 --> 00:06:11,291
where we can notice three beams systems:

96
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:14,970
one which is more or less vertical in the picture,

97
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:19,150
another which goes down leftwards,

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:32,860
and a third one which goes down rightwards.

99
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:41,427
So, the interest of such a system is that since we increase the number of beams,

100
00:06:41,427 --> 00:06:45,323
each of these beams carries a smaller load

101
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:49,497
and then, we can make beams with smaller dimensions,

102
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:51,871
but the formwork however, certainly see it,

103
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,586
is especially complicated to make.

104
00:06:54,586 --> 00:07:01,856
On the right, we have a similar system made by Pier Luigi Nervi for the Naples train station.

105
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:07,781
We have three families of beams:

106
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,161
this family here,

107
00:07:11,953 --> 00:07:14,933
a family which goes down leftwards,

108
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:23,243
and a family which goes down rightwards.

109
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:39,140
And then finally, we have this example which comes from Madrid,

110
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,800
for a metro station,

111
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,126
in which we have a large number of beam families which interesct,

112
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:51,746
so once again, beams in this direction, then

113
00:07:55,528 --> 00:07:57,258
in this direction,

114
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:06,005
and in the opposite direction,

115
00:08:07,511 --> 00:08:12,599
but there is a fourth family of beams, here,

116
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:18,250
which are the ones which are more or less horizontal in the drawing;

117
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:25,971
so here, we have four families of beams which cross in this roofing.

118
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,972
Finally, who said that the beam grids

119
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,381
were limited to rectilinear systems?

120
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:35,819
Actually, there is no reason, if you have a system which adapts well,

121
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:41,439
that is an access ramp for a multistory parking garage,

122
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:48,112
and here, we have beams which are circular in one direction

123
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:52,412
and then which are rectilinear in another direction.

124
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:58,276
A beam does not need to be a rectilinear element.

125
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:01,310
Of course, that is simpler in a certain point of view,

126
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,171
but if it is preferable to have another arrangement

127
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:09,381
for the use we want to have,

128
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:11,326
there is no fundamental problem

129
00:09:11,326 --> 00:09:15,076
to have a non-rectilinear beam grid.

130
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,024
That is what we can see on the right,

131
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:22,205
in another work of Pier Luigi Nervi,

132
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:25,493
with several families of beams:

133
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:30,423
we are going to say that we have beams which are directly connected to the supports,

134
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,314
here, there and there,

135
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:39,269
and then I am going to draw them with the same color in the other direction,

136
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:42,480
all these beams get a little further from the supports

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,976
but they directly reach them, following axes

138
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:51,336
which directly link the posts straight ahead.

139
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,701
Then, we have a second family of beams, here,

140
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:58,100
which are also rectilinear beams, really rectilinear,

141
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,970
but which are located at the interface

142
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,040
between the panels about which we will talk a bit later.

143
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,684
The rectilinear beams which do not extend till the supports,

144
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:12,574
cross the beams which extend till the supports,

145
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:16,047
then they create beautiful rectilinear lines in the whole structure;

146
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:19,842
and then, finally, we have two additional families of beams:

147
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:25,832
one family of curved beams which go in the direction of the support,

148
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,707
and this corresponds well to what is happening

149
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:35,767
inside a slab, we will see it later,

150
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,821
so here, Nervi really used his knowledge in this field;

151
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:43,131
and then, finally, we have a last family of beams,

152
00:10:43,131 --> 00:10:49,171
which are more or less circular around the column,

153
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,592
and which perpendicularly cross - or almost perpendicularly -

154
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:57,513
all the other beams of the structure.

155
00:10:57,513 --> 00:11:00,649
So, here, we can see several families of beams

156
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,078
on which we place afterwards a very thin concrete flooring,

157
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:11,078
which only has a small span, that is a system which is quite efficient.

158
00:11:11,998 --> 00:11:15,051
In this video, I have introduced to you beam grids:

159
00:11:15,051 --> 00:11:16,531
I first showed you

160
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,956
that the load-bearing systems are similar

161
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,300
to the ones seen for truss grids,

162
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,496
I told you that these beam grids

163
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:27,780
are generally made either out of reinforced concrete or steel,

164
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,476
I did not tell you but I should have, we also have the possibility

165
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:33,393
to have timber beam grids,

166
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:35,263
even though this is not usual.

167
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:39,486
Geometrically, beam grids can simply be orthogonal

168
00:11:39,492 --> 00:11:42,336
with two families of beams which perpendicularly intersect,

169
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,551
or else we can have more than two families,

170
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,236
three or four easily,

171
00:11:46,236 --> 00:11:48,918
which cross at regular angles,

172
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:51,692
and which create an interesting space.

173
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:54,401
Finally, we have seen that the beams themselves

174
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:56,401
do not necessarily need to be rectilinear,

175
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:59,091
they can be curved,

176
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:02,092
in such a way that they correspond more to the geometry of the structure

177
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,772
or that they more directly bring the internal forces to the columns.
