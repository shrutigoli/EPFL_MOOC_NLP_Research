00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:04,608
Hello, in this video, I will talk to you about slabs on point supports,

2
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:07,896
that is to say slabs supported by columns.

3
00:00:07,896 --> 00:00:12,102
As a consequence of this, we will see that there is a concentration of internal forces

4
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:14,545
which occurs on top of the columns,

5
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,607
which can lead to the phenomenon of punching,

6
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:19,480
which must be avoided by all means.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,581
I will propose you a few configurations for slabs on point supports

8
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:26,656
and I will show you that we can also

9
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:30,294
obtain equivalent spans for this type of slabs.

10
00:00:30,294 --> 00:00:32,674
In this video, you can see a slab represented

11
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:36,381
by a black cardboard sheet which is supported on four columns.

12
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:41,061
I use my hands to apply a load more or less distributed

13
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,984
to deform this slab.

14
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:48,920
We can see here that this slab deforms between the supports

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,891
in the parallel direction here, and also in the direction parallel to these two sides.

16
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:58,315
That is what we will also see behind,

17
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:03,247
and then also in the middle; we have

18
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:10,069
a deformation which is larger in the middle than on the edges.

19
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:13,677
That is not easy to represent graphically,

20
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:15,910
but I hope you can see what it is,

21
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,876
nothing prevent you from taking a small piece of cardboard

22
00:01:18,876 --> 00:01:21,427
to make a little experiment similar to this one.

23
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:26,168
What we notice is that when we have a columun, here,

24
00:01:27,718 --> 00:01:29,530
on which come the internal forces,

25
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,726
that is what Nervi had illustrated very well

26
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:39,174
creating this beams grid with, here, a large concentration of ribs

27
00:01:39,174 --> 00:01:41,177
just on top of the column,

28
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:44,821
well that is what we have because we have a lot of elements

29
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:47,920
which are in tension in their upper part,

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,211
that is represented by a familly of trusses,

31
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,362
these are structures which we know well,

32
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:58,613
this is a valid representation to illustrate the internal forces in a slab

33
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:00,460
near a column.

34
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,671
So we have a concentration of all these tensile internal forces

35
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,564
in the upper part,

36
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:13,233
and then I am going to represent the part of the trusses which is only in compression.

37
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,093
We thus have here diagonals in compression

38
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:19,019
which go towards the column.

39
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,305
These are the diagonals which are a bit further,

40
00:02:23,305 --> 00:02:27,727
then, they lean one more time,

41
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:30,196
to go down towards the column.

42
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,758
We cannot see very well here, but there are many

43
00:02:33,758 --> 00:02:38,291
diagonals in compression which are supported by this column.

44
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,087
The lower part of the slab

45
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:42,530
is obviously in compression in this zone here.

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:55,620
We thus have a concentration of internal forces on the top,

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,830
that is to say on top of the columns

48
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,204
and this can lead to the phenomenon which we call punching.

49
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,418
- that is what I have drawn below -

50
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:25,820
so, here, we have a column with a compressive internal force;

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,511
on top of this column, we have the formation,

52
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:37,814
inside the concrete, of a kind of cone,

53
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:46,204
which can separate from the rest of the slab which I draw here in green,

54
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,176
and of course the reinforcement, which I do not represent here,

55
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:53,547
but when, this phenomenon occurs, most of the reinforcement bars,

56
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:57,644
at least the horizontal bars does not have much effect.

57
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:05,340
And potentially, it can lead to the falling of the slab.

58
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,114
This is catastrophic because if you are under this slab,

59
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,321
its huge weight is going to crush you

60
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,376
and, furthermore, if this slab falls onto the following slab,

61
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:17,761
there are chances that the following slab does not resist

62
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,489
and that this collapse spreads across the whole building.

63
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,156
So this punching phenomenon must really be avoided by all means,

64
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:27,476
that is why I mention it in the introductory lecture,

65
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,844
even though we are not going to get into the details

66
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:31,922
of how to fight against punching.

67
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,741
For the moment, I would only like you to know that it exists.

68
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,863
How can we tackle punching?

69
00:04:36,863 --> 00:04:38,544
Robert Maillard, the Swiss engineer,

70
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,443
had already an intuition about this

71
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,998
in his first flat slabs constructions.

72
00:04:43,998 --> 00:04:47,517
We can see a flat slab which has,

73
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:54,576
in this part here, an element which widens

74
00:04:55,306 --> 00:04:59,001
and that Robert Maillart called a mushroom.

75
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:05,207
The interest of this mushroom is that, indeed,

76
00:05:05,207 --> 00:05:09,070
the internal forces can reach the column not directly,

77
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,037
but in a more gradual way through this big mushroom.

78
00:05:13,165 --> 00:05:18,576
We can notice a similarity between the solution of Robert Maillart, on the left,

79
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,072
and the solution of the Palace of the Popes, on the right,

80
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,731
which we have studied

81
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:27,274
when we have started to look at the realization of the flooring,

82
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,091
since indeed, in both cases, we have a shape

83
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:36,118
which is a bit the one of a rib, where the internal forces can gradually go down

84
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:38,685
towards the column.

85
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:43,685
In the administration building of the Johnson company,

86
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:47,103
Frank Lloyd Wright, at the end of the 1930s,

87
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:51,030
went to the extreme of the expression of the structure,

88
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,516
since actually the structure, here,

89
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:58,632
is composed of mushrooms - big circular mushrooms,

90
00:05:58,632 --> 00:06:02,220
which barely touch each other, which are supported on columns,

91
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,616
and on which a very light and transparent structure

92
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:08,950
is used as roofing.

93
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,309
So we have here a structure which is only

94
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:16,823
a juxtaposition of columns with a big mushroom on top

95
00:06:16,823 --> 00:06:19,952
and that really looks like mushrooms in this configuration.

96
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,794
However, nowadays, it started with Le Corbusier,

97
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:25,811
but that is still very strong,

98
00:06:25,811 --> 00:06:29,174
the trend is to make what we call a flat slab,

99
00:06:29,174 --> 00:06:33,996
that is to say to directly have a post on which we have a slab,

100
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:38,402
without any width changings, an entirely flat slab.

101
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:41,925
That is easier from the point of view of the building process,

102
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:45,214
that is easier to place elements under the slab,

103
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:50,007
however, we must carefully deal with the concentration of internal forces

104
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:52,900
on top of the columns by means of specialized devices,

105
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,030
and then, maybe increasing the depth of the slab

106
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,590
for it to work.

107
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:01,692
If we look, here, for flat slabs,

108
00:07:01,692 --> 00:07:05,522
we have two configurations which are represented,

109
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:07,652
to give us the equivalent spans.

110
00:07:07,652 --> 00:07:12,252
The case of a slab on columns with an outlying wall,

111
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:16,935
that is for example the case when we have a underground story

112
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:22,052
since we will have cellar walls around, and then columns inside,

113
00:07:22,052 --> 00:07:24,942
we can see that the equivalent spans are around 0.9L,

114
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:28,893
and if we are very very far, very regular, very far from the edges,

115
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,778
we can reach a value of 0.82.

116
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:36,894
The case of the right is the one of a building with only columns,

117
00:07:36,894 --> 00:07:40,209
so there is no wall around, there are only columns,

118
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,044
and then we will have for example a glass façade,

119
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:47,210
we can see that the equivalent span coefficients are larger than one,

120
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,526
we can find again, very far from the façade,

121
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:53,900
0.82, but otherwise, we have values around one,

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,740
sometimes a bit smaller though.

123
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,625
That means that for a same span,

124
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,097
a slab on point supports, on columns,

125
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,200
will require more material,

126
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,215
to be thicker than a slab supported on walls,

127
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:10,396
because we have seen that for the slabs on walls,

128
00:08:10,396 --> 00:08:13,047
we generally had values smaller than one,

129
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,799
which could even go down to about 0.6.

130
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,772
In this video, we have seen that in slabs on point supports,

131
00:08:20,772 --> 00:08:24,844
there is a large concentration of internal forces on top of the columns,

132
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:28,645
which can lead to the punching phenomenon which must be avoided by all means.

133
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,001
A constructive solution to avoid this problem

134
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,833
is to place mushrooms,

135
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:35,655
which are widenings on top of the columns;

136
00:08:35,655 --> 00:08:38,517
for flat slabs we do not use this kind of solution,

137
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,042
but we will have to take it into account during the dimensioning stage.

138
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:44,656
Fianlly, the equivalent span have been indicated

139
00:08:44,656 --> 00:08:46,980
for the slabs on one-time bearings;

140
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,481
their values range between 0.9 and one in most cases.
