00:00:00,514 --> 00:00:01,565
Hello, in this video,

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:04,033
I will talk to you about predimensioning of slabs.

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,041
For this, I will introduce the concept of equivalent span

4
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,904
then we will see what we precisely want when we deal

5
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:13,539
with predimensioning of slabs.

6
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:17,332
On the basis of the support conditions of slabs,

7
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,818
we will look at how they behave.

8
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:24,641
Then, we will get to the concept of equivalent span which will enable us

9
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:29,277
to proceed to the predimensioning of slabs on a systematic basis.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,701
This predimensioning will simply consist in obtaining the minimal depth

11
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,705
to give to each element of the slab.

12
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,510
The predimensioning of the amount of tensile reinforcement which 

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,004
should be placed inside the slab will not be dealt with.

14
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:45,304
That is a bit different

15
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,723
from what we have done before with beams,

16
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:51,940
since in the case of beams, we have also determined the amount of reinforcement.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,537
We are going to look at

18
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:57,236
some characteristic configurations of slabs.

19
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:01,600
Firs of all, this slab on the left, with a support on the left and a support on the right

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,720
so a simple support on each side

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,189
represented with one line.

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,717
The distance between both these supports is equal to L

23
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:12,362
and then,

24
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:17,725
on the top and on the bottom, no supports, so a free edge.

25
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:20,554
The internal forces inside a slab beam which we extract of this slab

26
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:22,130
are represented here.

27
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,750
We then have an arch

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,254
in compression, together with a cable in tension,

29
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:32,804
and the span to be taken into account

30
00:01:34,153 --> 00:01:35,922
here, is

31
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:41,760
directly the distance between the supports L.

32
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,884
If we look at the right side, we have a slab which is clamped on both sides

33
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:52,022
so with a double line on the left and on the right.

34
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:58,241
However, on the top and on the bottom, it is still free

35
00:01:58,241 --> 00:02:00,491
so we draw a free edge.

36
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:05,455
Again, isolating a small piece of beam from this slab

37
00:02:05,455 --> 00:02:08,792
and using the representation which I have introduced

38
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:15,792
within the framework of the video about continuous beams, we get a configuration

39
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,096
which, in theory, would remain within the depth of the slab.

40
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:22,259
Well, that is not exactly the case in my drawing,

41
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,889
but we obtain a configuration of the slab in which we can recognize

42
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:28,081
cantilever elements on the left and on the right.

43
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:34,614
And then in the central part, we have an element which strongly looks like

44
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,487
what we have seen before,

45
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:40,081
that is to say a classic arch-cable.

46
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:47,081
And here, between these two elements, we have the equivalent span

47
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:52,360
which we note Leq.

48
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:56,745
So I also write Leq on the top.

49
00:02:57,137 --> 00:03:02,468
In this case, it is approximately equal to 0.67 times the span.

50
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:06,572
If we know how to dimension this slab elements with this span,

51
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:09,583
we will also know how to predimension this slab element

52
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:12,424
with a smaller equivalent span.

53
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:17,164
In this picture, we have two other configurations, the case of a slab

54
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:22,407
which is clamped on the right and simply supported on the left,

55
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,645
with free edges on the top and on the bottom.

56
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:35,758
Here, we have the arch which goes from the left support

57
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:39,623
but which stops before the right support.

58
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:43,419
We will have an equivalent span smaller than L

59
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,655
but larger than what we had before,

60
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,181
approximately, Leq = 0.8 * L.

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,785
That is roughly the same thing when we have a cantilever

62
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:12,068
with obviously three free edges

63
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:17,740
and then a clamped support on the left.

64
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,505
The equivalent span in the case of a cantilever

65
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:27,119
must be taken at 1.69*L.

66
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:33,244
This picture summarizes for the case of a square slab,

67
00:04:33,244 --> 00:04:35,481
so its dimensions are

68
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:42,697
L times L

69
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:54,941
and the equivalent span is equal to a k factor

70
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:59,256
which is given in the table which we are going to look at,

71
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,753
times the span L.

72
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:09,831
So one more time, to be able to read well this figure, it is necessary to remember

73
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,954
that we have here a free edge,

74
00:05:13,177 --> 00:05:15,990
here a supported edge

75
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:23,041
and here a clamped edge

76
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:27,502
which does not allow rotation.

77
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,258
We can notice that in this table,

78
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:37,258
there is a family of configurations for which the k factor is larger than one.

79
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,882
There are a few cases.

80
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:44,201
It should be noticed that this case is absolutely unstable,

81
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:48,343
since we only have a support on the left and not enough supports

82
00:05:48,343 --> 00:05:50,961
so the structure here is going to fall.

83
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:53,474
But we have included it in the table to be complete.

84
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:56,381
Here, we have a certain number of cases, especially the cantilever

85
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,681
which we have seen before or else cases which are similar to the cantilever,

86
00:05:59,681 --> 00:06:02,713
where the equivalent span to take into account is larger

87
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,946
than the distance between the supports.

88
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:08,944
And then, on the opposite, here on the bottom,

89
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,954
we have a configuration where the slab is clamped on all its sides

90
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:18,792
and where the equivalent span to take into account is only

91
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,921
0.56 times the span of the slab.

92
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:26,507
We have in this picture equivalent span factors

93
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,736
for a rectangular slab.

94
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:33,141
It still has a small side which is equal to L,

95
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,030
and the long side is equal to 1.5*L.

96
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,967
If your slab is between both, you can interpolate

97
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:49,360
or use the most cautious value to proceed to dimensioning.

98
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,609
The equivalent span is always defined as

99
00:06:52,609 --> 00:06:56,773
k times L where L is the smaller of two spans.

100
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,492
Here, you can see values which sometimes are larger than two

101
00:07:00,492 --> 00:07:02,040
in a certain number of cases,

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,403
and then which are a little bit larger than before.

103
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,011
which is logical since the influence

104
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,680
of the longer span can be felt in this configuration.

105
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,469
Once we have obtained the equivalent span,

106
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:21,465
it is necessary to proceed to the dimensioning and I am going to do a reminder.

107
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:25,559
This topic has been seen in the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;,

108
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,297
but there are mainly two ways to proceed to the dimensioning

109
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:34,339
which must be done simultaneously, or let's say, one after each other.

110
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:40,786
That is, on the one hand, the Serviceability Limit State, in which we care

111
00:07:40,786 --> 00:07:43,200
about the behavior of the structure which must be satisfactory.

112
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,445
For example, we avoid accumulations of water like on the structure on the left.

113
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:53,038
And then, on the right, the Ultimate Limit State, that is to say the collape.

114
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,627
It is obviously unacceptable that a structure collapses onto its occupants.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,120
These two criteria,

116
00:08:01,832 --> 00:08:04,580
the Serviceability Limit State (SLS) and the Ultimate Limit State (ULS),

117
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:10,203
have been considered by Professor Muttoni in his book

118
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,370
to create this figure which gives,

119
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,460
as a function of the equivalent span of a slab,

120
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,323
the allowable slenderness ratio which it can have.

121
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:23,488
This, for two types of loadings.

122
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:31,353
A light type of loading (2kN/m²), it would correspond

123
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:34,280
to an accomodation building.

124
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,392
A heavier type (5kN/m²), it would maybe correspond

125
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:42,461
to a school or to a shopping center.

126
00:08:42,582 --> 00:08:45,582
If you have special structures such as libraries for example,

127
00:08:45,582 --> 00:08:47,150
or something else, this figure should not be applied

128
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,308
because that would not be sufficient

129
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,239
or it would be necessary to decrease the slenderness ratio in a corresponding way.

130
00:08:55,239 --> 00:09:02,239
And then here, we have the vertical deflection which we are going to accept.

131
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:07,592
In most cases, we can accept a vertical deflection equal to 1/300th of the span.

132
00:09:07,592 --> 00:09:12,035
But if we have fragile elements, like glass elements, etc.

133
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:17,705
which are connected to the structure, we will want to limit the vertical deflection to 1/500th of the span.

134
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:22,413
On the right, I have drawn simple beams which have, respectively, a slenderness ratio

135
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:25,366
of 1/30, 1/20 and 1/15

136
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:30,846
to give you an idea about the slenderness ratio which we can expect.

137
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:33,641
If we take a slab with an equivalent span

138
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:40,480
of 6 meters and the conditions which are the least limitative,

139
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,880
that is to say 2 kN/m² of load and a vertical deflection of 1/300,

140
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:54,225
we can read here that the ratio is equal to 19.5.

141
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,695
What does it mean?

142
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,764
It means that in this case,

143
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,300
the minimal depth of the slab is equal to 6 mètres...

144
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,300
... so 6000 mm / 19.5 that is to say around 310 mm.

145
00:10:14,961 --> 00:10:20,760
We will see other examples of application in one of the videos which follow.

146
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,121
As I said in the introduction, in a concrete slab,

147
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:27,800
there is of course concrete but there are also reinforcing bars.

148
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,877
We can see here the lower reinforcement

149
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:34,577
and the upper reinforcement.

150
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:37,280
What we do during the predimensioning here is only

151
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,257
determining the total depth of the slab,

152
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,052
the minimal depth that we will have to give to it.

153
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:48,761
It will then be necessary, for a dimensioning,

154
00:10:48,761 --> 00:10:51,667
to proceed to the calculation of the amount of reinforcement required,

155
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:54,638
but this is out of the scope of this course.

156
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:58,240
In this video, we looked at predimensioning

157
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,734
of building slabs.

158
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,064
We have seen that, on the basis of the types of support,

159
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:05,579
we can determine an equivalent span for slabs

160
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,941
and that on the basis of this equivalent span, inserting

161
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:10,143
the types of loads and the deflection requirements,

162
00:11:10,241 --> 00:11:15,163
we can obtain the minimal depth to give to slabs.

163
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,980
I have also insisted on the fact that it is only the depth.

164
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,162
Later, to build a concrete slab,

165
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:24,528
it will also be necessary to determine the amount of reinforcement

166
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:27,041
but this course does not deal with this.
