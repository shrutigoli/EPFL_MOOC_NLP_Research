00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:01,300
Hello.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,048
With this video,

3
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:05,107
we start dealing with a very important topic : slabs

4
00:00:05,107 --> 00:00:07,980
which are a very popular type of load-carrying systems nowadays.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,062
In this video, we will see what types of slabs exist

6
00:00:12,062 --> 00:00:14,486
and we will classify them according to the type of their supports,

7
00:00:14,486 --> 00:00:16,644
either linear, either point-type.

8
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:21,183
Here, on this picture taken about ten years ago in Europe,

9
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:23,363
we can see two buildings under construction

10
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:27,096
whose load-bearing systems are fundamentally different.

11
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:31,545
These two buildings rest on columns,

12
00:00:31,545 --> 00:00:33,243
on the left, they are square,

13
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,848
on the right, they are circular,

14
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:38,502
but that is not a significant difference for us,

15
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,733
neither for the structure by the way.

16
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:48,751
We have vertical columns for both systems.

17
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:57,689
We can also see that the diameter of the column

18
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:01,750
increases according to the story where it is located, which is logical,

19
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,830
the largest columns being in the lower part.

20
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,031
Then, if we look on the left,

21
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:13,327
we have in a classical manner, as we saw in the previous video,

22
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:19,007
beams, which probably have a shape like that,

23
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,614
a kind of inverted T,

24
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:25,587
and this was made to facilitate the setting up

25
00:01:25,587 --> 00:01:30,535
of the concrete boards were placed on top of them thereafter,

26
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,250
as it can be seen on the left part.

27
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,160
Here, we have a system, again, with precast concrete boards;

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,830
we can see that they have a certain width, and there are several which are visible.

29
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,449
There is the same thing on the upper story:

30
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:58,631
that is again a classic precast construction.

31
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,605
On the right, on the opposite, we only have one support,

32
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:07,591
which is directly the slab which carries everything

33
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,540
through its own thickness.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,286
Here, on the upper floor, we can notice that the ground floor's slab is much thicker

35
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,950
than the upper levels' slabs:

36
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,340
that is probably due to its function

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,263
-maybe that is a shop,

38
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:28,296
nay a public place such as a restaurant

39
00:02:28,296 --> 00:02:29,739
or something like that-

40
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:32,679
and that is logical that the loads are larger.

41
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,210
On the right, we have what we call a floor slab,

42
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:49,691
while on the left, we really have a slab

43
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:56,473
on linear supports,

44
00:02:56,473 --> 00:03:00,473
the linear supports being the yellow beams

45
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,353
which we have previously identified.

46
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,004
We are going to see that in more details here

47
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:10,893
with examples of slabs on linear supports;

48
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:15,411
once again, on the left, the system which we have seen several times,

49
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:22,136
that is to say a systems with one or several main beams

50
00:03:22,136 --> 00:03:26,246
in one direction, which carry secondary beams

51
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:29,737
in the other direction,

52
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:35,450
which, themselves carry boards

53
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,049
in the third direction.

54
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,460
All this is a system,

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:51,160
and they are slabs on linear supports for example,

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,490
on bi-directional springers, here, but we can also find other solutions:

57
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:58,190
the linearly borne slabs,

58
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,830
with beams in only one direction

59
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,300
-beams or springers, that is the same thing-

60
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,375
and then a slab on a wall, a very classic example,

61
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,991
at least in Switzerland, for accommodation buildings,

62
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:15,840
where we have concrete or masonry walls on which

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,596
we have relatively thin slabs which simply carry loads between these walls.

64
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:24,078
On the right, we have the case of an industrial building,

65
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:29,328
where the springers, in both directions, are constituted of steel elements

66
00:04:29,328 --> 00:04:33,000
with hemstiches enabling to make pass a lot of installations

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,350
underneath the slab.

68
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,492
Another possibility is to have point-type supports

69
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:45,303
under the slab, the clearest case being the case of the floor slab

70
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:46,719
which I showed you before.

71
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,962
We only have one column:

72
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:53,600
here, it has a small plate on top of it, and then the slab

73
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,950
is directly supported on this column.

74
00:04:56,497 --> 00:05:00,860
However, there are internal forces concentrations on top of these columns

75
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,084
-I will talk about it in one of the next videos-

76
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:05,758
and a solution to avoid this concentration,

77
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:09,416
or at least to more efficiently spread the internal forces,

78
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,402
is what we call a mushroom:

79
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,275
here, it has a shape which is quite close to the one of a mushroom,

80
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,238
but that is sometimes more schematic.

81
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:20,459
The advantage here is that the surface on which the slab leans

82
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,070
is much larger, so the internal forces are more widely distributed.

83
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,496
We can get a solution similar to the one of the mushroom

84
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,970
with an additional thickness of the floor slab,

85
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,729
that is to say that the slab is locally thicker,

86
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:36,207
because the internal forces on top of the column

87
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:38,138
are quite significant.

88
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:41,413
Finally, we have what we call a cassette slab,

89
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,243
or else an voided slab

90
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:50,239
or else a ribbed slab,

91
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,761
they are all synonyms,

92
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,734
but as we can see it on the picture,

93
00:05:55,734 --> 00:06:00,287
that is a slab in which we have a beam grid,

94
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:04,797
except that on top of the columns, the slab is solid,

95
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,391
because the internal forces are larger.

96
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:11,500
That is a quite frequently used solution.

97
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,085
In this introductory video,

98
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,761
I have shown you how we can classify slabs,

99
00:06:15,761 --> 00:06:19,521
distinguishing between slabs on linear supports, that is to say walls or beams,

100
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,939
and slabs on point supports, which are directly carried

101
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:24,439
by columns.
