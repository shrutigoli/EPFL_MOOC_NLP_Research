00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:03,910
Hello. In this video, I am going to give you an example

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,186
of predimensioning of the slabs of a rather simple building.

3
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:11,241
I will briefly talk about the configuration of the building,

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:15,451
we will especially see that it is usual not to have the same configuration

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:18,469
for the basement than for the upper floors.

6
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:22,557
The purpose of this exercise is to obtain, for all the slabs of this building,

7
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:25,640
the depth they should have.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,486
That is clear that in a later dimensioning,

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,874
there will be some considerations to make,

10
00:00:30,874 --> 00:00:33,897
especially the determination of the amount of reinforcement.

11
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:38,098
Here is the building, you have a more or less faithful picture on the right;

12
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:41,540
so this is a building which is, for the usual stories,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,340
supported by columns, with a span between the columns

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,506
of 7 meters in both directions.

15
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:58,572
We have two particular zones in this building:

16
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,431
a zone here, shaped like a horseshoe,

17
00:01:01,431 --> 00:01:05,536
with a hole -- that is the meaning of this symbol --

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:10,586
in which we will have space for the elevators and the stairs;

19
00:01:10,586 --> 00:01:14,560
and then, a concrete wall, simply,

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,871
to insure the horizontal stability of the building.

21
00:01:19,024 --> 00:01:21,620
So that is a concrete wall...

22
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,420
and then here, several concrete walls.

23
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,851
This part, here, is called the core.

24
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:41,292
The core is the hard part of the building which holds it horizontally;

25
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:45,610
the concrete wall, on the right, also has a function in this context.

26
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,390
We thus distinguish, in this building,

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,497
on the one hand, the foundation slab, which is thicker;

28
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:57,308
I am not going to talk about it, its dimensioning is an operation

29
00:01:57,308 --> 00:02:00,077
which is out of the scope of this course.

30
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:03,462
Then, we are here under the ground, we are going to have concrete walls

31
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:06,797
on the outside the building, and then inner walls or columns,

32
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:08,247
we will get back to it later on.

33
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:12,955
Here, we have the slab on top of the basement,

34
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:16,885
which is a particular slab.

35
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,531
And then afterwards, we are going to have a series of story slabs,

36
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,300
which are roughly all similar: one, two, three,

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,554
the roofing slab is slightly different,

38
00:02:27,554 --> 00:02:31,231
since its loads will be smaller. But we will not take it into account;

39
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,338
we are going to deal with, on the one hand, the slab on top of the basement,

40
00:02:34,338 --> 00:02:36,473
and then the slabs of the usual stories.

41
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:40,378
There are fundamentally two possible solutions for the basement:

42
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,159
we always have this hole, since

43
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,279
the elevator or the lift goes down till the basement,

44
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:50,592
and we can also have either cellars, either technical rooms in the basement,

45
00:02:50,592 --> 00:02:53,502
for which we will have a lot of walls;

46
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:57,750
I still assume -- that is an hypothesis which is not always verified,

47
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,905
but that is reasonable in this case to have the same span

48
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:04,310
of seven meters in both directions.

49
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:10,772
And what we want to see is how to dimension the various elements.

50
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:14,118
Let's first assume that these walls are masonry walls,

51
00:03:14,118 --> 00:03:17,898
except the core walls, and then the outlying walls,

52
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:21,533
of course, which must be in concrete to protect us from the ingress of water,

53
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,432
and so forth.

54
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:26,724
What we can notice is that we have, as supports,

55
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:31,227
for this slab, here, a clamped wall;

56
00:03:31,227 --> 00:03:32,978
here, that is a clamped wall;

57
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:36,858
here, because of continuity, that is clamped,

58
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,873
likewise in this direction. So if I get to this table,

59
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:45,253
that is a square slab, with all the sides clamped,

60
00:03:45,382 --> 00:03:48,825
so the coefficient is here 0.56.

61
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:52,148
And actually, all the slabs, whereever they are --

62
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,815
this one is clearly inside, it is clamped on all its sides --

63
00:03:55,815 --> 00:04:00,032
but all the slabs of this building have the same properties:

64
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:02,553
this one is also clamped on the left and on the right,

65
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:04,015
such as this one.

66
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:07,987
There is an exception: that is this slab, here,

67
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:13,561
which is clamped on the left, clamped on the right, clamped on the bottom,

68
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:17,112
and then here, on the top, it has a free edge.

69
00:04:17,112 --> 00:04:23,536
If we look at it, that is this configuration here;

70
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:27,451
we would thus have a coefficient, here, of 0.67.

71
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:31,463
It is going to have a significant influence on the dimensioning of our structure,

72
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:35,289
and maybe that it is not desirable, because there is a big difference.

73
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:41,942
A solution could be to add a beam here,

74
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:48,916
a beam under the slab on the basement:

75
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,740
in this way, we would have a simple support on this side,

76
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,720
still the clamped supports of the three other sides;

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,114
and at this moment, we would be here in the figure,

78
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:06,123
with a value of 0.59 which would be very very close to the value of 0.56.

79
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:08,839
That is something which is not decided yet,

80
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,625
that must be discussed with the architect,

81
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:14,038
to know if it is possible to create this beam,

82
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,782
if it can be sufficient. Another solution

83
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:20,333
would simply be to thicken the slab in this zone here.

84
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,512
Another configuration for the slab on top of the basement

85
00:05:23,512 --> 00:05:26,959
is to assume that this basement is going to be used for other purposes,

86
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,654
for example to park cars; and then, we would have, in this case,

87
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:35,886
a slab supported on walls, outside and on the core,

88
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,482
and on the other hand, on some columns.

89
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:41,075
The configuration here is a bit complicated,

90
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:44,362
since there are configurations which we have not necessarily

91
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:45,895
in our table.

92
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:52,402
Considering that, here, the corner of this slab,

93
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:55,380
with this column, corresponds to the corner of this slab

94
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,113
with this wall corner, we can consider, here,

95
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,698
that we will have a coefficient of 0.90 for this span.

96
00:06:02,698 --> 00:06:08,990
Here, we have a slab with the same configuration,

97
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:15,703
so a large part of the slab has this same configuration.

98
00:06:24,713 --> 00:06:26,803
Some particular cases still remain:

99
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,121
here, in the middle, we are not absolutely sure,

100
00:06:30,121 --> 00:06:32,734
but that is clear, that it is less than 0.90.

101
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,180
So if we choose the depth

102
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,484
which corresponds to the coefficient of 0.90 for the span, we will be good;

103
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:43,436
likewise, here, that is also less than 0.90, because of this wall,

104
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,728
but that is probably quite close to this.

105
00:06:45,728 --> 00:06:51,401
Here, we probably have a slab which carries in two directions,

106
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:56,014
so probably a value which is around 0.67,

107
00:06:56,014 --> 00:06:59,274
but clearly still under 0.90,

108
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:05,088
so we can neglect it; here too, less than 0.90.

109
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:08,802
However, here, we have a particular configuration,

110
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:11,647
and we have more than 0.90.

111
00:07:11,647 --> 00:07:14,342
What is precisely the value? That is not easy to say,

112
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:16,892
we could imagine that it is around 0.93;

113
00:07:16,892 --> 00:07:20,077
but that is something which should be dealt with in more details.

114
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:22,359
For the dimensioning stage,

115
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,756
we are going to keep in our memory that this zone here has a small problem,

116
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:28,906
but we are not going to consider it any longer.

117
00:07:29,294 --> 00:07:32,315
Let's now move to a story slab:

118
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:36,375
it first has, in the corners,

119
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,885
a configuration which is the same, obviously,

120
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,065
than the one we have in our figure;

121
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:47,007
so the four zones in the corners have a span coefficient of 1.01.

122
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:53,328
This zone looks like what we have seen in the previous case,

123
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:56,783
with a wall on one side and two columns, around 0.90.

124
00:07:57,622 --> 00:08:02,006
Here, probably, we have a configuration a little bit like this,

125
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:06,082
with 0.93. Here too.

126
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:14,846
Here, in the middle, we are maybe not at 0.82 yet,

127
00:08:14,846 --> 00:08:17,594
but clearly at less than 0.90:

128
00:08:17,594 --> 00:08:20,503
likewise here, less than 0.90.

129
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:22,701
And here, less than 0.90.

130
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,478
However, here, we have a particular configuration,

131
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,054
since we have the equivalent of a column:

132
00:08:28,054 --> 00:08:29,887
(counts the columns)

133
00:08:29,887 --> 00:08:33,138
We probably are... - but we only have one span,

134
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,934
we have no continuity -- we probably are

135
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,416
around 1.01, but in all likelihood, even,

136
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,143
above 1.01.

137
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:42,862
This is again going to be one of these particular zones,

138
00:08:42,862 --> 00:08:46,236
that it will be necessary to consider separately.

139
00:08:46,236 --> 00:08:49,562
We now want to take back the various factors

140
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,939
which we have obtained in our configuration:

141
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:58,595
as a reminder, the factors which we have obtained

142
00:08:58,595 --> 00:09:08,788
were 0.56 for the case of the slab supported by walls located in the basement,

143
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:15,597
0.93 for the case of the basement with columns,

144
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:20,483
and 1.01 for the current storey.

145
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:26,721
Multiplying them by the span of our slabs,

146
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:37,623
it gives us equivalent spans of 3.92 m, 6.51 m and 7.07 m.

147
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:46,024
The minimal width for this slab would thus be 3 920,

148
00:09:46,024 --> 00:09:51,923
divided by the factor which we are going to obtain entering in the table

149
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:55,276
at the level of 3.92 m;

150
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,135
we are going to use, for the whole building,

151
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:04,336
an admissible vertical deflection of 1/300 and a live load of 2kN/m².

152
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:09,021
Here, we reach slightly more than 22,

153
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:16,457
so we are going to say 22.5; so 3 920 divided by 22.5,

154
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:23,986
it will give us a minimal depth of 174 mm.

155
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:26,776
Obviously, it will be a value which will have to be rounded,

156
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,460
maybe to 180mm, or to another value,

157
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,026
it will depend on the result of the final dimensioning.

158
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:35,432
I remind you, that is a predimensioning, 

159
00:10:35,432 --> 00:10:38,017
to obtain an idea of the width of these slabs.

160
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:41,772
For the solution, in the basement, with columns,

161
00:10:41,772 --> 00:10:45,781
we have a minimal width which is equal to 6 510,

162
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:50,854
divided by the factor which we obtain entering at the level of 6.50m

163
00:10:50,854 --> 00:10:53,516
in the graphic, here.

164
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,414
So we obtain 19.

165
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:12,403
6 510 divided by 19 gives 343 mm as minimal depth.

166
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,464
Finally, for the story slab,

167
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:17,726
the minimal depth will be given

168
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:26,959
by 7 070 divided by what we obtain entering at the level of 7.07 m;

169
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:34,338
so approximately here, in the graphic, with a factor of roughly 18,

170
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:46,304
which gives us a minimal depth of 392 mm.

171
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,924
You should note that the slenderness ratios which we have for these slabs

172
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,411
are thus around 20, sometimes slightly less than 20,

173
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:57,172
in some other cases, a little more than 20 if there are lots of walls.

174
00:11:57,672 --> 00:12:01,452
In this video, we have carried out the predimensioning of the width

175
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,603
of the slabs of a building,

176
00:12:03,603 --> 00:12:06,331
in a part with walls,

177
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:09,110
and in another part, with only columns.

178
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,878
Depending on the story, the depth was quite different;

179
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:17,267
also, depending on the use that we want to do of the building.

180
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:20,469
We have seen how to proceed to the choice of the depth,

181
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:23,363
noting that there are often exceptions,

182
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:26,477
for which we know less accurately the equivalent span,

183
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:30,372
which means that it will maybe be occasionally necessary, in some places,

184
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:34,771
to increase the depth of the slab, or else, during the final dimensioning,

185
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:37,838
it will be necessary to put more reinforcement in this place.

186
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:41,317
Finally, I remind you that it is only a predimensioning,

187
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:43,422
so you obtain the width of the slabs;

188
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,942
that is not enough, it will be necessary to proceed to the dimensioning,

189
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,000
to know which amount of reinforcement it will be necessary to place inside these slabs.
