00:00:00,864 --> 00:00:02,719
Hello, in this video, I am going to talk to you about

2
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:04,158
slabs on linear supports.

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:07,016
First of all, I will talk about the bending behavior of slabs,

4
00:00:07,154 --> 00:00:09,253
an extension of the bending behavior of beams,

5
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:12,024
I will insist a lot on the deflected shape,

6
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,135
the shape that the slab takes when subjected to loads,

7
00:00:15,828 --> 00:00:18,472
I will talk to you about the types of supports, since there are

8
00:00:18,642 --> 00:00:20,437
additional ones for slabs,

9
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:23,812
and finally, I will talk about continuous slabs,

10
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,722
in relationship with their deflected shape.

11
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:30,320
In this video, you can see a slab symbolized by a black cardboard

12
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:33,876
which is supported on two gray walls on the left and on the right

13
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:35,576
and on which I push with my right hand.

14
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:40,489
We can see that the slab deflects in the middle taking this shape.

15
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,723
What we cannot see well, but I ask you to believe me,

16
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,943
you can also try at home,

17
00:00:47,163 --> 00:00:53,446
is that this slab also deflects in the parts which are

18
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:58,749
in the back, which means that the slab also deflects

19
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,928
longitudinally.

20
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:07,705
Actually, if we compare a flooring to a slab, the difference is obvious.

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,679
On the left, I have a flooring for which the boards are independant from each other.

22
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:18,849
If I apply a load on this board, then only the board

23
00:01:18,986 --> 00:01:21,872
on which the load acts deflects.

24
00:01:22,188 --> 00:01:25,429
The other boards do not move, they do not feel anything.

25
00:01:26,274 --> 00:01:29,378
As a consequence, the board on which

26
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:32,714
the load acts deflects significantly more, since the others

27
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,399
do not participate.

28
00:01:34,608 --> 00:01:38,492
On the opposite, with a slab, if we apply a load,

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,475
all boards - they do not exist anymore, I have just

30
00:01:42,655 --> 00:01:47,603
drawn these small lines to represent zones -

31
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:50,924
all the zones of the slab, as we have already observed

32
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:54,749
on the model before, all zones of the slab deflect

33
00:01:55,006 --> 00:01:59,891
as well in the longitudinal direction as in the transversal direction.

34
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:07,804
That is the essential difference between a flooring and a slab.

35
00:02:15,824 --> 00:02:19,599
Obviously, all materials cannot be used to make slabs,

36
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:23,161
for example, timber boards do not easily let themselves

37
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:26,147
linked to each other laterally, that is not completely impossible

38
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:29,999
but that is difficult, so typically, with timber, we will make floorings;

39
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:32,537
with a material such as concrete, we will make slabs.

40
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,881
In this picture, you can see a unidirectional slab

41
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,165
such as the one we have seen before in the model.

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,373
This means that we have a slab which is supported on a wall on the right,

43
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,254
for us that is simply a fixed support for example,

44
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:54,068
which acts over the entire length of the wall

45
00:02:54,589 --> 00:02:57,673
and on the left we would have a mobile support.

46
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:03,555
I am not going to draw it behind, but that is also a mobile support

47
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:05,476
which extends over the whole length.

48
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,196
The other two edges are not supported.

49
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,602
We have here a free edge,

50
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,820
this edge is free too.

51
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:33,099
Here we have a supported edge.

52
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,313
How can we represent this slab on a plan

53
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:42,787
view from the top?

54
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,834
The supported edges are represented

55
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,905
here by continuous lines,

56
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:57,185
there is one on the left and one on the right,

57
00:03:57,406 --> 00:04:02,866
and the free edges are indicated by dashed lines.

58
00:04:03,474 --> 00:04:05,141
There is one on the top and one on the bottom.

59
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:08,327
Here, we have a free edge, and there too, which we can find here.

60
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,880
How is this structure going to carry loads?

61
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:13,510
It cannot carry loads in the direction where there are no supports.

62
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:18,061
The loads are thus going to be transmitted in the direction of the supports

63
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,534
to the left and to the right.

64
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:25,078
That is why we call it a unidirectional slab.

65
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:28,963
If we put a load in the middle of this slab,

66
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,987
the entire slab will collaborate.

67
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,810
However, when we place a uniformly distributed load

68
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:36,704
as I did here,

69
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,949
we get a unidirectional behavior.

70
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:43,478
All these small boards, which are not disjointed,

71
00:04:43,734 --> 00:04:47,390
will exactly have the same deflection.

72
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:51,211
In this video, you can see the example of a slab which is not supported on

73
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:53,033
two facing walls anymore,

74
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:55,221
but on four walls located all around it.

75
00:04:56,316 --> 00:04:58,259
I am going to accentuate the deflected shape because we cannot see it well

76
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,964
on the black cardboard of the slab.

77
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,582
We have a deflected shape in this direction,

78
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:05,787
but also in the other direction,

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:14,934
like this.

80
00:05:16,035 --> 00:05:19,656
This time, this bidirectional slab is loaded by a uniformly

81
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,574
distributed load over its entire surface.

82
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:30,086
We can see well the deflected shape of the slab: it deflects in this way in the middle.

83
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:33,716
That is what we have also seen in the previous video.

84
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,363
And the intermediate lines will always deflect

85
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,716
a little bit less...

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:46,099
in this direction or in the other direction.

87
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,396
Now, we have a slab which is supported on all its edges.

88
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:02,698
We have here a support system like before.

89
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,652
We will see that for slabs, the difference between fixed supports and mobile supports

90
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,027
is not really significant.

91
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:12,400
One of the reasons is that the walls on which the slab is supported are flexible.

92
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,498
So we do not necessarily make the distinction between fixed and mobile supports.

93
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:21,180
This said, in some cases, it is necessary to have constructive details

94
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:25,354
which ensure that the slabs can indeed move

95
00:06:25,642 --> 00:06:28,313
on top of the walls with small joints.

96
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,679
That is something I will not talk about more

97
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:32,682
within the framework of this course.

98
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:35,148
Here, we have a supported edge,

99
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,466
and also here.

100
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:44,689
If we look on the right, of course

101
00:06:45,504 --> 00:06:49,356
all edges of this slab are supported.

102
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,985
Here is how this slab carries loads:

103
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,717
the loads always try to go towards the supports in the most direct

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,051
way, so from the middle, we are located at the same distance

105
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,520
from all supports, so the slab is going to carry in both directions.

106
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:08,472
However, near the edges, if we have a load on the corner,

107
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,667
the closest edges are in the diagonal direction,

108
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:17,369
so there is also a load-carrying mode in the direction of the diagonal,

109
00:07:17,824 --> 00:07:20,512
and as a consequence of the fact that there are several load-bearing modes,

110
00:07:20,824 --> 00:07:25,229
slabs supported on four edges need less material

111
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:28,053
to resist the loads we apply to them.

112
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,720
We will get back to it in one of the next videos.

113
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:34,727
Here we have the example of the Savoye villa,

114
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:37,837
designed by the architect Le Corbusier, near Paris.

115
00:07:38,215 --> 00:07:42,255
Inside this villa, as it can be seen here,

116
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:45,148
we have several linear supports,

117
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:51,462
small beams, which support a slab; 1, 2, 3, 4 spans,

118
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,685
so this is a continuous slab.

119
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:58,077
In this case, we can see that the spacing between the beams is constant.

120
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,064
What does it mean? If we look, under a uniformly

121
00:08:02,386 --> 00:08:05,637
distributed load, at the form of the deflected shape,

122
00:08:05,915 --> 00:08:12,915
the maximum deflection is larger in the edge spans

123
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:17,712
on the left and on the right, because these spans do not have the correct length.

124
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:23,143
We have seen it for the continuous beams, we would use 0.8 times the span in the middle.

125
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,714
That would be more favorable.

126
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:28,600
That is not what we have here, we have the same span everywhere,

127
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,997
that can be understandable fron an architectural point of view.

128
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,547
We thus have a deflected shape where the largest vertical deflections

129
00:08:37,824 --> 00:08:41,684
are located in the edge spans.

130
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,929
That is very important to have the deflected shape in mind,

131
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:48,915
the shape that the slab takes under the loads

132
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:52,132
when we study the rest of these videos.

133
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,762
We are going to look at how slabs are supported.

134
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:00,723
We will see that depending on the detail we use, such as for example concrete

135
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,297
or masonry walls, or else beams,

136
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:08,271
the behavior is different and that is necessary to take it into account.

137
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:12,633
We start here with the probably most usual solution,

138
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,394
that is to say masonry walls on which the slab rests.

139
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:21,109
If we have a slab edge, that is to say an end wall of a building,

140
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,598
and the slab stops, then we are going to have a deflected shape

141
00:09:24,884 --> 00:09:27,577
which will essentially look like this.

142
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:32,008
This corresponds to a supported edge from a structural point of view.

143
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:38,908
If, however, the slab continues on the left and on the right,

144
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:42,243
as we have seen it in the villa of Le Corbusier,

145
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,318
then the deflected shape will be like this

146
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,231
and from a structural point of view, we will have a clamped system

147
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:56,612
leftwards and rightwards.

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,760
Pay attention please! For graphical reasons, I have drawn a clamping on the left,

149
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:07,624
but actually, the clamping is located on the axis of the wall.

150
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:14,344
Both are on top of each other, the clampings leftwards

151
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,959
and rightwards.

152
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:20,327
If I have a small cantilever, I will have the same behavior

153
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,319
than if I have a simple support.

154
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,558
Here, I have a supported edge.

155
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:32,916
Generally, during a predimensioning, we can neglect a small cantilever.

156
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:36,329
In slabs, we can also have a free edge.

157
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:42,230
The slab is going to be able to go up and down freely.

158
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:49,418
I do not have any symbols, I just have the slab which keeps going.

159
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:52,017
The edge of the slab is free here.

160
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:55,525
Finally, if I have a long cantilever,

161
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:05,896
that means L2 larger than approximately 1/3 of L,

162
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:11,158
here, L2 is the length of the cantilever,

163
00:11:15,047 --> 00:11:17,546
and L, the length up to the next wall.

164
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:22,907
In this case, the deflected shape is going to be close to what we have in a clamped case,

165
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,313
and the behavior as well.

166
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:32,355
We are going to have a system where the left part of the slab

167
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:38,591
is clamped and the cantilever is also clamped.

168
00:11:41,244 --> 00:11:43,975
It is obviously necessary to be careful to cantilevers which are too long.

169
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:48,855
I would say that it would not be reasonable to exceed half of L for a cantilever

170
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,718
because otherwise the behavior of the structure is going to be

171
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,164
quite different.

172
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:55,104
It is possible, but that is a particular detail which is not dealt with

173
00:11:55,296 --> 00:11:56,805
within the framework of this course.

174
00:11:57,236 --> 00:12:00,960
We are now going to look at the case of slabs supported on reinforced

175
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:06,923
concrete walls which are sufficiently thick, without defining what is &quot;sufficiently thick&quot;.

176
00:12:06,923 --> 00:12:10,347
but we cannot build extremely thin walls and expect to get this behavior.

177
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,574
If we make very thin walls, then we can consider them

178
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:15,594
as masonry walls.

179
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:23,684
If the wall is sufficiently thick, we are going to get a behavior similar to the one

180
00:12:23,684 --> 00:12:24,980
of a clamping.

181
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:34,491
The slab thus behaves as if it had a clamped edge.

182
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:37,832
If the slab is continuous, it does not change anything

183
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:43,204
compared to the masonry wall in terms of deflected shape. We again have

184
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:48,456
a system which is clamped on the left and on the right.

185
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:58,046
And if we have a cantilever, any kind of cantilever,

186
00:12:58,254 --> 00:13:01,777
we are going to have, thanks to the wall, the same behavior than on the left

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,345
with the edge of the slab.

188
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:06,403
We are going to have very small deflections in the cantilever

189
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,155
if it is short, more if it is long.

190
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:13,387
In any case, we will have a behavior with a double clamping

191
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:17,626
leftwards and rightwards.

192
00:13:22,086 --> 00:13:25,681
Finally, it is quite frequent that, like the Savoye villa

193
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,089
which I have shown you before,

194
00:13:27,404 --> 00:13:29,499
slabs are not supported by walls,

195
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,219
but rather by beams, generally made of reinforced concrete,

196
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,304
but they could be made of steel, that would not change a lot.

197
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,669
In this case, we are going to have a behavior where the beam,

198
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,201
except if it is extremely stiff,

199
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:45,297
will tend to rotate with the slab,

200
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:49,925
which means, from a structural point of view, that we have a simply supported edge;

201
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,852
if obviously, we have a continuous slab on the beam,

202
00:13:56,163 --> 00:14:00,573
thus the behavior is going to be like in all the other cases,

203
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:05,795
that is to say with a clamping leftwards and rightwards.

204
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:15,776
If we have a small cantilever, that is going to be the same thing than

205
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:19,957
what we have seen before, that is to say that the beam is going to rotate,

206
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:23,741
which corresponds to a simply supported system.

207
00:14:28,237 --> 00:14:30,574
If however, we have a long cantilever,

208
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,618
then we can also end up in the configuration which we have seen

209
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:41,401
before where there is no rotation at the level of the beam and then the system

210
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:46,125
is clamped leftwards and rightwards.

211
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:55,437
In this video, I introduced to you the bending behavior of slabs,

212
00:14:55,657 --> 00:14:59,135
the deflected shape they take under a point load

213
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,540
and under a uniformly distributed load.

214
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:06,799
We have seen that the behavior of slabs can be uni- or bidirectional

215
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,374
depending on the way they are supported.

216
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:14,324
We have talked about continuous slabs, insisting on the importance of the deflected shape.

217
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:18,410
Then, we have seen various types of supports, that is to say concrete

218
00:15:18,619 --> 00:15:20,298
and masonry walls,

219
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,942
or else beams,

220
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:25,687
which provide supports for the slabs.
