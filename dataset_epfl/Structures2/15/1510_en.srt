1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,960
Hello. In this video, I am going to introduce floorings.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,491
We will first see why we need to make floorings,

3
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:10,500
then, and this is the main question, how to make a flooring; 

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,520
and then I will show you which materials can be used

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,763
- let's say, preferably - to make such structural elements.

6
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:20,200
If we look at our progress in the Art of Structures,

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,495
we are finished with the 2D part of the lecture about beams,

8
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:28,937
and we are starting to deal with the 3D part,

9
00:00:28,937 --> 00:00:31,552
so we will talk about beam grids and slabs,

10
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:35,715
but all this, within the general topic about floorings,

11
00:00:35,715 --> 00:00:38,735
since a flooring can directly be constituted by a slab,

12
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:42,160
or else by a beams grid,

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,867
which support a slab.

14
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,642
How to make a flooring, that is good,

15
00:00:45,642 --> 00:00:47,663
but first, why do we need to floorings?

16
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:49,542
Well, in human history,

17
00:00:49,542 --> 00:00:53,045
the first constructions have been directly placed at ground level,

18
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:56,912
and the only structure which we used was a structure which aimed

19
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:59,040
at protecting what there was at ground level.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,750
That is what we have, for example, in the case of a tent,

21
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,743
or of a simple structure, in the form of a branches truss, for example.

22
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:09,600
However, as soon as we wish to rise from the ground,

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,338
for example to store at a higher level

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,200
goods which we would like to protect from floods,

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,152
well, we need to create a flooring,

26
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:20,764
that is to say a surface which looks like the one of the ground:

27
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:24,120
which is flat, for humans to be able to move on it,

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,910
and then which is at a certain height.

29
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:31,113
We easily mention, in our country, at least in French-speaking Switzerland,

30
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:32,987
the lakeside civilisation,

31
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:37,189
which settled in villages composed of huts laying on stilts;

32
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:40,562
clearly, on to of these stilts, it was necessary

33
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:43,005
to create a flooring, because otherwise,

34
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,234
no life would have been possible above water.

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,108
So, how to do a flooring?

36
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,678
We can find the solution here, in this picture,

37
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:54,092
or in these pictures of some old floorings.

38
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,937
We use, of course, beams.

39
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,686
Here, I have a beam, it can be seen in perspective,

40
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:06,353
that is why I draw three lines: there is a beams which goes from there to there,

41
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:09,861
and then here, the perspective does not really exists anymore,

42
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,318
so I only draw two lines;

43
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,668
and here, that is what I call a beam, we could say, a main beam.

44
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,314
This beam, we will get back to it later,

45
00:02:19,314 --> 00:02:22,853
it spans from this wall, on the left, to this wall on the right.

46
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,761
Then, we have, on this beam, and carried by it,

47
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,870
other beams which are smaller.

48
00:02:31,616 --> 00:02:37,396
Again, three lines because of the perspective, here.

49
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:41,800
Here, the perspective does not really exist anymore... still a little bit.

50
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:45,315
We are going to draw a third line; here, again,

51
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:51,113
and so forth. So we have beams which,

52
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:53,992
instead of carrying between two main walls,

53
00:02:53,992 --> 00:02:57,980
are supported by the yellow beams.

54
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,578
So here, I have a secondary beam.

55
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:11,155
Then, on these beams, perpendicularly --

56
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:13,819
it should be noted that the secondary beams

57
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,532
are perpendicular to the beams of the first level --

58
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:25,333
Here, I have elements which are boards,

59
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,909
which are directly positioned on the secondary beams,

60
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,012
and which cover the entire surface.

61
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,986
So, once we have these boards, we have reached the objective --

62
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:41,051
I am going to add the line which was missing here, that is a bit disturbing --

63
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:49,422
once we have placed these boards, here - for example here, or here, these are boards;

64
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,899
once we have place all these boards,

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,914
well, we have covered the whole surface,

66
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:56,950
thus we have reached our goal.

67
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,100
We have of course covered the story underneath,

68
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,564
but we have also offered a planar surface to the upper floor and we expect

69
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:06,920
that it will be able to resist loads, for example,

70
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,594
to put there a wheat stock, or else to get a living room.

71
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:14,480
On the right, we have a similar picture,

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,773
probably from the same period,

73
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,390
with a slightly more complex construction --

74
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,592
by the way, the beams which we can see are quite elaborated,

75
00:04:22,592 --> 00:04:26,295
in terms of carpentry.

76
00:04:26,295 --> 00:04:34,786
So we have large beams, like in the previous structure;

77
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,500
so these are the main beams.

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:49,440
Perpendicularly, we have a series of secondary beams, here,

79
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:55,044
or else here.

80
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,668
And then, on these secondary beams,

81
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:23,745
we can observe a set of additional beams --

82
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:27,100
so I cannot entirely draw them because of the text,

83
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,076
but we can see them well here --

84
00:05:30,978 --> 00:05:33,833
there are tertiary beams.

85
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,240
And then, on these tertiary beams,

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,825
we cannot really see them on this picture,

87
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:53,518
but I draw them with dashed lines, we will again have boards.

88
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,440
So a flooring, that is a serie of beams,

89
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,421
on which, maybe, other beams lean,

90
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:11,512
and on which, finally, we are going to place boards,

91
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:14,260
which are going to be contiguous, to touch each other,

92
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,815
and as a result, we will have a surface

93
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:20,847
on the upper floor, which will be planar and will be able to resist loads.

94
00:06:21,205 --> 00:06:25,995
This method to rest timber beams on masonry walls

95
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:28,594
is very old; here, we can see a photo

96
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:33,164
of a wall of a house in Herculanum, that is the twin city of Pompei;

97
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:38,123
where we can recognize rectangular shaped and closely spaced holes,

98
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:43,474
which were clearly designed to place beams inside.

99
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:55,467
So, if we imagine the beams which were placed at this level,

100
00:06:55,467 --> 00:07:02,748
we had a series of beams like this which were shaping a horizontal story.

101
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,730
And then, on these beams, there were...

102
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,005
well, these ones did not leave any traces,

103
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,595
because it is not necessary to make holes in the wall to place them,

104
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:18,815
but there was certainly a series of boards which created a contiguous flooring

105
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,669
in such a way that, on the upper floor --

106
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,662
we can see that this floor was not very high;

107
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:29,908
there was no lighting and it was not possible to live up there,

108
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:34,155
so it was rather, in all likelihood, a storey to store goods,

109
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:38,031
maybe precious goods, supplies, or things like that.

110
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:43,835
So this technique, we can see, was already used 2000 years ago.

111
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:49,667
Let's look at this other picture of the Pompei Forum which is slightly more detailed;

112
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:56,819
this city has also been distroyed by a volcanic explosion in 79.

113
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,202
We can notice here, on these marble elements which have been replaced

114
00:08:02,202 --> 00:08:06,625
according to their original layout, of course,

115
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,873
the position to place beams.

116
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,992
Well, you maybe wonder:

117
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:18,372
&quot;why is it much lower than the final level?&quot;

118
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,440
Well, you should realize that we really had

119
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,744
quite sophisticated constructions.

120
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:26,514
That is the Pompei Forum, so we can absolutely imagine

121
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,789
that we had placed a certain number of boards on top of these beams...

122
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:35,476
I am going to quickly draw them.

123
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:39,917
You have boards which, for example, span between two beams,

124
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:41,613
and so forth.

125
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:48,425
And then, on these boards, we have placed a layer of sand:

126
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:55,530
that was often used to level out the thickness -- I forgot

127
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,971
to indicate here that these are boards,

128
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:05,590
that is to say the flooring itself -- and then, on this element, finally,

129
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:11,087
we can place the definitive paving, which is made of stone.

130
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:18,178
So this, that is a solution which can be found in any kinds of constructions,

131
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:23,279
until, let's say, the end of the 19th century.

132
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,993
Depending on the luxury of the construction, we have or we have not

133
00:09:27,993 --> 00:09:30,764
an upper stone paving.

134
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:33,153
Another interesting thing: since I am showing you

135
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:35,291
these structural elements in Pompei,

136
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:39,061
that is interesting to notice these structural joints;

137
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,478
Romans, on the one hand, did not have machines able to lift up

138
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,231
infinitely large loads and, on the other hand,

139
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,339
we know that it is not possible to obtain an infinitely

140
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,462
large marble block in a quarry;

141
00:09:52,462 --> 00:09:56,523
so what has been done here? They have simply created marble

142
00:09:56,523 --> 00:10:03,493
blocks with inclined joints; if you remember well

143
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:08,337
what we have seen in this course, here,

144
00:10:09,303 --> 00:10:16,442
an arch and cable will be able to interesect,

145
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:22,594
just here, at the level of joint,

146
00:10:22,594 --> 00:10:28,023
and so on for the following spans.

147
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:38,354
So, we have actually a system which works like a Gerber beam,

148
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:44,522
since these jointshave been placed in a proper manner:

149
00:10:44,522 --> 00:10:49,790
they enable the internal force to be transmitted to the following element

150
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,824
by friction, and then into the column.

151
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:55,907
Let's get back to the construction of floorings.

152
00:10:55,907 --> 00:11:00,994
Here, we are in the citadel of Baux-de-Provence, in France,

153
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:06,793
which has been built around the 12th century. We can see on the remaining facade

154
00:11:06,793 --> 00:11:12,029
-- it is made by natural stones, the rest did not survive --

155
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:16,924
but we can find in a very characteristic way, some cavities

156
00:11:16,924 --> 00:11:23,160
which can probably be considered as evidences that a flooring was spanning there,

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,788
at that time, above the meeting room which was downstairs.

158
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,903
One more time, that is likely

159
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:33,228
that there were simply zones to store supplies,

160
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:34,974
in this upper part.

161
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,832
It should be noted that there are other holes which are probably there

162
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,930
for the covering structure,

163
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,339
which was used as roofing in this place, in Baux-de-Provence.

164
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:48,457
On the right, that is the palace of the Popes in Avignon,

165
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,904
where we can notice a large number of very closely spaced beams,

166
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,096
so we cannot see the boards between them,

167
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,822
in the upper part, we would clearly put them,

168
00:11:57,822 --> 00:11:59,679
we have this kind of boards.

169
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,559
This picture is there to show you that a flooring can lean on a wall,

170
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:07,610
but it can also lean on a wall with openings, or more exactly,

171
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,696
a series of gothic arches, as you can see in this picture.

172
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,080
Still inside the palace of the Popes in Avignon, we have another interesting structure,

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,407
that is the one of the Chapel of the palace, that is the chapel of the pope;

174
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:25,262
when we are walking around in the palace, we start by going up for quite a long time,

175
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:29,692
and then we figure out, when we arrive in this chapel which is very big -

176
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,646
you can see the group of people downs there

177
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:34,995
which shows that it is not a small construction at all --

178
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,532
we have a very beautiful floor made of stone,

179
00:12:37,532 --> 00:12:42,182
and then a very large elevation, and when we look out the window,

180
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:45,442
we figure out that we are quite high above the ground.

181
00:12:45,442 --> 00:12:47,462
How did they manage to do that?

182
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:50,710
Is there a flooring like that of the Pompei Forum?

183
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:55,087
No; if we look at the lower part of the structure, we can see that there is

184
00:12:55,087 --> 00:12:57,773
something which is much more sophisticated:

185
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:01,193
the lower part of the structure is constituted

186
00:13:01,193 --> 00:13:07,474
by these crossing gothic vaults --

187
00:13:07,877 --> 00:13:10,508
I am just going to draw this part here --

188
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:14,374
and then here, above, somewhere -- well, I am first going to draw it in white,

189
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:18,608
for the moment -- here, above, we have the chapel.

190
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,227
How can we make this?

191
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:24,615
Well, it was made by creating... -- if I draw imagining

192
00:13:24,615 --> 00:13:30,122
that this is a cross-section of this part here -- we have this relatively thin zone

193
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:34,259
made of stone, which is here to carry the loads;

194
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,092
and then, above, we have a filler,

195
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,113
probably constituted of stone shards,

196
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,948
as we got them during the construction process.

197
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:54,927
Above, we probably have added a thin layer of sand

198
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:57,807
to level out the surface.

199
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,534
And then finally, to reach the white level,

200
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:15,641
we have placed a paving; which is made of stone, maybe of marble.

201
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:27,434
And, in this way, we can reach the level of the chapel,

202
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,883
and we do not perceive that we are not at ground level because we are walking

203
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:34,308
on a stone floor; and if we look at the cross-section of the whole structure,

204
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,881
we can see that, indeed, that is not a classic flooring,

205
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:40,203
since there are no boards,

206
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:43,724
but that is really something which is only constituted,

207
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:47,003
or mainly constituted, of mineral elements.

208
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:49,762
That is not a very usual type of structure;

209
00:14:49,762 --> 00:14:55,695
we can also find this kind of structure in some cathedral's crypt.

210
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:59,927
In this case, that is a structure which is lower than the main flooring of the cathedral,

211
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:03,791
even though in this case, the spans between the posts are often very small.

212
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:09,326
Here, we really have a large span between the posts, in this room,

213
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:12,811
which is under the chapel of the palace of the popes.

214
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,638
What has changed since that time?

215
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:18,201
Well, not a lot of things, we could say.

216
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:23,346
Look, here, that is a building in Europe, a few years ago:

217
00:15:23,346 --> 00:15:31,060
what can we see? We can see large concrete beams,

218
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:41,433
on which we have placed, transversally,

219
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,444
large boards,

220
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,602
also made by concrete.

221
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:57,380
We can wonder why we have made the beam and the board

222
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,253
separately;

223
00:15:59,253 --> 00:16:02,597
here, the answer is very simple: these elements have been precast --

224
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:08,118
we can notice that the columns is also separated from the remainder of the structure --

225
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:12,061
that is not necessarily the only way to proceed.

226
00:16:12,061 --> 00:16:20,043
I indeed have here a yellow beam, here a second beam,

227
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,784
and then above these beams, in the other direction,

228
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,934
I have placed boards. This is what we have just seen,

229
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,652
we can do that with any kind of materials,

230
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:35,410
clearly, that is almost the only solution if we use timber.

231
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,515
But if we use concrete, the best solution

232
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:44,808
is to make everything monolithic, that is to say

233
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:49,944
to have a contiguous T-shaped cross-section

234
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:56,393
-- you can see, I have an element which is precast, and then the following element --

235
00:16:56,393 --> 00:16:58,393
I draw it with another color,

236
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:02,271
it is also precast; it has a load-bearing function,

237
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:07,579
mainly insured by the part which goes down towards the bottom of the beam

238
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,216
in the central part, and then it touches the other element,

239
00:17:12,216 --> 00:17:16,125
which makes it very easy to create a flooring,

240
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:20,468
simply juxtaposing several of these elements

241
00:17:20,468 --> 00:17:22,654
in this direction.

242
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:25,673
So here, of course, I have the orange element.

243
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,472
Here, I have the pink element.

244
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:36,493
And then, at the beginning, I had the green element.

245
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,651
So this is a solution with what we call a T-shaped beam, here,

246
00:17:47,593 --> 00:17:50,313
which we have already seen when we have learned to dimension beams.

247
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:52,924
We know that it is a particularly efficient beam,

248
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:56,407
since it can carry well the compression in the upper part.

249
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,253
In this first lecture about floorings,

250
00:17:58,253 --> 00:18:00,204
we have seen that they are important elements

251
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,705
for human society, since they enable human beeings

252
00:18:02,705 --> 00:18:06,208
to store supplies or precious goods in a safe place,

253
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,060
at a certain height from the ground,

254
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,645
or else to reuse the same surface than the one of the ground floor

255
00:18:10,645 --> 00:18:13,840
to have human activities, upright.

256
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,074
We have seen how to make a flooring.

257
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:19,290
This solution which dates from the Roman era,

258
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,473
or even probably from before, with simply

259
00:18:21,473 --> 00:18:25,449
a series of beams which intersect, on which we place timber boards

260
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,753
enable us to get a flooring.

261
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:31,709
We have also seen that the basic material for floorings

262
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,098
is certainly timber,

263
00:18:33,098 --> 00:18:36,618
but a material like stone can also be used,

264
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:40,094
and then, more recently, that is concrete which is certainly 

265
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:42,852
the most used material for the creation of floorings.
