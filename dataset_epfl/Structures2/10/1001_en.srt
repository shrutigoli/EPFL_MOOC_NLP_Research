00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:00,823
Hello,

2
00:00:00,823 --> 00:00:04,120
I welcome you in the course The Art of Structures II

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,995
which is offered by EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland.

4
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,349
This course is based on the book:

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,869
The Art of Structures by the professor Aurelio Muttoni.

6
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:17,453
As its name implies, this course is the second part

7
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:21,711
and it is preceded by the course : The Art of Structures I

8
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:25,558
Along this lecture, I am going to give you some ideas

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,769
about what we mean by a structure,

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,497
I will show you the path of structures

11
00:00:31,497 --> 00:00:34,608
which is the program that we follow for this course,

12
00:00:34,608 --> 00:00:38,843
I will precise the content of the course The Art of Structures II

13
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:42,651
and the course's supports which which will be available to you.

14
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,681
I will insist on the necessary prerequisites,

15
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,328
as well as the material that you must have

16
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:52,652
to be able to properly follow this course and successfully solve the exercises.

17
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:54,998
Finally, I will give you some indications

18
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:58,246
about the way this course will be graded,

19
00:00:58,246 --> 00:01:03,544
so that you can get a certificate at the end of the course.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,250
The path of structures that you can see here

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,421
is really the table of contents of the book <i>The Art of Structures</i>.

22
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:16,512
It stretches from the left to the right over ten chapters.

23
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:21,173
The part which is on the left, here,

24
00:01:21,173 --> 00:01:26,041
deals with the material of the course : The Art of Structures I,

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,704
while the part which is on the right,

26
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:31,503
deals with the material of the course : The Art of Structures II.

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,561
This is the one I am introducing to you now.

28
00:01:36,035 --> 00:01:39,520
The course The Art of Structures I is a mandatory prerequisite

29
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,963
to be able to follow the course The Art of Structures II.

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,156
In this course, we are studying equilibrium,

31
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:49,985
we understand how structures work,

32
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,410
what loads act on them,

33
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,269
what internal forces are induced within the structures by applied loads.

34
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,498
We learn how to analyse their behavior,

35
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:02,911
but also how to design new structures.

36
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,428
The first course also includes an introduction to know how to dimension,

37
00:02:06,428 --> 00:02:08,632
that is to say to choose the dimensions

38
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:12,319
according to the material the structure will be built with.

39
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:19,250
The course The Art of Structures I looks at cables structures,

40
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:32,367
such as the one we can see here in this roof, and also here in the Golden Gate bridge ;

41
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:39,668
it looks at membrane structures,

42
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:43,246
such as this public place cover,

43
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:47,610
in which there are elements in tension ;

44
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:57,067
it looks at arch-shaped structures, such as these arches of the &quot;Pont du Gard&quot;,

45
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:06,732
or this arch bridge by the Swiss engineer Robert Maillard.

46
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:10,032
There is a type of structures which is not represented here

47
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:13,367
which is called an arch-cable that we also introduce

48
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,891
in the first course.

49
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,478
The arch-cable is simply

50
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:20,345
the combination of an arch and a cable within a structure.

51
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:25,981
You have here the content of the course The Art of Structures II.

52
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:31,317
We will start to deal with truss structures,

53
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:34,016
then we will study beam structures,

54
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,079
and finally frame structures.

55
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,956
In every lecture,

56
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:43,026
we will first study the aspect of two-dimensional structures,

57
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:46,860
then we will study the aspect of three-dimensional structures.

58
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:51,129
It will enable us to introduce some types of derived structures

59
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,291
or else, a bit more important,

60
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:59,401
as the one of slabs within the framework of the lecture dealing with beams.

61
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,522
Finally,

62
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:03,995
the last lecture will be devoted to the stability of elements in compression

63
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:07,385
which is not a type of structures, but which is an important phenomenon

64
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:10,806
to design and dimension structural elements

65
00:04:10,806 --> 00:04:12,537
subjected to compression.

66
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:16,272
This is a repetition, but The Art of Structures I

67
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:22,106
is the foundation of the tower that we are building here.

68
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:25,586
If you do not have the proper basics from this course,

69
00:04:25,586 --> 00:04:28,568
it is unlikely that you can build

70
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:32,059
in a stable manner the course The Art of Structures II.

71
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:36,562
So, one more time, I encourage you, if your notions are uncertain

72
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:41,460
or if you did not follow it yet, to follow the course The Art of Structures I.

73
00:04:41,953 --> 00:04:46,034
The course The Art of Structures II has numerous course supports.

74
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:48,852
The first one is the one you are watching now :

75
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:53,086
the videos which are available on-line.

76
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:58,994
These videos go along with PDF supports

77
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,965
which I strongly recommend you

78
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:04,512
to print and to have with you when you follow the videos.

79
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,626
These supports are not complete

80
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:08,853
and require that you add yourself 

81
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,101
the graphical constructions, as well as the remarks,

82
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,738
that I make myself in the videos.

83
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:15,747
It will enable you

84
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:20,352
to have reliable notes to, thereafter, work on the exercises.

85
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:25,920
The exercises will take place on the website i-structures

86
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:31,264
which is an e-learning website that exists since several years,

87
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,823
on which you will also find

88
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:37,329
informations in HTML about the diverse subjects of this course.

89
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:41,091
Finally, but I have already mentioned it in the introduction,

90
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,617
you will also be able to call on the book The Art of Structures

91
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,877
by the professor Muttoni,

92
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:49,388
which exists in French, in English and in Italian.

93
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,320
It is not absolutely mandatory to use it,

94
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,942
but I encourage you to purchase it

95
00:05:54,942 --> 00:05:57,654
or to borrow it for the duration of the course.

96
00:05:57,921 --> 00:06:00,495
The necessary material, in addition to a computer

97
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:05,061
-- since you are already using one, I think you have access to it --

98
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:09,523
will be drawing material, so some paper or a notebook,

99
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:13,522
pencils and blue and red colored pencils,

100
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,666
as well as a rubber and a calculator.

101
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,135
About computers,

102
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:21,247
I have to say that most of the tablets or mobile phones

103
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,142
that we can find nowadays cannot execute the Java applets

104
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:27,286
which are frequently used within the framework of the exercises.

105
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:31,462
So, for this part of the exercises, you will need to have access

106
00:06:31,462 --> 00:06:34,809
to a computer which can execute Java applications,

107
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:37,148
that means a desktop computer

108
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,381
or a laptop.

109
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,169
Most of the time, it is possible.

110
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,028
As already mentioned, you will also have to print the course supports,

111
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,589
even though it is also thinkable

112
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:50,416
to use the annotation function for PDF files.

113
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,923
Finally, I am going to give you some informations

114
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:54,507
about the exercises and the grading.

115
00:06:54,507 --> 00:06:57,546
The exercises, for which you will have a link from Coursera,

116
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:00,679
will take place on the i-structures website of EPFL.

117
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,508
You will just need to insert

118
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:05,639
your Coursera login and password

119
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:08,182
and you will reach it automatically.

120
00:07:08,182 --> 00:07:11,383
Please respect the time limits to do the exercises.

121
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:14,245
Generally, they must be done within a one-week period.

122
00:07:14,245 --> 00:07:21,266
Each completed exercise will be corrected and graded between 0 and 100.

123
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:23,663
The conditions for success, that is to say the average grade

124
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:28,497
for all the exersises of the course, are indicated on Coursera.

125
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:31,328
For those who will obtain the best results,

126
00:07:31,328 --> 00:07:32,781
they will have the possibility,

127
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,222
if their average grade reaches a certain level,

128
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,145
to get a certificate with a distinction.

129
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:39,973
I thank you for your attention,

130
00:07:39,973 --> 00:07:43,086
I wish you a happy discovery of this course :

131
00:07:43,086 --> 00:07:45,379
The Art of Structures II, and I encourage you

132
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,992
to start as soon as possible to study the lectures

133
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,820
which are related to truss structures.
