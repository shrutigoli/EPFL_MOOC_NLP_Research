00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,078
Hello, in this video,

2
00:00:02,443 --> 00:00:04,899
we are going to dedicate ourselves to the specific analysis.

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:08,592
The specific analysis will enable us to directly obtain the internal force

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:11,959
in a certain number of bars in which we are particularly interested in.

5
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,210
These bars, we have identified them in the previous video

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,583
because they are the ones in which the internal forces are maximum.

7
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,505
It will also enable us to do so

8
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,500
whithout being obliged to calculate all the internal forces

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,463
as we have done it till now.

10
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,566
Here, we have a structure which we know well,

11
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,092
which is our truss with 9 nodes,

12
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:36,229
we already know by the analysis of the maximum internal forces

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,915
that the largest internal force will be located in this chord

14
00:00:40,195 --> 00:00:43,587
because its depth with respect to the cable is the deepest

15
00:00:43,587 --> 00:00:45,227
compared to this one.

16
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:47,113
How are we going to proceed ?

17
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,786
We are first going to identify a node

18
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,818
which is the node by which the largest internal force passes,

19
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:58,957
corresponding to a value of 31.4N in the arch-cable.

20
00:01:00,163 --> 00:01:04,989
We are going to make the arch-cable pass by this node.

21
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:20,171
It is very important: if the arch-cable did not pass by this node

22
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:22,051
we could not proceed in this way.

23
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,503
Then, we are going to isolate the internal forces

24
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,319
in the bars which interest us by means of a free-body.

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,063
There are three bars which we cut:

26
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:32,990
There is the upper chord where the internal force will be maximal,

27
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:36,893
the lower chord where the internal force will also be maximal

28
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,777
and then this diagonal which does not interest us a priori

29
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:41,941
but we are going to obtain it anyway in the process.

30
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:46,034
When I cut this free-body,

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,317
I obtain the following internal forces:

32
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:52,740
I have the compressive internal force in the arch

33
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:58,590
of 31.4 Newtons.

34
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:07,302
And I have the tensile internal force in the lower chord

35
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,893
which has a value of 31.3 Newtons.

36
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:16,262
This internal force, I have already directly obtained it here:

37
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:21,787
it is this internal force of 31.3N which is the maximum internal force in this bar.

38
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:24,967
I have directly obtained it, simply thanks to this free-body.

39
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,793
Unfortunately in the upper part,

40
00:02:27,793 --> 00:02:30,116
I cannot directly obtain this internal force

41
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:36,169
because in fact, it is carried by two elements,

42
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,208
the upper chord on the one hand

43
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,823
and the diagonal on the other hand.

44
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,700
But the good news is that these three elements

45
00:02:44,918 --> 00:02:49,972
coincide in this node, here I indicate them again in green.

46
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,458
What does it mean ?

47
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:53,727
It means that the internal force of 31.4N,

48
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,405
we are going to be able to decompose it

49
00:02:55,532 --> 00:02:57,494
into a horizontal component

50
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,178
in the upper chord

51
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:02,738
and an inclined component along the diagonal.

52
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:06,121
We are going to report these internal forces in the right part.

53
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:10,429
31.4 Newtons, it corresponds to 15.7cm on my scale.

54
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,245
You certainly have another scale on your sheet.

55
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:17,591
Whatever, we can do it with the scale we want.

56
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,629
So, I copy this internal force of 31.4N

57
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:24,757
It is a negative internal force,

58
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,285
I draw it in blue so we can see it well

59
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:30,847
and it is going to be decomposed in an horizontal component

60
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:33,931
-- I have already drawn this horizontal line --

61
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,626
and a component parallel to the diagonal.

62
00:03:38,297 --> 00:03:40,365
These diagonals are all parallel

63
00:03:40,491 --> 00:03:44,164
so I can take any of them

64
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,227
and I copy here

65
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:50,627
and I have here a component in this direction.

66
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,598
Now, I am going to see that the internal force which I am going to obtain here

67
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,896
goes up rightwards.

68
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:58,793
If I copy it here into the free-body,

69
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,627
I have a compressive internal force in this diagonal.

70
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:06,326
So, I can draw this internal force here in blue.

71
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:13,302
And then an internal force in the upper chord

72
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,778
which is horizontal.

73
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:23,331
We can read the components of these internal forces

74
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,595
in the upper chord: 29.2 Newtons

75
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,652
and in the diagonal: 3.3N.

76
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:36,492
So we have now obtained

77
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:39,479
the internal force in the upper chord

78
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:45,325
which has a value of 29.2N in compression,

79
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:52,000
in the diagonal which has a value of 3.3N in compression

80
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:55,954
and in the upper chord which has a value of 31.3N.

81
00:04:56,561 --> 00:05:00,649
So we have a method here which is very efficient to directly obtain

82
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:04,053
the internal force in a truss element.

83
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,835
Obviously, we could have proceeded to another decomposition,

84
00:05:08,256 --> 00:05:10,747
still using the same node in this case

85
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,659
and then another free-body.

86
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:15,133
With this free-body,

87
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:18,186
we actually have the same internal forces than before:

88
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:22,025
31.4N in compression

89
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:33,266
and then 31.3N in tension

90
00:05:33,697 --> 00:05:36,184
and we can decompose them again,

91
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,444
the result will exactly be the same

92
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:40,458
except that now, we draw

93
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:44,197
with vectors oriented leftwards.

94
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:49,391
So here, we have 31.4N

95
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:55,501
A decomposition according to the horizontal,

96
00:05:55,917 --> 00:05:57,265
parallel to the upper chord

97
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:58,966
and according to the diagonal.

98
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,878
Again, we will exactly get

99
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:03,285
the same construction, simply in the other direction,

100
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,191
so here, with 3.3 Newtons

101
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:11,749
and here with 29.2 Newtons.

102
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:16,534
You can check these values,

103
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:20,389
they are the ones we obtained in the lecture in which we solved

104
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,334
this truss with 9 nodes.

105
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,759
Let's now look at the example of another structure.

106
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:29,271
This one, we have not calculated so far,

107
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:31,208
it is slightly different,

108
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,604
it is a truss which interests us.

109
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,046
We can first see that the largest depth

110
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:39,680
between the arch and the cable in the middle of the bar

111
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,170
is going to be here for the lower chord

112
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:48,239
and here for the upper chord

113
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:50,492
where the internal force will be the largest.

114
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:55,404
So, we will have to make the arch-cable pass

115
00:06:58,514 --> 00:06:59,799
by this point.

116
00:07:07,764 --> 00:07:11,192
We use the applet i-Cremona.

117
00:07:11,236 --> 00:07:14,475
Here, I have inserted this image, I have inserted two loads

118
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:18,574
and I have already made pass the arch-cable by this place here

119
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,010
and I can read here that the internal force has a value of 296

120
00:07:22,548 --> 00:07:25,285
with an angle of 5.2 degrees.

121
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:29,965
The internal force at the bottom has a value of 295, horizontal of course.

122
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:37,194
So here, the internal force is equal to 296 with 5.2Â°

123
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:42,879
and here the internal force is equal to 295 Newtons.

124
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,081
Again in this free-body,

125
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:49,458
we directly get the internal force in the lower chord

126
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,612
since we cut it, that is the only one.

127
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:55,062
Here, however, we cut at the same time the upper chord

128
00:07:55,422 --> 00:07:59,406
and this diagonal with this inclined internal force of 296N.

129
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,382
I am directly going to draw it to the scale 1:1.

130
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:18,715
Here I have 296 in compression.

131
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:20,991
And then, there will be a component

132
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,621
along the diagonal here

133
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:31,879
which I copy here.

134
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,727
And this component is going to be in this direction.

135
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:38,301
If we copy it here on the free-body,

136
00:08:38,758 --> 00:08:42,004
this component pulls on the free-body,

137
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,640
which means that this internal force is a tensile internal force

138
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,996
and thus, this bar here, this diagonal,

139
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:53,288
is in tension.

140
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,312
Afterwards here, in this direction,

141
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,395
we have the compressive internal force

142
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:02,480
in the upper chord.

143
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:15,424
This internal force here has a value of 315 Newtons in compression

144
00:09:15,876 --> 00:09:20,628
and this internal force here is equal to 35 Newtons in tension.

145
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,907
You can notice that the operation which we are doing here

146
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:28,284
is not an operation like the ones we did before.

147
00:09:28,474 --> 00:09:30,581
The sum of these two vectors,

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,001
the sum of these vectors of 35N and of 315N

149
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:38,532
is the 296N, so we do not have a vectorial sum which is equal to zero.

150
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:41,502
Here, we have a decomposition

151
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:54,628
of the internal forces in the bars.

152
00:09:59,511 --> 00:10:02,197
You can note that compared to the work

153
00:10:02,197 --> 00:10:04,521
we have done in the Cremona diagrams,

154
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:12,801
here, there is no special convention of &quot;rotation&quot;.

155
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,891
I use quotation marks because we can turn, of course,

156
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:21,128
in the way we want but we could have decomposed

157
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:24,972
this internal force of 296N -- I am maybe going to quickly do it here --

158
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:31,464
into a component oriented in this direction

159
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,055
and a component in this direction.

160
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:46,476
So we would have obtained exactly the same result

161
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,815
and both these solutions are equivalent.

162
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:53,701
We have then already made this construction here.

163
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:56,596
I propose you to make the constructions

164
00:10:56,596 --> 00:10:58,288
in these three other configurations

165
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:01,008
as exercise,

166
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:04,389
but for you to be able to do it in a simpler way,

167
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,560
I am going to give you the internal forces

168
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,851
in the various elements by means of the i-Cremona applet.

169
00:11:11,321 --> 00:11:13,598
For the solution number 2,

170
00:11:14,054 --> 00:11:16,237
we have an internal force here of 312N

171
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,041
and an internal force here of 311N.

172
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,005
In the configuration number 3,

173
00:11:25,565 --> 00:11:27,372
the maximum internal force is in this bar

174
00:11:27,883 --> 00:11:32,107
and it has a value of 286N with an angle of -5.2Â°

175
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:35,016
and here 285N on the horizontal.

176
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:38,878
For the configuration number 4,

177
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:43,127
the internal force in the upper part is 323N in compression

178
00:11:43,414 --> 00:11:47,836
with an angle of -4.4Â° and here of 323N.

179
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:50,071
I copy these internal forces.

180
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,015
Here, we had an internal force of -311N

181
00:11:54,622 --> 00:12:01,441
while here we had 312N and an angle of 4.9Â°.

182
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:10,282
Here, we had -286N with an angle of -5.2Â°

183
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,461
and a tension of 285N.

184
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:16,807
And finally, in the configuration number 4,

185
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:22,940
we had an internal force of -323N with an angle of -4.4Â°

186
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:27,696
and the tension has a value of 323N.

187
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,291
So you can redraw it,

188
00:12:30,342 --> 00:12:31,635
I maybe just give you

189
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,765
a small example here

190
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,079
using the configuration which is here

191
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,167
and especially, copying the angle which you have on the drawing,

192
00:12:41,404 --> 00:12:44,003
you can copy,

193
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:49,784
for example here, this internal force of 312N.

194
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,934
So, afterwards, the point for which we are going to do

195
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:55,940
these operations is still

196
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,930
the point which is here.

197
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,913
But it is now necessary to identify

198
00:13:02,276 --> 00:13:08,527
the proper free-body to obtain the internal force where we want it and then afterwards,

199
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:11,355
to proceed to the decomposition of these internal forces

200
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:13,725
to obtain the internal force in both chords

201
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,784
and in a diagonal into the bargain.

202
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:20,327
In this video about the specific analysis, we have seen a simple method

203
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,088
to directly obtain the internal forces which act around a node.

204
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:27,784
So, we choose a node by which we make pass an arch-cable,

205
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:32,742
we use an appropriate free-body which cuts the elements, the bars

206
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:35,386
for which we wish to obtain the internal force.

207
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:40,023
Then, once we have got the internal forces, if there are internal forces which are taken

208
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,766
by several bars, we decompose these internal forces.

209
00:13:44,163 --> 00:13:48,174
So, we find both the internal forces in the considered bars,

210
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:51,832
whose sum will be equal to the internal force, either in the arch, or in the cable.

211
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:54,308
Generally, this internal force has an inclination.

212
00:13:54,985 --> 00:13:57,742
Obviously, this method will enable us to quickly proceed

213
00:13:57,742 --> 00:14:00,798
to the pre-dimensioning, since we will have directly obtained,

214
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,513
without too much work, the maximum internal forces

215
00:14:03,622 --> 00:14:05,540
in a truss element.
