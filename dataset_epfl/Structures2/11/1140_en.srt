00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:03,262
Hello. In this video, we are going to proceed to the analysis

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:05,269
of trusses with seven and nine nodes,

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:07,476
and by extension, we will see how to proceed

4
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:10,549
to the complete analysis of a truss.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,174
In this video, you can recognize the truss that we have seen till here,

6
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:18,407
which has been increased to become a truss with seven nodes;

7
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:20,452
it only had five nodes a bit before.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,030
There is a difference in the loading, which will be effective

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,103
for the further structures which we are going to see,

10
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:30,296
that is to say that the upper left node

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,721
now carries a load of 30 N, and not anymore of 20 N as previously.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,972
The second node still receives a load of 10 N.

13
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:41,718
In this video, we will check that the trusses which we are studying

14
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:45,982
are statically determinate, we will present a systematic approach

15
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:49,935
to proceed to their solving in all the configurations,

16
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:53,793
we will see how to obtain the internal forces, and we will make some observations

17
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:57,845
about the amplitude of these internal forces, comparing them for example to the arch-cable.

18
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:01,895
First, let's check if this truss with seven nodes is statically determinate.

19
00:01:01,932 --> 00:01:07,142
We have a fixed support on the left, and then we are going to have two support reactions,

20
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:11,753
we have a mobile support on the right, and thus a total of three support reactions.

21
00:01:12,735 --> 00:01:14,467
Let's now count the bars.

22
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,175
We have one, two

23
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:23,832
(counts till 11)

24
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,799
11 bars.

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,918
Let's now count the nodes. One, two...

26
00:01:30,122 --> 00:01:34,948
(counts till seven)

27
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:36,764
seven nodes.

28
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:41,708
2 x 7 + 14, which is also equal to 3 + 11,

29
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:45,599
our structure is thus statically determinate.

30
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:48,504
Fortunately, because we want to calculate it with the methods

31
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,189
of graphical statics.

32
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,307
Let's now proceed to its solving ;

33
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:55,973
here, I have already obtained the support reactions

34
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:02,513
RA of 21.7N and RG of 8.3N, using an auxiliary arch-cable.

35
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:10,236
We are now going to proceed to the solving, starting by the node G, on the left.

36
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,909
I identify this node...

37
00:02:13,308 --> 00:02:16,648
and three forces act on this node :

38
00:02:16,863 --> 00:02:25,469
the reaction in G, which is equal to 8.3N and which is drawn on the far-left ;

39
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:27,146
-- it has been drawn in a staggered way --

40
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:30,873
I am going to take this axis here to make the rest of the drawing --

41
00:02:30,873 --> 00:02:34,340
and afterwards, turning counterclockwise,

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,971
the internal force in F-G

43
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:44,139
first acts on this node,

44
00:02:48,466 --> 00:02:59,048
and then the internal force in E-G which brings me back to the beginning...

45
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:07,685
So, this, it is the internal force in F-G, and this in E-G.

46
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,908
If we first copy FG, here, we can see that it is an internal force which is going to push

47
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:21,343
on the free-body, so a compressive internal force.

48
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:32,269
The internal force in E-G pulls on the free-body,

49
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:38,350
it is therefore a tensile internal force.

50
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:49,585
The contribution of the blue node to the Cremona diagram is indicated by this triangle.

51
00:03:49,725 --> 00:03:53,257
We now pass to the solving of the node F,

52
00:03:53,268 --> 00:03:56,958
which is a non-loaded node but we will see that it has however internal forces --

53
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:02,996
The internal force in F-G first acts on this node in the other direction,

54
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:11,300
as well as the internal force in D-F, horizontally,

55
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:19,268
and finally the internal force in E-F.

56
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:28,760
The internal force in D-F pushes on the free-body,

57
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:30,878
rightwards,

58
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,967
so it is a compressive internal force.

59
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:42,332
The internal force in E-F, however, pulls on the free-body;

60
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:47,607
thus it is a tensile internal force.

61
00:04:55,547 --> 00:05:01,050
Here is the contribution of the node F to the Cremona diagram.

62
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,616
It is a non-loaded node, but there are internal forces in all the bars.

63
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:10,512
Let's now move to the node E, which is again a non-loaded node ;

64
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:16,119
The internal force EG first acts on this node, in the other direction,

65
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:30,667
then the internal force in E-F, also in the other direction, then the internal force in D-E,

66
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:40,211
and finally the internal force in C-E -- we are going to go back to the beginning,

67
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:45,376
I just stagger it a bit for it to remain visible.

68
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,681
The internal force in D-E pushes on the free-body,

69
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:55,961
it is therefore a compressive internal force.

70
00:06:01,096 --> 00:06:05,826
The internal force in C-E pulls on the free-body,

71
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:11,925
it is thus a tensile internal force.

72
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:22,193
Here is the contribution of the node E to the Cremona diagram,

73
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,519
so this triangle, but, with, in addition,

74
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:31,598
this small passing by the left part of the diagram.

75
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:34,027
The node D now,

76
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:42,567
a loaded node which is subjected to the internal force in D-E, in the other direction,

77
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:47,054
then to the internal force in D-F, also in the other direction,

78
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:52,007
to the load, here, of 10N,

79
00:06:52,007 --> 00:07:01,130
afterwards, to the internal force in B-D, which is horizontal,

80
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:09,934
and finally to the internal force in C-D which is parallel to E-F.

81
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:16,000
The internal force in B-D pushes on the free-body,

82
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:24,838
it is therefore a compressive internal force,

83
00:07:31,298 --> 00:07:40,136
as well as the internal force in C-D,

84
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,083
here.

85
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:56,148
This free-body contributes in this way to the Cremona diagram.

86
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:02,136
The node C, again a non-loaded node,

87
00:08:02,253 --> 00:08:09,893
which is subjected to the internal force CE in the other direction,

88
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:25,377
then to the internal force CD, also in the other direction, then to the internal force BC, parallel to FG,

89
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:32,316
and finally to the internal force in AC.

90
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:37,707
Here again, I stagger it for us to be able to see it.

91
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:43,493
The internal force in BC pulls on the free-body,

92
00:08:43,617 --> 00:08:48,715
it is thus a tensile internal force;

93
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:59,850
as well as the internal force in A-C.

94
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:17,543
And there is the contribution of this node to the system which is very small,

95
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:24,553
but with these two very long elements, the internal forces in A-C and C-E.

96
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:29,911
We now move to the node B, the last loaded node,

97
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:36,775
which is subjected to the internal force in B-C, in the other direction,

98
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:43,067
followed by the internal force in B-D, in the other direction,

99
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:49,599
followed by the force of 30N,

100
00:09:49,599 --> 00:10:01,031
itself followed by the internal force in A-B, to come back to the beginning of BC.

101
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:13,669
This internal force pushes on the free-body, so it is in compression.

102
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:28,476
The contribution of this node to the Cremona diagram

103
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:39,989
is composed of these two triangles

104
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:45,872
Finally, we look at the node with the support A,

105
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:51,072
which is subjected -- we can pass in this way --

106
00:10:51,072 --> 00:11:02,928
to the support reaction RA which is equal to 21.7N, followed by the internal force in A-C

107
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:09,748
in the other direction, followed by the internal force in A-B, in the other direction.

108
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:15,264
To verify that the construction is correct, it is necessary

109
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:20,102
to check that the segment A-B, which we had previously determined,

110
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:24,948
is really parallel -- it is just a small error --

111
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:28,133
to the segment in the construction.

112
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:31,256
The contribution of this node to the equilibrium of the whole system,

113
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:38,699
is this grey triangle here.

114
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,944
In this figure, you have the entire solution of this truss with 7 nodes,

115
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:45,745
-- actually, entirely correct.

116
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,639
Graphically, you can see, on the right, the Cremona diagram,

117
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,883
and then, on the left part, we have, on the structure,

118
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,709
indicated by colors, the type of internal force,

119
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,535
but also the numerical values.

120
00:11:57,535 --> 00:12:01,312
Let's now move to a truss with nine nodes.

121
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:05,788
Here, we have extended our model to add

122
00:12:05,788 --> 00:12:08,554
four additional bars and two additional nodes.

123
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:16,021
Let's quickly check that this structure is statically determinate.

124
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:20,634
We have a fixed support, so two potential components;

125
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:26,375
one on the right, which give us three support conditions,

126
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,588
to which I add one, two, three,

127
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:39,399
(counts till 15)

128
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,188
15 bars,

129
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:45,660
and I count the number of nodes : one, two, three...

130
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,252
(counts till 9)

131
00:12:51,587 --> 00:13:02,373
2 x 9 = 18, which is also equal to 3 + 15, therefore the truss is statically determinate.

132
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,611
Let's quickly notice what happened

133
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:07,836
when we moved from the truss with five nodes,

134
00:13:07,836 --> 00:13:11,352
which we knew was statically determinate, to the truss with seven nodes at first.

135
00:13:11,543 --> 00:13:19,272
Well, we added one, two, three, four bars ;

136
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,526
so four, here, on the left part of the equation ;

137
00:13:22,634 --> 00:13:28,666
and then we added two nodes ; so, 2 x 2 = 4,

138
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:32,484
it is logical that the structure remained statically determinate,

139
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:38,461
and that when we moved from a truss with seven nodes to nine nodes,

140
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:43,478
we have added again one, two, three, four bars and two nodes,

141
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:47,436
so again, it is logical that our structure remained statically determinate.

142
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:48,542
We could keep going,

143
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,397
making a truss with 11 nodes, with 13 nodes and so forth,

144
00:13:51,457 --> 00:13:54,260
and the solving method would remain the same.

145
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,934
I am not going to solve the equilibrium of this truss here

146
00:13:57,934 --> 00:14:00,112
but I gave it to you in an illustrative way,

147
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:03,290
it is an another way to represent it, you can see :

148
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,469
we have started again by the node which is on the far-right,

149
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:09,127
I have called it A in this case, and I have drawn

150
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:12,406
the Cremona diagram -- here you have, still in grey,

151
00:14:12,406 --> 00:14:14,105
the final diagram.

152
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:18,855
I have drawn the contribution of this orange node to this first step.

153
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:22,524
Afterwards, we moved to the node B, where we have discovered two new bars,

154
00:14:22,524 --> 00:14:26,609
which I drew in green since they have been discovered studying the node B,

155
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,662
which is itself drawn in green ; here are their contributions,

156
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:33,744
the node C has this contribution, with this return that we have already seen

157
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:39,551
in the truss with 7 nodes ; and so forth for the whole structure.

158
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:43,411
Here, on the bottom, the internal forces in each of the bars are represented ;

159
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:47,670
so, again, under a load of 30 N, plus a load of 10 N.

160
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:52,248
And here, we have this figure which is a bit bigger,

161
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:56,163
on which we have represented, for the arch-cable, as well as for the truss,

162
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:03,091
the amplitude of the internal forces using the width of the bars.

163
00:15:03,142 --> 00:15:07,107
We can notice that in the arch-cable, all the elements are essentially subjected to

164
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:10,565
high amplitudes, they are quite thick.

165
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:14,249
However, in the truss, we can notice that a certain number of bars,

166
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:18,092
like these ones, are subjected to low internal forces compared to other bars

167
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:20,152
which are subjected to much larger internal forces.

168
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:22,973
What we can also notice is that there is a value

169
00:15:22,973 --> 00:15:27,275
which is absolutely identical in all the structures : the maximum tensile force at the bottom,

170
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:31,684
which is constant in the arch-cable and has here a value of 31.3N.

171
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:37,898
Other values, such as this one, 27.2 or even 18.9 are quite similar.

172
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:42,570
The same phenomenon occurs for the compression. Here, we do not find exactly

173
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,263
the same value : we have 45.1 and 42.3 but it is something

174
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,366
which is quite similar anyway.

175
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:50,688
Likewise, the compression in the upper part,

176
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:57,011
has a value of 31.4N in the arch-cable, while it is 29.2N for the truss.

177
00:15:57,091 --> 00:16:00,948
What we can deduce from this is that the larges internal forces

178
00:16:00,981 --> 00:16:05,763
in the truss are similar to the ones in the arch-cable.

179
00:16:06,185 --> 00:16:10,605
Some of you have maybe been surprised by the fact that I consider this truss

180
00:16:10,645 --> 00:16:12,691
as a truss with seven nodes.

181
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:15,179
This is true : we can see one node,

182
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:18,459
(counts the nodes)

183
00:16:19,523 --> 00:16:26,113
seven nodes, but we can also see, here, an eighth node and a ninth node.

184
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,686
Indeed, they are really nodes,

185
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:30,823
the structure has really been built in this way.

186
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:35,444
However, on this node 8, for example, except if there is a bird

187
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,220
or someone who sits on it, the loads are quite unsignificant.

188
00:16:40,737 --> 00:16:44,519
So it is legitimate to simply ignore this bar

189
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,762
and the node that belongs to it for the calculation.

190
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,739
So, maybe you wonder why they built this bridge in this way.

191
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,434
No, that was not unuseful,

192
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,782
this vertical bar has two main functions.

193
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:59,983
On the one hand, it is going to support this horizontal bar,

194
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:02,961
which, otherwise, would be quite long and would risk, for example,

195
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:06,003
to vibrate under the wind, or when there is some traffic.

196
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:09,216
And on the other hand, it is going to transversally hold this bar,

197
00:17:09,255 --> 00:17:14,027
to prevent it to change its shape under the effect of compression.

198
00:17:14,027 --> 00:17:19,087
This phenomenon is called instability, we will talk about it later.

199
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,318
And then, the purpose of this bar and of this node 8,

200
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:24,820
is not to directly carry loads,

201
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:30,396
but it has a function in the global system.

202
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,536
Likewise, here, we have a truss which I called a truss with nine nodes, with

203
00:17:36,665 --> 00:17:43,145
(counts till nine)

204
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:47,347
nine nodes, that is right, but actually, if we look at these vertical bars,

205
00:17:47,347 --> 00:17:52,202
we can see 10, 11, 12, 13 nodes. It is correct;

206
00:17:52,202 --> 00:17:55,915
and we could obviously calculate this truss as a truss with 13 nodes,

207
00:17:55,915 --> 00:17:59,581
it would simply be a little bit more complicated, but we have all the tools to do it.

208
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,709
Why did they place this bar here ?

209
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:04,733
Here, the purpose is not really to stabilize ;

210
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:10,263
but it enables to reduce the internal forces in the deck of the bridge.

211
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:15,800
Indeed, if I have a big truck, here, which is parked,

212
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:24,336
or which simply passes on this part of the bridge,

213
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:30,298
it corresponds to a very large load, and given the fact that in a truss,

214
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,091
the loads can only be introduced into the nodes,

215
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:38,670
well, this load will have to transit till these two nodes, 7 and 9,

216
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,769
that is to say over a quite long distance,

217
00:18:40,769 --> 00:18:46,928
and this will induce higher internal forces inside the concrete deck.

218
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,885
It is not necessary in the configuration which has been chosen,

219
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,569
here, with this additional bar : when there is a truck here,

220
00:18:54,599 --> 00:19:01,998
the internal force goes up, by tension, till the node 8, and at the level of the node 8,

221
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,919
the force of the truck is introduced.

222
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:09,634
So the purpose of this bar is to carry a load which acts

223
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:12,193
in this region here, and to bring it onto a node,

224
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,951
which is closer, the node 8, especially because we can only

225
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:17,873
reach it by tension.

226
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:21,211
Therefore these nodes are not useless, we can make the calculation,

227
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:24,392
or simply, as I did till now,

228
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:27,971
we can introduce the load on the upper nodes of the truss.

229
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:30,744
In this video, we have seen a systematic approach

230
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:32,891
to solve all kind of statically determinate trusses,

231
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,577
starting by a node which is a support

232
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,497
for which we know the support reaction.

233
00:19:37,872 --> 00:19:40,312
Afterwards, solving the equilibrium node by node,

234
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,637
we can obtain the internal forces in each of the bars of the truss.

235
00:19:43,718 --> 00:19:47,735
The internal forces, we have seen it, are similar to the ones of the arch-cable ;

236
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:50,237
at least, the maximum internal forces.

237
00:19:50,267 --> 00:19:53,269
There are however certain bars in the truss which, sometimes,

238
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:54,198
only carry small loads.

239
00:19:54,218 --> 00:19:56,747
We have observed that it is possible, in a truss,

240
00:19:56,747 --> 00:20:00,076
that a bar does not carry any loads ; it can have another function,

241
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:04,793
for example the function of stabilizing the structure or of introducing a load onto a node.
