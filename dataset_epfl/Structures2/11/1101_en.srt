00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,624
Hello. In this lecture, we are going to solve

2
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:06,173
our first truss, a truss with four nodes.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,699
As we have seen it in the previous lecture,

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,234
it is an arch-cable to which we have added an additional cable.

5
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:14,634
In the first course, we have seen

6
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:17,806
that this is a method to stabilize the arch.

7
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:21,337
It is indeed efficient but we did not calculate the internal force

8
00:00:21,337 --> 00:00:22,798
which acts in this cable.

9
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:25,569
Now, we are going to see how to solve this structure

10
00:00:25,569 --> 00:00:27,629
proceeding node by node.

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,114
We will ask the question : &quot;By which node should we start ?&quot;

12
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:34,201
And then, we will obtain the internal forces in each of the bars of our truss.

13
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:38,457
We have here a truss with four nodes and we can wonder :

14
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:41,154
&quot;By which node can we start ?&quot;

15
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:44,279
If I look at the node at the bottom on the left,

16
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:47,458
I can see that it is not possible to solve it because I have here

17
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:51,737
one, two, three and four unknowns,

18
00:00:51,737 --> 00:00:56,709
because the support force has two components, we have here five unknowns.

19
00:00:56,776 --> 00:01:02,116
However, the methods that we have seen do not enable us to solve a system

20
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:04,286
with more than two unknowns.

21
00:01:04,286 --> 00:01:08,616
If I look at the right support, the situation is a bit better

22
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:14,332
since I have one, two, and the vertical force, three unknowns.

23
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,751
Unfortunately, I cannot solve a system with three unknowns,

24
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,224
only a system with two.

25
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:25,711
If I look at this node, I have a known force but

26
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,504
one, two, three unknowns which are the internal forces in the bars.

27
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,697
It is not going to be possible.

28
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,671
However, if I look at this node here,

29
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:41,596
we can see that we have one known force and two unknowns. 

30
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:45,992
It is thus by this node that we are going to start the analysis of the structure.

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,607
We have here a structural scheme for this structure

32
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,455
and we are going to start by the subsystem

33
00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:56,814
which I have just indicated to you, around node B.

34
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:04,956
This node is subjected to a vertical force of 20N.

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,222
Around this subsystem, we are going to turn 

36
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:12,044
counterclockwise,

37
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:15,787
starting by what we know, that is to say the force of 20N.

38
00:02:16,045 --> 00:02:23,189
After this force, we are going to meet the internal force in the bar A-B.

39
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,736
On the Cremona diagram, here on the right,

40
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:36,561
we know that we are going to have an internal force which goes in this direction.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,134
To close the polygon of forces, we know that the internal force in B-C is going to be

42
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:49,348
a horizontal internal force which is coming back to the beginning of the force of 20N.

43
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:50,855
So, here.

44
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:57,905
We thus have here the internal force in A-B

45
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:00,198
and here the internal force in B-C.

46
00:03:00,816 --> 00:03:02,683
What is the sign of these internal forces ?

47
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:05,230
We are going to copy these internal forces to the free-body.

48
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:10,700
Here, the internal force in A-B comes and it pushes on the free-body.

49
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:17,139
It is a compressive internal force, I am then going to draw this vector in blue.

50
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,055
The whole bar A-B is in compression.

51
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:31,233
The vector BC also pushes on the free-body.

52
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:36,586
We have this component.

53
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:38,550
Here, this is the internal force B-C.

54
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,477
and here the internal force in A-B.

55
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:47,850
We will be able to read these values to scale in the Cremona diagram.

56
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:50,739
I am not going to do it now but you can do it

57
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,039
with an accurate drawing at home.

58
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,392
You will obtain the actual internal force in Newtons in each bar.

59
00:03:56,392 --> 00:04:05,196
The contribution of node B to the Cremona diagram is symbolized by this triangle.

60
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:11,850
We can now move to node C because we had three unknowns

61
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,525
but we just got one of those,

62
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:18,680
the internal force in bar B-C.

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,675
This node is subjected to a force of 10N, the internal force in B-C,

64
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:24,215
the internal force in A-C

65
00:04:24,215 --> 00:04:25,592
and the internal force in C-D.

66
00:04:25,592 --> 00:04:28,599
I introduce the force of 10N.

67
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:41,426
The internal force in B-C goes in the other direction and pushes towards the node.

68
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:45,556
The internal force in A-C which I do not know,

69
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:49,597
I am going to temporarily represent it with a black line.

70
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,108
That will be enough.

71
00:04:58,008 --> 00:05:00,707
We are going to meet the internal force in C-D

72
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:06,555
to come back to the top of the force of 10N.

73
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,678
This is the internal force in A-C.

74
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,735
And this, it is the internal force in C-D.

75
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:26,308
In A-C, we can see that the internal force pulls on the free-body

76
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,753
therefore this internal force is a tensile internal force.

77
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:44,550
For C-D, the internal force pushes on the free-body,

78
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,597
it is then a compressive internal force.

79
00:05:56,317 --> 00:06:04,026
The contribution of node B to the Cremona diagram is indicated by the orange zones.

80
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:11,354
I am coloring bar A-C in red since it is in tension and

81
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:17,330
bar C-D in blue because it is in compression.

82
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,057
I am coloring bar B-C.

83
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:26,707
We can now move to node D

84
00:06:29,331 --> 00:06:33,930
which is subjected to the vertical support reaction RD,

85
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,149
because it is a mobile support.

86
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:39,030
Turning counterclockwise,

87
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,322
we are going to meet the internal force in C-D which we already know in the other direction,

88
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:50,479
and the internal force in A-D to finish our polygon of forces.

89
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:53,603
I have the internal force C-D in the other direction.

90
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:58,543
We can see that the internal force A-D is going to be in tension

91
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,777
because it pulls on the free-body going leftwards, here.

92
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:11,855
And the vertical reaction at the support RD

93
00:07:11,855 --> 00:07:15,965
- I draw it slightly staggered to better see it but it should be superimposed -

94
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:19,393
RD which is equal to 12.5N.

95
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:21,666
You would see it if you draw it to scale.

96
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,060
The contribution of the green node to the total equilibrium

97
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,221
is indicated by this triangle.

98
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:42,302
I am going to draw in red the bar A-D which is in tension.

99
00:07:46,978 --> 00:07:51,957
We can now move to node A

100
00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:56,016
which is subjected to the support reaction RA.

101
00:07:56,016 --> 00:08:00,536
I am not going to draw it because I do not know in which direction it is going to act

102
00:08:00,536 --> 00:08:03,154
but we are going to find it out soon.

103
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,078
What are the internal forces acting on node A ?

104
00:08:06,097 --> 00:08:10,178
We are going to start by the internal force in A-D

105
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:15,386
which is horizontal rightwards in the other direction,

106
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:19,901
the internal force in A-C in the other direction,

107
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,362
the internal force in A-B.

108
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:31,587
To close the polygon of forces of the node A,

109
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,159
we have the reaction in A

110
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,813
which proves to be vertical

111
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,127
and which has a value of 17.5N

112
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:57,063
while RD was equal to 12.5N.

113
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:05,902
The contribution of the node A to the equilibrium is indicated by the gray-colored zone, here.

114
00:09:07,584 --> 00:09:11,437
My drawing is quite complicated, that is why I made available for you

115
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:14,582
the complete solution of the structure on the next slide,

116
00:09:14,582 --> 00:09:17,547
starting by node B

117
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:20,598
with its contribution indicated by this orange triangle,

118
00:09:20,598 --> 00:09:24,125
then moving to node C with these two orange triangles,

119
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:27,152
then to node D, this upper triangle

120
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:31,423
and finally node A, the lower quadrilateral that we just made.

121
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,091
You can also find the accurate internal forces in each of the elements of the structure.

122
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:44,716
It is also possible to create a truss with four nodes by adding a timber diagonal,

123
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,738
for example, instead of a chain,

124
00:09:47,738 --> 00:09:49,940
so an element which can at once resist

125
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,404
to tension and compression.

126
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:57,360
Let's see how we are going to solve this element.

127
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,226
It is very similar to what we have done the last time.

128
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,148
I am then going to do it quite quickly.

129
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:08,724
We are going to start by node C because it is a node where there are only two unknowns.

130
00:10:08,724 --> 00:10:11,691
We know the force of 10N

131
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:16,168
and this node is also subjected to

132
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:21,322
the horizontal internal force in B-C which we are going to meet first,

133
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,841
and to the inclined internal force in C-D.

134
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:42,262
Coming back to the free-body,

135
00:10:42,262 --> 00:10:46,710
we can see that the internal force in B-C pushes on the free-body,

136
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,890
as well as the internal force in C-D.

137
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,180
So both internal forces, here, are in compression :

138
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:04,862
the internal force in BC and the internal force in CD.

139
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:11,669
I can draw these bars in blue to indicate that they are in compression.

140
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:23,392
Here is the contribution of node C to the Cremona diagram.

141
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,208
We can now move to node B

142
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:31,763
since we know the internal force in B-C.

143
00:11:32,353 --> 00:11:36,039
We are going to use the internal force in B-C in the other direction.

144
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:38,669
Then, we are going to add...

145
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:41,691
Here is the force of 10N, I should have written it before.

146
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:44,735
We are going to add the force of 20N.

147
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:55,283
We are going to meet the internal force in bar A-B

148
00:11:57,173 --> 00:11:59,485
which acts in this direction.

149
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:03,928
Then, we are going to meet the internal force in bar C-D

150
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:08,691
which will bring us back to the beginning of the internal force in B-C.

151
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:12,575
So here.

152
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,341
Here, this is the internal force in A-B.

153
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:24,069
Here, the internal force in B-D.

154
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:29,389
If we copy these internal forces onto the free-body,

155
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,348
we can see that A-B is in compression, as well as B-D.

156
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:40,507
We can draw these vectors in blue

157
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:47,252
AB

158
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:51,103
and BD

159
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:02,449
Likewise, here, on the actual system.

160
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,990
And the contribution of node B to the Cremona diagram

161
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,089
is this zone that I represent in blue.

162
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:23,066
I can now solve node D

163
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:29,472
on which a vertical support reaction RD acts

164
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:34,783
but we do not know it for the moment, as well as two internal forces, C-D and B-D which we already know

165
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:39,314
and the internal force in the lower chain, in all likelihood in tension, AD.

166
00:13:41,041 --> 00:13:43,932
We are going to have C-D in the other direction,

167
00:13:43,932 --> 00:13:46,903
BD in the other direction,

168
00:13:49,323 --> 00:13:55,160
AD in all likelihood horizontal in tension.

169
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,395
We indeed see that if I copy this onto the free-body, AD is in tension.

170
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:09,139
We can directly color this bar.

171
00:14:12,407 --> 00:14:15,857
The support reaction RD

172
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:23,801
here, vertical, which is still equal to 12.5N.

173
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:29,510
I remind you - we have seen that on the lecture about the obtaining of the forces at the supports -

174
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,268
that whatever the arch-cable, the support reactions will be identical for a given combination of loads.

175
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:37,609
It is not surprising that we get the same result for these two configurations.

176
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,092
The contribution of node D to the Cremona diagram,

177
00:14:42,105 --> 00:14:48,217
we can see it here, is a quadrilateral which is a bit particular.

178
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,809
We can now move to node A.

179
00:14:53,378 --> 00:14:56,881
We do not know yet RA. In all likelihood, it is going to be vertical.

180
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:01,027
We are going to start by the internal force AD in the other direction,

181
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:04,377
then the internal force AB in the other direction

182
00:15:04,556 --> 00:15:11,719
and then, to close the polygon of forces, we will need to have RA vertical.

183
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:20,109
So, we are going to have RA equal to 17.5N like before.

184
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:25,718
The contribution of node A to the Cremona diagram,

185
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,126
we can see it here.

186
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:33,902
On this graph, I have copied the results of the calculations

187
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:37,780
of the three configurations which we have seen in these past two lectures.

188
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:40,875
First, here, you have the arch-cable.

189
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:44,548
Here, you have the truss with a diagonal made by a cable,

190
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:46,338
a diagonal in tension.

191
00:15:46,338 --> 00:15:49,364
And then here, the truss with a diagonal in compression.

192
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,789
Let's have a look at how to compare these various configurations.

193
00:15:54,423 --> 00:16:00,325
In the three configurations, we can first recognize an arch.

194
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:03,940
In the case of the arch-cable, it takes a funicular shape.

195
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,437
In the case of both trusses, it is a fixed shape,

196
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:08,936
the one we have given to our truss.

197
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:15,204
Note that the three configurations that we are comparing have the same height

198
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:19,983
since the left bar always has the same inclination.

199
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:26,086
If we get a closer look, the internal forces in the left bar

200
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:31,484
20N, 23N, 20N in compression are very similar.

201
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:37,377
The internal force in the upper bar, 11.5N in the middle, 10.4N, is also similar.

202
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:41,087
Here, it is only 5.8N but we can see that there is another bar in compression

203
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,582
and both together reaches roughly 10N.

204
00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:49,916
If we look at the tensile internal forces, we first always have tension on the bottom of the structure.

205
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:59,241
The internal forces, 10.1N, are identical in the configurations of the arc-cable and of the

206
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,312
truss with a diagonal in compression.

207
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:05,375
Here, it is 7.2, it is lower but we also have a diagonal with 5N.

208
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:09,865
What we can thus say is that the order of magnitude

209
00:17:14,581 --> 00:17:19,507
and the signs of the internal forces

210
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:30,155
are the same for the arch-cable and for both trusses.

211
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:46,198
This is an important observation, it means that the system does not change

212
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:49,839
in a dramatic way if we change its setup a bit.

213
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,998
It also means that if you want to quickly estimate the internal forces

214
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:58,108
in a future truss, a quick calculation simply using an arch-cable

215
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,548
with the correct loads will already give you

216
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:02,773
a very good approximation.

217
00:18:02,773 --> 00:18:06,093
I here have models of five configurations of trusses,

218
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:09,756
always with the same distance between the supports and the same total height.

219
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:15,271
We can recognize in all the cases an upper shape of arch

220
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,444
with its timber elements.

221
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,470
In the configurations presented on the top, we always have a cable at the bottom

222
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,566
and then a diagonal in tension,

223
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,503
or a câble at the bottom and two diagonals in tension,

224
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:37,896
or else no cable at the bottom but two diagonals in tension.

225
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:43,827
In the configurations presented at the bottom, we have a chain in tension

226
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:48,684
and then a diagonal element which can be in compression or in tension.

227
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:52,752
If we compare this configuration with this one,

228
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:56,295
we can see that the diagonal, here, has been given to us as being in tension

229
00:18:56,295 --> 00:18:58,569
so this diagonal is going to be in compression.

230
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:01,516
This diagonal, we have already calculated it before

231
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:04,128
so we know that it is in tension.

232
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:11,473
We can thus note a big variety in the possibilities of design of trusses.

233
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:15,529
We can also wonder : &quot;Can we calculate them all ?&quot;

234
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:21,103
If we look at this truss, here on the top, I cannot calculate it.

235
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:24,544
I have two, three, four, five unknowns here.

236
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:30,297
Here, I have one, two, three unknowns in addition to the force at the support.

237
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:34,216
Even if I independently determined the force at the support, what I can do,

238
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:36,672
I would not succeed to solve the structure because I have three bars.

239
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:40,079
Here, likewise, I know one force and I have three bars.

240
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,724
I know one force and I have three bars.

241
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,909
Actually, we are not going to be able to calculate this type of trusses

242
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,528
with the methods we have studied in this course.

243
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:51,335
But how could we know if we can calculate or not a truss ?

244
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,903
This will be the topic of the next video.

245
00:19:53,903 --> 00:19:57,343
In this lecture about our first truss with four nodes,

246
00:19:57,343 --> 00:20:02,330
we have seen that starting from a chain which was stabilizing the arch-cable,

247
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,591
we have obtained a new structure which is called a truss.

248
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:08,991
We have seen that the method of solving it

249
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:12,889
to obtain the internal forces is similar to what we have seen till now,

250
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:15,639
we have not introduced any new methods of calculation.

251
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:19,408
Simply, we must start by a node where there are only

252
00:20:19,408 --> 00:20:22,761
two unknowns, for example two bars for which we do not know the internal force.

253
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:25,021
We have seen that the diagonals in a truss

254
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,045
can be in tension or in compression

255
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:30,375
and that the order of magnitude of the internal forces is similar to the arch-cable.

256
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,436
Finally, as we just saw, certain structures are not

257
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:36,965
directly computable using the methods of this course.

258
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:40,594
And the next video will enable you to understand

259
00:20:40,594 --> 00:20:43,700
the ones that we are able to calculate.
