00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,113
Hello, in this video, we will talk

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:05,745
about statically determinate, labile and statically indeterminate systems.

3
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:09,330
I begin this lecture by a quite catastrophic picture,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,775
which illustrates the danger that the structures which we build

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:16,327
can represent for their users.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,593
We definitely want to avoid what happened the first of August 2007,

7
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:23,323
in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:26,670
During peak hours,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,306
this highway viaduct collapsed without any warning indicators,

10
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:34,807
after having been in service for about twenty years,

11
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:36,896
and while it was being undergoing maintenance work.

12
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:42,173
This is a little reminder to say that our structures can be dangerous

13
00:00:42,173 --> 00:00:45,697
and that it is important to be careful to their behavior.

14
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,818
So what we want to see in this video,

15
00:00:47,818 --> 00:00:50,032
it is about the questioning

16
00:00:50,032 --> 00:00:53,957
I had let you at the end of the previous video:

17
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:57,771
when can we be sure that our structures can be calculated

18
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:00,250
by the methods which we study in this course,

19
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,750
and is a collapsing of the structures we are looking at possible?

20
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,838
For this, we will visit the concepts of support,

21
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:11,435
of node, of bar and of hinge,

22
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:16,748
and I will introduce to you a general method of calculation to determine

23
00:01:16,748 --> 00:01:20,272
if a structure can be calculated, respectively, if it is labile.

24
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:22,259
A bar.

25
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:27,603
By the way, I will use in this lecture the red and blue colors

26
00:01:27,603 --> 00:01:31,288
without making a reference to the convention of tension and compression,

27
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:33,340
simply because I need these colors.

28
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,744
A bar is a continuous element between two nodes,

29
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,456
so here, we have a bar, we have another bar,

30
00:01:40,456 --> 00:01:43,187
we have another bar, and we have another bar.

31
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:47,540
Or else here a bar, another bar, another bar, another bar,

32
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,135
so on the left, we have four bars, on the right, we have five bars.

33
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:55,946
A node is the end of a bar, whatever if there is a support or not,

34
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:59,472
so we have a node here, a second node here,

35
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,027
a third one here, a fourth one,

36
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:06,365
and actually, it is exactly the same for the structure on the right.

37
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:09,519
A support is a point of support,

38
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:18,539
respectively, we want to look at the number of forces at the support which are necessary

39
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,568
to entirely determine these supports.

40
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:26,809
Here, we are going to have a force with a vertical component,

41
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:29,891
which means only one contribution,

42
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:32,138
while here we can have a vertical force

43
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:36,438
but also a horizontal component, which thus means two contributions.

44
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:39,977
Likewise here, we will have two contributions,

45
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:43,330
and here we will have one support contribution.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,728
A hinge is a rotation point between two bars,

47
00:02:48,728 --> 00:02:56,121
it indicates the end of a bar

48
00:02:58,889 --> 00:03:05,697
Let's look at the different types of supports and at the unknowns which are related to them in details.

49
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:09,494
Leftmost, we have a mobile support,

50
00:03:14,425 --> 00:03:18,392
for which we can only have a vertical reaction,

51
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:22,673
so we have the number of reactions, which is counted as one.

52
00:03:22,673 --> 00:03:25,550
Then, we have here a fixed support,

53
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,691
for which, as we have already seen, we have two components,

54
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:35,222
a horizontal component, and a vertical component,

55
00:03:35,222 --> 00:03:38,042
which means that a fixed support counts as two.

56
00:03:38,657 --> 00:03:40,783
Here, we have a clamping,

57
00:03:43,033 --> 00:03:48,645
that is to say a type of support which is like a fixed support

58
00:03:49,043 --> 00:03:55,437
and which, in addition, prevents any rotation.

59
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:02,751
The rotation.

60
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,666
We do not have two but three parameters,

61
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:13,941
which can be visualized as both the vertical and the horizontal components

62
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,461
of the force at the support, and the eccentricity

63
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:20,267
since this support reaction does not pass anymore by the support which is here,

64
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,024
but at a certain distance from it.

65
00:04:24,412 --> 00:04:27,155
And on the far right, in an illustrative way,

66
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:29,750
we have a hinge,

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,545
which is thus a end of bar.

68
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:42,650
We have on the left the bar one,

69
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:49,456
and here, the bar two, and here, we have the hinge.

70
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:56,237
If, on the contrary, it is not hinged but welded,

71
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,307
we have only one bar.

72
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,474
You have already encountered e a variety of symbols in this cours

73
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:06,791
to represent supports, so I drew some here.

74
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:09,282
Here, we have fixed supports,

75
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,276
so with two reactions,

76
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:22,679
here, we have a support which is horizontally mobile,

77
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:26,832
that is to say that it can move leftwards or rightwards,

78
00:05:26,832 --> 00:05:30,937
but it cannot move vertically,

79
00:05:31,577 --> 00:05:33,823
which thus gives us only one reaction.

80
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:38,723
We can also have supports which are vertically mobile,

81
00:05:47,457 --> 00:05:48,854
with also one reaction.

82
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:52,091
Actually, we could even have a support which is mobile on a slope,

83
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,950
but we will not deal with this topic in this course.

84
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,065
And finally, we have clampings,

85
00:06:02,992 --> 00:06:04,875
with three contributions.

86
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:12,705
Let's note that these three drawings here are very similar.

87
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:18,402
The difference is that here we have a hinge,

88
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:22,542
which makes the rotation of the bar possible,

89
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,786
while here we do not have a hinge

90
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:26,960
and therefore the rotation is not possible.

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,686
But be careful, both these symbols are very similar.

92
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,574
So, how to know if a structure

93
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,620
is labile, isostatic or hyperstatic

94
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,851
- I am going to come back to these terms thereafter -

95
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:43,571
and we are going to do it by writing an equation

96
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:48,995
for which we will use the number of reactions coming from the supports,

97
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,383
we will add to it the number of bars,

98
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:03,462
and we will compare that sum to twice the number of nodes.

99
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:12,048
Let's start here, on the left. We have here two unknowns at the support,

100
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:13,105
one unknown at the support,

101
00:07:13,105 --> 00:07:16,713
that is to say three,

102
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:24,021
plus one, two, three, four bars

103
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:28,430
and then, we have one, two, three, four nodes.

104
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,200
We multiply four by two,

105
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,892
and if look at this equation, three plus four is equal to seven,

106
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:39,538
which is smaller than two times four which is equal to eight,

107
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:43,036
thus the structure is labile.

108
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,278
That means that it is maybe unstable,

109
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:49,346
but it is not necessarily unstable,

110
00:07:49,346 --> 00:07:52,289
that will depend on the type of structure.

111
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:54,265
But you have to be careful.

112
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:57,886
If we look at the example in the center,

113
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:01,111
we still have two support reactions on the left and one one the right,

114
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:02,978
for a total of three,

115
00:08:02,978 --> 00:08:08,874
plus one, two, three, four, five bars.

116
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:17,535
We compare this to one, two, three, four, two times four nodes,

117
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:21,399
three plus five is equal to eight, which is also equal to two times four,

118
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:25,031
this structure is statically determinate,

119
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:33,723
so it is computable according to our system.

120
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,543
We will see a lot of statically determinate structures

121
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,164
throughout the remained of this course.

122
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:41,693
And on the right, we still have two reaction forces plus one,

123
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,769
which means three,

124
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:52,864
and afterwards, we have one, two, three, four, five, six bars,

125
00:08:53,699 --> 00:09:00,343
and we have one, two, three, four nodes, so two times four is equal to eight,

126
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,314
and three plus six is equal to nine,

127
00:09:02,314 --> 00:09:07,276
thus this structure is called statically indeterminate.

128
00:09:13,739 --> 00:09:16,693
We are going to say &quot;not directly computable&quot;,

129
00:09:21,434 --> 00:09:24,572
we will see later that we can calculate some types of 

130
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:26,492
statically indeterminate structures

131
00:09:27,027 --> 00:09:31,589
Let's note that what we can see now here, is that there is just one additional bar,

132
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:35,721
if there was one bar less, it would be a statically determinate structure,

133
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:40,972
so in this case, we have a structure which is one time indeterminate.

134
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:44,626
So it would be enough to take off one bar,

135
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,665
(it is necessary to choose to right one because we could do something stupid)

136
00:09:47,665 --> 00:09:51,016
but if we take off a bar, we could make the structure statically determinate.

137
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,622
For example, if we took off bar number three here,

138
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,944
we would be back to the case of this structure,

139
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,619
and the structure would be statically determinate.

140
00:09:57,619 --> 00:09:59,726
Imagining a statically indeterminate structure,

141
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:02,741
- you will by the way see some several times in the exercises -

142
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:06,906
we could then take them off one, two, three, four bars.

143
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,935
On the opposite, this structure is one time labile,

144
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:15,337
since it would be enough to add one bar for it to be stable.

145
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:18,346
A statically indeterminate structure, we cannot directly calculate it,

146
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:22,327
however it has the advantage that if for example, further to an accident,

147
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,602
let's say for example the impact of a truck on a bar,

148
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:28,488
by losing one bar, the structure would become statically determinate at this moment

149
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:31,743
but still can stand, so it is an advantage.

150
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,870
Let's look at these three examples of structures,

151
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,192
on the left, we have a cable,

152
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:40,781
we have in all the cases, for all these structures,

153
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:47,948
each time, two support reactions, on the left and on the right,

154
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:52,959
and then here, we have one, two, three, four bars.

155
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:58,982
And one, two, three, four, five nodes.

156
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:07,020
Let's come back to our equation, we have four plus four,

157
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,689
and then we have two times five,

158
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:14,673
so our structure is twice labile.

159
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,635
Is this structure unstable ?

160
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:23,822
In any case, if I place loads on my structure,

161
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:25,524
it is not instable.

162
00:11:25,524 --> 00:11:31,677
It is called a cable, it is a structure which is stable,

163
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:35,993
but with large displacements.

164
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,701
Let's now look at the structure of the middle,

165
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:53,171
actually, the numbers are exactly the same,

166
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,171
so I write them quickly.

167
00:11:56,171 --> 00:12:01,218
We have again four plus four,

168
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:05,945
which is smaller than two times five.

169
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:10,833
The structure is twice labile, and if we build it on this way,

170
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:15,937
this is an arch which unstable,

171
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:20,235
because we enable the rotation between the different elements,

172
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:22,134
because of the hinges.

173
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:24,500
So we can see two configurations,

174
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,886
for loads which would act in this way on the structure.

175
00:12:28,886 --> 00:12:30,655
We now move to the right structure.

176
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,545
First of all, for the left support, 

177
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,479
I had noted two reaction forces but it was a mistake,

178
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:40,006
since it is a clamping, we cannot have rotation,

179
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:44,552
so we will have three unknowns at the level of the left support,

180
00:12:44,552 --> 00:12:48,699
two at the level of the right support, because we have this hinge here.

181
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:51,660
We are going to have one, two bars,

182
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,753
this bar here is curved, but there is no hinge,

183
00:12:55,753 --> 00:12:58,892
there is not any other bars coming, and this is not an end of structure,

184
00:12:58,892 --> 00:13:00,426
so there is no node here.

185
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:05,717
Likewise, we will have here one, two and three nodes.

186
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:11,668
This means that we are going to have five unknowns for the supports,

187
00:13:11,668 --> 00:13:15,499
plus two bars, and on the other side,

188
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:19,043
we are going to have two times three nodes,

189
00:13:19,043 --> 00:13:22,734
five plus two is equal to seven and is greater than six,

190
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,678
this structure is statically indeterminate,

191
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:33,919
and since seven is just one more than six,

192
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,547
it is one time statically indeterminate.

193
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:45,599
So, this is a stable structure, but not directly computable.

194
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,092
So we will see a bit later in this course,

195
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,449
examples of statically indeterminate structures

196
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,108
that we can still calculate, or approximate,

197
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,167
using the applet or a graphical construction,

198
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:04,386
but in this case, it is not directly computable.

199
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:07,848
Alltogether, you have this line with the degrees,

200
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:12,762
so here, we have a degree for twice labile,

201
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:16,926
for the two first structures,

202
00:14:16,926 --> 00:14:22,915
and then one time statically indeterminate, for the last one.

203
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:28,352
It also means that if we wanted to stabilize this structure

204
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,550
keeping exactly the same number of nodes,

205
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,579
we would have to add two bars,

206
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:37,051
we can think about adding two bars to stabilize these structures.

207
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:41,071
On the opposite, here, the structure being one time statically indeterminate,

208
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:43,134
we could take off one bar.

209
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:45,845
To take off one bar, it would be necessary to choose the right one,

210
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:49,489
for the structure to remain a structure.

211
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:55,191
We are quickly going to visit some types of trusses,

212
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:57,986
here the most simple, we did not even do the model,

213
00:14:57,986 --> 00:15:01,283
with a fixed support on the left, a right support on the right,

214
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:04,946
that gives us two support reactions on the left,

215
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,991
one on the right, for a total of three.

216
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:12,345
We have here one, two, three bars,

217
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:17,504
and then one, two, three nodes ; two times three is equal to six,

218
00:15:17,504 --> 00:15:19,770
this is a statically determinate truss.

219
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,205
We can now move to a truss which is a bit more complicated,

220
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:28,491
it is the one we have made at the beginning, with four nodes,

221
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:31,759
a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right.

222
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,550
We then have two plus one, which is equal to three support reactions,

223
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,541
plus one, two, three, four, five bars,

224
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:51,998
and then one, two, three, four, two times four nodes,

225
00:15:51,998 --> 00:15:54,354
this truss is thus one more time statically determinate.

226
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:58,040
We move to another truss that we will shortly see in details,

227
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,202
with five nodes

228
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:06,423
with still a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right,

229
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:11,197
so here, two and one, which gives us three support reactions,

230
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:18,782
plus one, two, three, four, five, six, seven bars,

231
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:24,347
and then, we have one, two, three, four, five nodes,

232
00:16:24,347 --> 00:16:28,306
two times five is equal to ten, which is also equal to three plus seven.

233
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:30,657
The structure is thus also statically determinate.

234
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:35,529
We can take another geometry for the first example,

235
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,800
a triangle which is a rectangle triangle

236
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,713
with a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right,

237
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:43,928
like before,

238
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:49,482
so two support conditions here, one here, for a total of three,

239
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:54,540
plus one, two, three bars,

240
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,312
and then we have one, two, three nodes,

241
00:16:58,312 --> 00:17:00,467
so two times three,

242
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:04,142
three plus three equal to two times three : still statically determinate.

243
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:08,037
Then, we move to the next variant of this truss,

244
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:16,988
where we are simply going to add a second element above,

245
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,113
a fixed support, a mobile support,

246
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:25,455
so here, two and one, for a total of three.

247
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:31,149
Here, we have one, two, three, four and five bars,

248
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:38,062
three plus five, to be compared with one, two, three, four,

249
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:41,359
two times four nodes,

250
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:47,314
it is still three plus five equal to two times four,

251
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:51,693
so we still have a statically determinate structure.

252
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:57,783
We now can move to a structure which is the one made with a mirror,

253
00:17:57,783 --> 00:18:03,074
so we are going to place the diagonals in this way,

254
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,306
and we thus get a bigger structure

255
00:18:06,306 --> 00:18:10,077
with a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right,

256
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:14,895
so two and one, for a total of three,

257
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:25,562
plus one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine bars,

258
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:31,230
and then, we have one, two, three, four, five, six,

259
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,934
two times six nodes,

260
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:36,613
three plus nine equal to two times six : twelve.

261
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:39,083
We still have a statically determinate structure,

262
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:44,115
we can also depart from the basic structure of this triangle,

263
00:18:45,305 --> 00:18:49,040
with a fixed support and a mobile support,

264
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,338
and refining in this way,

265
00:18:54,338 --> 00:18:56,870
we still have a structure only constituted by triangles,

266
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:03,000
we have two supports plus one, three,

267
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,379
plus one, two, three, four, five,

268
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,918
six, seven, eight, nine, bars,

269
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:17,578
and we are going to compare this with one, two, three, four, five, six,

270
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:23,120
two times six nodes : still a statically determinate structure.

271
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,446
A bigger example that we will soon be visiting

272
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:32,990
is a structure with four panels,

273
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,167
and diagonals inclined in the other direction,

274
00:19:43,525 --> 00:19:47,079
so a fixed support on the left, a mobile support on the right,

275
00:19:47,092 --> 00:19:52,373
which makes us two and one : three,

276
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:58,086
plus one, two, three, four, five,

277
00:19:58,086 --> 00:20:04,569
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

278
00:20:05,229 --> 00:20:10,522
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

279
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:16,916
And, we are going to compare this with one, two, three, four,

280
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:21,573
five, sixe, seven, eight, nine, ten,

281
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,199
two times ten nodes,

282
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:27,505
three plus seventeen equal to twenty, which is equal to two times ten,

283
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:30,073
therefore this structure is still statically determinate.

284
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:34,612
What we can notice in this equation, I am going to write it down again :

285
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:42,952
the number of reactions for a statically determinate structure

286
00:20:42,952 --> 00:20:46,112
plus the number of bars

287
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:51,782
must be equal to twice the number of nodes.

288
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:58,510
So if we add two bars on the left,

289
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,673
and one node on the right,

290
00:21:00,674 --> 00:21:05,397
we have increased the size of a structure keeping it statically determinate.

291
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:10,148
We can do that for example on this structure here,

292
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:15,146
I am now going to add two bars and one node.

293
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:22,637
So now, I am going to have ten, eleven bars,

294
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:26,501
with seven nodes. If I redo the calculation here,

295
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:32,760
I have three supports plus eleven bars,

296
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,619
which is equal to fourteen,

297
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,180
also equal to two times seven nodes, then it also works.

298
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:44,650
In this video, we have seen what a bar is,

299
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,051
a node, a support, a hinge.

300
00:21:47,051 --> 00:21:50,544
We have talked about the different types of supports and their contribution

301
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,140
to the functioning of the structure,

302
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,057
we have defined the labile structures,

303
00:21:56,057 --> 00:22:00,041
which are structures which do not have enough bars

304
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,675
to be perfectly stable, but

305
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:05,315
which may be stable, particularly if they are cable-shaped structures.

306
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:09,566
We have seen that we can calculate statically determinate structures

307
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:10,648
within the framework of this course,

308
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:13,114
so twice the number of nodes

309
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,985
is equal to the number of supports plus the number of bars.

310
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:21,525
Statically indeterminate structures have too many bars or support conditions

311
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:23,859
compared to twice the number of nodes.

312
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,414
These structures cannot be directly calculated

313
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,659
within the framework of this course,

314
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:31,339
but they have the advantage that we can take them off one or several bars,

315
00:22:31,339 --> 00:22:33,580
while they remain stable.

316
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,636
We have finally seen a general method,

317
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:40,236
which enables, on the basis of a structure, counting the number of supports,

318
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:41,984
of nodes and of bars,

319
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:47,116
to determine if this structure is labile, statically determinate or statically indeterminate.
