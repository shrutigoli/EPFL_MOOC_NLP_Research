00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,908
Hello. In this video, we will see how

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:05,753
to determine the internal forces in all the bars of a truss

3
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:09,413
and to identify where the maximum internal forces in the chords and in the diagonals

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,060
are located.

5
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:14,745
On this picture, we have gathered together different representations,

6
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:18,348
first, on the top, the arch-cable which we already know well, for our beam,

7
00:00:18,412 --> 00:00:22,847
with a load of 30N on the left, and of 10N, near the middle ;

8
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:26,786
with larger internal forces near the left support,

9
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:30,210
but pretty constant in the arch, and obviously constant

10
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:31,232
in the cable.

11
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,260
If now, I look at, underneath,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,482
the result of the complete resolution of the truss,

13
00:00:36,527 --> 00:00:43,332
well we have an internal force of 29.2N in the first bar,

14
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:46,978
of 25N in the second one,

15
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:53,654
and of 12.5 N in the third bar of the upper chord.

16
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,178
So here, I can make a diagram of these internal forces,

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:08,084
which are then the internal forces in the upper chord.

18
00:01:18,713 --> 00:01:24,675
Likewise, we can make this diagram for the four bars of the lower chord

19
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:29,328
so the first one on the left, with 27.1N, the second one with 31.3N,

20
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:35,156
the third one with 18.8N, and the one the most on the right with 6.3N.

21
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:42,532
This is one more time a diagram with internal forces tensile internal forces this time,

22
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,938
which represent the internal forces in the lower chord.

23
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:06,217
What is interesting to notice -- I had superimposed

24
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:12,438
the shape at the scale of the arch-cable -- is that indeed,

25
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:19,410
this shape superimposes very well at once on the diagram of the compressive

26
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:25,697
internal forces in the upper chord, and on the one of the tensile internal forces

27
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,705
in the lower chord.

28
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:35,985
This observation is important because it will enable us to use,

29
00:02:36,052 --> 00:02:39,036
very systematically, results from the arch-cable

30
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,317
to apply them to the truss.

31
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:53,416
We thus notice a similarity between the internal forces in the chords

32
00:02:58,547 --> 00:03:04,458
and the shape of the arch-cable.

33
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:13,972
Here, we have copied again these same diagrams,

34
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:18,625
with the internal force in the upper chord and in the lower chord,

35
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,901
we have added another diagram, which is the profile

36
00:03:24,674 --> 00:03:28,115
of our truss beam, actually its depth.

37
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:37,602
So here, I simply fill it to signal that we are taking an interest

38
00:03:37,649 --> 00:03:45,356
in the depth, and not in the particular elements inside this truss.

39
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:58,980
We are going to introduce a quantity which corresponds to the internal force times the depth,

40
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:07,207
which is the bending moment.

41
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:20,448
On the top, this internal force is in compression ; on the bottom, it is in tension.

42
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:27,890
We multiply it by the depth, which I have drawn in yellow,

43
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:33,139
and we will get a quantity, which I am going to draw in green

44
00:04:34,172 --> 00:04:36,630
and which is the bending moment.

45
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:41,262
So let's start : here, we first start by the part which is the most on the left,

46
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,251
with the internal force in the lower chord, times the depth which is equal to 1.2,

47
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:53,442
27.1 x 1.2 is equal to 32.5 NÂ·m.

48
00:04:54,036 --> 00:04:57,854
Note that the unit of this bending moment that I just introduced,

49
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:02,502
is &quot;Newton&quot;, for an internal force, times &quot;meter&quot;, for a depth.

50
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,295
The next point, we will take it in this diagram,

51
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:09,609
on the middle of the bar, times this depth,

52
00:05:09,886 --> 00:05:14,765
29.2 x 1.2 equal to 35 Nm.

53
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:18,686
Then, we will take the internal forces ;

54
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:26,860
31.3 x 1.2 equals to 37.5 Nm ;

55
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:35,498
then here 25 x 1.2, it will give us 30 Nm.

56
00:05:37,454 --> 00:05:45,121
Here, 1.2 x 18.8 = 22.5 Nm, and so forth for the last quantities.

57
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:54,403
We can notice that these quantities are distributed

58
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:57,789
on this diagram which is continuous,

59
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:10,283
and which we call &quot;Bending moment diagram&quot;.

60
00:06:12,049 --> 00:06:14,877
That is not something with which we will work a lot,

61
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:17,446
but we will refer to it

62
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:20,842
a bit in this course, and certainly in other courses

63
00:06:20,842 --> 00:06:24,334
which will follow, that is why I introduced this notion here.

64
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:30,523
Some important properties: in statically determinate systems,

65
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:48,417
the bending moments, so the internal force times the depth,

66
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:56,378
are independant of the depth.

67
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:05,241
We have already seen this a bit when we played with the applet,

68
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:09,232
with which we obtained a variety of arch-cables by increasing

69
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:12,718
or decreasing the depth of the arch-cable, and if we look at the internal forces,

70
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,953
indeed, they increased if we decreased the depth,

71
00:07:15,953 --> 00:07:17,500
and decreased it we increased it;

72
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,784
and then now, we write this down in a formal way.

73
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:27,483
And then, there is an affine transformation

74
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:33,544
between the shape of the arch-cable

75
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:49,536
and the bending moment diagram.

76
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,520
Indeed, if we observe these two diagrams here,

77
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,958
they have the same shape, but not exactly the same depth.

78
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:06,210
That is it, an affine transformation: it means that if we multiply the lengths and widths

79
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:10,231
by appropriate coefficients, we will get an identical diagram.

80
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,912
We now want to obtain some information about the internal forces

81
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:18,627
in the chords, that is to say the horizontal parts of our trusses.

82
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:22,816
We have information, first, which is valid for all the trusses.

83
00:08:22,816 --> 00:08:27,779
For all the trusses, you have already observed it before,

84
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:37,585
the chord which is on the side of the arch

85
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,537
is in compression.

86
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:55,777
We had already observed it, but we can now confirm it:

87
00:08:56,391 --> 00:09:00,639
the chord which is on the side of the arch is in compression.

88
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:08,194
In a similar way, the chord

89
00:09:11,522 --> 00:09:15,459
which is on the side of the cable

90
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:22,416
is in tension.

91
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,921
So in this case, the lower chord is on the side of the cable,

92
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:33,912
it is therefore in tension.

93
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,756
This is not only valid for the truss that I have drawn,

94
00:09:38,756 --> 00:09:42,400
but also for all the trusses, so even for trusses with variable depth,

95
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,236
the chord on the side of the arch is in compression.

96
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:49,809
Now, particularly for trusses with constant depth:

97
00:09:54,948 --> 00:10:06,255
the chord with the largest internal force

98
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,343
and since we have positive and negative values,

99
00:10:12,382 --> 00:10:15,720
we are going to talk about the absolute value; it can be in tension

100
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:18,652
or in compression;

101
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:24,891
is the the one for which the distance

102
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:34,482
between the arch and the cable is the largest.

103
00:10:40,235 --> 00:10:41,852
So, what can we notice ?

104
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:48,723
In this case of arch-cable, we obviously have, here, a maximum depth

105
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:53,422
and we are going to wonder to what chord it corresponds,

106
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:56,978
does it correspond to the upper chord or to the lower chord?

107
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,326
Actually, I am going to add one more point, here:

108
00:11:00,532 --> 00:11:04,476
to know which is the largest, we consider

109
00:11:04,508 --> 00:11:08,228
the middle point of each bar.

110
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:26,442
So if we look at the middle point, it is clear that it is this bar, here,

111
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:35,036
whose the middle is exactly here, which has the maximum internal force.

112
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,914
So, I am going to say that N(max)+, is the largest internal force in terms of absolute value,

113
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:43,477
it is also the largest tensile internal force.

114
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:53,220
Now, we can take look at two bars in the upper chord:

115
00:11:53,527 --> 00:11:58,205
the one which is just on the left of the load of 100kN,

116
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:01,554
and the one which is just on the right.

117
00:12:03,312 --> 00:12:06,914
And here, we can clearly see that both depths are not the same.

118
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:11,540
Why ? Because the left part of the arch goes down more slowly

119
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,199
than the right part.

120
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:19,810
Therefore the maximum compressive internal force will be in this bar,

121
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,677
whose the depth, here, is maximum.

122
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:30,685
So here, we have N(max) in compression.

123
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:35,726
Obviously, this diagonal -- this chord, here, has a quite significant

124
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:38,701
internal force, but it is a bit smaller

125
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:40,845
than the one of the left bar.

126
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:48,500
We can make similar observations, still valid in the case

127
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:51,684
of trusses with a constant depth, but now, in addition,

128
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:55,268
with a constant inclination of the diagonals.

129
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:05,046
The diagonal with the largest internal force,

130
00:13:08,098 --> 00:13:11,755
still in terms of absolute value -- I am not going to write it but we always

131
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:16,779
implicitly talk about absolute value; I use some parentheses --

132
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:24,439
is the one for which the inclination of the arch

133
00:13:29,847 --> 00:13:31,780
is maximum.

134
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:39,440
So, you can measure it on your notes: indeed, the left angle

135
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:43,954
is a bit larger than the right angle;

136
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,041
and what do we notice?

137
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,749
We notice that it applies to several bars.

138
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:55,447
If we consider the middle point, well, we have this diagonal,

139
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:03,678
this diagonal, and this diagonal, for which we have the same angle alpha(max).

140
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:07,713
And thus we have three internal forces which are equal,

141
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:15,087
two, in these diagonals, are in compression, one is in tension.

142
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:19,915
I cannot yet tell you why, but we are going to see this very soon.

143
00:14:19,915 --> 00:14:29,793
Here, we have the maximum internal force in the diagonals for these three diagonals.

144
00:14:34,979 --> 00:14:42,639
In a similar way, the diagonal with the smallest internal force,

145
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:54,652
still in terms of absolute value, is the one one for which

146
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:06,296
the inclination of the arch is minimal.

147
00:15:11,739 --> 00:15:16,186
So we are going to clearly identify that here, we have alpha(min);

148
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,779
it could even be horizontal.

149
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,705
And in this case here, it applies to these two diagonals

150
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:28,358
so here, we are going to have

151
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:35,724
a minimal internal force here, in compression, and here, in tension.

152
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:41,300
So here, we have the minimal internal force in the diagonals.

153
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:51,640
Here, we go on with our reasonings, which are valid for the trusses

154
00:15:51,686 --> 00:15:55,688
with a constant depth, and with a constant inclination of the diagonals.

155
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:59,121
What we want to see now is how we can know

156
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:01,504
the sign of the internal forces in all the diagonals.

157
00:16:02,464 --> 00:16:08,946
So, we can figure out that this diagram, with the arch-cable, is characterized

158
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:18,051
by three different parts, which I am going to call A, B and C; and we are going,

159
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:21,150
in a corresponding way, to make three small diagrams,

160
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:28,971
for these zones A, B and C. As you can see here,

161
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:34,652
I have drawn an orthonormal coordinate system, if you remember

162
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:39,084
to have studied, maybe, trigonometry, we talk about quadrants,

163
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:44,072
-- here we have the quadrant 1, 2, 3 and 4; there are always four quadrants

164
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:48,318
in the trigonometrical circle; you do not need to be a master at

165
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:51,627
trigonometry, you just need to accept the notion of quadrant.

166
00:16:52,627 --> 00:16:54,346
And we have this assertion:

167
00:16:54,412 --> 00:17:02,273
if the diagonal is in the same quadrant

168
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:17,058
than the arch, it is in compression.

169
00:17:21,687 --> 00:17:25,398
So, we are going to draw, approximately,

170
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:29,764
the shape of the arch in this quadrant,

171
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,708
and then we will draw, approximately,

172
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,385
the shape -- ah, I need to number my diagonals!

173
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:43,489
I am going to number them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.

174
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:56,458
In this quadrant here, I have the diagonal 1, then the diagonal 2 in the other quadrant,

175
00:17:56,458 --> 00:18:01,063
and the diagonal 3 is the same than the diagonal 1, here, in this quadrant.

176
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:04,740
If the diagonal is in the same quadrant than the arch, it is in compression,

177
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,299
so the diagonals 1 and 3 are in compression.

178
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:13,050
So here, I have the diagonal 1, and there, the diagonal 3,

179
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,968
which are in compression.

180
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:25,732
If the diagonal is in another quadrant,

181
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,816
it is in tension.

182
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:42,876
So, I have the diagonal 2, which is not in the same quadrant,

183
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:45,866
and which is thus in tension.

184
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:52,472
We now pass to zone B; in zone B, the arch has this shape,

185
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:58,345
approximately, it goes down rightwards; and we have, in zone B,

186
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:08,472
the diagonal 4, the diagonal 5, and we can see that

187
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:12,725
the diagonal 4 is in the same quadrant, so it is in compression;

188
00:19:15,336 --> 00:19:19,788
the diagonal 5 is in another quadrant, so it is in tension.

189
00:19:24,727 --> 00:19:27,945
Same thing for the last quadrant, where we have the arch,

190
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:32,294
which goes up again, a bit less steeply than before,

191
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:42,110
and then we have the diagonal 6, which is in this quadrant;

192
00:19:43,403 --> 00:19:47,455
and the diagonal 7, in this one.

193
00:19:47,694 --> 00:19:53,963
So the diagonal 6 is in tension, and the diagonal 7 is in compression

194
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:13,440
If, instead of having an arch-cable, we have a cable-arch,

195
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:22,383
it is the same thing, by analogy.

196
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:29,512
What do we have in our quadrants ? So here, we have quadrant A

197
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:37,555
-- hum sorry, the zone A, the zone B and the zone C;

198
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:44,019
so again, here, A, B and C.

199
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:51,158
I draw for these three zones the position of the cable, so here,

200
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:55,115
here, and here.

201
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:02,462
And we can immediately see that the diagonals which are in the same quadrant

202
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:08,572
than the cable are in tension. Here, that is this diagonal,

203
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:13,483
here, that is this diagonal, and the others are in compression.

204
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:21,851
We could have made this reasoning using an arch-cable,

205
00:21:21,851 --> 00:21:25,681
and we would have obtained the same results; I let you do this check

206
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,256
by yourself.

207
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:31,848
Se we can now determine the internal forces in all the chords,

208
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:36,109
simply on the basis of our structural scheme, and of the arch-cable.

209
00:21:36,183 --> 00:21:39,387
What does the arch-cable tell us ? Well, the chords...

210
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:44,628
The upper chord, which is on the side of the arch, is in compression;

211
00:21:45,528 --> 00:21:50,482
the lower chord, which is on the side of the cable, is in tension.

212
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,510
The diagonals which are in the same quadrant than the arch are in compression.

213
00:21:59,302 --> 00:22:02,256
So here, it is this; here, it is this again.

214
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:05,471
Here, it is this.

215
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:09,687
Here it is this, here it is like this,

216
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,083
and so forth till the end.

217
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:15,258
And then the diagonals which are in opposite quadrants,

218
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:19,209
if I drew here, I would cut, as well as here, if I drew,

219
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:25,244
I would cut quite violently the arch... Well, these diagonals are in tension.

220
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:35,521
Moreover, studying where is the largest depth, we can determine

221
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:41,882
the maximum internal force, here in tension, we have N(max)+

222
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:47,475
here, in compression, N(max)-

223
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:52,089
And then here, we have N(max) diagonal,

224
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:59,487
here N(max) diagonal, and likewise, here, N(max).

225
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,992
So you can see that, now, on the basis of what have learnt,

226
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:07,453
you can very quickly obtain the internal forces

227
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,593
in all the chords of a truss, even if it is complex,

228
00:23:10,593 --> 00:23:14,087
you just need to first obtain, simply, the arch-cable.

229
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:19,425
In this lecture, we have seen that, one more time, the arch-cable

230
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,797
is a central element, since it enables us to determine

231
00:23:22,837 --> 00:23:26,518
the sign of the internal forces in the chords, as well as that of the internal forces

232
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,142
in all the diagonals.

233
00:23:28,181 --> 00:23:31,097
We can also, on the basis of the arch-cable, determine

234
00:23:31,129 --> 00:23:36,183
the locations where the maximum values of the internal forces occur in the chords

235
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:37,704
and in the diagonals.

236
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,595
These elements will be very useful for the pre-dimensioning of trusses

237
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,545
which we will see thereafter.
