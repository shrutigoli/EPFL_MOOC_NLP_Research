00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,054
Hello. The purpose of this video is to give you

2
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:05,593
a short introduction about trusses.

3
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,244
As we will see together, trusses are essentially

4
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:10,725
structures derived from the arch-cable.

5
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:13,840
If you remember well, the arch-cable is the last type of structures

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,560
which we have seen in the course The Art of Structures I.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,417
It is the combination of an arch and of a cable which produces 

8
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:24,474
a type of structure with interesting particularities.

9
00:00:24,826 --> 00:00:27,498
The disadvantage of this structure, like for arches,

10
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:30,635
is that it has problems of shape stability,

11
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:34,062
that is to say that, depending on the loads, it must changes its shape

12
00:00:34,062 --> 00:00:36,961
to have a correct mode of resistance.

13
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,025
First, since it is 

14
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:40,928
an extension of the arch-cable,

15
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,683
I want to solve again a simple arch-cable

16
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:44,808
so we have here,

17
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,485
on the left, a fixed support,

18
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:47,801
a mobile support on the right

19
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:51,057
and two loads, one of 20N and one of 10N

20
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:55,174
and I would like to have an arch-cable so the height will just be equal

21
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:59,462
to the distance between the support and the lower end of the load of 20N.

22
00:01:00,462 --> 00:01:07,180
So this is the first segment of my arch-cable which has this orientation

23
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,223
and since I am here, I can find the position

24
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:17,134
of the resultant given the fact that this one is located

25
00:01:17,134 --> 00:01:20,192
on the extension of the line of action of this first segment.

26
00:01:22,174 --> 00:01:24,159
I am now coming to the Cremona diagram

27
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,500
where I replace the orientation

28
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:34,411
of the internal force on the left part of the arch-cable

29
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:37,314
since I am going to need it.

30
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:41,256
On the left part of the arch-cable,

31
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:46,452
the internal force acts with this inclination

32
00:01:46,452 --> 00:01:51,023
and then it is added to the force of 20N.

33
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:55,365
I first build here an auxiliary cable

34
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,322
and I choose that the second segment of this auxiliary cable is horizontal

35
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:05,851
from the upper end of the force of 20N.

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,631
In the real system, it means that the segment, here, is horizontal.

37
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:17,197
I have the right to do it because it is an auxiliary arch

38
00:02:17,197 --> 00:02:20,019
which is going to be used to determine the resultant.

39
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,910
The last part of the auxiliary arch is determined by this shape

40
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,273
on the Cremona diagram.

41
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:33,374
This orientation, I draw it again, here, on the real structure.

42
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:42,230
This last segment gives me the orientation of a second part of the auxiliary arch

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,679
and the intersection of these two lines gives me a point

44
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,554
on the line of action of the resultant.

45
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:56,943
In the Cremona diagram, on the right, I draw the resultant in a staggered way,

46
00:02:56,943 --> 00:03:00,699
so we can see it well, its value is 30N.

47
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:11,832
And in the real system, here, I have a resultant force, R, of 30N.

48
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:20,754
I now end the auxiliary arch with a support for it to be in equilibrium.

49
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:24,069
I now wish to determine the geometry

50
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,195
of the arch-cable which passes

51
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,620
by the left support, but also by the right support.

52
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,635
We can see that we did not pass by the right support

53
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:35,718
with this auxiliary arch.

54
00:03:35,726 --> 00:03:41,215
I know that the right segment of the arch must pass by the right support

55
00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:44,426
and by the intersection of the line of action of the resultant

56
00:03:44,426 --> 00:03:46,353
and of the one of the first segment.

57
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:49,346
So I line up these three elements

58
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:53,575
and then, it gives me the right part of my arch-cable.

59
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:57,632
I take advantage of this situation to give names to the characteristic points

60
00:03:57,632 --> 00:03:59,113
The point A

61
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,057
The point B

62
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:02,264
The point that I just determined, C

63
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,485
and, here, the point D.

64
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,756
I now redraw the right segment of the arch-cable

65
00:04:07,756 --> 00:04:10,557
on the Cremona diagram

66
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:21,887
which gives me the complete definition of the internal forces in this element.

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,764
Here, I have the internal force A-B.

68
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,502
We can erase it, we are going to use a dotted line.

69
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:34,860
Then, the internal force here is the internal force in C-D

70
00:04:36,046 --> 00:04:40,512
while here, this is the internal force in A-B.

71
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,792
The last segment of the arch,

72
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:49,111
the segment BC, has this orientation -

73
00:04:49,111 --> 00:04:51,556
it also gives us these internal forces.

74
00:04:51,556 --> 00:04:54,586
And then this orientation here, in the real system,

75
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,207
is necessarily parallel, at least if we have correctly made the graphical construction.

76
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:03,212
This is the correct shape that the arch of the arch-cable must have

77
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,794
for this combination of loads.

78
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:11,504
It is an arch-cable so I now add the cable

79
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:18,305
which acts between both supports : the left support A

80
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,065
and the right support D.

81
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:24,548
I am now going to check the equilibrium of my arch-cable

82
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:27,369
node by node.

83
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:30,753
I start by the node C.

84
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:41,425
The force of 10N, and then, turning counterclockwise,

85
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,374
the internal force in BC

86
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:49,920
and the internal force in CD are acting on node C.

87
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:56,929
The contribution of this node to the Cremona diagram thus corresponds

88
00:05:56,929 --> 00:06:02,705
to this triangle, here, which I indicate in blue.

89
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:11,847
Afterwards, I want to look at node D where the right support is.

90
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:17,625
On this node D, I know that the force C-D acts the other way.

91
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,332
I had already drawn it before.

92
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:26,306
Then, the internal force in A-D which is horizontal and leftwards.

93
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:29,222
It a tensile internal force.

94
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:32,058
Here.

95
00:06:35,405 --> 00:06:40,836
And then, finally, the vertical reaction RD is also acting on this node.

96
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:46,711
I draw it again in a staggered way to see better

97
00:06:46,711 --> 00:06:47,825
what is happening.

98
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:54,321
Here, RD which has a value of 12.5N.

99
00:06:57,341 --> 00:07:04,064
The contribution of the orange node to the Cremona diagram

100
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:06,723
partially superimposes

101
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:09,057
on the one of the node C.

102
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:12,300
We are now going to look at the equilibrium of node B,

103
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,127
which is loaded by a force of 20N.

104
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:22,261
The force of 20N which is here, acts on this node.

105
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,429
And then, the compressive internal force in A-B.

106
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:32,375
The contribution of the node B to the Cremona diagram

107
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,166
goes from there to there.

108
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,644
And thus...

109
00:07:46,764 --> 00:07:50,933
I am now looking at node A

110
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:55,960
which is also subjected to a support reaction.

111
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,612
So, this node A is subjected to,

112
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:02,575
counterclockwise,

113
00:08:02,864 --> 00:08:05,898
first the internal force in A-D in the other direction,

114
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,594
then the internal force in AB

115
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:13,019
and the reaction at the support which necessarily needs to be vertical

116
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:15,535
for the system to be in equilibrium.

117
00:08:15,535 --> 00:08:19,028
Here, I have RA

118
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,202
which is equal to 17.5N.

119
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:28,764
So, RA is here, vertical upwards.

120
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:31,961
Here, we thus found the internal forces

121
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:35,176
in each of the elements of the arch-cable,

122
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,546
as well as the reactions at the supports. This is a reminder.

123
00:08:37,546 --> 00:08:41,725
You have already done it within the framework of the course The Art of Structures I.

124
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:45,790
If you have not done it before, study well this construction

125
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,587
because this is a basic construction which we will use a lot

126
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:53,745
and that we will develop in the following videos.

127
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:58,066
In this video, you can see an arch-cable with two loads.

128
00:08:58,066 --> 00:09:01,882
When the loads are symmetrical, you can see that I can add a force,

129
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:03,297
it remains perfectly stable.

130
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:07,835
However, if I add a force on the left part only,

131
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:11,362
the left node wants to go down and I cannot find an equilibrium position,

132
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:13,487
only if I make it go up.

133
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,352
This phenomenon of stability, which we have already well studied, is a problem

134
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,519
with arch-cables.

135
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,835
However, if I had a diagonal element, a chain in this case,

136
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:27,043
I can see that I come back to the initial shape and that I can add

137
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:31,735
a second load, or several loads while the structure remains stable.

138
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:34,752
This is the interest of truss structures.

139
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:42,453
So, what have we seen in the video ? We had an arch-cable here

140
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:52,113
with three bars in compression and one in tension.

141
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,869
And we have completed it. We have kept the three bars.

142
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:02,958
We are going to see later, actually very soon, that they actually remained

143
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,372
in compression.

144
00:10:05,707 --> 00:10:11,833
Then, the chain remained in tension and we have added a second chain.

145
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,677
So on the left, we have an arch-cable.

146
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:25,755
And on the right, we have a truss.

147
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:34,211
The arch-cable has a variable shape

148
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:38,183
since it must vary

149
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:43,770
according to the loads for the arch to be stable.

150
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:56,149
To the contrary, the truss has a fixed shape.

151
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:00,106
So we will see in this case, depending on the loads, we can have a problem

152
00:11:00,106 --> 00:11:03,452
because this chain that I added can only carry tension,

153
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:08,272
but in principle, the truss nevertheless keeps a fixed shape.

154
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:13,998
There is a bit of vocabulary to add about trusses.

155
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:18,772
When we talk about the upper part of a truss,

156
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:23,664
we talk about the upper chord.

157
00:11:27,947 --> 00:11:32,407
In the lower part, quite naturally,

158
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:35,574
is the lower chord.

159
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:44,653
The inclined elements are called diagonals.

160
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:54,553
And the vertical elements, here, are called posts.

161
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,416
There are always diagonals in trusses.

162
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,967
In some trusses, there are not posts.

163
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:03,005
If, for example, you look at the illustration

164
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:08,663
which is on the cover of this video, it is a truss with V-shaped diagonals

165
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:10,469
without any posts.

166
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:16,934
You have for example, here, a truss with V-shaped diagonals without any posts,

167
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:19,732
this is the Palais de Beaubourg in Paris.

168
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:24,481
We can recognize several trusses at each level, at each storey.

169
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:29,109
Actually, this structure is supported by big trusses.

170
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:32,486
We will see how to determine the internal forces in such a structure.

171
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:36,484
And then we will also see how to determine the sign of the internal forces

172
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,640
without proceeding to big calculations.

173
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,634
In this video, we have seen that trusses are structures which are derived

174
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:45,435
from the arch-cable.

175
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:48,575
In addition to the properties of the arch-cable, they have the advantage

176
00:12:48,575 --> 00:12:51,671
not to have to change their shape to be able to resist

177
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,053
various combinations of loads.

178
00:12:55,053 --> 00:12:57,864
The constituting elements of a truss are :

179
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:02,701
the lower and upper chords, the diagonals and, if there are some,

180
00:13:02,701 --> 00:13:04,308
the posts.
