00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,031
Hello, in this video, we are going to deal with a truss with 5 nodes.

2
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:10,866
As you can see in this video, we can move from a truss with 4 nodes,

3
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:13,240
the one which had a diagonal in compression,

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,005
to a truss with 5 nodes.

5
00:00:16,005 --> 00:00:19,871
Adding 2 bars and 1 node,

6
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:22,629
we thus get a new structure.

7
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:26,450
We first want to see if this structure is statically determinate.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:33,006
We have 2 support conditions on the right and 1 on the left, which means 3 in total.

9
00:00:33,006 --> 00:00:40,760
Thereafter, we have (counts till 7) 7 bars.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:52,075
We have (counts till 5) 5, 2 x 5 = 10 = 3 + 7.

11
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,885
Then, we are going to see

12
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,966
how to solve this structure,

13
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:58,200
what are the internal forces acting inside

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,001
and then we will compare these results

15
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,681
to the results we previously got

16
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,785
for the arch-cable and for the truss with 4 nodes.

17
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,227
Afterwards, we will perform a study of variations

18
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:11,812
to figure out what is the influence of height

19
00:01:11,812 --> 00:01:15,018
on all the internal forces acting in this truss.

20
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:17,766
Let's start by solving the equilibrium.

21
00:01:17,766 --> 00:01:21,317
We have got a small problem here because there is no node

22
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,146
like the one before. There are 3 bars intersecting on this node,

23
00:01:24,146 --> 00:01:27,713
as well as on this one; there are 4 bars intersecting on this node,

24
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:32,013
here there are 2 bars, here there are 2 bars.

25
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:33,813
We will be able to solve this problem

26
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:37,253
if we first get the support reactions

27
00:01:37,253 --> 00:01:39,342
on the left or on the right.

28
00:01:39,342 --> 00:01:42,445
Here, I have already got them ; maybe in your exercise,

29
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:45,682
it will first be necessary to determine the support reactions,

30
00:01:45,682 --> 00:01:50,282
from which we can solve, for example, the node E.

31
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:55,781
We are going to start by the node E, here.

32
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:12,639
The support reaction RE = 12.5N acts on this node.

33
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,966
Afterwards, rotating counter-clockwise

34
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:17,217
around this node

35
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:20,952
we meet the bar D-E

36
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:24,496
Be careful, the support reaction is drawn on a staggered way,

37
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:29,065
but we are going to make the Cremona construction

38
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:37,520
using the axis which is given by the forces, so here. We have the parallel to D-E,

39
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:48,727
then, we will arrive on C-D here, at this level.

40
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:53,425
Here are the internal forces.

41
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:55,351
What we can see here,

42
00:02:55,351 --> 00:03:01,889
is that this force C-D is going to compress the node E,

43
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:05,759
so this bar is in compression.

44
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:14,098
Respectively, this vector is a vector in compression.

45
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,050
This is the internal force inside D-E.

46
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,295
Afterwards, the internal force inside C-D pulls on the free-body

47
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:32,118
so this is a tensile internal force, then this bar here is in tension

48
00:03:32,118 --> 00:03:45,012
and then the polygon of forces is closed thanks to this support force on the right.

49
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:51,211
The contribution of the node E to the Cremona diagram

50
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:55,647
is highlighted in green.

51
00:03:55,647 --> 00:04:01,425
We are now going to move to node D.

52
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:05,241
This node is subjected to the internal force in D-E, the force of 10 Newton,

53
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:08,774
the force in B-D and the force in C-D.

54
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:23,356
We take the internal force D-E in the other direction, we add the force of 10 Newtons,

55
00:04:23,356 --> 00:04:30,295
and then the internal force in B-D, horizontal,

56
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:38,471
then the internal force in C-D, parallel to the segment [CD]

57
00:04:38,471 --> 00:04:48,491
to finally reach again the beginning of the internal force D-E.

58
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,186
The internal force in B-D is pushing towards the right,

59
00:04:56,186 --> 00:05:01,640
this is thus a compressive internal force acting on node D,

60
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:11,477
so this bar B-D, here, is in compression.

61
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:18,359
However, the internal force in C-D pulls on the free-body

62
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:23,801
and then bar C-D is in tension.

63
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:29,377
Here is the contribution of the node D to the Cremona diagram,

64
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:34,913
so a triangle over and another under.

65
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:42,985
We are now going to move to node C which is not loaded.

66
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:47,620
There are internal forces anyway. I had not noted it,

67
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,102
here is the internal force C-E

68
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,237
along which we are going to travel on the other direction,

69
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:55,079
then we are going to follow C-D also on the other direction,

70
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:16,500
and then we are going to travel along B-C

71
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,310
until here.

72
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:26,560
Then, I am going to shift to draw the internal force in A-C

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,941
till, again, the beginning of the internal force in C-E.

74
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:37,273
The internal force force in B-C, here, pushes on the free-body,

75
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:44,576
it is thus a compressive internal force,

76
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:50,159
however the internal force in A-C pulls on the free-body,

77
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,562
it is a tensile internal force.

78
00:06:55,562 --> 00:07:00,091
The contribution of node C to the Cremeona diagram

79
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:02,053
is a bit complicated

80
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:04,314
since here, there are two lines one over each other

81
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:08,074
and there is this little triangle at the end.

82
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:15,961
We are now going to move to node B.

83
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:19,422
This node B is subjected to the internal force of B-C in the other direction,

84
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:35,315
then to the internal force of B-D also in the other direction, then to the force of 20 Newtons,

85
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:48,274
and to the internal force in A-B which comes back to the beginning of the internal force in B-C.

86
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:55,275
The internal force in A-B is thus in compression here.

87
00:07:55,275 --> 00:08:02,128
I should have drawn before that the internal force in A-C is in tension.

88
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:15,140
The contribution of the node B to the Cremona Diagram, here.

89
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,792
Finally, we are going to move to node A.

90
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:24,560
We are simply going to check that the reaction at the support is right.

91
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,546
We have the internal force A-C in the other direction, followed by the internal force A-B in the other direction,

92
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:43,912
followed by the reaction force on the left RA = 17,5N.

93
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:56,846
The contribution of this gray subsystem to the Cremona diagram, here.

94
00:08:56,846 --> 00:09:01,380
We have solved here the equilibrium of the entire structure,

95
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,453
finding the internal forces in all the nodes.

96
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,978
And here, like for a truss with 4 nodes, you have

97
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:11,393
all the resolution process which I encourage you to attentively follow

98
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:14,363
to understand well what happens.

99
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:20,119
To better understand, you could watch the video again to see what I have done.

100
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:22,973
Now, as we did before, we want to compare

101
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:26,030
the internal forces in the arch-cable, the truss with 4 nodes

102
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,112
and the truss with 5 nodes.

103
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:33,695
For this, we are going to concentrate on certain elements.

104
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,516
If we look at the internal force in the left diagonal, 

105
00:09:38,516 --> 00:09:42,562
we can see that it is quite similar in these calculations,

106
00:09:42,562 --> 00:09:45,098
actually it is identical in 3 of the 4 calculations

107
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:48,281
and a little bit bigger in the fourth one.

108
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:52,585
What we can see as well is that this internal force is given

109
00:09:52,585 --> 00:10:04,016
by this part of the Cremona diagram.

110
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:08,800
Likewise, the internal force in the lower bar

111
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,148
is given by this same part of the graphical construction,

112
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:18,115
sometimes with additional elements, but most of the time directly.

113
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:22,915
We can see that the order of magnitude of these internal forces is again the same.

114
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:27,583
If we look at the internal force in the right part of the truss,

115
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,905
it is given on the upper part

116
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:34,942
of the construction.

117
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:44,187
And again, the values are quite similar.

118
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:46,873
There is a big similarity 

119
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:49,762
between the results obtain for the arch-cable

120
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:52,314
and the various types of trusses which we have seen till now.

121
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:55,777
Don't forget that these structures obviously have the same span,

122
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:59,751
the same height, and they are subjected to the same loads.

123
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,994
In this diagram,

124
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,379
I have gathered together the resolution for three trusses :

125
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:08,351
the truss with 5 nodes which we have already seen together,

126
00:11:08,351 --> 00:11:12,970
a truss which is similar to the first one but with half the height

127
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,804
and a truss which is also similar to the first one but with twice the height.

128
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,225
As before, let's look at

129
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,468
what happens in the Cremona diagram.

130
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:25,242
Here, we get the internal forces in the left diagonal

131
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:27,153
which is the most loaded.

132
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,840
When we divide the height by 2,

133
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,105
we can see that the horizontal scale turns out to be the double.

134
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:40,148
However, the vertical scale is defined by Newtons.

135
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:43,436
The loads being the same, this vertical scale remains identical.

136
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:50,034
Horizontaly, the drawing lengthens, which means that the triangle becomes flatter.

137
00:11:50,034 --> 00:11:52,780
What we can see is that these elements here,

138
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,352
the horizontal elements, got twice longer

139
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:59,002
so the internal forces double from 10.1 to 20.2N.

140
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:02,970
However, in the diagonal, we go from -20 to -26N

141
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,981
because, trigonometrically,

142
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:11,186
the hypotenuse increases less than the cathetus which doubles.

143
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:13,997
In a similar way, if we take an interest in the right part,

144
00:12:13,997 --> 00:12:18,032
we have doubled the height of the truss and we have kept the same vertical forces,

145
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:22,800
this triangle becomes much smaller, actually half size,

146
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,585
it is classical, we go from 10.1 to 5.1N, it is a rounded 5.05,

147
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:31,281
then we decrease the internal forces in the horizontal elements

148
00:12:31,281 --> 00:12:32,867
by a factor 2.

149
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:35,320
However, for the diagonal elements,

150
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,320
the internal force goes from 20.2 to 18.2, in compression, reciprocally.

151
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,792
As we had already seen it for the arch-cable

152
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,807
and for other types of structures,

153
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:48,875
the height that we give to a truss has a big influence.

154
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:53,934
If the figure becomes smaller, less high, the internal forces increase.

155
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,160
That means that we will use more matter.

156
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,568
If, conversely, the structures becomes higher,

157
00:12:58,568 --> 00:13:02,525
the internal forces decrease and we will be able to save matter.

158
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,037
In this lecture,

159
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:07,057
we have seen that the truss with 5 nodes is statically determinate,

160
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:09,144
we have solved it

161
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:13,105
starting by a node on which there was support forces.

162
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:16,793
These support forces are independantely determined.

163
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:21,527
We have determined the internal forces for each of the bars of this truss

164
00:13:21,527 --> 00:13:24,249
and we have compared them, on the one hand, to the ones

165
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:27,093
of the other types of structures which we had seen till here,

166
00:13:27,093 --> 00:13:30,619
the arch-cable and the various types of trusses with 4 nodes,

167
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:33,699
and then we have carried out a variations study,

168
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:35,614
changing the height.

169
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:39,033
We have seen how this change of height

170
00:13:39,033 --> 00:13:41,512
had repercussions on the Cremona diagram

171
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:44,152
and thus on the internal forces which act on the structure.
