00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:02,782
Hello. In this video, we are going to deal with

2
00:00:02,788 --> 00:00:05,764
the N-shaped trusses. And we will see how

3
00:00:05,794 --> 00:00:08,714
to solve certain cases of particular nodes.

4
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:10,665
We will see that the solving method

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,686
for trusses with N-shaped diagonals

6
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,049
is similar to what we had till now,

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,076
with simply Cremona diagrams which have a slightly different shape.

8
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,030
We will determine the internal forces in each of the bars,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:25,180
and then we will make some observations about these internal forces.

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,331
Finally, we will spend a bit of time looking at cases of particular nodes,

11
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,113
particularly unloaded nodes.

12
00:00:33,944 --> 00:00:38,034
In this video, you can see a truss with 10 nodes,

13
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:42,055
which is being to be loaded by three loads of 10N

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,673
on the three upper nodes, on the middle.

15
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:50,257
Let's first figure out if this structure is statically determinate.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,119
Here, we have a fixed support, so one, two support reactions ;

17
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:59,748
a mobile support on the right, we thus have three reaction forces.

18
00:00:59,848 --> 00:01:02,004
We are going to count the bars :

19
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:15,880
1, 2, 3, … (counts till 17)

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,767
17 bars in total.

21
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:20,367
Let's count the nodes :

22
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:29,404
1, 2, 3,… (counts till 10)

23
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:33,516
2 x 10 = 20, which is also equal to 3 + 17 ;

24
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:37,806
therefore this structure is statically determinate.

25
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,607
We are going to proceed with the resolution;

26
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,300
we already have the support reactions.

27
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,033
In this case, it is quite easy since the resultant

28
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,846
is located in the middle and has a value of 30 N,

29
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,682
the resultant is the applied force.

30
00:01:49,682 --> 00:01:53,335
And then, we have a support reaction on the left and on the right,

31
00:01:53,335 --> 00:01:56,507
which is equal to 15 N.

32
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:04,182
Let's start by node A, which is slightly particular

33
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:07,697
since a support reaction acts on it,

34
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:10,504
and there is a bar which is lined up with this support reaction ;

35
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,947
there is also another bar which is not lined up.

36
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,114
Well, for the sum of these three forces to be equal to zero,

37
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,550
it is necessary that the force in A-C be equal to zero.

38
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:30,450
Let's build the Cremona diagram, with the vertical reaction R(A) on the right,

39
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:33,118
which is equal to 15 N,

40
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:40,554
and the internal force in the bar A-D which will be equal to 15 N and will act on the opposite way.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,871
I draw it slightly staggered, but obviously, in reality,

42
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,361
it should be superimposed.

43
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,248
So this bar A-B is in compression,

44
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,082
and the contribution of the node A to the Cremona diagram

45
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,430
is simply this line, or these two superimposed lines.

46
00:03:03,278 --> 00:03:06,774
Let's now move to node B which is an unloaded node.

47
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:11,390
This node is subjected to the internal force A-B in the other direction,

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,924
then, turning counterclockwise,

49
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:33,261
I first meet the bar B-C, then the bar B-D.

50
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:42,884
We can see that the internal force in B-C pulls on the free-body,

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,021
it is thus a tensile internal force,

52
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,593
while the internal force in B-D pushes on the free-body,

53
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:02,764
it is therefore a compressive internal force.

54
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:17,911
This orange triangle indicates the contribution of node B to the Cremona diagram.

55
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:23,122
We now pass to node C, another unloaded node,

56
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:28,681
which is of course subjected to the internal force in A-C, equal to zero,

57
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:33,143
to the internal force in B-C in the other direction,

58
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:41,578
then to the internal force in C-E, horizontally,

59
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:48,660
and finally to the internal force in C-D, vertically.

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,244
We can see that the internal force in C-E pulls on the free-body,

61
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:55,503
it is thus a tensile internal force,

62
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:08,525
while the internal force in C-D pushes on the free-body,

63
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:11,610
it is therefore a compressive internal force.

64
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:23,222
The contribution of this free-body to the Cremona diagram

65
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,676
is thus this pink triangle.

66
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:31,761
We now move to the node D, a loaded node,

67
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,146
which is subjected to a load of 10N ;

68
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:40,506
I am going to draw it, one more time, in a staggered way ;

69
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,128
while in reality, it should be superimposed.

70
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:46,856
Here, I have a load of 10 N ; then, turning

71
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:49,212
counterclockwise,

72
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:53,138
I meet the internal force in B-D in the other direction,

73
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:56,367
then the internal force in C-D in the other direction,

74
00:05:56,367 --> 00:06:01,640
now I meet the bar D-E,

75
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:12,276
then, I meet the bar D-F,

76
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:17,414
to finally come back to the beginning of the load of 10 N.

77
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,325
The internal force in D-E pulls on the free-body,

78
00:06:34,338 --> 00:06:36,711
it is a tensile internal force.

79
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:47,627
And the internal force in D-F pushes on the free-body,

80
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:49,665
it is D-F, here ;

81
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:11,403
the contribution of this node D to the global equilibrium is thus like this.

82
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:22,472
We cannot move now to the node E,

83
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:26,095
since there are still one, two, three bars in which the internal forces are unknown,

84
00:07:26,095 --> 00:07:28,826
but we can move to the node F.

85
00:07:29,947 --> 00:07:34,810
Again, this node is subjected to a load of 10 N.

86
00:07:42,012 --> 00:07:45,927
Then, the internal force in D-F in the other direction,

87
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:49,772
the internal force in F-E,

88
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,610
and finally the internal force in F-H.

89
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:13,340
The internal force in E-F pushes on the free-body,

90
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,587
so let's say E-F,

91
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:25,630
it is then a compressive internal force, such as the internal force in F-H.

92
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:42,670
The contribution of the yellow node to the Cremona diagram is this rectangle,

93
00:08:42,781 --> 00:08:46,749
with the same internal forces F-H and D-F,

94
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:51,108
and 10N for the internal force in the bar E-F.

95
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,429
We can now look at the equilibrium of the node E.

96
00:08:56,814 --> 00:09:00,902
We know the internal force in E-F, well, however, in the other direction ;

97
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:07,408
the internal force in D-E, in the other direction, the internal force in C-E, in the other direction,

98
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:12,865
then, we come back by an internal force which is going to be equal and in the opposite direction,

99
00:09:13,268 --> 00:09:17,984
-- I am not going to redraw it, but… this is the internal force in E-G.

100
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:20,912
We could have guessed that, since the structure is symmetrical,

101
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:23,240
the internal forces must also obviously be symmetrical.

102
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:30,488
Then, by an internal force in E-H, which will also be symmetrical to the internal force in D-E,

103
00:09:30,921 --> 00:09:33,038
… E-H, here.

104
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,870
This light blue node contributes to the Cremona diagram

105
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,160
in this way.

106
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,111
We could keep solving the equilibrium of the truss

107
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:58,632
with the node H, obtaining the internal forces in H-I and G-H, and so forth,

108
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:02,462
but since the structure is symmetrical, we already know these internal forces,

109
00:10:02,523 --> 00:10:06,053
simply reading them on the other part and we know that here,

110
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:13,766
we have compression ; here, tension in G-I;

111
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:18,785
and then the internal force in G-J is equal to zero. I let you finish this drawing by yourself

112
00:10:18,912 --> 00:10:23,364
if you wish to. What we can see is that here, we have a N-shaped truss,

113
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:28,392
with diagonals in tension. All the diagonals are in tension

114
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:32,462
and that is due to this configuration in which the diagonals

115
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:35,379
look towards the inside of the truss.

116
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:39,361
Of course, this is only true if the loads act downwards.

117
00:10:39,397 --> 00:10:43,008
Let's note that when the diagonals are in tension,

118
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:47,861
the posts are in compression.

119
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:57,862
If you look at the equilibrium of the node C, for example,

120
00:10:57,862 --> 00:10:59,507
it is particularly clear,

121
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:03,325
we have this tension which must be offset by this compression:

122
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,182
it goes together.

123
00:11:05,976 --> 00:11:09,057
In this video, we can see a new truss structure,

124
00:11:09,107 --> 00:11:14,098
this time with a configuration in which the diagonals are orientated in the other way

125
00:11:14,098 --> 00:11:16,898
compared to what we have seen till now.

126
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:20,512
I let you determine that this structure is statically determinate ;

127
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,281
it is since it just

128
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,316
has the same number of bars and nodes than the previous structure.

129
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:30,886
Likewise, the loads being the same, the support reactions are identical

130
00:11:30,963 --> 00:11:34,810
and we can start the resolutiokn. We have a little problem here,

131
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:39,376
because at the level of the node A, we have 3 bars ; one, two, three bars which meet

132
00:11:39,376 --> 00:11:41,692
thus we cannot proceed to the solving

133
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:44,097
with the usual method.

134
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:49,039
However, what we can observe is that the node B is again

135
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:54,537
a particular node : this is a node with this kind of configuration.

136
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,944
When we have this kind of configuration,

137
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:00,994
the only way to have a polygon of forces which is closed,

138
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:02,754
and then a structure in equilibrium,

139
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,142
is that the internal forces in both these bars be equal to zero.

140
00:12:05,255 --> 00:12:08,980
So the internal force in these two bars, here, is equal to zero; and now, we can

141
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:15,289
start to solve the structure beginning with node A.

142
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:25,277
On this node A, the support reaction has a value of 15 N and is orientated upwards,

143
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:31,480
then, turning counterclockwise

144
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:39,082
from this force, we first meet an horizontal segment, A-C,

145
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:46,522
and a segment orientated at 45° which is A-D

146
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:52,330
Here is the equilibrium of the node A.

147
00:12:55,634 --> 00:13:00,313
We can see that the internal force in A-C pulls on the free-body,

148
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,622
it is therefore a tensile internal force

149
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,949
and that the internal force in A-B pushes on the free-body,

150
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:20,300
it is thus a compressive internal force.

151
00:13:31,366 --> 00:13:38,115
The contribution of the node A to the Cremona diagram is this triangle.

152
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,635
We now move to the node D :

153
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:49,075
this node is subjected to a load of 10N, I draw it in a staggered way to be able to see it

154
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:53,093
but it should be superimposed to the support reaction in A.

155
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:59,781
A load of 10 N, then the internal force in A-D, in the other direction ;

156
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:05,444
the internal force in C-D, vertical ;

157
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,529
and finally the internal force in D-F, horizontal.

158
00:14:20,282 --> 00:14:27,517
The internal force in [CD] pulls on the free-body of the node D,

159
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,393
it is therefore a tensile internal force.

160
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:43,748
The internal force in D-F pushes on the free-body,

161
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:46,993
it is a compressive internal force.

162
00:14:54,713 --> 00:15:01,545
Here is the contribution of the node D to the Cremona diagram.

163
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,513
Let's now move to the node C :

164
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:09,446
this node is subjected to the internal force in [CD], in the other direction,

165
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:15,488
in A-C, in the other direction, then to the internal force in C-E --

166
00:15:15,528 --> 00:15:18,507
I already know that this is going to be a tensile internal force,

167
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:23,894
so I am going to draw it in tension, in a staggered way ; it should be superimposed.

168
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,341
I am going to finish by the internal force in C-F,

169
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:31,227
and here too, I already know that it is a compressive internal force, 

170
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:35,646
so I save some time by directly drawing it in blue.

171
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:40,698
Here, this is the internal force in C-F…

172
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:51,257
And here, this is the internal force in C-E.

173
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,623
The contribution of the node C to the Cremona diagram is like this :

174
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:06,162
we came here, we left in the other direction, we turned in this way.

175
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:08,915
At this stage, we cannot solve node F yet,

176
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:11,781
since there are still three bars in which the internal forces remain unknown here,

177
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,632
however, we can solve node E,

178
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:22,421
which is subjected to the internal force in C-E, in the other direction,

179
00:16:22,507 --> 00:16:24,952
and then -- I just redraw the tip of the arrow --

180
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:31,512
the internal force in E-G, which is identical, in the other direction.

181
00:16:32,411 --> 00:16:36,232
There cannot be any component of internal force inside E-F,

182
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:39,531
because otherwise, it would be impossible for the vectorial sum to be zero

183
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,916
with two vectors which are in this direction

184
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:44,434
and one vector which is perpendicular to them.

185
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:48,575
So, the internal force in E-F here must necessarily be equal to zero.

186
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:55,037
The contribution of node E is then limited to, here,

187
00:16:55,037 --> 00:16:57,366
a small horizontal line.

188
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:02,075
We can now move to the node F,

189
00:17:02,075 --> 00:17:07,683
which is first subjected to a new load of 10N,

190
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:19,541
then to the internal force in D-F in the other direction, to the internal force in C-F in the other direction

191
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,271
to zero in E-F, then to the internal force in F-G --

192
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,567
I know by symmetry that it is in compression so I directly

193
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:33,648
continue -- to the internal force in F-G, in compression, and

194
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:39,469
finally, to the internal force in F-H -- I also know by symmetry

195
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:42,070
that it is also in compression.

196
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:53,144
So here, I have the internal force in F-H, and here the internal force in F-G.

197
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:12,317
The contribution of the node F has thus this shape of a house.

198
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:18,794
As previously, we could keep solving the equilibrium moving to the node H,

199
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:22,142
and we would obtain all the results, it would give us

200
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:26,194
the following part of the Cremona diagram. However, since we know

201
00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:27,855
that our structure is symmetrical,

202
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:32,037
we are not going to do it here. We have here an element in compression,

203
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:35,062
and here two elements in tension.

204
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:40,272
And finally here, two bars in which there is no internal force.

205
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:46,736
We are thus here dealing with a N-shaped truss with diagonals in compression,

206
00:18:50,221 --> 00:18:54,561
and obviously, in this case, the posts…

207
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,801
… are in tension.

208
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:09,763
We can see in this video that it is possible to release the bar

209
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:13,313
which previously corresponded to G-J,

210
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:15,758
without the equilibrium of the structure being impacted ;

211
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:19,900
well, we had seen on this first truss that the internal force in G-J,

212
00:19:19,946 --> 00:19:25,405
and also the internal force in A-C, on the left, are equal to zero so we can obviously

213
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:29,765
take off these chains -- at least, for this combination of load.

214
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:38,357
This is due to the fact that we had a particular free-body here :

215
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:41,282
when we have a free-body with a bar,

216
00:19:41,316 --> 00:19:43,748
and another bar in the other direction,

217
00:19:43,748 --> 00:19:50,487
and a force, from the support or not, it is obvious that here,

218
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:55,410
we must have a compressive internal force which is equal to F to reach the equilibrium,

219
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,090
and to get this same equilibrium, we must necessarily have an internal force which is equal to zero ;

220
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:05,325
this is true for this node here, it is also true for this node there.

221
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:10,818
We have another particular node, which we have also investigated,

222
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:16,341
it is the node F. On this node F, we have the following situation :

223
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:22,059
we have a bar which continues, and then a bar which is perpendicular to the first one,

224
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:24,510
which are subjected to a certain force.

225
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:29,630
For reasons of equilibrium, it is absolutely necessary that there is,

226
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,296
here, a compressive internal force equal to F,

227
00:20:33,296 --> 00:20:35,681
-- this is what we have found in our solution--

228
00:20:35,713 --> 00:20:39,162
while if we say the internal force in the chord -- for us,

229
00:20:39,162 --> 00:20:42,767
it was a compressive internal force -- if we say that we have an internal force N on the left,

230
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:46,302
therefore the internal force on the right must be opposite.

231
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:51,331
The Cremona diagram which is induced, if we start by the force F...

232
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:58,304
we have the force F, then the internal force N,

233
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:03,258
thereafter the internal force F in the vertical bar

234
00:21:03,258 --> 00:21:09,753
and we have again the internal force N, horizontal, acting on the right.

235
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:13,585
We have also seen particular nodes,

236
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:16,802
in the trusses with diagonals in compression;

237
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:19,056
here, this is the same truss than previously,

238
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:23,150
but I took off the bars which were not used

239
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,838
in this construction and you can see that it still stands well.

240
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:34,468
Indeed, here, we have the same configuration - except that it is on the top -

241
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:38,337
which we have seen for the truss with diagonals in tension ;

242
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:41,889
here we have two bars which have a random angle,

243
00:21:41,937 --> 00:21:46,123
by the way, they do not necessarily need to have an angle of 90 degrees,

244
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:51,935
if we have this kind of configuration,

245
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:58,175
we will also have, in case there is no load acting on the node,

246
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,133
we will also have internal forces equal to zero in these bars.

247
00:22:01,266 --> 00:22:06,206
We had another particular node, here : it was the node E.

248
00:22:07,158 --> 00:22:10,344
This is a particular case of what we have just seen

249
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:14,676
on the trusses with diagonals in tension, since we have here

250
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:17,400
a bar that continues, in which there is an internal force,

251
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,659
and we have here a vertical bar.

252
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:24,440
We have here an horizontal internal force N, on the left and on the right,

253
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,423
and it is necessary, to have equilibrium,

254
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:31,689
that the internal force in this vertical E-F be equal to zero,

255
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:35,000
otherwise, it is not possible to reach the equilibrium.

256
00:22:35,268 --> 00:22:39,340
In this lecture, we have seen how to solve the trusses with N-shaped diagonals,

257
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,555
we have seen that it was sometimes necessary

258
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:43,335
to start by a particular node,

259
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:45,401
for which we can determine, for example,

260
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:48,175
that certain internal forces are equal to zero, before being able to proceed

261
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,249
to the usual solving.

262
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,243
But it has always been possible to proceed with resolution.

263
00:22:53,243 --> 00:22:56,281
We have obtained the internal forces observing, in particular,

264
00:22:56,317 --> 00:23:00,399
that according to the orientation of the diagonals, they are systematically

265
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:03,723
in tension or in compression, and that in addition,

266
00:23:03,723 --> 00:23:08,335
the posts are systematically in compression or in tension.

267
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,581
We have observed a certain number of particular nodes,

268
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:14,655
in which it is possible, simply observationally, 

269
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:18,255
to determine that the internal force is equal to zero or that it must be equal

270
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:21,935
to another quantity, or to the internal force in the adjacent bar.
