1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:01,656
Hello, in this video,

2
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:04,736
I will talk about vertical Vierendeel beams.

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,939
In this configuration, we will see that on the one hand,

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,285
we can compare this structure to superimposed frames

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:16,040
or else, on the other hand, when we think about what we have seen with the Vierendeel beam

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,341
in the previous video, to a Vierendeel cantilever.

7
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:24,106
That will depend a bit on the loads, if they act vertically

8
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,707
or horizontally.

9
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:29,170
In this structure located in Paris which we are going to use as example,

10
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:30,588
the headquarter of UNESCO,

11
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:35,432
the structural concept has been developped by the engineer Nervi and we can see

12
00:00:35,582 --> 00:00:37,335
a peculiar construction.

13
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:41,445
That is a tall building with columns whose width

14
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:45,030
increases as we go towards the bottom of the building

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,900
and at ground level, there are some very particular columns with a very

16
00:00:49,186 --> 00:00:50,475
inclined shape.

17
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,718
Let's first look at the effect of loads on these frames

18
00:00:55,016 --> 00:00:56,618
starting by the top storey.

19
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:01,231
For the sake of simplicity, I only place one load in the middle of the frame.

20
00:01:01,465 --> 00:01:06,633
We already know how to solve this, we have seen it in the lecture about frames.

21
00:01:06,982 --> 00:01:08,491
We know that the pressure line...

22
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:10,287
That is a statically indeterminate structure,

23
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:14,497
the pressure line is going to have this shape.

24
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:24,571
And since it is necessary to bring back pressure

25
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,975
inside the frame, we are going to apply compression in the diagonal

26
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:33,023
which is going to enable us to straighten up

27
00:01:35,024 --> 00:01:35,847
the compression.

28
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:39,479
We are going to have an arch structure,

29
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,161
deviated by these internal forces in the diagonals

30
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:46,927
and a cable structure

31
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,454
which I am going to draw right now,

32
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,922
which is added to this structure.

33
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:58,253
There is nothing new compared to what we have seen about frames,

34
00:01:58,442 --> 00:02:01,909
that is just the top storey frame.

35
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:08,499
Now, we are going to say that it is possible to place

36
00:02:08,657 --> 00:02:10,264
tensile reinforcements in the slab.

37
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,059
I place it anywhere

38
00:02:13,472 --> 00:02:18,160
but that means that the thrust of the frame

39
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:29,495
is carried by the slab.

40
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,272
The consequence of this is that the support reactions under the slab

41
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,705
are simply vertical.

42
00:02:39,129 --> 00:02:42,083
If we now look at the frame just below,

43
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:43,488
it has the same load.

44
00:02:43,778 --> 00:02:46,031
We are going to assume that the live load is the same.

45
00:02:46,475 --> 00:02:51,481
And some loads which are roughly equal to half of the supports reactions

46
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,117
of the previous storey, act on this frame

47
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,889
So it has an influence on the shape of the pressure line

48
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:04,748
since now we have these three loads

49
00:03:04,954 --> 00:03:07,696
so we are going to have something which is going to be

50
00:03:07,915 --> 00:03:09,394
like this.

51
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,863
The left and right parts are influenced

52
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:19,248
by the support reaction.

53
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,194
And then the part which goes up

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,248
towards the support line

55
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,807
of the load.

56
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:33,686
The result of this, qualitatively speaking, does not change a lot,

57
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:36,576
but we can see that the eccentricity to be carried is smaller.

58
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:43,538
We again have diagonals in compression and in a similar way,

59
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:48,686
the internal forces in the cross-beam and the posts.

60
00:03:51,215 --> 00:03:54,359
Here, that is absolutely similar.

61
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:01,361
I have been mistaken with this line before,

62
00:04:01,683 --> 00:04:05,442
we are going to correct it, the diagonal here is wrong.

63
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,196
You probably had noticed it.

64
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:11,183
Sorry for this mistake.

65
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,722
And here, in this direction, there is obviously going to be tension.

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,195
I again forgot, I did not put it here,

67
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,327
we also have compression vertically to distribute the internal force

68
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,503
between the arch system and the cable system.

69
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,949
What we can see however is that, here, this part

70
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:29,515
of the pressure line is more vertical

71
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:34,005
and that will be even more the case

72
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:36,123
as we go down the stories.

73
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:40,068
Here on the right, I have just drawn the right part of the pressure

74
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:43,986
line corresponding to the load on the first storey

75
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:45,685
from the top,

76
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,092
the second one from the top,

77
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:49,502
the third one from the top, etc.

78
00:04:49,694 --> 00:04:54,519
We can see that because of the accumulation of forces

79
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,060
which come from the upper stories,

80
00:04:57,408 --> 00:05:03,187
the pressure line becomes more and more vertical.

81
00:05:03,989 --> 00:05:05,914
So, I am going to write here:

82
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:09,412
because of the weight

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,839
of the upper stories,

84
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,956
the internal forces in the posts,

85
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:30,546
they are the columns of the frame,

86
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,311
tend to become

87
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:40,920
more vertical

88
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:45,871
and do not get out anymore

89
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,881
of the material.

90
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:56,472
Here, I have only drawn the part in compression

91
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,488
but obviously, we have seen the part in tension

92
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:00,748
which we must also have.

93
00:06:00,931 --> 00:06:03,728
However, when we have something which is simply inclined

94
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:06,092
inside 1the column and which does not get out of the material, we do not need

95
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,423
to have tension at the same time.

96
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:12,077
We are going to have a structure which is more economical.

97
00:06:12,341 --> 00:06:16,199
We can notice here that it is also made possible by the fact that the dimensions of the columns

98
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,891
increase as we go towards the bottom of the building,

99
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:20,399
which is logical since the internal forces increase

100
00:06:20,653 --> 00:06:21,842
as we go down the building.

101
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:23,543
Here, in this video,

102
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:27,402
I push horizontally on a vertical Vierendeel beam.

103
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,968
We can imagine that it is a model of our building.

104
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:34,141
We can see that I can push at the level of the nodes,

105
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:36,170
whether it be at the upper level or at the lower level,

106
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:38,635
they are still very deformable structures.

107
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:42,262
Let's now look at the effect which we have here

108
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:44,575
for the frame.

109
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,755
If we look at the upper level,

110
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,709
the effect of a horizontal force

111
00:06:54,303 --> 00:06:58,833
translates into tension and compression.

112
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:02,295
So, we are going to have,

113
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:07,309
we have already seen it before,

114
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,437
we are going to have tension

115
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:12,451
in the diagonal here

116
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:19,843
and we are going to go till the other side diagonally and again

117
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:22,240
we are going to have tension

118
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,153
and then compression

119
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:28,379
opposite to each other in the cross-sections.

120
00:07:31,522 --> 00:07:33,964
The compression must be diagonal.

121
00:07:34,712 --> 00:07:36,562
This is nothing new,

122
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:39,863
we have already seen it when we studied frames.

123
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:43,855
If we are now located several stories below,

124
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:45,807
on the second floor in the present case,

125
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:53,222
then we are going to have the sum or the resultant

126
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,665
of both horizontal forces,

127
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,138
since they are not equal,

128
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,863
the resultant is a bit lower,

129
00:07:57,997 --> 00:08:01,816
in this case, than the middle of the segment between both forces, whatever,

130
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,821
and the result is again going to be

131
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:12,355
a system with tension and compression

132
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:15,943
which are exactly identical to what we had before.

133
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:18,066
I draw it very quickly.

134
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:23,300
Tension in this diagonal, compression in the other one.

135
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:31,191
Compression in the posts rightwards,

136
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:33,334
going down rightwards.

137
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,807
What is more interesting is to look at what happens

138
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,312
if we consider the entire building.

139
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:43,354
It is interesting to see that precisely,

140
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:48,777
the dimensions which have been given for the columns on the ground floor

141
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:53,407
have actually been chosen, in all likelihood, according

142
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:57,936
to this configuration since at this moment, we can see that we have

143
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,150
material,

144
00:08:59,324 --> 00:09:02,019
I just draw it in yellow the outside of these columns,

145
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:03,777
which we cannot see very well,

146
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:07,181
we can see that thanks to this, compression, particularly,

147
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,442
can remain inside the column,

148
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,833
which does not require any additional reinforcement,

149
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,579
even though we are going to have to place reinforcement anyway

150
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:18,487
for the case in which the wind would come from the other side.

151
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:24,592
We can, like in the case of the Vierendeel beam, use

152
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:28,974
the representation with teeth to understand the behavior

153
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,290
of a Vierendeel beam.

154
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:33,725
We take two parts which we separate.

155
00:09:34,188 --> 00:09:40,283
In these two parts, the teeth of the orange part tend to rotate upwards.

156
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:45,930
The bottom parts do not move much.

157
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,356
And then in the left part,

158
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:59,426
teeth tend to go downwards,

159
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,933
which is obviously not compatible.

160
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,906
We are going to have to make it compatible,

161
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:11,913
you can guess what I am going to do, I have already done it in the lecture

162
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,185
about horizontal Vierendeel beams.

163
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:18,853
To make these displacements compatible,

164
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:23,987
we are going to have to push downwards on these orange cantilevers, here,

165
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:28,445
and to push the pink cantilever upwards.

166
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:33,448
As a consequence, we will have here compression and tension,

167
00:10:33,861 --> 00:10:36,403
here compression and tension,

168
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:39,556
here compression and tension,

169
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:41,957
and in the other direction, we are going to have

170
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,530
here compression and tension,

171
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:47,213
here compression and tension,

172
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:49,656
here compression and tension.

173
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,613
If I copy all this in the right drawing,

174
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:56,647
this means that we are going to have here, in these posts,

175
00:10:57,736 --> 00:11:00,755
diagonals in compression in this direction,

176
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:04,795
and in the other direction, they are going to be in tension.

177
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,685
This, that was... I should have drawn it, for horizontal loads

178
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:12,573
applied in this way on the posts.

179
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:16,335
So, that is similar to what we have seen for a Vierendeel beam

180
00:11:16,688 --> 00:11:18,585
in the other direction.

181
00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:21,858
We could have made the complicated drawing like before

182
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,392
but what I want is that you remember these principles

183
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:29,371
and how we can understand the internal forces on the basis of this reflection

184
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:32,063
with both half-structures

185
00:11:32,644 --> 00:11:34,209
which must be made compatible.

186
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,155
To finish this, I show you an example of a building

187
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,687
entirely built with Vierendeel beams.

188
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:41,867
You can first see the quite significant amount of material.

189
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,985
As it happens, this is a school, we do not need to make

190
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:45,434
doors to get out everywhere,

191
00:11:45,649 --> 00:11:46,931
otherwise this would not be very convenient,

192
00:11:47,224 --> 00:11:50,021
because these elements here, in the lower part too,

193
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:51,467
are load-bearing elements.

194
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,376
Here, we can see at once a Vierendeel beam over several stories

195
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,591
and a cantilever Vierendeel beam,

196
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,323
it certainly works as a cantilever for the wind too, but it also

197
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:03,839
works as a cantilever to let some space under these eaves

198
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:05,669
for the schoolyard.

199
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:08,457
In this video, we have seen that

200
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:11,185
vertical Vierendeel beams

201
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:14,877
can be considered either as superimposed frames, or as

202
00:12:15,097 --> 00:12:17,923
Vierendeel cantilevers, depending on the effect of horizontal and

203
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:18,987
vertical loads.

204
00:12:19,297 --> 00:12:21,935
We have seen that it is also possible, there is a large freedom,

205
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:24,753
to combine both types of Vierendeel beams,

206
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,318
horizontal and vertical,

207
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,467
there is no reason to deprive ourselves of this freedom.
