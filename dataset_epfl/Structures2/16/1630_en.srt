00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,360
Hello,

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,036
in this video, we will see how the horizontal loads

3
00:00:04,036 --> 00:00:05,512
are carried by frames.

4
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:07,427
Like in the previous video,

5
00:00:07,427 --> 00:00:09,803
we will see what is the effect of hinges

6
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:11,998
and what is the shape of the pressure line

7
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:15,439
when we have loads which act horizontally on a frame,

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,576
and we will thus see how the internal forces distribute inside frames.

9
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,658
We will also see a little bit what happens

10
00:00:22,658 --> 00:00:24,557
in the case of a multiple frame.

11
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:30,806
We again have the 4 same frames than in the previous video.

12
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:34,072
A frame with three hinges, a frame with two hinges,

13
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:38,865
a frame with one hinge and a frame without any hinges.

14
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:43,208
Here 3 hinges,

15
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:47,803
2 hinges,

16
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:52,195
1 hinge

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,036
and no hinges.

18
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:05,362
We are going to have in all cases, a load

19
00:01:05,362 --> 00:01:09,308
which acts horizontally from the left,

20
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:11,561
a load which I am going to call H,

21
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,361
because it is horizontal.

22
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,582
That is for example the wind.

23
00:01:19,582 --> 00:01:21,273
That could also be the effect of an earthquake

24
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:24,802
which mainly translates into horizontal loads.

25
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:27,294
To understand well how the internal forces work,

26
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:31,386
we are going to first look at the case of a frame with three hinges.

27
00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:35,636
In this case, we really have a cantilever with an upper support

28
00:01:35,636 --> 00:01:38,665
and then a lower support here, if we rotate everything of 90 degrees.

29
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:42,392
It means that in this part here,

30
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:46,422
we are going to have compression.

31
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:52,300
And in this part here, we are going to have tension.

32
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,020
That is quite different from what we had previously.

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:04,372
Although in the right part, we are going to have compression in the diagonal

34
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:07,173
to make the pressure line go up

35
00:02:07,173 --> 00:02:11,252
then we are going to have compression inside the post

36
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,370
and in the lower part, in the cantilever.

37
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,971
In the upper part, that is going to be exactly as we have seen it

38
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:20,840
in the case of a vertical load.

39
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:26,273
In the left part, we are going to have a cable here.

40
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:30,399
If we want to make a cable go up, we are going to pull on it in a diagonal direction,

41
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:34,201
which is going to make it go back inside the cross-section.

42
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,916
We are going to have tension on the intrados

43
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:45,534
and then on the other side, we are logically going to have compression.

44
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:58,313
What happens in the case of a frame with two hinges?

45
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:00,982
We have not any hinges at this level here

46
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:03,547
but remember: I said that it must also pass

47
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:07,615
by the line of action of the force.

48
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:15,481
Actually, the pressure line

49
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:19,038
is identical to what we had before.

50
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:24,692
That means that the result will also be the same.

51
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:31,153
That is the same than the left one so I am not going to draw it

52
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:34,246
but we could determine it if we wanted,

53
00:03:34,246 --> 00:03:36,105
exactly in the same way.

54
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:40,717
If we have an arch with one hinge,

55
00:03:40,717 --> 00:03:45,883
we are going to have compression in this way but we do not know where it goes.

56
00:03:45,883 --> 00:03:47,684
It is going to go onto the external part here

57
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:52,110
and then likewise, tension like this on this side.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,790
On the right part, that is similar to what we had already seen

59
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,951
for vertical loads:

60
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,039
compression in the diagonal,

61
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,384
compression which changes side in the post

62
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:18,212
and then which remains under the hinge in the central part.

63
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:24,010
And then for the upper part, for tension, that is similar,

64
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,868
simply in a symmetrical way.

65
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,459
What about the left part?

66
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,232
Here we have a cable which we will need to pull with tension

67
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,562
to bring it back inside the cross-section.

68
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:45,133
And then we will have this configuration, this tensile internal force

69
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:47,778
in the diagonal which must be offset

70
00:04:47,778 --> 00:04:53,496
by compression in the external and upper part

71
00:04:53,496 --> 00:04:55,804
of the cross-beam, in the corner.

72
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:59,069
If we look at the right part,

73
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,682
it is again going to be a pressure line

74
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:08,987
which is determined by the height of the force on the left

75
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:15,501
and then which is going to get out of the cross-section at the level of the supports.

76
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:19,236
That will again be exactly the same thing

77
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,182
than what we have seen in the left part.

78
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:27,313
We can see quite fundamentally different configurations,

79
00:05:27,313 --> 00:05:31,733
although this one reminds us what I have shown you

80
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,935
in the previous lecture when we had an eccentric load

81
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:39,737
on the frame with tension in the lower part on the left

82
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:42,373
and compression in the lower part on the right.

83
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:48,576
Let's look again at this curved frame under the effect of a lateral wind this time.

84
00:05:48,576 --> 00:05:51,356
We are going to place horizontal wind,

85
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:54,056
constant because the structure is not very high

86
00:05:54,056 --> 00:05:55,851
-lowercase w-

87
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:59,618
and we are going to look at the internal forces in this structure.

88
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,365
We use this applet.

89
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,509
I am not going to encourage you to try to do it

90
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,372
because that is quite difficult to obtain this shape,

91
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:13,303
because the applet is pushed here to the limit of its capacity.

92
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:18,030
And then we can see that we have a very large eccentricity

93
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:24,522
in the part which receives the wind, with tension on the intrados,

94
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:27,776
and obviously the corresponding compression on the extrados

95
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,004
an then on the other side

96
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:31,593
we also have a very significant eccentricity

97
00:06:31,593 --> 00:06:34,364
because this is a straight line

98
00:06:34,364 --> 00:06:37,304
so we do not have a curved shape like before,

99
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:40,926
so the effect of this wind load on the left

100
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:44,396
leads to very large compressions on the intrados.

101
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:47,220
I get back to this picture.

102
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,680
We can remember what we have just seen previously,

103
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,262
that is to say compression here

104
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,842
in a diagonal direction

105
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:04,790
and then tension

106
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,640
with a parabolic shape like this.

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,820
What does it mean?

108
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,527
It means that in this part of the cross-section,

109
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:20,175
we are going to have tension inside.

110
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:26,422
For this tension to come inside,

111
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:30,224
we will need to have a bit of transversal tension,

112
00:07:30,224 --> 00:07:34,233
and then we will obviously have compression

113
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:37,724
on the other side of the cross-section.

114
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:45,791
And then that will be almost symmetrical on the other side,

115
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:49,943
with compression on the intrados,

116
00:07:49,943 --> 00:07:53,357
transversal compression

117
00:07:54,877 --> 00:07:57,161
and tension

118
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:08,114
like this.

119
00:08:09,075 --> 00:08:11,830
We thus can see that in such a frame,

120
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:16,117
the load case with lateral wind is a very important load case

121
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:19,986
because it leads to very large internal forces eccentricities

122
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:24,730
both on the upwind side and on the downwind side.

123
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:29,371
Finally, we want to look at an example of multiple frame.

124
00:08:29,371 --> 00:08:32,513
In the present case, that is the Parthenon in Athens.

125
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:38,065
They are elements which are made out of marble, so by stone.

126
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:41,621
That is an element which does not have a very large tensile strength.

127
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,049
How does it work?

128
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:47,092
Usually, it works in this way:

129
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:51,377
we have columns with vertical internal forces,

130
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:56,822
we are going to have a rather significant arch effect

131
00:08:56,822 --> 00:09:03,494
because these cross-beams have a large depth compared to their span

132
00:09:03,494 --> 00:09:09,799
and we are going to have a little bit of tension in the lower part

133
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,271
because marble resists a bit in tension anyway.

134
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:16,409
That is the usual case.

135
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:20,557
So that was for vertical loads downwards.

136
00:09:20,557 --> 00:09:22,705
If we now have a load case,

137
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:25,277
it is drawn but I am going to draw it bigger,

138
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:29,417
with horizontal wind, what is the effect going to be?

139
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:39,751
Well, the internal forces are going to be inclined in the columns.

140
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:41,950
This inclination enables to support

141
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:48,283
the horizontal component of the wind force.

142
00:09:48,283 --> 00:09:49,854
So there is a horizontal component,

143
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:53,999
we can see here that each support reaction is inclined.

144
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:56,227
Concerning the cross-beam,

145
00:09:56,227 --> 00:10:02,425
the functioning mode remains identical with an arch

146
00:10:02,425 --> 00:10:07,036
and then, a contribution of the tensile strength of the material

147
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:13,302
which enables to carry at the same time the vertical loads.

148
00:10:13,812 --> 00:10:20,822
In all likelihood, in the course of History, what happens

149
00:10:20,822 --> 00:10:26,408
is the creation here of a crack in one of these stone cross-beams.

150
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,533
That is not really possible

151
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:31,856
to imagine that there are not any cracks in these structure - there are some ;

152
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:36,429
if you had visited these structures, you probably observed it yourself.

153
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:39,897
So, what happens in this case?

154
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:44,348
Well, when there is this crack, we still can have an arch effect,

155
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:47,104
compression being able to pass through a crack,

156
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:51,214
but obviously, we cannot have a tensile internal force from the left to the right

157
00:10:51,214 --> 00:10:53,725
since tension could not cross the crack.

158
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:58,653
So this arch itself now creates a thrust leftwards

159
00:10:58,653 --> 00:11:00,833
and a thrust rightwards, such as any arches,

160
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:04,392
which was usually supported by tension in this case.

161
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:07,559
This time, it cannot be the case, but this thrust can be taken

162
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:11,590
by inclining the support reaction in the columns.

163
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:14,771
And then, since these frames touch each other,

164
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:21,817
making the other columns also have an inclined support reaction,

165
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:22,672
an inclined force,

166
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:26,530
the other cross-beams keep working normally,

167
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:32,464
that is to say that they have a tensile internal force in their lower part,

168
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:35,838
and thus equilibrium is possible.

169
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:40,417
We can see that there are really a lot of columns here.

170
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,248
We could even imagine that several,

171
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:45,924
not all, but only several, possibly 2 or 3,

172
00:11:45,924 --> 00:11:47,261
of these cross-beams are cracked

173
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,587
and that in spite of that equilibrium is still possible .

174
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,771
By the way, it is necessary to understand this in this way

175
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:59,912
because this building is located in Greece which is a country with high seismic activity

176
00:11:59,912 --> 00:12:02,480
and it stands since more than 2 000 years

177
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,003
so that is not one or two cracks that one can see there

178
00:12:06,003 --> 00:12:08,872
which condemned it to collapse.

179
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,270
In this video,

180
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,983
we have looked at the effect of the horizontal loads on frames.

181
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,690
Depending on the number of hinges,

182
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,919
there are variations of the pressure line

183
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,062
and the distributions of internal forces inside the posts

184
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,847
and the cross-beams are quite different.

185
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:28,188
Finally, we have looked at the example of the Parthenon:

186
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,690
how multiple frames

187
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,444
can resist gravity loads, horizontal loads

188
00:12:33,444 --> 00:12:36,508
and even cracking of one of the cross-beams

189
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,920
without any possibilities to take any tensile internal forces.
