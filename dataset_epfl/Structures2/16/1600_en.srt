Hello,

2
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:03,266
With this lesson about frames,

3
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:07,576
we will broach the last topic of sructures of the course &quot;The Art of Structures&quot;.

4
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:10,476
What is a frame? Well, we can see that

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:13,876
in this structure. Here, that is an electric pole

6
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:15,236
in a suburb.

7
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,826
And, what can we see?

8
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:20,228
The usual system in the upper part

9
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:24,008
is a truss with X-shaped diagonals,

10
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,158
pretensioned in all likelihood, since they are only cables.

11
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:31,548
It enables this post to transversally resist to some internal forces.

12
00:00:31,548 --> 00:00:35,218
In the lower part, it would have been logical

13
00:00:35,218 --> 00:00:38,828
to also use diagonals.

14
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:42,188
But in this case, straightaway, we can see that there is a small path which passes

15
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:43,188
there, underneath.

16
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:45,898
We can see that it would have been dangerous for the people who are walking around,

17
00:00:45,898 --> 00:00:49,848
especially if there was someone riding bicycle, he would really have risked to hurt himself

18
00:00:49,848 --> 00:00:52,048
against these cables. So, it was decided,

19
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,158
just for this level, not for the rest,

20
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:56,098
to change the type of structure,

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,408
into a structure which has the same function, so 

22
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:03,548
it is able to carry vertical and horizontal loads,

23
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:07,768
but which gives more space; this type of structure is called a frame.

24
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:11,768
What we can already see well in this picture is that there is considerably more

25
00:01:11,768 --> 00:01:15,108
material in the frame than in the simple lines,

26
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,358
I mean, the filigrane diagonals which we had in the upper part.

27
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,108
That is a property of frames;

28
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:23,118
they are not extremely economical structures.

29
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:26,178
We are going to look at what is the position of the frames

30
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:28,098
in the path of structures

31
00:01:28,098 --> 00:01:31,078
and then to look at what is a frame in more detail.

32
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:33,378
That is really something which is midway

33
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:36,658
between an arch and a beam or several beams.

34
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,231
Within the path of structures,

35
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,754
this is the complete version which thus includes the courses

36
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,168
&quot;The Art of Structures I&quot; and &quot;The Art of Structures II&quot;,

37
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,108
we can see that the frame is the penultimate lesson

38
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,728
and actually, that is the last type of structure,

39
00:01:48,728 --> 00:01:52,568
since the last lesson will deal with compressed elements and stability

40
00:01:52,568 --> 00:01:55,348
which are not properly types of structures.

41
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,648
Frames include all the types of structures

42
00:01:57,648 --> 00:02:01,018
which are almost arches, but not exactly.

43
00:02:01,018 --> 00:02:08,608
If we look at this concrete bridge, which is essentially subjected to uniformly

44
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:13,378
distributed loads over its whole length,

45
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,458
the logical shape induced by these loads would be

46
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:23,208
a parabolic arch, a second-order parabola.

47
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,728
But, actually, we can see that the shape which has been given to it

48
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:33,848
is slightly different, since, here, the arch is a bit higher

49
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:38,778
that it would be in the case of the funicular arch.

50
00:02:38,778 --> 00:02:40,348
Why do we do this?

51
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:45,068
For a very very good reason: because this bridge

52
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:46,528
crosses a river.

53
00:02:46,528 --> 00:02:50,528
And if we have water which reaches this level, for example,

54
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:56,698
you can see that here, the blue arch would be a large obstacle to water.

55
00:02:56,698 --> 00:03:00,898
Here, we gain maybe one meter of width on each side,

56
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:04,098
where water can pass and then, it can be very important

57
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,228
during a flood.

58
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:09,428
So, the shape of an arch is not the appropriate shape

59
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:12,548
and then, we choose a frame instead of an arch,

60
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:15,358
so we have a shape which wanders a little bit from that of the arch.

61
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:18,748
That is also what we have seen in the initial example

62
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:20,998
where we had a truss with X-shaped diagonals

63
00:03:20,998 --> 00:03:23,388
and then we replaced it by a frame,

64
00:03:23,388 --> 00:03:27,618
to have a solution which was more favorable to the use.

65
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:30,808
In this lecture, we have seen what is a frame.

66
00:03:30,808 --> 00:03:34,418
In the example of the bridge, we have seen that it is an intermediate solution

67
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:35,968
between an arch and a beam,

68
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:38,858
actually, a modification of the shape of the arch.

69
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:41,938
In the first example, we have seen that it is the modification

70
00:03:41,938 --> 00:03:44,878
of the shape of a truss.

71
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,628
In frames, there are compressive and tensile internal forces

72
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,845
which coexist within structural elements,

73
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,835
just as in the case of the beams.
