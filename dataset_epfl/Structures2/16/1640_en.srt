00:00:00,476 --> 00:00:04,059
Hello. In this video, I am going to talk to you about Vierendeel beams.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,589
Vierendeel is the name of a Belgian engineer,

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,075
and you can see here one of his bridges,

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,463
built in Belgium at the beginning of the twentieth century.

5
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:17,740
And since he is Belgian, I am tempted to quote

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,887
a saying by another Belgian man, the painter Magritte,

7
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:26,979
to say : this is not a truss!

8
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,630
That is true that it looks like a truss, that is like a truss,

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,175
in which we would have forgotten, or in which we would not have put

10
00:00:33,175 --> 00:00:34,437
any diagonals.

11
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:37,165
In this lecture, we will see the configuration which is necessary

12
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:39,126
for a Vierendeel beam to work,

13
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,522
we will see the differences between a truss and a Vierendeel beam,

14
00:00:42,522 --> 00:00:44,955
and then I will also talk to you about the Vierendeel beams

15
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,581
with several stories.

16
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:49,521
In this video, you can see that I have a Vierendeel beam,

17
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:51,704
that is to say a truss where we have taken off the diagonals,

18
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:53,568
that I load with our usual load,

19
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:56,170
and there, the truss deforms a lot.

20
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,660
So for a Vierendeel beam to work,

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,160
I am going to have to clamp all nodes;

22
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,579
usually, the nodes, in the trusses, are hinges,

23
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,713
the bars can rotate one in relation to each other;

24
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:10,285
here, this is not the case, I tighten a lot all my hinges:

25
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:13,326
obviously, this construction was not planned, originally,

26
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:16,293
to work as a Vierendeel beam, but you can see that now,

27
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:18,346
I managed to put my load of 10N

28
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:22,751
and to have a valid structure in the form of Vierendeel beam.

29
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:27,358
Let's look at a detail of the bridge of Mister Vierendeel here

30
00:01:27,358 --> 00:01:30,263
which I have shown you at the beginning of this lecture,

31
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:34,180
and clearly, we can see that there are no hinges.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,880
On the opposite, near where there would be hinges --

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,765
we are going to say near the nodes between the bars --

34
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:43,563
some additional material has been placed.

35
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:47,628
We are going to say : here, this is clearly not

36
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:55,304
a hinge.

37
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:06,554
That is more a clamping

38
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:14,383
of the chords

39
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,388
in the posts.

40
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:23,227
I remind you that the posts are the vertical elements.

41
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:28,286
As a consequence,

42
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:31,373
and we can see here the number of... -- at that time, these were rivets;

43
00:02:31,373 --> 00:02:34,622
that is a solution which is more expensive,

44
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:40,589
and which is more complicated to build than a truss.

45
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,275
but it must be said that there are advantages:

46
00:02:50,275 --> 00:02:54,358
if we look at this example of a building which was built

47
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,626
relatively recently,

48
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:58,555
quite close to EPFL, in Saint-Sulpice,

49
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,958
we can see here a structure which, at first sight, is quite surprising,

50
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:08,170
but if we look at where are these load-bearings elements, it is interesting to see

51
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,673
that there are here load-bearing elements --

52
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,783
there is a second building behind, which is not connected.

53
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,787
But if we look at the first building, which is in the foreground,

54
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,355
which hosts apartments --

55
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:21,471
well, we have, on the right, in the back, two columns, on the left,

56
00:03:21,471 --> 00:03:26,970
only one column, and then all this space, here,

57
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:29,697
is a free space.

58
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,542
So it has been partly used to put small bushes,

59
00:03:33,542 --> 00:03:35,453
and partly to put parking places;

60
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,477
but that is clear that we could not have parked cars

61
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,128
if we had had a lot of columns;

62
00:03:39,128 --> 00:03:40,716
we could have maybe put columns,

63
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:41,883
but that is another story.

64
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:44,883
If you look at pictures of the construction of this building,

65
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:48,943
there, again, we have this huge free space --

66
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,555
that is about thirty meters long, that is really the span of a bridge.

67
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:58,089
And we can clearly see, here, that there is a lot of material

68
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:01,352
which has been added, we can see steel elements

69
00:04:01,352 --> 00:04:04,755
with quite significant dimensions.

70
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,901
That is not a transparent structure at all, unlike some of the trusses we have seen before.

71
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:11,251
On the opposite, that is quite a heavy structure.

72
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,314
But with some advantages, especially, this free space.

73
00:04:14,637 --> 00:04:18,105
If we compare a Vierendeel beam to a truss,

74
00:04:18,105 --> 00:04:22,303
what we can see is that in the truss,

75
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:27,855
we can have internal forces in the diagonals.

76
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:36,374
And we are going to see in this lecture, that it has a decisive effect,

77
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:40,427
that is a bit like what we have seen before with frames.

78
00:04:40,926 --> 00:04:47,479
Here, as usual, the internal forces must remain inside the material,

79
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:02,474
so we will have additional internal forces,

80
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,928
like in frames.

81
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,469
But this is not only in the field of internal forces that the difference

82
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:21,320
between Vierendeel beams and trusses is significant,

83
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,976
that is also the case for deflections:

84
00:05:23,976 --> 00:05:26,314
here, we have the deflections of a Vierendeel beam

85
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:30,462
and of a truss; we are going to add &quot;strongly exaggerated&quot;,

86
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:34,929
because you should not think that it really deforms as much as here.

87
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:38,221
I used a calculation software to calculate this;

88
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:45,503
and we can see here that the deflection w for the Vierendeel beam,

89
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:52,446
is tremendously larger than the deflection w for the truss.

90
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,575
Now, I would like to clarify that

91
00:05:54,575 --> 00:05:57,435
it depends on certain parameters which have been chosen for the calculations,

92
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:00,352
but in all cases, the deflection of a Vierendeel beam will be

93
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,976
passably larger than that of a truss.

94
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:04,842
It will never be smaller.

95
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:12,351
As a consequence, if we want the same deflection,

96
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:31,407
we will need more material with a Vierendeel beam.

97
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:39,979
That is also what we have seen in the bridge of Mr Vierendeel,

98
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,332
in the first picture: there is passably more material

99
00:06:43,332 --> 00:06:44,681
in this structure.

100
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe the deflections of trusses are too small; we could

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,794
accept slightly larger deflections, but the deflections

102
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,255
of Vierendeel beams are, very generally,

103
00:06:53,255 --> 00:06:54,248
very large.

104
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:57,183
Let's see how we can understand the internal forces

105
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,903
in a Vierendeel beam;

106
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:04,121
so, I should first add loads; we are going to have,

107
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:07,175
the same loads on all these beams.

108
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,933
I only draw them for the beam on the top.

109
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:12,572
So loads which act vertically,

110
00:07:12,572 --> 00:07:16,705
at the level of the intermediate posts -- I do not put any on the first posts,

111
00:07:16,705 --> 00:07:20,185
simply to simplify the reasoning,

112
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:22,100
but there could absolutely be some.

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,400
How is this beam going to work?

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,733
Well, I am going to imagine an arch-cable.

115
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,566
So on top, I have an arch.

116
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:35,148
And then I am going to give it a lenticular shape, because this structure

117
00:07:35,148 --> 00:07:38,543
is symmetrical, so there is no reason for the internal forces to be,

118
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,616
a priori, rectilinear in the lower part,

119
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:42,406
but we are going to get back to this point later.

120
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,426
Vertically, between both, well, we should have

121
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:47,493
compressive internal forces

122
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,250
to transmit a part of the load -- half --

123
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,731
of the arch, towards the frame.

124
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:56,833
We can see that, in the central part, all this can work very well

125
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:59,226
because the internal forces remain inside the material.

126
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:03,517
However, in the part, shall we say, of both openings at the ends,

127
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:07,183
on the left and on the right, well the arch and the cable pass

128
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:11,790
through the air, and then that is not possible, it will be necessary to correct this.

129
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,974
How are we going to be able to correct this?

130
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:17,703
We are going to do it as we did before, with frames;

131
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:22,255
that is to say that we are going to insert compressions in the diagonals,

132
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:29,307
as a consequence, the internal forces in the arches will be deviated,

133
00:08:30,848 --> 00:08:35,035
in such a way that they remain inside the material,

134
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:43,517
and then we are going to do the same to deviate the internal forces

135
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:50,037
in the cables,

136
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:55,152
in such a way that they also remain inside the material.

137
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:58,715
In the central part, we will not need this anymore,

138
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:01,821
we are only going to use the arch-cable.

139
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:05,234
I am now going to insert the missing internal forces,

140
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:09,222
to reach the complete equilibrium of this structure.

141
00:09:11,903 --> 00:09:15,022
Here, I must have tension on the top.

142
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:21,587
So that is something which is quite complex, I mean the functioning of a Vierendeel beam.

143
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:24,519
I will not ask you -- there will not be a lot of questions

144
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,925
about Vierendeel beams in the exercises,

145
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:32,460
that is not a fundamental topic of the course.

146
00:09:32,557 --> 00:09:35,515
I will ask you some questions sometimes,

147
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:40,207
but they will be theoritical questions, quite general questions.

148
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:45,127
So, I finish this construction here,

149
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,500
for it to be complete.

150
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:53,780
So we can see that the left and right parts

151
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,404
of this structure essentially behave

152
00:09:57,404 --> 00:10:00,401
like a frame; and then in the central part, on the opposite,

153
00:10:00,401 --> 00:10:04,028
we have an arch-cable and obviously, between the arch and the cable,

154
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:07,851
we have elements which are in compression;

155
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:11,434
in the lower part, I will now show you to you another way

156
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:14,955
to understand the behavior of a Vierendeel beam.

157
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,845
We have cut this beam in two,

158
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:19,520
with a lower part and an upper part;

159
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,897
obviously, we are going to bring them back together thereafter,

160
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:23,627
for them to work together.

161
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:26,234
Half of the loads act on the top half-beam,

162
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:28,836
half of the loads act on the bottom half-beam.

163
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,215
We are not going to get into all the details,

164
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:34,220
but we are going to look at how this beam deforms.

165
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,675
Under the effect of these loads, the beam on the bottom is going to deform in this way,

166
00:10:38,675 --> 00:10:42,625
it is going to bend, and, because of the rotation, we can see that

167
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:49,937
these teeth, which represent the fact that the Vierendeel beam has been cut in two,

168
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:54,812
these teeth tend to rotate, and they rotate inwards,

169
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:57,396
at least the teeth which are at the ends,

170
00:10:57,396 --> 00:11:00,849
in the middle, we can see that they do not rotate much.

171
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:04,205
Then again, when we reach the other side,

172
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,891
we have larger rotations.

173
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:21,526
Likewise, the top half-beam -- we are going to assume that it has its own supports --

174
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:28,951
it also deforms, but there, you can see that the teeth rotate outwards.

175
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:33,375
Well, in the central part, it does not rotate much either,

176
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:36,407
like in the lower part;

177
00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:48,447
but in the external parts, it rotates more.

178
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,695
Actually, in reality, of course,

179
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,988
both structures must be compatible.

180
00:11:55,988 --> 00:11:58,354
What does it mean? Well, for them to be compatible,

181
00:11:58,354 --> 00:12:00,746
it is necessary that the deformations, here, be the same.

182
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:05,936
So, to have this, we are going to push on the pink teeth, at least, let's say,

183
00:12:05,936 --> 00:12:10,255
the first three ones, in this way, to make them get inside;

184
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:15,467
and then we are going to push on the orange teeth in the other direction,

185
00:12:15,467 --> 00:12:18,555
to make them get out a bit, so that

186
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,295
they can meet.

187
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:22,715
What is the result of this?

188
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:26,107
Well, if we look at this small element, we can see that it is a cantilever.

189
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:28,575
What are the internal forces in such a cantilever?

190
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:31,498
Well, in this direction, we are going to have compression,

191
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,387
and in this direction, tension.

192
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:38,751
Likewise for the following cantilever: compression, tension,

193
00:12:39,754 --> 00:12:43,825
the following cantilever, compression, tension.

194
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:48,155
If we look at the lower part, we have a cantilever oriented in this way,

195
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:51,867
so we have compression here, tension there,

196
00:12:51,867 --> 00:12:55,130
compression here, tension there.

197
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,215
And so on: compression, tension.

198
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:02,863
If we look at the other end of the beam,

199
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:09,138
well, we are going to push in this way, here, and to push in the other way

200
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,287
in the orange part;

201
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:18,130
and likewise, we are going to find compression and tension.

202
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:30,524
That is the same for the lower part, compression, tension,

203
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:35,430
tension, compression, tension.

204
00:13:35,722 --> 00:13:39,514
If I draw outside what we have just observed, well, what we can observe

205
00:13:39,514 --> 00:13:42,743
is that in this part, we have diagonals

206
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:47,875
which are inclined in this way, in compression, in the other way, they are in tension.

207
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,894
And then on the other side, diagonals in this way

208
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:54,135
are in compression, and in this way, they are in tension.

209
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,783
But if we look at the illustration on the top,

210
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:59,480
we can see that we have exactly observed the same thing:

211
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,524
diagonals in compression in this direction,

212
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,175
in tension in the other direction,

213
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:08,739
and likewise here, diagonals in compression and diagonals in tension.

214
00:14:09,239 --> 00:14:15,162
So both these approaches confirm what we have seen about the behavior

215
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:17,312
of Vierendeel beams. In the central part,

216
00:14:17,312 --> 00:14:20,810
there is not a big need to offset, so there are only small internal forces

217
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,247
to insert; so we have an arch-cable

218
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:25,878
with compressed elements, a very quiet part,

219
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:29,687
and then, in the left and right parts,

220
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:34,111
the posts are subjected to both tension and compression.

221
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:37,337
If we have this in the posts, we will also have it, obviously,

222
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:40,964
in the chords of this Vierendeel beam.

223
00:14:41,502 --> 00:14:45,944
I am not going to ask you to get into the details of the compression

224
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,713
of Vierendeel beams within the framework of this course.

225
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:49,555
I am giving you an introduction,

226
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,974
I will ask you some questions in the exercises,

227
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,606
which will be questions of general understanding

228
00:14:54,606 --> 00:14:57,335
about how Vierendeel beams work, but I ask you to know

229
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:01,077
a little bit about what is happening inside these beams.

230
00:15:01,135 --> 00:15:03,415
Vierendeel beams, as I told you before,

231
00:15:03,415 --> 00:15:06,425
deform a lot and cannot carry much load,

232
00:15:06,425 --> 00:15:07,809
because large internal forces are induced.

233
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,808
A solution to make them efficient is to create

234
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,047
Vierendeel beams over several stories.

235
00:15:12,047 --> 00:15:13,772
Of course, it would also be necessary to limit

236
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:17,270
the loads which act on them, this can be achieved by having

237
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,730
Vierendeel beams, for example, for the facade system,

238
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,361
and then another type of load-bearing element, for example walls,

239
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,041
inside the structure.

240
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,099
I am not going to get into the details of this structure,

241
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:29,392
but that is clear that it is more efficient,

242
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:31,445
it is certainly going to deform less

243
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:34,304
than a one-storey Vierendeel beam.

244
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:40,630
Here, I have a short video which show the behavior of a structure

245
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,432
with Vierendeel beams over several stories;

246
00:15:42,432 --> 00:15:45,492
so, to be honest, I had to tighten up less

247
00:15:45,492 --> 00:15:47,332
my nodes for it to work

248
00:15:47,332 --> 00:15:50,245
because there are many more nodes so it works a bit better,

249
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:53,037
but you can see that if again I push on it with one finger,

250
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:54,823
I still can deform this structure,

251
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:57,457
it remains very deformable.

252
00:15:57,746 --> 00:15:59,586
In this first lecture about Vierendeel beams,

253
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:04,680
we have seen that if a Vierendeel beams looks like a truss without any diagonals,

254
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,798
that is far to be a truss.

255
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:09,999
There will be much more significant deformations in this type of structure,

256
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,499
and the internal forces are very different also.

257
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:13,227
Instead of having, like in a truss,

258
00:16:13,227 --> 00:16:15,119
only tension and compression

259
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,532
in the structural elements, we have at once

260
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:21,026
compression and tension in many of the structural elements.

261
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,572
One of the possible solutions to increase the efficiency of Vierendeel beams

262
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:26,736
is to place them over several stories.
