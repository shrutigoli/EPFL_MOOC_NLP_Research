00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:01,659
Hello, in this video,

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:05,104
we are going to see how to pass from an arch to a frame,

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:10,699
a structure which has a shape which is different from the correct funicular structure

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,198
corresponding to the loads.

5
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:16,170
We will see this with the example of rectangular frames

6
00:00:16,704 --> 00:00:20,076
which will enable us to look at what is happening

7
00:00:20,268 --> 00:00:21,897
in a quite systematic and simpler way.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:26,002
We will see the importance of the position of hinges in an arch --

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:28,968
--or rather, in a frame with hinges.

10
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:32,846
We will see how to solve a frame using the i-Cremona applet

11
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:36,475
and I will set general principles for the solving of frames,

12
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:39,926
especially to obtain the internal forces which act inside frames.

13
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:43,007
We thus have here our reinforced concrete frame bridge

14
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:49,407
whose pressure line moves away from the shape of the intrados.

15
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:55,251
What we remember, at least for those who followed

16
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:57,019
the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;,

17
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:03,711
is that if we push on this side here and on this side there onto an arch,

18
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:08,521
it makes the pressure line of the arch rise,

19
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:14,965
so we will be able to make the shape of the arch rises into the intrados,

20
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:20,007
in the part where there is some material, where there is some concrete.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,880
What we have also seen in the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;,

22
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,552
is that when we have such a configuration,

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,907
where the resultant of the pressure line gets out of the material, it is possible

24
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:34,776
to obtain this resultant if we add at the same time tension

25
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,679
in the cross-section.

26
00:01:36,204 --> 00:01:40,993
We will see thereafter that indeed, there is compression and tension

27
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:44,658
which act at the same time in the cross-sections of frames.

28
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:46,929
Not everywhere, but in lots of places.

29
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:51,815
Let's take a simpler example, a rectangular frame with only

30
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:53,732
one load in the middle.

31
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:57,388
The pressure line corresponding

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,739
to this load directly goes towards the supports.

33
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,496
That is a frame with three hinges or an arch with three hinges,

34
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,201
whatever how you want to call it, for the moment that still does not matter.

35
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:16,887
The pressure line is clearly defined.

36
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:21,280
As an aside, that is never bad to call it back to mind,

37
00:02:21,546 --> 00:02:25,588
the support reactions are inclined

38
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:29,427
and correspond to this direct line

39
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,959
which goes from the load towards the supports.

40
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:36,596
We have a reaction on the left and on the right which goes in the direction

41
00:02:36,876 --> 00:02:39,455
of this pressure line.

42
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,593
We can obviously notice that this pressure line

43
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:44,421
cannot pass through the air,

44
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:47,030
it must pass through the material.

45
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:50,562
To that end, we are going to make act

46
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:57,679
compression in this diagonal here

47
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,413
and in this diagonal here.

48
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:08,590
This compression is going to push on this arch.

49
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:12,070
When I am going to push on this arch,

50
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,524
it is going to go up towards the arrow

51
00:03:15,793 --> 00:03:18,909
in such a way that once I will have pushed enough on this arch,

52
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:26,285
it is going to be inside the material, and at this moment,

53
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,536
we will have a frame; we have not seen everything yet

54
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:31,163
concerning the frame, but we will already have a frame,

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,564
the arch part of the frame.

56
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,221
There you go! We are really glad,

57
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:47,681
the arch, which was outside the material, moved inside the material.

58
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:50,595
Now, the problem is that we have here this compression.

59
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:54,175
I am going to draw an arrow at the end of this compression

60
00:03:54,175 --> 00:03:55,879
because it is necessary to know,

61
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,795
here, this compression pushes on the arch,

62
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,235
no problem, it is at equilibrium.

63
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:04,291
However, on the other side, on what does it lean?

64
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,300
It is going to lean on a cable.

65
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:14,763
We are going to fix a cable to the left support, which is going to run up to the corner of the frame,

66
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:20,090
it is going to be deviated and then it is going to pass through the hinge

67
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,740
since all internal forces must pass through the hinge,

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,969
there are no possible exceptions.

69
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:28,742
And then, that is the same thing in the right part of the frame.

70
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,848
So, there you go, we have here the corresponding internal forces in a frame

71
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:38,979
which are very different from the initial internal forces

72
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,537
since we have pushed on the arch to make it get inside the material

73
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,347
but to insure equilibrium of this diagonal element

74
00:04:46,347 --> 00:04:47,504
which has been added into the structure,

75
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:50,012
we had to add these elements in tension.

76
00:04:50,631 --> 00:04:52,310
That is qualitative, but not only,

77
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,055
it is really like this that the internal forces are distributed

78
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:56,575
inside a frame.

79
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,593
It is possible to model this using the applet

80
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,656
using actually two applets.

81
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:04,413
I first take the left applet,

82
00:05:04,413 --> 00:05:06,399
in which I make act a force,

83
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,157
let's say of 10 Newtons, as usual,

84
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:14,561
and if I ask for the resolution by means of the polygon of forces,

85
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:16,366
we can see that it is just there.

86
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,565
I am going to use the mode with the red ball

87
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:23,546
to force the internal forces to pass just by this intersection.

88
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:28,483
Now, I am going to add on the left and on the right,

89
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:31,623
the force which corresponds to the internal force in the diagonal,

90
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:34,317
so I need to make it rotate.

91
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:38,141
I hold CTRL, in this way it keeps the same size,

92
00:05:38,326 --> 00:05:41,552
it is going to be important that these two forces have the same size.

93
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,032
Likewise here, on the right,

94
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,199
and then, I make them pass exactly by the diagonal

95
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,474
and now we can see that we start having an arch

96
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,570
which gets closer to the material.

97
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:56,866
So, I select these two forces, on the left and on the right,

98
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:59,688
I increase their amplitude,

99
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,189
and we can see that at the same time,

100
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,670
we obtain

101
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,020
the passage of the arch just inside the frame.

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,017
You should note that the force here is very large,

103
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:18,820
I had put a force of 10, and now,

104
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,475
I have a force in the diagonal

105
00:06:20,475 --> 00:06:24,165
of almost 6 times more than this force: 57.

106
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:26,585
Now, we want to move to the right part.

107
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:28,239
Here, I am not going to put

108
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:31,696
the load of 10 Newtons but it is already carried

109
00:06:31,982 --> 00:06:33,629
by this system of arch.

110
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,077
What are the loads

111
00:06:35,077 --> 00:06:36,650
which act in the right part?

112
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,147
There is this force of 57,

113
00:06:42,243 --> 00:06:44,187
with an angle of 45 degrees,

114
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:47,440
here,

115
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,764
and of 135 on the other side,

116
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,915
I carefully place them in the angles,

117
00:06:55,142 --> 00:06:58,663
then, I ask for the resolution,

118
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:04,097
unavoidably passing by here.

119
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,968
We can see that it is already solved.

120
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:13,085
For this force of 57, we are going to have internal forces of around 40

121
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,449
in the columns and in the cross beam.

122
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,532
Here, in the frame, the compressive internal force

123
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:21,301
was around 45 in the column

124
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,095
and 47 in the cross beam.

125
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:26,592
The internal forces are much larger with this framed

126
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:31,729
solution than with, let's say, a classic arch-shaped solution.

127
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,452
But we managed to get the right shape.

128
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:41,913
We do the same resolution for the case with a hinge

129
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:45,245
which is not placed anymore in the middle of the cross-section, but on the top.

130
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:48,020
That is a bit particular, because I have a very thick cross-section,

131
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,356
if it was not very thick, the difference would be small,

132
00:07:50,356 --> 00:07:52,613
but here, we will have a significant difference.

133
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,495
Of course, the initial resolution is very similar to the one

134
00:07:58,495 --> 00:07:59,672
we had before.

135
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:05,615
And we add forces in the diagonals,

136
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:08,112
so -45 here

137
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,721
and -135

138
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,731
on the other side.

139
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:22,285
We carefully position these forces,

140
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,152
we select both.

141
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:30,497
We can see that we can make the arch pass with a slightly smaller force,

142
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:34,835
28.14, actually quite smaller, I remind you that we had 57 before.

143
00:08:35,512 --> 00:08:39,178
Then, we are going to introduce in the second applet,

144
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:42,929
forces which are equal to 28,

145
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,635
with an angle of 45,

146
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,059
and then, of 135

147
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:57,699
here.

148
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,609
We are going to ask for the resolution and we can make the internal forces pass

149
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:07,794
just through this hinge.

150
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:13,835
Here, the tensile internal force is smaller of about 20 in the cross beam

151
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:16,882
and on the right post.

152
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,572
And the internal forces were 25 and 23 in the right post,

153
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:23,862
respectively in the cross beam.

154
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:26,263
We can see that the position of the hinge

155
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:30,630
potentially leads to significant differences in the internal forces

156
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:32,236
inside the arch.

157
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,926
Here, we have a construction of a frame with a horizontal cross beam

158
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:38,775
with the elements we are used to.

159
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,452
Again, I solve it with both applets.

160
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,311
Here, I have not placed the supports yet,

161
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,653
so I place the supports.

162
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:49,482
In the left part, I have a load of 10 Newtons

163
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,042
which act just here.

164
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:55,844
Then, I have a pressure line

165
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,134
which is obviously going to pass by this intersection.

166
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:03,768
Then, I add forces in the diagonal.

167
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:12,113
So here, I make it rotate, not exactly 45 degrees,

168
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,907
I roughly estimate the inclination of this diagonal,

169
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,812
I select both diagonals

170
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:22,122
and I carefully come to pull on the end

171
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,989
until the internal force is centered.

172
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:28,910
The internal force in the post is approximately equal to 23 Newtons,

173
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,593
in the cross beam too.

174
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:34,898
And the internal force in this diagonal is equal to 22 Newtons.

175
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,328
I am going to introduce these 22 Newtons here in the right applet

176
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:45,254
making the force here rotate,

177
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:48,441
22 Newtons, here 22 Newtons,

178
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,707
I need to make it rotate more.

179
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:55,444
And I activate the resolution --

180
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,495
I have forgotten to place the supports, sorry--

181
00:10:58,495 --> 00:10:59,895
So, I place both supports.

182
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:06,207
And now, I activate the resolution

183
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,584
and I can see that I again have

184
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:14,964
the internal forces which correspond to about 16 in the post

185
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:18,137
and 16 and half in the cross beam, that is the same.

186
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:21,115
We can also solve such a case,

187
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:23,574
because we can see that it is a triangulated structure,

188
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:24,701
like a truss.

189
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:28,279
I am going to do it very quickly, because it may be useful for you,

190
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:34,177
it can be useful to know how to quickly calculate a truss.

191
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:38,662
I am going to use the fact that it behaves like an arch

192
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:44,929
with 3 hinges to draw the pressure line

193
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,639
which would correspond to the one of such an arch.

194
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:54,361
And I remind you what I said before:

195
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:59,468
the support reaction goes in this direction.

196
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,566
If now I come into the Cremona diagram,

197
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,526
we can see that we have here this load of 10 Newtons

198
00:12:12,395 --> 00:12:16,794
and then, turning, if I take a global free-body,

199
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:19,137
turning counterclockwise

200
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,957
around this global free-body,

201
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:25,479
I will first meet the left reaction

202
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,413
then the right reaction.

203
00:12:37,528 --> 00:12:40,432
Now that I have these reactions, we are maybe going to start

204
00:12:40,437 --> 00:12:46,018
the resolution of the truss by the left node,

205
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:46,778
here.

206
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:48,107
So, we have

207
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:56,037
this node 1 on which act the reaction RG.

208
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,613
Then, when we keep going counterclockwise,

209
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:09,242
we are going to have the internal force in 1-3

210
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,004
which pushes on the node.

211
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:16,464
So, this element here is in compression.

212
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:26,028
Then the internal force in 1-2 which pulls on the node.

213
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:33,566
So, the element 1-2 here is in tension.

214
00:13:36,963 --> 00:13:39,031
The contribution of the node

215
00:13:41,003 --> 00:13:41,724
1

216
00:13:42,804 --> 00:13:47,274
to the global equilibrium, respectively to the Cremona diagram,

217
00:13:47,954 --> 00:13:49,407
we can find it here.

218
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:53,495
We can now move to the node 3,

219
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:56,972
for example, we would actually have the choice between nodes 2 and 3.

220
00:13:57,444 --> 00:14:04,577
If we take the node 3, then we are going to have the internal force in 1-3

221
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,932
in the other direction.

222
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:12,584
Then, the internal force in 3-4 which pushes on the node,

223
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:19,620
thus it is in compression, here, 3-4.

224
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:25,611
Then, the internal force in 2-3 which also pushes on the node,

225
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:27,481
so which is also in compression.

226
00:14:32,253 --> 00:14:36,786
But we knew that there was compression here, in this diagonal.

227
00:14:37,362 --> 00:14:43,028
The contribution of node 3 to the global equilibrium

228
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:46,281
can be read here in the Cremona diagram.

229
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,955
We now move to node 2.

230
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,803
This node is subjected to the internal force in 1-2

231
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,499
in the other direction,

232
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:05,199
then to the internal force in 2-3

233
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,583
in the other direction,

234
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:12,053
then to the internal force in 2-4

235
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,134
which is horizontal.

236
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,841
So the element 2-4 is in tension.

237
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:31,056
I let you solve the other part of the diagram.

238
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:34,446
I am just going to indicate to you the colors since it is symmetrical,

239
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:36,428
that is not very difficult.

240
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:40,667
Here, we have compression.

241
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:45,632
They are elements of the arch.

242
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:50,115
And here, we have tension.

243
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:53,498
They are elements of the cable.

244
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:57,181
So, likewise, here,

245
00:15:58,812 --> 00:16:00,995
we have both these elements in tension

246
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:05,639
and these 3 other elements

247
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,074
in compression.

248
00:16:10,732 --> 00:16:12,825
So you can see that it is absolutely possible

249
00:16:12,825 --> 00:16:17,338
to solve such a frame by the classical method

250
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:19,676
which we know for trusses--

251
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:22,421
Ha, I did not indicate yet, I need to do it,

252
00:16:22,421 --> 00:16:27,473
the contribution of node 2 to the global equilibrium which is obviously here.

253
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:33,470
We can notice that there are really large internal forces in frames.

254
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,567
Here, you have the applied load of 10 Newtons

255
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:39,338
and you can see that the support reaction on the left and on the right

256
00:16:39,338 --> 00:16:41,093
are slightly smaller than 10 Newtons,

257
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:44,613
but all the other internal forces inside the frame,

258
00:16:44,613 --> 00:16:47,453
whether it be tensile or compressive internal forces,

259
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:49,114
are quite larger,

260
00:16:49,114 --> 00:16:51,121
that is also what we had seen with the applet.

261
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:54,806
We had an amplification coefficient of almost 6.

262
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,105
That is something we need to take into account.

263
00:16:57,378 --> 00:17:00,693
If we choose to build a frame, then the internal forces will be larger.

264
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:04,079
This means that more material will be needed, more reinforcement in the concrete,

265
00:17:04,346 --> 00:17:05,205
more steel.

266
00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:09,272
Here, in this video, I have a frame with a horizontal cross beam,

267
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,469
but that is the lower part of the cross beam which is horizontal.

268
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,229
That is a frame which I could have used for the calculation,

269
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:22,010
but since it turns out that the internal forces are actually very large

270
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,784
in this frame, I thought that it was more useful to solve

271
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,113
the one I have just shown you before.

272
00:17:27,437 --> 00:17:30,540
I would like to state four broad principles

273
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,341
pertaining to frames.

274
00:17:33,646 --> 00:17:36,521
The first principle is that we are going to add

275
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:40,534
internal forces--

276
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,504
internal forces

277
00:17:45,284 --> 00:17:46,864
to have

278
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:50,864
the desired shape.

279
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,479
For the moment, I took very simple shapes like that

280
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,735
of a rectangle, but we can have more complex shapes

281
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:02,913
and any kinds of shapes of this type can be obtained,

282
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,631
simply, you need to know that we are going to add

283
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:07,900
internal forces and we have seen that they were quite significant.

284
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,890
Then, we distribute

285
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,940
the loads

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,099
between

287
00:18:17,589 --> 00:18:19,959
the arch system

288
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:21,399
and

289
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,571
the cable system.

290
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:29,229
In the system I was showing until now,

291
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,041
the arch system was carrying the whole load

292
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:34,093
and you remember, the cable system was not carrying anything,

293
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:35,582
it was just taking the internal forces

294
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:38,602
which we had added, but we could have a system

295
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:41,317
where, on the opposite, the internal forces are carried

296
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:45,756
by the cable system and the arch system must carry the induced internal forces

297
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,613
where the loads distribute between both contributions.

298
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:54,834
Third, the internal forces are quite significant.

299
00:18:57,118 --> 00:19:00,223
I have already said it, but you really need to remember.

300
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:07,719
The choice of a solution with frames is not necessarily very economical.

301
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:10,025
To make a truss structure, for example,

302
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,434
is more efficient.

303
00:19:11,843 --> 00:19:16,469
And finally, we have seen it but we did not talk that much about it,

304
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:23,092
we have tension and compression

305
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:34,171
in the entire structure.

306
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:37,652
There will be places where there will only be tension

307
00:19:37,652 --> 00:19:40,394
or only compression, but generally, in a cross-section,

308
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:42,984
we will have at once tension and compression.

309
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,158
That is very similar to what we have for beams.

310
00:19:47,105 --> 00:19:49,866
Finally, I am going to deal here with this large example

311
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:55,055
which was built by Pier Luigi Nervi.

312
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:59,980
So, that is a large bridge which should ideally be an arch,

313
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:03,737
at least if we consider the applied loads.

314
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:07,465
This is the arch which would correspond to a uniformly distributed load.

315
00:20:07,828 --> 00:20:11,934
The shape which has been given to it is much more turned up.

316
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:15,297
You can see here the outer side of the bridge,

317
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:17,209
and here a cross-section of the bridge.

318
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:20,780
The bridge is hollow, there is obviously material in the upper part,

319
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,276
that is where the vehicles can run,

320
00:20:22,276 --> 00:20:24,411
and in the lower part, the intrados.

321
00:20:24,582 --> 00:20:27,799
And we can see here on the left and on the right,

322
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,619
very inclined blades made of concrete,

323
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:37,035
which really have a very important function for this structure.

324
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:38,723
Indeed,

325
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:47,123
these blades are going to introduce the compressive internal force here onto the arch

326
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:49,686
on the left and on the right.

327
00:20:50,565 --> 00:20:55,947
And that is going to drastically change the way this structure works.

328
00:20:57,001 --> 00:21:02,873
Let's look at this using two applets as we have already did before.

329
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:07,232
Here, on the left, we have an arch system.

330
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:10,538
One more time, the arch carries all the loads,

331
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,124
so I place here the hinge, that is the shape of the arch.

332
00:21:14,252 --> 00:21:15,794
All the loads are taken here.

333
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:19,641
In the right part, we are only going to take the internal forces.

334
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:21,782
We are going to introduce loads,

335
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:24,942
here,

336
00:21:26,582 --> 00:21:27,642
which are inclined.

337
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:32,458
I already make them a bit larger because I know they are going to be.

338
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:35,573
Then, I am going to give it an inclination.

339
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:37,526
I make it rotate.

340
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,479
Once it will have rotated, I can put it again... there you go.

341
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,009
I am going to place it a bit in the middle because, you are going to see,

342
00:21:43,264 --> 00:21:45,118
these loads are going to become quite large.

343
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:48,327
I place a second force which is equal to it,

344
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:51,480
but I make it rotate in the other direction

345
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,757
for it to be lined up with the concrete blade

346
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:00,264
of the right part.

347
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:01,942
Here, that is not too bad.

348
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:04,538
I am going to bring back this load here, in the middle.

349
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:06,771
You remember that only the line of action matters.

350
00:22:06,771 --> 00:22:08,713
I can move this load on its line of action.

351
00:22:08,713 --> 00:22:11,378
By the way, you can see that it does not change anything for the applet.

352
00:22:11,378 --> 00:22:14,005
Now, I select these two forces

353
00:22:14,828 --> 00:22:17,345
and I make them grow larger.

354
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,846
You can see that the arch very nicely changes its shape to snugly fit

355
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,497
the shape of the intrados.

356
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:26,340
Now, here we had ten loads of 1600.

357
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:29,691
So, it was 16 000, and you can see that the force

358
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:34,793
in the diagonal is approximately equal to the double, that is to say 31 500.

359
00:22:34,793 --> 00:22:38,405
And the internal forces in the cross-beam are in the range of 38 000.

360
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:42,135
So we have internal forces larger than the applied load.

361
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:45,534
In the right part, we are going to introduce

362
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:48,885
this internal force of 31 500.

363
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:52,137
So we are going to insert

364
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:57,927
this internal force here on the left and on the right.

365
00:22:57,927 --> 00:23:02,436
We are going to increase a bit the scale for it to look a bit bigger.

366
00:23:03,746 --> 00:23:05,865
I have a force on the left, a force on the right.

367
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,403
Now, I am going to incline them without varying their length.

368
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,120
So, I push on the CTRL button of the keyboard to make them

369
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,913
line up in the direction

370
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,489
of the small concrete elements.

371
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:28,440
Afterwards, I can make the cable pass, the structure in tension,

372
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,988
through the hinge and we can see that we have elements in tension

373
00:23:32,988 --> 00:23:35,797
with also internal forces in the range of 13 000 here

374
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:38,548
and of 24 000 in the central part,

375
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:42,201
that is a bit smaller than in the diagonal elements

376
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:44,271
but still very large.

377
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:46,622
Here, I am going to copy the internal forces.

378
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:52,619
We have seen that this element here is in compression at the level of the intrados.

379
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:04,820
The diagonal element is also in compression.

380
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:11,531
And the cross-beam is in tension in the upper part.

381
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:17,815
We are going to materialize this tension using

382
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:22,624
prestressing cables over the whole length of the bridge.

383
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,212
There will be a significant amount of these cables,

384
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,905
but that is not particularly a problem.

385
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:32,248
And then, finally, we are going to have the equilibrium of the tension

386
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:34,912
in the post, in the back part.

387
00:24:36,097 --> 00:24:39,821
In this video, we have seen principles for the resolution of frames

388
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:43,679
which consist in adding internal forces to change the shape

389
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,705
of the initial arch or cable and to make it enter

390
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:49,304
into the shape which we wish to have.

391
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,078
The consequence of this is that there are additional internal forces in frames.

392
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:55,114
These internal forces are sometimes very significant.

393
00:24:55,698 --> 00:24:58,927
We have also seen how a frame can be solved

394
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:01,125
using the applet i-Cremona.
