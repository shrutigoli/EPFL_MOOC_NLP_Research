00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:01,320
Hello!

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:04,743
In this video, we will talk about frames and hinges

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:09,023
So far, the frames which we have seen had three hinges,

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,694
in this case, the pressure line is uniquely determined 

5
00:00:13,694 --> 00:00:16,674
and it passes through the three hinges.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:20,322
We will see what happens when we have an arch with two

7
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:23,532
hinges, or only one or even without any hinges.

8
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:25,592
We will see that in these cases too,

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,856
we can determine the type of internal forces which act within the frame.

10
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,746
Finally, we will talk about a special type of cantilever frame

11
00:00:33,746 --> 00:00:35,487
which we will discover together.

12
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:38,467
We have here a frame with three hinges.

13
00:00:40,383 --> 00:00:42,513
So in this configuration,

14
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:47,531
the shape of the pressure line is totally determined

15
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,671
since it must pass through the three hinges

16
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:57,571
and change direction at the level of the line of action of the force.

17
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,856
If we had several forces, it should change its shape several times

18
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:04,363
but it would have to necessarily pass by the three red dots.

19
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:08,280
We have not exactly determined our structure yet

20
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,386
since we are going to have to push on the structure here

21
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:19,123
and to pull on the structure there to make the pressure line enter

22
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:22,873
inside the material.

23
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:27,730
So placing a compressive internal force here,

24
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,870
we manage to make the internal force

25
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:31,486
come back inside material

26
00:01:31,486 --> 00:01:33,506
then here, on the right,

27
00:01:33,506 --> 00:01:35,580
we are going to make the internal force

28
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,690
come back inside the material by applying a tensile internal force here.

29
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:46,583
Then obviously, to carry the compressive internal force here,

30
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,507
it will be necessary to have a tensile internal force here,

31
00:01:49,507 --> 00:01:53,817
likewise to support the tensile internal force in the right part.

32
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,048
We are going to have this kind of internal forces

33
00:01:57,048 --> 00:01:59,386
which act in a frame

34
00:01:59,386 --> 00:02:03,636
with three hinges and an asymmetrical load.

35
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,965
That is what we have represented in this picture.

36
00:02:06,967 --> 00:02:11,307
So I have put a very large load to be sure that everything is tensioned

37
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:16,174
and what we can see is that we have here a diagonal element

38
00:02:16,174 --> 00:02:20,804
in compression, here a diagonal element in tension

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,508
and then the effect of this diagonal element

40
00:02:23,508 --> 00:02:30,238
is to make the arch rise up in the left part

41
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:34,472
and to make it go down in the right part,

42
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:39,091
compared to the logical position of the pressure line.

43
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:42,641
And we thus obtain a structure

44
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:46,749
which has the shape which we have seen just before.

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:50,816
Here we can see, because it is a structure which cannot lie,

46
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:54,986
we can really see where we have tensile and compressive internal forces.

47
00:02:58,604 --> 00:02:59,814
Of course, it is a truss,

48
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:04,034
we could calculate it with the calculation methods which we know

49
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:07,970
since we have three hinges, that is a statically determinate structure.

50
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,115
Thereafter, we are going to have structures

51
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:13,526
with variable numbers of hinges.

52
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:16,050
Here, we have three hinges.

53
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,855
Here, we have two hinges at the base.

54
00:03:17,855 --> 00:03:20,491
Here we have one hinge

55
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:24,124
and finally on the bottom, we have not any hinges.

56
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:27,454
So three hinges,

57
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:31,681
two hinges,

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,460
one hinge

59
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:43,152
and without any hinges.

60
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,554
On all these structures,

61
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:50,324
we are going to make act only one vertical load : Q

62
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:55,892
in the middle of the cross beam, the cross beam is the horizontal part of the frame,

63
00:03:55,892 --> 00:04:00,492
while the vertical part is called the post.

64
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,709
So simply, a vertical load.

65
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,712
Under the effect of this load,

66
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:08,901
I am going to have a pressure line in this arch with three hinges

67
00:04:08,901 --> 00:04:11,511
which is well determined since it must pass

68
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:14,101
through the three hinges.

69
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:18,982
Then, as we have previously seen,

70
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:24,195
I am going to support this arch by means of these diagonals in compression

71
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:29,795
in such a way that the arch is going to rise up and get inside the material,

72
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:34,205
in the post as well as in the cross beam.

73
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:43,625
And then, to equilibrate these compressive internal forces in the diagonals,

74
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,419
I am going to introduce two tensile internal forces,

75
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,484
one in the post and the other one in the cross beam,

76
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:54,804
which are going to ensure that our structure is in equilibrium.

77
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,810
In the case of the arch with two hinges on the right,

78
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,631
the structure is statically indeterminate,

79
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,360
so we cannot exactly calculate the internal forces

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,338
within the framework of this course.

81
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:07,395
But we however know

82
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:10,808
that the pressure line must pass through these two hinges,

83
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:14,127
and then it is going to pass somewhere, on a point, let's say here,

84
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:18,547
in the part above the cross beam.

85
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,758
How is the structure going to behave?

86
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:26,598
Well, in a very similar way than

87
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:30,152
what we have seen before.

88
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,906
That is to say that we have a pressure line

89
00:05:32,906 --> 00:05:35,126
which is inside, so we must push

90
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,056
on this pressure line by means of a diagonal in compression

91
00:05:38,056 --> 00:05:41,759
to make the pressure line enter

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,489
into the posts.

93
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:46,603
Then in the cross-beam,

94
00:05:46,603 --> 00:05:49,913
the pressure line is going to start inside,

95
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,053
on the intrados.

96
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:53,144
And then it is going to go up until the outer part

97
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:58,514
to end up on the same side than the initial pressure line.

98
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:01,374
For the structure to be in equilibrium,

99
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:06,314
again, we insert a tensile internal force in the posts,

100
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:09,624
and then in the cross beam, we are going to have tension

101
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:13,710
which goes towards the extrados, in the corners,

102
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,090
and which goes towards the intrados, inside, at mid-span.

103
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,310
Finally, to reach the equilibrium here,

104
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,990
we have a small element in compression.

105
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:26,459
For the arch with one hinge,

106
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,421
there, we simply know

107
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,528
that the internal force is going to pass through this hinge

108
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:32,548
then afterwards, it is going to get out.

109
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,864
So, I am going to introduce a point

110
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:38,704
at a certain distance, I am going to make it symmetrical,

111
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:41,433
in this way, my drawing will be more correct.

112
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:44,345
A point at a certain distance, but we cannot determine it.

113
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:45,912
Those of you who will attend more

114
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:48,918
advanced structures courses will definitely see methods

115
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:52,238
to accurately calculate the internal forces in frames.

116
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:53,628
We can understand anyway

117
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:56,080
what happens without proceeding to an accurate calculation, so here,

118
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,290
that is not the result of a precise calculation.

119
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:02,657
Here, I need anyway a diagonal in compression

120
00:07:02,657 --> 00:07:05,019
to make the internal force rise up inside the material

121
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:06,103
and then,

122
00:07:06,103 --> 00:07:07,698
we can see that the internal force in the post

123
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,727
will be inside, on the intrados,

124
00:07:10,727 --> 00:07:14,547
in the upper part, and then it is gong to go outwards,

125
00:07:14,547 --> 00:07:18,446
towards the extrados, in the part near the supports.

126
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:20,971
And then, in the cross beam however,

127
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:22,997
it is the same thing than what we had here,

128
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:26,847
we simply go up towards the hinge.

129
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:32,392
Concerning tension,

130
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:36,773
we need tension to equilibrate the diagonal in the corners.

131
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:40,930
So we are going to have tension which is going to cross here the compression

132
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,910
in the posts.

133
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:48,856
And then, a tension exactly as we have seen

134
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:51,526
above for the cross-beam.

135
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,314
Finally, we have here

136
00:07:55,314 --> 00:07:57,752
a frame without any hinges.

137
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:03,522
So, we are going to determine some points of passage.

138
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:08,324
We are going to have a pressure line

139
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:14,107
which is going to be outside, at the level of the supports,

140
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,821
which is going to pass above the cross-beam

141
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:19,041
and which is going to be outside,

142
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,399
at the level of the right support.

143
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:23,178
For the internal forces to be inside

144
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:24,831
this structure, we must again

145
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,561
insert a diagonal in compression.

146
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:31,668
The internal force in the posts will be similar to what we have seen for the frame

147
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:33,788
with one hinge, on the left,

148
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:37,673
so, with compression which changes side.

149
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:40,085
And then, at the level of the cross-beam,

150
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:42,134
it is the same configuration

151
00:08:42,134 --> 00:08:44,078
than the one we have seen above.

152
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:49,280
That is to say that the internal forces change side with an element in compression

153
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,570
in the middle and tension

154
00:08:55,157 --> 00:08:59,687
which is opposite to compression.

155
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,756
And likewise in the posts.

156
00:09:05,981 --> 00:09:08,260
So we can see that through a real understanding

157
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,121
of what is the pressure line,

158
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,417
even if we cannot entirely determine it,

159
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,254
since there is only the case with three hinges,

160
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,906
on the left here, which we can

161
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:19,466
completely calculate on the basis of the methods of this course

162
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:22,200
but understanding how the pressure line works,

163
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,998
we can understand the sign of the internal forces

164
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:29,068
in the various parts of this frame structure.

165
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:32,554
What happens when we are confronted

166
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:34,795
with asymmetrical loads?

167
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:37,685
Asymmetrical loads could be placed, for example,

168
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:41,102
on the left part of this structure,

169
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:45,182
we only have its self-weight acting.

170
00:09:48,676 --> 00:09:50,895
And then, on the right part,

171
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:53,292
a more significant load

172
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,232
because it has been snowing

173
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,245
and the snow has been blown.

174
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:00,231
It only acts on the right part

175
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:06,781
so we have the self-weight plus the snow on the right part.

176
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,645
We still have, as we have seen it,

177
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,905
three hinges here,

178
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:18,522
how is this structure going to behave ?

179
00:10:18,522 --> 00:10:22,662
We are going to use this applet to see how this structure works.

180
00:10:22,662 --> 00:10:24,245
The supports have already been inserted,

181
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:27,555
and the uniformly distributed load as well.

182
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,523
We can activate the resolution

183
00:10:30,523 --> 00:10:34,103
and using the mode &quot;point of passage&quot;,

184
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:38,394
we force the pressure line to pass by this point here.

185
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:39,833
What we can see is that obviously,

186
00:10:39,833 --> 00:10:42,676
we have a parabolic shape

187
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,528
for the pressure line,

188
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:46,796
and thus there will be a compressive internal force at the level of the intrados.

189
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,743
The compressive internal force is maximum

190
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:52,869
where the distance to the pressure line is maximum.

191
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,489
And then we are going to have a maximum internal force here,

192
00:10:55,497 --> 00:10:58,777
and then a minimum internal force near the hinges.

193
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,110
Now, what happens

194
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:06,613
when we have a series of forces here?

195
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:09,553
I select all these forces,

196
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:12,757
and then I make them vary,

197
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:16,418
increasing them.

198
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:18,917
You can see that, when I increase the force

199
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,637
in the right part, we are going to stop here,

200
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,997
then in the right part, the pressure line rised up

201
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:27,197
and the internal forces decreased,

202
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:28,747
while in the left part,

203
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:30,967
the pressure line went down,

204
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,741
and thus the internal forces increased.

205
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:33,909
That is a bit paradoxical

206
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:36,709
but if we add forces

207
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:42,081
on one side, the internal force increase on the other side of the structure.

208
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:44,980
In this video, you can see what I called

209
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,219
a cantilever frame, that is to say a structure

210
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,514
which essentially looks like a crane,

211
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,623
with a cantilever on the top,

212
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:55,607
and then a kind of vertical element

213
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:58,150
with tension and compression.

214
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,895
You should note that the first thing I have done

215
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,985
when I introduced this video,

216
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:05,030
is to add a counterweight

217
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:10,090
on the bottom of the crane to prevent it to overturn

218
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:14,401
because of the load of 10 Newtons here.

219
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:19,104
Very clearly, without needing a long explanation,

220
00:12:19,104 --> 00:12:22,714
that is clear that these elements

221
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:28,069
are in compression,

222
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:34,144
and then that the chain element is in tension.

223
00:12:44,644 --> 00:12:47,267
Actually, that is half a frame,

224
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,578
which I represented here.

225
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:52,692
You should note that because of the presence of this quadrilateral,

226
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,772
this structure is not totally stable,

227
00:12:55,773 --> 00:13:00,583
it could deform in the way I made it move here.

228
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,675
It was actually standing in a vertical position

229
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:05,452
because I had tightened well

230
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,082
this screw at the bottom.

231
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:09,848
Let's concretely look at such a structure.

232
00:13:09,848 --> 00:13:12,435
It is very similar to what I have just shown you,

233
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,656
but that is a real structure,

234
00:13:14,656 --> 00:13:17,736
that is a crane for a small construction site.

235
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:21,265
If we first apply a load Q

236
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:25,947
at the tip of the structure,

237
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:28,775
what are we going to get as a type of internal force?

238
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,831
Here, I am going to take advantage of this situation to repeat the things

239
00:13:31,831 --> 00:13:36,033
we have seen in different parts of this course until now.

240
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:41,753
In the external part, that is a cantilever

241
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:44,115
so we are going to have compression

242
00:13:44,117 --> 00:13:48,587
on the bottom of the cross-section, and tension on top of the cross-section.

243
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:52,726
And then we are going to have diagonals

244
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:55,768
in tension in this direction.

245
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,048
This first part

246
00:13:58,048 --> 00:14:00,210
works like this, and obviously,

247
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,497
the other diagonals are in compression.

248
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:07,137
It works like a small truss.

249
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,870
And then, we can see that we reach

250
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,696
a larger structure,

251
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:16,156
we are going to essentially have tension here.

252
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,522
We are going to keep having a bit of bending

253
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:21,852
in this part here

254
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:26,442
but I am going to choose to ignore it

255
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,812
because we are essentially

256
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:35,545
going to have compression here, in this part of the structure.

257
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:39,005
Here, tension is slightly 

258
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:40,638
deviated.

259
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:44,911
So, to support this small deviation,

260
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,269
we will need to have a bit of compression

261
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,112
which is also going to be carried through the following part of the structure

262
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:54,858
by a bit of bending.

263
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:57,075
I keep looking at

264
00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:59,925
this compression here,

265
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:06,192
this cable carries the vertical component of the internal force

266
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:07,990
which is transmitted through here.

267
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,868
We are going to also have an element in compression

268
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,773
as well as two elements in compression,

269
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:20,863
here, which are going to be used to deviate the horizontal internal force in this cable

270
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:25,202
to make it go down towards the bottom of the structure.

271
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:28,002
And then compression,

272
00:15:28,002 --> 00:15:33,546
will be deviated to go down into the mast of the structure.

273
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:37,273
It should be noted that in this zone here,

274
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:41,928
we have a large weigth W

275
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,284
which is the counterweight of the crane.

276
00:15:44,284 --> 00:15:46,311
Sometimes, it is placed on top of the mast,

277
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:48,141
here, it is placed atthe bottom.

278
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,499
That is exactly what I personally

279
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:55,852
placed to avoid the structure rotating,

280
00:15:55,852 --> 00:15:58,552
and becoming unstable.

281
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:02,068
What happens when we have a load which is still called Q,

282
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,788
but which is placed somewhere else on the crane?

283
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,025
There are many crane elements

284
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:08,957
which have not any internal forces.

285
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:12,047
So, that is not that they exactly have not any internal forces,

286
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:15,066
since, obviously, they keep having a weight.

287
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,582
But, within the framework of this example,

288
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,832
we only consider the part

289
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,396
which is linked to the load.

290
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,296
We are going to have tension

291
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:30,026
in the diagonals and then in this cable,

292
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:34,679
and then, compression in the diagonals

293
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:35,964
in the lower chord.

294
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:39,002
And then tension in the upper chord.

295
00:16:39,002 --> 00:16:40,400
And then, we are going to

296
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,110
essentially have compression

297
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,639
in this part of the crane.

298
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,979
There is again compression here and there, as well as in the column.

299
00:16:52,926 --> 00:16:55,356
And then tension, of course,

300
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:58,069
in the cable, from the ground,

301
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,897
deviated by these elements in compression.

302
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:04,952
But the remainder of the structure is not used.

303
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:08,480
We can see that we have a structure which works in a quite different way

304
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,460
depending on the position of the load on the crane.

305
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:13,574
It seems to be quite natural by the way.

306
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,782
In this video, we have seen what is the influence

307
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:18,702
of the number of hinges on the position of the pressure line.

308
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:19,910
We have seen that we can

309
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,524
estimate the position of this pressure line

310
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:24,528
when we cannot exactly calculate it,

311
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:27,957
and that it enables us to determine the position of the internal forces

312
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:29,836
and of the maximum internal forces,

313
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:33,192
that is to say where the eccentricity between the pressure line

314
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,950
and the structure is the largest.

315
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,791
Finally, in the example of a crane,

316
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,741
we have seen how a cantilever frame works.
