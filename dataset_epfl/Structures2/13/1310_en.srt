00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:05,636
Hello.

2
00:00:05,636 --> 00:00:08,699
In this video, we will see how we can actually

3
00:00:08,712 --> 00:00:10,993
include a truss in a beam,

4
00:00:11,614 --> 00:00:13,580
we will see what are the limitations

5
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,091
to respect for it to work,

6
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,845
we will see that construction materials

7
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:21,451
such as reinforced concrete or steel

8
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:26,909
are particularly adapted to the analogy of a truss in a beam.

9
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:33,839
We first have the beam which we have seen in the previous video

10
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:36,690
with 2 times 10 Newtons

11
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,687
and we want to study the internal forces which act inside this beam.

12
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:48,273
We already know that the lower part will be in tension, so I already place here,

13
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:53,481
a little bit inside because I need a certain thickness,

14
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:55,595
the tensile internal force.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,618
And then, I am going to study a free-body which is approximately located here,

16
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:08,702
we are going to see why I cannot totally be accurate.

17
00:01:09,309 --> 00:01:14,481
This free-body is subjected to the load of 10 Newtons

18
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:20,868
and then comes an inclined diagonal from the support.

19
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:29,876
This diagonal cannot go till the edge. Why?

20
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:35,333
Because it will be necessary to reserve a part of the matter

21
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:37,009
to carry the internal force.

22
00:01:37,454 --> 00:01:41,562
The complete solution is not yet a truss in the beam,

23
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:43,183
that is just an arch-cable,

24
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:47,124
and you will see that it is enough for our reasoning.

25
00:01:47,124 --> 00:01:52,826
And we have here a certain amount of material which is reserved

26
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:58,460
to be able to carry the internal force which acts in the beam.

27
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:10,239
This internal force here, I call it... we are going to write it here, I call it N2

28
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:16,359
while the internal force in this part, which is larger,

29
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:18,290
so I give it more space,

30
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,543
I call it N1.

31
00:02:28,344 --> 00:02:35,475
So here, this internal force N1 spreads over a certain width

32
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,144
within the beam.

33
00:02:37,148 --> 00:02:39,961
You remember that the truss elements which we had

34
00:02:39,961 --> 00:02:42,743
also had, eventually, widths

35
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,410
when we were finished with our calculation.

36
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:50,043
The width of this zone here, I am going to call it b1,

37
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:57,110
and of this zone here, I am going to call it b2,

38
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,676
remembering that our beam has a total depth of h,

39
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,269
and a width t.

40
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:29,505
So, on this basis, I can write that the internal force N1 is equal to the width

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:36,653
of the diagonal times the thickness t times the compressive strength

42
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:38,418
of the material.

43
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,594
If I know the thickness and the material, I can thus determine that

44
00:03:42,874 --> 00:03:49,977
b1 is equal to N1 - in terms of absolute value, I do not write it but that is obvious

45
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:52,256
that the thickness is going to be positive -

46
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,148
divided by t times fc.

47
00:03:56,964 --> 00:04:05,096
Likewise, b2 will be equal to N2 divided by t times fc.

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:15,214
What we can notice... I evidence the central part

49
00:04:15,537 --> 00:04:16,789
of the arch-cable.

50
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:26,115
This arch-cable does not have the same depth than the beam,

51
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:34,858
for an obvious reason: the whole arch-cable which supports

52
00:04:35,172 --> 00:04:40,242
the internal forces must be inside the beam, so actually,

53
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:49,278
the real effective depth is located here and we will call it Z.

54
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:55,180
It is very important to remember, obviously, that the effective depth z

55
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:58,769
is smaller than the total depth of our beam.

56
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:09,507
Let's look at how to obtain the internal forces N1, N2 and N3 in the lower part

57
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:10,702
of the beam.

58
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:15,189
Our dark blue free-body is subjected

59
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:17,623
to the 10 Newtons.

60
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,015
Then, turning counterclockwise,

61
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,521
we first meet the internal force N1,

62
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:42,224
here, then the internal force N2 which is horizontal.

63
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:54,707
If we want to obtain the internal force N3, we have to look

64
00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:02,607
at this orange free-body which is subjected to the internal force N1

65
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:09,113
in the other direction and then to the support reaction here: we can easily guess that it is equal to

66
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:14,098
10 Newtons. I draw it in a staggered way.

67
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:17,913
R on the left is equal to 10 Newtons,

68
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:22,087
then finally, the internal force N3

69
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:27,615
which pulls rightwards

70
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:34,570
and then we can see that the amplitude of N2 is equal to the one of N3.

71
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,510
That is not possible to endlessly proceed in this way.

72
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,030
If we have, like when we turned the beam before,

73
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,910
a beam which still has

74
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:51,499
the same loads but which has a smaller depth,

75
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:59,563
what is going to happen when I try to draw the same arch-cable

76
00:07:00,363 --> 00:07:02,683
than before, still respecting

77
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:10,894
a certain zone which will enable to distribute the stresses

78
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:13,561
in our beam,

79
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:24,297
I observe that suddenly, this angle that I call alpha

80
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,401
becomes too small.

81
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,344
So, this is a solution

82
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,292
which is unacceptable.

83
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,880
Why is it unacceptable?

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,818
Not because we cannot calculate it,

85
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:45,816
but because it has been observed in lab tests that the the structure

86
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:48,993
is not going to behave this way.

87
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,090
What is going to happen then?

88
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:57,505
We are going to see another type of solution which is another truss

89
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:01,301
which is going to enable us to solve this difficulty.

90
00:08:02,446 --> 00:08:12,381
Instead of directly going to the support, the internal force is actually going to first go down

91
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:19,047
then to go up again, thanks to a tensile element

92
00:08:19,396 --> 00:08:23,033
to finally go down again towards the support.

93
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,017
Then, we are going to have a compressive internal force here,

94
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:37,372
and then the same thing on the other side.

95
00:08:45,204 --> 00:08:50,380
Then a vertical element in tension

96
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,387
and a second diagonal in compression.

97
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,182
Of course, all these elements are going to have a thickness,

98
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:01,359
here the internal force is going to be maximum,

99
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,707
it is going to decrease a bit here,

100
00:09:07,018 --> 00:09:09,928
and in the diagonals, however, it is going to be constant

101
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:15,243
since actually the load of 10 Newtons must go through

102
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:18,813
towards the support.

103
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:36,498
Here, we have an angle which is acceptable if it is between 25 and 45 degrees.

104
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:41,764
The building codes prescribe these limit angles

105
00:09:42,121 --> 00:09:46,159
but these values there are generally acceptable, for example,

106
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,604
for reinforced concrete.

107
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,083
So let's look at a reinforced concrete beam.

108
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,958
Here, this is a beam that we have in our corridors,

109
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,034
which enables us to show... a quite old beam,

110
00:09:59,034 --> 00:10:02,038
which enables us to show the types of reinforcement which act

111
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:05,052
in a reinforced concrete beam.

112
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,289
We first have the reinforcement, it is on both sides,

113
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:16,967
the lower longitudinal reinforcement.

114
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:28,142
That is the one which can carry tension

115
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,486
as we have just seen it before.

116
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:35,822
Here, we have another particular element, that is this kind of pipe,

117
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:41,009
which actually contains, here we can see it, a lot of small wires,

118
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:46,031
this is a prestressing reinforcement.

119
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:53,982
We have already seen the word prestressing not that long ago

120
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,591
when we were talking about the airplane of the Wright brothers

121
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:58,924
which had prestressed their X-shaped diagonals.

122
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,506
Prestressing is a system by means of which we introduce, in the present instance,

123
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:07,197
compression in concrete by strongly tensioning these cables

124
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:11,213
before loading the structure; that is why we call this prestressing.

125
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:15,921
Concretely, the most significant consequence of prestressing here,

126
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,283
is that we can introduce, thanks to these cables,

127
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:21,345
a very large concentrated load

128
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:24,819
which would otherwise need a very large number of reinforcement bars.

129
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:32,407
We also have other types of reinforcement here which are vertical reinforcements

130
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:37,867
which surround, and that is important, all the other reinforcement.

131
00:11:38,218 --> 00:11:40,443
In theory, these bars should be closed,

132
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,668
here unfortunately they are not,

133
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,414
but actually, they should be closed and these bars,

134
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,432
we call them stirrups.

135
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:56,500
They work as transverse reinforcement since, as we have seen it,

136
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:59,155
it was necessary before.

137
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:10,411
And then, we have a fourth kind of reinforcement here,

138
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:13,290
that is the bars which remain here

139
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,011
and also here.

140
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,116
This is a constructive reinforcement.

141
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:30,695
It is not, actually, strictly necessary for strength reasons

142
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:34,512
but however, it is here to hold the other bars, in such a way

143
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:38,426
that the reinforcement cage which it is going to constitute, remains stable

144
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:39,983
when we are going to pour the concrete...

145
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,520
because the concrete is very heavy material,

146
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,607
you remember, with a density twice and half larger

147
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,558
than that of water.

148
00:12:47,302 --> 00:12:51,367
Here, we have a model which is maybe a bit simpler

149
00:12:51,368 --> 00:12:54,341
to understand the behavior of a reinforced concrete beam.

150
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,038
We have here, a beam with two loads,

151
00:12:58,719 --> 00:13:01,475
we have a lot of stirrups, here that is a beam

152
00:13:01,752 --> 00:13:04,641
with a rectangular cross-section and here the stirrups are 

153
00:13:04,898 --> 00:13:09,301
closed, and then, actually, you can see, the stirrup is bent

154
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:11,543
and it is closed in the other direction.

155
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:15,869
There are several ways to do that, but this usually works quite well.

156
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,376
Here it is, I am not going to draw them all,

157
00:13:20,376 --> 00:13:23,270
however, I am going to copy them here on the top.

158
00:13:24,098 --> 00:13:28,948
We have here stirrups, regularly distributed over the whole length.

159
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:35,760
Here it is, and so forth...

160
00:13:42,348 --> 00:13:45,597
I do not correctly draw them, I need to correct them here.

161
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,518
They must obviously extend over the whole depth

162
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:55,886
and surround the load-bearing reinforcement, that is to say the lower reinforcement.

163
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,889
This reinforcement should actually even raise

164
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:04,297
upwards in a correct way, anchored.

165
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,632
What behavior are we going to have?

166
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:10,486
Well, what we have said before, that is to say

167
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:14,717
a behavior with diagonals in compression.

168
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:19,302
And then actually, we can see that since we have more reinforcements,

169
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:24,497
we are going to have a behavior with multiple diagonals in compression

170
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:34,231
and then, obviously, here on the top, a compression which is going to increase,

171
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,977
it is going to be maximal in the central part,

172
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,220
constant by the way in the central part

173
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:48,365
and it is going to vary towards the supports and then still these multiple diagonals.

174
00:14:49,303 --> 00:14:51,513
Of course, you can ask yourself the question:

175
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:54,676
&quot;Does reinforced concrete really behaves concrete like that?&quot;

176
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:59,824
Well, what we can see here, on the bottom, is a similar test,

177
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,062
also with two loads which act on this beam.

178
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:11,299
We can notice the presence of a lot of cracks

179
00:15:12,223 --> 00:15:15,210
which are prettily parallel to each other

180
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,097
and which let us understand the behavior of concrete.

181
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:28,445
If we take a small element of concrete here,

182
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,544
well, this concrete is cracked on either side, so

183
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:37,220
it means that it is exposed, in this direction,

184
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,562
to tensile stresses which exceeded its tensile

185
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:42,085
strength and it cracked.

186
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,997
And then, in the other direction, to compression stresses.

187
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:52,004
It enables us to understand that indeed, the simplification

188
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,261
that we have made, to imagine a truss inside

189
00:15:56,261 --> 00:16:01,226
the reinforced concrete beam, is actually not a real simplification.

190
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,349
Here, on the right, you have the shape of the reinforcement,

191
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:11,025
for example, we can also end the stirrup like this, thereafter, we are going to place

192
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:15,650
a certain number of longitudinal load-bearing bars,

193
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:19,353
and then, on the top, since I have drawn them in yellow, I keep going,

194
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:23,637
there will be a certain number of non-load-bearing bars

195
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,654
which are constructive bars.

196
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:31,299
You can also see them in the central part of the illustration.

197
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:49,434
A reinforced concrete beam thus behaves like a truss with N-shaped diagonals

198
00:16:49,447 --> 00:16:51,086
in compression.

199
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:02,619
Here we have a nice example of a reinforced concrete beam just before its rupture.

200
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:07,265
What happened is that here, the stirrups broke,

201
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:12,248
I draw them in a discontinuous way and since the stirrups broke,

202
00:17:12,884 --> 00:17:16,158
they enabled the light which is behind to pass through

203
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,321
but what is interesting is that despite this, we can see that there still were

204
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:26,524
some concrete elements in a relatively good state,

205
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:30,331
at the end, they broke, but these elements enabled

206
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:34,237
to transmit compressive internal forces.

207
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:41,605
That is a test by Michael Rupf, in the laboratory IBETON, at EPFL.

208
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:47,398
We now want to look at how a steel beam behaves

209
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,834
when it is subjected, let's say, to two loads like the ones we have seen before.

210
00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:01,541
Here, on the right, you have the cross-section of a steel beam which is typical,

211
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:09,669
with two flanges: the upper flange and the lower flange.

212
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,545
The upper flange is here to support compression,

213
00:18:14,545 --> 00:18:16,823
the lower frange to support tension

214
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:20,651
and then the element between both, we call it the web.

215
00:18:20,897 --> 00:18:23,513
All the elements of this cross-section are quite thin

216
00:18:23,513 --> 00:18:26,954
because steel is quite expensive, so we try to save it

217
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,816
and since it is very strong, that is absolutely possible.

218
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:37,201
And then, also in the left part, that is a railway bridge in Switzerland

219
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:43,770
and we can notice that indeed, we have here the lower flange,

220
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:48,978
here we can see the upper flange,

221
00:18:49,491 --> 00:18:53,299
then we can see the whole web and also an additional element

222
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,923
that I am going to draw here in light blue,

223
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,519
which is a very one-time element, like this,

224
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,665
there is one approximately every 2 meters.

225
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,135
A vertical element, likewise, on the supports.

226
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,650
If I have to draw this element, that is an element which is going to be here

227
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:18,895
on the cross-section; it is typically welded to the cross-section and it closes it.

228
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:22,890
Usually, this cross-section is open here,

229
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,375
in this case, it is closed.

230
00:19:25,057 --> 00:19:30,834
What is the function of this element? We can see it here in a test,

231
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:33,538
a test which has been carried out, there was probably a load

232
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,528
or several loads which acted around there,

233
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:40,040
we have a support reaction here, on the left.

234
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:51,524
And then, the natural trend would be to have here diagonals in compression.

235
00:19:51,742 --> 00:19:55,053
But what happens when we introduce compression

236
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,605
in a very thin element?

237
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:00,809
Well, we can see it with this shape that we can guess here:

238
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:07,880
this element, instead of remaining rectilinear, is going to bend like this.

239
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:10,818
That is the same thing here.

240
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:14,802
The result is going to be that this element cannot support any internal forces

241
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:16,656
in this direction.

242
00:20:17,335 --> 00:20:23,825
So actually, I am going to erase my diagonal in compression because it cannot

243
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,912
work because of this phenomenon.

244
00:20:26,381 --> 00:20:29,760
This phenomenon, we call it web buckling.

245
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:36,210
That is a quite advanced phenomenon, we are not going to talk more about it here,

246
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:41,294
but it thus means that for a steel beam, it is simply not possible

247
00:20:41,453 --> 00:20:44,475
to have N-shaped diagonals in compression.

248
00:20:44,837 --> 00:20:47,066
What can then happen?

249
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:57,257
We at least know that we are going to have tension in the lower flange,

250
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:01,051
and that we are going to have compression in the upper flange.

251
00:21:03,816 --> 00:21:07,543
To carry the loads, it is possible to have tension here,

252
00:21:08,732 --> 00:21:10,177
in these diagonals.

253
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:17,630
In this case, to reach equilibrium, it is necessary that the posts here

254
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:19,978
be in compression.

255
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:25,888
The function of this element which we have here,

256
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:30,538
which is called a stiffener,

257
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,530
is to enable this part of the beam...

258
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:42,020
Normally, it would also like to bend if it is subjected to compression,

259
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,001
but thanks to this stiffener, it manages to resist and then the result is

260
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:52,769
that this element, this post, can resist compression.

261
00:21:54,757 --> 00:21:57,429
The behavior of a steel beam

262
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,502
with two loads is then as follows:

263
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,320
we have tension in the lower flange,

264
00:22:06,696 --> 00:22:10,725
we are going to have compression in the upper flange...

265
00:22:13,185 --> 00:22:15,789
Because of the very particular shape of these elements,

266
00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:22,848
we can see that the effective depth is slightly smaller

267
00:22:25,183 --> 00:22:27,453
than h, but just a bit.

268
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:31,831
That is a big advantage of this construction method.

269
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:35,636
And then we are going to have stiffeners

270
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:47,432
in compression here and then also in the left part,

271
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,860
and finally diagonals in tension.

272
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:16,706
So, the behavior of a steel beam can be assimilated

273
00:23:16,719 --> 00:23:21,984
that of a truss with N-shaped diagonals

274
00:23:27,143 --> 00:23:28,623
in tension.

275
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:37,869
We have seen in this lecture how to insert a truss

276
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:41,508
in a beam, with a clear process which generally leads us

277
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:43,339
to trusses with N-shaped diagonals.

278
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,402
For reinforced concrete, the diagonals are in compression.

279
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:52,169
For the steel construction, they are in tension.

280
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:55,814
In both cases, instead of taking into account the total depth of the beam,

281
00:23:55,814 --> 00:23:59,928
we have to consider the effective depth.
