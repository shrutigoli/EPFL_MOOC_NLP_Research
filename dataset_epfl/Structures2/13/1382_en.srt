1
00:00:05,028 --> 00:00:08,402
When we want to proceed with the dimensioning of steel beams,

2
00:00:08,402 --> 00:00:13,089
we are going to proceed in a way which is similar to what we have seen with concrete before.

3
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:15,697
It is important - we are going to see why -

4
00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:18,199
to use Newtons and millimeters as units,

5
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,805
that is a bit different from what we usually have

6
00:00:20,805 --> 00:00:22,395
but that is not very serious,

7
00:00:22,395 --> 00:00:25,208
and then we will look a bit at the dimensions of these steel shapes.

8
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,103
We are going to start with exactly the same condition,

9
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:31,421
we are going to predimension a steel beam with large flanges,

10
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,313
which has a span of 10 meters,

11
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:35,492
a depth of 1.32 meters,

12
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:37,787
we do not know the width of the flanges.

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,853
Here you go, we have our steel beam.

14
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,168
The first thing we are going to do is to put the screen to scale.

15
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:47,301
This time we do not have a distance of ten or or one hundred

16
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:51,258
but a distance of ten thousand between the supports.

17
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:57,264
We are now going to insert the forces,

18
00:00:57,267 --> 00:01:01,728
the forces have a value of one hundred kiloNewtons every meter,

19
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,825
that is to say one hundred thousand Newtons.

20
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:09,193
You can see that the applet always automatically puts the forces to scale,

21
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:11,705
se we cannot see when we insert forces

22
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,728
if they are ten, one hundred, or one thousand times too large.

23
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:16,695
So, we have to be careful,

24
00:01:16,695 --> 00:01:19,517
I insert here the left support

25
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:23,781
and then with control, the right support.

26
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:27,693
I am now going to define the material properties.

27
00:01:27,693 --> 00:01:32,290
We have said that it has a strength of 235 Newtons per square millimeter,

28
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,693
and then I am going to give it a width of 300 millimeters,

29
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,193
at first,

30
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:41,892
I activate the resolution pushing control

31
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:45,288
and we can see something very thin which appears

32
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,340
and if I make it go down into the cross-section,

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,479
here I can see that I would only need,

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,005
for the width of 300 millimeters which I have indicated,

35
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:56,777
a steel thickness of approximately 13.5 millimeters.

36
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:01,253
We are going to be able to do something a bit more efficient,

37
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:04,360
probably decreasing the width:

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,386
instead of a width of 300 millimeters,

39
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:08,068
I put 100 millimeters.

40
00:02:08,953 --> 00:02:11,753
And then I restart the resolution,

41
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:16,005
we can indeed see a slightly larger thickness,

42
00:02:16,005 --> 00:02:18,783
and I can move the supports

43
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:24,170
in such a way that the internal forces remain inside the cross-section.

44
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,855
Here you go, we can see that I only need now

45
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,930
an upper flange with a width of 100 millimeters

46
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,539
and a thickness of approximately 41.5 millimeters.

47
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:36,967
So I could order a steel beam

48
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:41,330
asking for a 41 or 42 millimeters thick upper flange

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,962
and probably approximately the same thing for the lower flange.

50
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,430
That would absolutely be possible.

51
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,118
However, for steel shapes,

52
00:02:49,118 --> 00:02:52,285
cross-sections are standardized.

53
00:02:52,285 --> 00:02:56,049
Here, I show you a part of the Swiss table

54
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,648
but that is available almost everywhere in the world

55
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:00,925
for the double T cross-sections.

56
00:03:00,925 --> 00:03:02,401
There are many more,

57
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:05,087
in some countries, there are many more than in Switzerland,

58
00:03:05,087 --> 00:03:07,874
so it depends on the countries

59
00:03:07,874 --> 00:03:09,842
but what we can very clearly notice

60
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:11,790
is that there are nominal depths

61
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,208
which vary between one hundred and one thousand millimeters so up to one meter.

62
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,684
The profile I had before - 1.32 meters - that is not standard,

63
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:20,425
that is not going to be possible.

64
00:03:20,425 --> 00:03:22,487
And then we have three range of weigths:

65
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,684
HEA, HEB and HEM,

66
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,331
if we take one of 320,

67
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,297
you can see that the HEA weighs 97.6 kilos per meter,

68
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:31,802
the HEB 127 kilos

69
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,448
and the HEM 245 kilos

70
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:37,662
so a very big difference of weight for these different shapes.

71
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:40,266
We will see that it also changes their efficiency.

72
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,717
So, for the pre-dimensioning, we are going to have

73
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:49,157
at once a variation of the depth and of the thickness

74
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:52,313
and then we are going to use a special grid

75
00:03:52,313 --> 00:03:54,689
for the free dimensioning of beams.

76
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,515
If you start the i-Cremona applet,

77
00:03:57,515 --> 00:04:00,533
in the folder containing the common pictures, you will find at the beginning,

78
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,305
this picture which is called &quot;Abaque poutre&quot;.

79
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,576
I have activated it here,

80
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:09,530
I am now going to put the screen to scale,

81
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:13,219
I have a maximum distance of 15 000

82
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:18,142
between this point here, for example, and this point there,

83
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,995
so I put it to scale.

84
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,856
Then, I am going to insert my forces,

85
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:26,658
my forces have a value of 100 000 Newtons,

86
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,408
I stay here in Newtons and in millimeters,

87
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:31,971
which I always place in the middle of the interval,

88
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,407
that is why we have these intervals, here,

89
00:04:36,087 --> 00:04:40,268
so I have 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 forces.

90
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:44,640
The supports are going to be located at the level of zero

91
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,702
and of 10 000.

92
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:50,108
I place them a bit higher, as you can see,

93
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:57,066
to already take into account the position of the center of gravity of the lower flange

94
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:02,084
and afterwards, I define the properties of my material.

95
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:06,314
For example, here, a grade 355 steel

96
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:11,335
with a width of 300 millimeters,

97
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:15,199
which, you will see, is quite standard for what we want to do.

98
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:19,176
I activate the resolution pushing control,

99
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:23,416
and the depth, well, I am going to see,

100
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,879
I could for example, take here a cross-section

101
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,135
which is, let's say, 700 millimeters deep,

102
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:32,967
so I am going to have here a depth of approximately 700

103
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,910
and here, it is said to me that with 700,

104
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,252
I need to have a width of the upper flange... of both flanges,

105
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:44,644
of about 17 millimeters.

106
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:48,808
We are at the level of 700 millimeters, here

107
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:50,518
and we want a thickness,

108
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:54,404
the thickness can be read on T and we get roughly 17.

109
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:58,955
So here, it would work with the HEA 700, but it has 27,

110
00:05:58,955 --> 00:06:03,077
so the depth is probably too large.

111
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,660
I come back to my applet

112
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,106
and I am going to decrease this depth to, let's say, 600.

113
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:15,680
For 600 millimeters, I would need a width of 300

114
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,648
and a thickness of about 20 millimeters according to the applet.

115
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:23,072
I am now at 600 millimeters,

116
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:24,737
I need a width of 300,

117
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,801
we can see that the width 2c is 300,

118
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,763
that is constant over a large portion

119
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,055
so it is no coincidence that I have chosen this value

120
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,356
And then, we have a thickness of 25

121
00:06:33,356 --> 00:06:37,480
and, what has been asked to me was a thickness of 20,

122
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,100
so that is still too large.

123
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,500
We are going to move to a solution with a depth of 500 millimeters.

124
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,148
With 500 millimeters, I would need

125
00:06:52,148 --> 00:06:56,288
a thickness of approximately 25 millimeters.

126
00:06:57,529 --> 00:06:59,579
500 millimeters here,

127
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,473
I would need a thickness of 25

128
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:06,691
which does not work with the HEA,

129
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:09,048
so I can have a look at the HEB,

130
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:11,893
this would be a good solution.

131
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:18,648
This is the HEB 550 and it weighs 187 kilos per meter,

132
00:07:18,648 --> 00:07:26,613
compared to the HEA 600 which weighs 178 kilos per meter.

133
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,946
So, if we have a bit a space, we can easily use the HEA

134
00:07:29,946 --> 00:07:31,888
which makes us save some material.

135
00:07:31,888 --> 00:07:34,063
The question is, what happens -

136
00:07:34,063 --> 00:07:36,514
could we only have, for example,

137
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,965
a beam depth of 400 millimeters?

138
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:42,591
I come back here, I activate the funicular polygon and I try to go to 400 millimeters,

139
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,694
that is here and we start looking at the thickness, which is significant,

140
00:07:45,694 --> 00:07:48,493
I need a thickness of approximately 31 millimeters.

141
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:51,351
At the level of 400:

142
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:54,886
here, I have 19 millimeters, it is not going to fit,

143
00:07:54,886 --> 00:08:00,090
but however, here, it would work with a HEM 400

144
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,909
which however weighs 256 kilos

145
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,808
so much it is heavier than the previous value.

146
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:12,339
We could maybe choose a smaller HEM

147
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,495
but we can see that the weight remains almost constant.

148
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,321
What is interesting -

149
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:20,215
I am maybe going to take off the first solution I have put

150
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:22,647
because it was far too conservative.

151
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:26,661
We can have the orange solution with a HEA

152
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,218
which will be a HEA 600,

153
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:36,413
or the pink solution with a HEB 500,

154
00:08:39,723 --> 00:08:45,238
or else finally the blue solution with a HEM 400.

155
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:52,000
So, the process of dimensioning of a steel double T cross-section

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,830
consists in the choice of a cross-section according to its efficiency

157
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,360
and its weight.

158
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,426
Finally, we can also pre-dimension

159
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:03,382
a composite steel-concrete beam, like I showed you

160
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:06,053
in the lecture about the superimposed beams,

161
00:09:06,053 --> 00:09:08,832
so we have a steel beam in the lower part,

162
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:11,283
a system of connecting dowels

163
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:14,422
and then a concrete slab in the upper part.

164
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,612
Look, this is schematically drawn here,

165
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:18,310
obviously, what we do not know

166
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,251
is the width of this concrete slab

167
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,030
and also its thickness.

168
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,592
Here we have the applet which has already been put to scale,

169
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:29,180
in meters by the way

170
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,082
since we are going to work with concrete

171
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:33,496
and in which I have already inserted the forces.

172
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:36,107
So, we are now going to define these dimensions,

173
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:38,963
I am going to consider a strength for the concrete

174
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:41,482
of 20 megaNewtons per square meter

175
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:44,691
and a width of 0.8 meters like before,

176
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:46,984
like for the T cross-section

177
00:09:46,984 --> 00:09:50,275
and I am going to activate the resolution

178
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,497
with the funicular polygon

179
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:55,329
and here once again, like for the T cross-section,

180
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:58,688
what we can see is that we only need, for a width of 0.8 meters,

181
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:03,069
about 60 millimeters of compression

182
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,096
so actually this slab here could be thinner,

183
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,455
it corresponds well, by the way, to the principle of composite construction

184
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:12,727
in which we try to have relatively thin concrete slabs.

185
00:10:12,727 --> 00:10:15,761
The part in tension, that is interesting,

186
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,144
the tension is not only supported

187
00:10:18,144 --> 00:10:20,359
by the lower part in this case,

188
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,476
we can absolutely consider that

189
00:10:22,476 --> 00:10:26,568
the center of gravity of the lower part of the cross-section

190
00:10:26,568 --> 00:10:29,558
is where the internal forces are going to be supported

191
00:10:29,558 --> 00:10:32,889
so the dimensioning is a bit more complicated in this case here,

192
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:34,560
we are not going to get into the details

193
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,303
but these 1.25 megaNewtons can be carried

194
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,865
by a considerable amount of steel

195
00:10:39,865 --> 00:10:42,435
which is placed in the lower part of the cross-section.

196
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:46,061
In this video, we have seen how to proceed to the pre-dimensioning

197
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,964
of various types of beams

198
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,664
using the i-Cremona applet.

199
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:52,078
We have seen that it is very important to use

200
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:53,996
coherent working units,

201
00:10:53,996 --> 00:10:58,105
good units being megaNewton and meter for the concrete structures,

202
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,765
Newton and millimeter for the steel structures.

203
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:04,335
we have applied this dimensioning method

204
00:11:04,335 --> 00:11:06,193
to various types of cross-sections,

205
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:09,058
first to rectangular cross-sections for a concrete beam

206
00:11:09,058 --> 00:11:10,866
and then to T-shaped cross-sections

207
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:14,080
then to double T shapes for the steel cross-sections

208
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,241
as well as for a composite steel-concrete beam.

209
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:20,438
We have seen that the predimensioning can be done quite quickly,

210
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:23,025
I draw your attention on the fact that the final dimensioning

211
00:11:23,025 --> 00:11:26,653
will have to take into account other parameters

212
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:30,178
which are not dealt with within the framework of this introductory course.
