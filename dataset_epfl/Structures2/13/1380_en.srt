1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,722
Hello.

2
00:00:00,722 --> 00:00:02,965
In this video, we will see how to proceed

3
00:00:02,965 --> 00:00:06,203
with the pre-dimensioning of a beam using the i-Cremona applet.

4
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:09,804
You will see that it requires a more intense use of the applet

5
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,738
than what we have done so far.

6
00:00:11,738 --> 00:00:15,081
In particular, we will have to be careful with units.

7
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:18,548
We will have to specify the dimensions of the cross-section,

8
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:22,400
and the properties of materials, at least, of one material per beam,

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,896
and then we will see how we can choose the dimensions

10
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:31,053
of a cross-section on the basis of this pre-dimensioning.

11
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:34,188
So far, and in the rest of the course,

12
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:36,483
we did not have to worry about units.

13
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:40,458
That means that if you prefer to work in Newtons and millimeters,

14
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:44,043
you can, but you can also work in Newtons and centimeters,

15
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,032
in kiloNewtons and meters, and so forth.

16
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:48,892
For the applet, this is always possible,

17
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:53,838
but to avoid confusions, I recommend you 2 sets of units:

18
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:57,507
either a set with Newtons and millimeters,

19
00:00:57,507 --> 00:01:00,297
so the spans, if we have a 10 meters span,

20
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:02,176
we are actually going to have 10 000 millimeters,

21
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:05,098
if we have a load of 100 kiloNewtons, that is 100 000 Newtons,

22
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,533
a distributed load of 100 kiloNewtons per meter,

23
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,792
it becomes 100 Newtons per millimeter,

24
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:12,786
a strength of concrete of 20 Newtons per square millimeters,

25
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:15,296
or here, that is 500 Newtons per square millimeters,

26
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,444
that does not change.

27
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:20,396
So this, that is the setup for steel or concrete

28
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:31,481
beams, if you wish to work in millimeters in concrete,

29
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,900
there is no problem.

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,096
However, if you use other units,

31
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:39,419
well, conversions will be required since the loads, for example,

32
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:44,443
if you have them in kiloNewtons and the distances in millimeters,

33
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:48,015
so you should have the strength in kiloNewtons per square millimeter,

34
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:51,644
and this is a little problem.

35
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:54,660
Another solution is to use a unit which we have not seen that much:

36
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,094
the megaNewton,

37
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,775
one megaNewton is equal to 1000 kiloNewtons,

38
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,840
that is a million Newtons,

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,725
and the meter, that is a good unit for the concrete beams

40
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:11,545
with the applet.

41
00:02:15,945 --> 00:02:17,854
So we will have a span of 10 meters,

42
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:21,226
a load of 0.1 megaNewtons per meter,

43
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,060
that is equal to 100 kiloNewtons,

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,382
a concentrated load of 100 kiloNewtons becomes a load of 0.1 megaNewtons,

45
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:32,335
a load of 100 kiloNewtons per meter becomes a load of 0.1 megaNewtons per meter,

46
00:02:32,335 --> 00:02:35,499
and then the good news is that a Newton per square millimeter

47
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:37,876
is equal to a megaNewton per square meter,

48
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:42,052
because there is one million on each side, so we still have the same strength,

49
00:02:42,052 --> 00:02:45,952
which we know, of 20 megaNewtons per square meter or for steel,

50
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:50,074
of 500 megaNewtons per square meter.

51
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:52,298
Well, here is typically the kind of structures

52
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,484
with which we want to work.

53
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:57,737
That is a beam, we are going to give it dimensions,

54
00:02:57,737 --> 00:03:01,067
a span of 10 meters,

55
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:06,163
we then have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 loads,

56
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,202
placed at intervals of one meter,

57
00:03:08,202 --> 00:03:11,370
but you can see that we start at half a meter from the support,

58
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,327
in such a way that each time, each load is equal

59
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,564
and represents a width of 1 meter.

60
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:20,882
So here, we are going to say a load of 100 kiloNewtons,

61
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,765
so 100 kiloNewtons per meter,

62
00:03:23,765 --> 00:03:26,568
we are going to look for the width,

63
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,024
and also the effective depth,

64
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,797
we do not know compression and tension forces either,

65
00:03:30,797 --> 00:03:31,859
we are going to look for them.

66
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,710
What I decided is that the total depth of this beam

67
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,993
will be equal to 0.132 times the span,

68
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:43,319
which means that this depth here is 1.32 meters.

69
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,128
So the ratio between the span and the depth is equal to 1.32.

70
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,876
We now push the button to start the applet,

71
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:57,400
we are here in this applet,

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,959
we are going to work in megaNewtons and in meters.

73
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:02,764
The first thing to do is to define the geometry of the screen,

74
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:05,297
or the scale of the screen, clicking on this button here,

75
00:04:05,297 --> 00:04:06,728
which we have not used yet.

76
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:08,776
On the bottom, the distance between 2 points appears,

77
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:12,140
that is a standard value of 100, we want a value of 10,

78
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,099
so we put 10.

79
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:16,160
Afterwards, where do we have these 10 meters?

80
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,249
We have them between here and there.

81
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:23,209
Thus, I first click here, then I draw out the mouse

82
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:28,941
keeping this clear blue line till the end of the 10 meters here.

83
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:32,146
I release it, we do not see anything, but the screen has been scaled.

84
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,026
If you want, you can redo it several times,

85
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,832
if you have not done something proper,

86
00:04:37,832 --> 00:04:40,740
but it is not necessary to reach a very high precision,

87
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,669
because, one more time, that is a pre-dimensioning.

88
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,966
We now want to introduce the loads,

89
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:46,814
in megaNewtons,

90
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:50,087
by default it would be 100 kiloNewtons, but what we want,

91
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:54,641
is 0.1 megaNewtons.

92
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:57,128
And I insert these ten forces.

93
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:59,765
What matters is that the line of action is correct.

94
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:02,907
We can put them a bit higher, a bit lower.

95
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:14,133
Now, I insert the left support here, but I place it at the level

96
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:19,882
of the reinforcement bar, we will see later why this is important.

97
00:05:19,882 --> 00:05:23,588
And pressing control, I do the same thing with the right support

98
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,655
at the level of the reinforcement.

99
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,873
I can now start the funicular polygon,

100
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:32,805
and then I know that the entire compression

101
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:36,146
must remain inside the material, so the funicular polygon

102
00:05:36,146 --> 00:05:40,658
is going to pass somewhere around here with approximately 1.2 megaNewtons of compression.

103
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,430
Here I will have tension.

104
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,806
You now understand why I put the supports at this level here,

105
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:47,288
because at this level here,

106
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:51,235
the red tensile force exactly superimposes with the position

107
00:05:51,235 --> 00:05:53,314
I have indicated with the reinforcement bar.

108
00:05:53,314 --> 00:05:54,998
Otherwise, that would not have been the case,

109
00:05:54,998 --> 00:06:00,841
the consequence would be that the effective depth would be larger than in reality.

110
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:04,360
That is good but not sufficient.

111
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,990
We are going to deactivate this and we are going to use another button here,

112
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,236
that we have never used,

113
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,770
which enables us to define the geometry and the materials of our cross-section,

114
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,097
the strength, we have said that it is concrete

115
00:06:16,097 --> 00:06:18,182
with 20 megaNewtons per square meter,

116
00:06:18,182 --> 00:06:21,338
then afterwards, we need to provide the width of the beam.

117
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:25,283
We are going to start with a width of 0.3 meters.

118
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:30,519
We now want to activate the funicular polygon

119
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,783
for it to take into account this geometry.

120
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:36,270
We are going to deactivate this red force,

121
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,315
just for aesthetical reasons,

122
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,910
we are going to activate the geometry of the funicular polygon

123
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,368
pushing at the same time the control button.

124
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:49,194
Doing this, you can see that now the funicular polygon is shown

125
00:06:49,194 --> 00:06:51,035
with a thickness.

126
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:56,410
Here, it is said for example that we have 1.23 megaNewtons

127
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,359
and the dimensions of the compressed zone are 0.3 meters,

128
00:07:03,359 --> 00:07:05,763
this is the defined width, times 0.21.

129
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,560
Actually, we must remain inside the cross-section,

130
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,099
but we can go higher,

131
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:12,286
so we move this line here

132
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:17,009
till it exactly reaches the top of the concrete cross-section.

133
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:23,184
We can see that the compression decreased to 1.05 and that 0.3 times 0.17

134
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:29,724
is the dimension of the compressed zone somewhere here on the top of our cross-section.

135
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:32,901
So the variable that we have, these 30 centimeters,

136
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:34,811
we can see that it is largely enough actually.

137
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:38,459
We have a very good z, but we do not use the concrete which is in the middle,

138
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,231
so we are going to try another width,

139
00:07:42,991 --> 00:07:44,963
a bit more extreme.

140
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,855
I am going to put 0.1 meters.

141
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:52,505
So with 0.1 meters, we have to reactivate it,

142
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:55,201
and we can see that here, we get a very large thickness.

143
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:59,262
We are going to try, we will roughly manage to put it inside the cross-section,

144
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:05,307
then here, what we can is is that we have a thickness of 0.1 times 0.65,

145
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:09,562
that means a width of 0.65,

146
00:08:09,562 --> 00:08:18,114
that is more than half of the 1.32 meters of the depth of our cross-section,

147
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,421
and this is not allowed by the codes.

148
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,468
This value should be at least under 0.5,

149
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:26,160
and even a bit smaller, that would not be bad.

150
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,471
Moreover, we can see that the internal force is quite larger, 1.31 megaNewtons,

151
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:34,156
which we also have in tension here, so that would require quite

152
00:08:34,156 --> 00:08:35,770
a lot of reinforcement,

153
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,457
so we are going to choose an intermediate solution, with a width of 0.15 meters.

154
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:44,876
So here, we come back...

155
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:50,253
And here, we are clearly under the value of 0.5.

156
00:08:50,253 --> 00:08:56,473
We have an internal force which have decreased to approximately 1.15 megaNewtons,

157
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:59,412
and thus, that would be the solution.

158
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,208
Here, we know that we must have

159
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,204
a tensile internal force of 1.16 megaNewtons.

160
00:09:08,984 --> 00:09:14,760
We know that here, the compression is equal to 1.15 megaNewtons,

161
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,683
and the tension has approximately the same value.

162
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:25,119
1.15 megaNewtons, that is 1150 kiloNewtons,

163
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:29,190
so we can calculate the effective cross-section that we need saying:

164
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,391
that is 1150 times 10 power 3, to obtain Newtons,

165
00:09:34,391 --> 00:09:37,876
divided by the strength of 500.

166
00:09:40,656 --> 00:09:43,795
1150 times 10 power 3 divided by 500,

167
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:49,290
which gives us 2300 square millimters of steel.

168
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,639
How can we proceed to the dimensioning?

169
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,557
Well, we must now look at the reinforcement cross-sections

170
00:09:55,557 --> 00:09:59,277
which are available in Switzerland.

171
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,903
Actually, that is probably the same kind of diameters everywhere,

172
00:10:01,903 --> 00:10:07,457
here we have even diameters until 22 millimeters, every 2,

173
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:11,363
then after, it jumps to 26, 30, 34, 40.

174
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:14,210
The diameters are almost all easily available

175
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:16,343
until 26 millimeters.

176
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,439
Beyond, this is a bit more difficult to get.

177
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,275
And then if we have the number of bars,

178
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:23,503
and I remind you that we are looking for a solution to obtain

179
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:28,414
2300 square millimeters, looking at this table,

180
00:10:28,414 --> 00:10:32,205
we find for example here 2280, that is a bit smaller,

181
00:10:32,205 --> 00:10:38,052
or else here, with 2510 square millimeters,

182
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:42,360
that is 8 20 millimeters diameter bars.

183
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:51,074
So here, the reinforcement would be composed of 8 20 millimeters diameter bars.

184
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:53,605
That is here, 8 diamater 20.

185
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,415
We do not have much space

186
00:10:56,415 --> 00:11:01,038
since we have decided that the width of the beam would be 150 millimeters.

187
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:05,622
So probably, what we are going to do, is that we are going to place 4 below

188
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:09,562
and 4 above, the lever arm will be slightly reduced

189
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:15,315
as a consequence, and then we will need a bit more reinforcement.

190
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,795
But since 8 diameter 20 provides us a bit of strength reserve,

191
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:23,095
that is likely to be sufficient. Here I give you again the process

192
00:11:23,095 --> 00:11:25,610
to pre-dimension a beam.

193
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,469
That is particular for a rectangular concrete beam,

194
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:31,135
but it is going to work for a lot of other beams.

195
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,867
So the first thing, which is very important,

196
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:37,293
is to define the scale of the screen.

197
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:44,982
Afterwards, we are going to specify the forces,

198
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:49,335
being careful to the units.

199
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:57,831
Then we will introduce the supports.

200
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:01,308
We are going to activate the resolution of the funicular polygon

201
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:06,640
using the control button on the keyboard

202
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,077
until we get a satisfactory combination.

203
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,389
A very elegant solution is to have a beam

204
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,354
whose the cross-section is optimized, very wide at the top, narrower at the bottom,

205
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:22,221
but sufficiently wide however to be able to place the reinforcement.

206
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:25,679
You have seen that before, we were a bit cramped with the reinforcement,

207
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,885
if we put a small foot like this one, it gives us more space

208
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:32,635
to place the reinforcement, and then here, on the top, we will have a larger width.

209
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:37,608
Here in the applet, I have already defined the scale of the screen, the loads, etc.

210
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:41,493
What I am going to do is to define the material.

211
00:12:41,493 --> 00:12:44,704
Well, that is still concrete with 20 megaNewtons per square meter,

212
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:51,053
and then its width, let's say the spacing between these beams is 0.8 meters,

213
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:54,592
so the width here on the top is 0.8 meters,

214
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:58,304
I define this, and then I activate the funicular polygon

215
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:04,112
pushing control and I can see that the effect of this larger width

216
00:13:04,112 --> 00:13:08,032
is very significant since I obtain at once a smaller internal force,

217
00:13:08,032 --> 00:13:15,010
only of approximately one megaNewton, because the effective depth is larger,

218
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,249
and on the other hand, this compressed zone is very small since it is only

219
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:24,185
60 millimters deep, 0.06 meters, that is 60 millimeters.

220
00:13:24,185 --> 00:13:28,504
So I could make this zone here very small.

221
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:31,933
Actually, for constructive reasons, we are going to make it thicker,

222
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,307
maybe around 15 centimeters wide,

223
00:13:34,307 --> 00:13:37,163
but it would be possible to make it smaller.

224
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:41,462
What we can see is that this shape enables to be doubly efficient.

225
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:46,886
Concrete is going to be very little compressed and the internal force in steel is going to decrease.

226
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:49,051
Here, to fill this table,

227
00:13:49,051 --> 00:13:52,110
I am going to let you do it yourself,

228
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,007
but we would very likely have slightly less reinforcement

229
00:13:56,007 --> 00:14:00,893
with this solution and a solution which is absolutely feasible

230
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,663
with reinforced concrete.
