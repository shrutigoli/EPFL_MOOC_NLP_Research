1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,860
Hello, in this video, we are going to look at bending,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,330
which is the resistance mode of beams, then we are going to look at how

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,520
this mode works to obtain, for a given beam,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,420
its maximal bending strength.

5
00:00:15,686 --> 00:00:20,966
We are going to start here by a reminder about the effect of compression, first,

6
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:25,646
then, of tension, on a rubber foam element.

7
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:30,696
We have seen this together during the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

8
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:38,636
The effect, when we have a known initial length of this element,

9
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:46,707
we are going to call it L. If we subject it to a compression,

10
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,955
- of course, there will be compression on the other side,

11
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,875
but I don's take time to draw it-

12
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:59,088
what is going to happen is that its length is going to decrease.

13
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:00,991
- we have seen it in this video -

14
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:11,380
So we are going to have here a delta l and here the length will be L minus this delta L.

15
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,310
That is the effet of compression.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,380
In a similar way, if we subject it to tension, the element is goign to lengthen

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,140
of a value delta L.

18
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:30,235
The element now has a length L plus delta L.

19
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:33,951
Delta L, we can read it here, that is the lengthening

20
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:37,827
induced by the tensile internal force.

21
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:45,435
Here on the right, I write the properties of a tie in tension, as a reminder.

22
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:53,626
So a stress-strain diagram. We have a linear part

23
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:58,586
whose the slope is equal to the modulus of elasticity of the material.

24
00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:05,836
Then we are going to reach a certain value of design strength fd

25
00:02:06,496 --> 00:02:11,156
before going into a larger lengthening, and finally failure.

26
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:14,616
- that will not really interest us within the framework of this course -

27
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:19,516
If we have, making a diagram, force-lengthening,

28
00:02:19,516 --> 00:02:23,256
- what we have observed on the rubber foam element -

29
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:27,226
the shape would be very similar: the slope of this diagram is now

30
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:33,536
equal to the stiffness of the cross-section which is the modulus of elasticity times the cross-section.

31
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:40,906
Then the maximum strength will here be equal to A times the strength of the material.

32
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:43,416
We could have done the same thing for the compression,

33
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,956
but that will be enough for a reminder.

34
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,078
In this video, we can see how, by first applying a concentrated load

35
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:57,178
in the middle of this rubber beam, it bends, it curves.

36
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:01,078
I can obtain a similar effect taking the beam in my hands,

37
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:04,598
and making it rotate to curve it.

38
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:07,518
This phenomenon is called bending.

39
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,780
If we take a closer look, bending a bit less the beam,

40
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,260
what happens, we have an element which was initially rectilinear

41
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,810
with lines perpendicular to the axis.

42
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:28,737
Then, when I have rotated it, when I have make this beam bend,

43
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:34,309
these elements have remained perpendicular to the axis, but they have rotated.

44
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,456
What has happened?

45
00:03:37,456 --> 00:03:43,466
The upper part of our beam shortens.

46
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,620
Everywhere: on the left, on the right and in the middle.

47
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:57,356
So what it means is that we have here,

48
00:03:57,356 --> 00:04:04,016
acting in the upper part, everywhere above this axis,

49
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:07,006
we have compression.

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,880
Conversely, if we look at the lower part,

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,305
we can see that here, we have, on the left and on the right,

52
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,710
we have a lengthening.

53
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:30,675
So, in this part here, we have tension.

54
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:34,567
This, it is new: we have never seen till now

55
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:40,077
simultaneously tension and compression on the same element.

56
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,359
Then, obviously, in the middle there is a part which is a bit Swiss,

57
00:04:44,359 --> 00:04:48,379
which is neutral, on which nothing happens.

58
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,399
There is neither lengthening, nor shortening

59
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,605
- I draw it in green -

60
00:04:53,605 --> 00:04:57,185
Here, that is what we call the neutral axis.

61
00:04:57,185 --> 00:05:01,855
At the level of the neutral axis, there is neither lengthening, nor shortening.

62
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:05,535
On this basis, let's look at how we can obtain

63
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:09,595
the maximal strength of a beam with a rectangular cross-section.

64
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,975
For this, we are going to make act on this beam

65
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:24,105
two loads QRd which correspond to the maximal design load.

66
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:37,143
Obviously, both reactions are equal on the left and on the right to QRd.

67
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:41,937
If that is the maximal load, what is going to happen,

68
00:05:41,937 --> 00:05:46,507
is that half of the cross-section, the upper half of the cross-section,

69
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,264
is going to be subjected to only compression over the whole depth.

70
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:59,504
And then, the lower half is also going to be subjected to tension

71
00:05:59,504 --> 00:06:01,544
over half of the depth.

72
00:06:01,544 --> 00:06:04,954
As a consequence, we will have,

73
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:07,874
for the indicated arch-cable,

74
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:12,764
we will have tension with a well defined geometrical position,

75
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:14,974
like we are going to see it in one minute.

76
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:21,904
Here I draw the corresponding arch, which also has a well defined position.

77
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:32,413
And if we look at the cross-section, half of the cross-section is entirely in compression,

78
00:06:32,413 --> 00:06:37,043
the other half is entirely in tension.

79
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,603
What does it means?

80
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:42,913
If there is half of the cross-section, that means that this distance here

81
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:49,583
must ncessarily be equal to h over four, on the top and on the bottom.

82
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,320
This, it does not particularly interests us.

83
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,685
What interests us is to know what there is between both.

84
00:06:57,685 --> 00:07:02,765
That is z which is thus equal to h over two.

85
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:05,651
Here we have a cross-section - I should have indicated it -

86
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,127
which has a depth h,

87
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:11,425
and then a width t, we are going to use it in a few moments.

88
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,899
These loads act at a distance a of the support, on the left and on the right

89
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:26,399
and we can solve this system using for example a free-body

90
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:28,579
around the left support.

91
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:39,432
This free-body is subjected to the reaction force QRd.

92
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:41,458
- it acts upwards -

93
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:48,538
Then, to a tensile internal force - I am going to call it again N,

94
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:56,668
like in the previous videos - and to a compressive internal force in the diagonal.

95
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:07,198
What is the value of N? Well, I can look at it. I have half of the cross-section.

96
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:13,078
So the center of gravity of N is going to be located here, in the red part.

97
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:22,348
N in tension will be equal to t times h over two times the

98
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:26,198
design strength of my material fd.

99
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:31,198
Now, I want to link all these properties together.

100
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:38,588
I can observe that we have again a similar triangle between this equilibrium

101
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:47,018
of the node on the left support, and then here, this part of our arch-cable.

102
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,585
What we can say is that:

103
00:08:50,585 --> 00:09:00,255
QRd divided by N is like h over two, that is to say z divided by a.

104
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:11,412
So, QRd is equal to h over two times a times N.

105
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:18,515
Now, we just saw what is the value of N,

106
00:09:18,515 --> 00:09:23,878
we can write that it is equal to

107
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:29,242
h over two a times the value that we have taken here for N, times t times h over two times fd.

108
00:09:31,432 --> 00:09:39,442
And then finally, QRd is equal to h squared divided by four,

109
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:43,802
times t divided by a, times fd.

110
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:50,424
This formula which we just derived, is actually based on a distribution

111
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:55,894
of the stresses over the depth of the cross-section, and thus, over the entire upper

112
00:09:55,894 --> 00:10:00,104
part, we have equal compressive stresses which have a value of fd,

113
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:04,826
and over the entire lower part, we have equal

114
00:10:04,826 --> 00:10:08,826
tensiles stresses which have a value of fd.

115
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:14,245
This is what we call a plastic distribution of the stresses.

116
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,825
That is linked to the plasticity of the material.

117
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,645
If we really go to the limit, that is what is going to happen and then

118
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:37,625
we will obtain QRd is equal to h square over four times t over a, times fd.

119
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:41,625
This is the formula which I would like you to remember

120
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,735
for this part of the course.

121
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:49,375
But that is true that, maybe the best observers among you told themselves

122
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:54,641
&quot;Oui but be careful, here, actually, I have a maximum

123
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:57,457
epsilon, but afterwards, it is going to decrease,

124
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,965
near the neutral axis, it is going to be very small.&quot;

125
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:03,995
Indeed, that is something which would be closer to reality.

126
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:08,085
At least, when we are at lower levels of load, it corresponds

127
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:17,305
to what we call an elastic distribution of stresses.

128
00:11:21,565 --> 00:11:24,415
So, again, on the top, we have fd.

129
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:29,861
Afterwards, we have smaller values which keep decreasing.

130
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:32,641
And then, from the axis, from the top to the bottom,

131
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,761
we have again values which increase till fd.

132
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,561
The ones among you which will study in an analytical way

133
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:43,771
the strength of materials, you will see both these distributions, and you will see that

134
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:47,471
the formula for the strength, if we are based upon something elastic,

135
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:51,111
it is very similar, with only one difference: it is going to be

136
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:55,471
h square over six times t over a, times fd.

137
00:11:56,734 --> 00:12:00,584
We now want to see the influence of the cross-section on the strength.

138
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:04,120
So I write again this formula which we just determined:

139
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,256
QRd is equal to h square divided by four

140
00:12:08,256 --> 00:12:13,244
times t divided by a, times the strength of the material fd.

141
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:16,227
We have various cross-sections, here a cross-section with

142
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,430
a depth h and a width t.

143
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,394
Here, still a depth h, but a width of two t.

144
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:27,434
Here a depth of two h and a width of t, and here on the right,

145
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:31,744
a depth of two h, but in two elements, and a width t.

146
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:36,114
Let's now look at what happens for the distribution of stresses.

147
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:39,237
We are going to have in the cross-section on the far-left,

148
00:12:39,237 --> 00:12:42,260
the upper part which is going to be in compression,

149
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:49,624
the lower part which is going to be in tension. And then the effective depth z,

150
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:54,164
between the centers of gravity of tension and compression,

151
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,624
is equal to h over two.

152
00:12:58,428 --> 00:13:02,548
I am going to take this cross-section as reference, and I am thus going to say:

153
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,878
this, it is one time the strength.

154
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,968
The second cross-section, I put much more material,

155
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:13,438
it is twice wider, but it has the same depth.

156
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:24,882
So the lever arm z is still going to be equal to h over two.

157
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:30,299
And if I look at the formula, I now have t which passed to two t,

158
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,989
so I have twice more strength.

159
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,509
In some ways, that is logical,

160
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,369
I put twice more material, I have twice more strength.

161
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,769
Let's now look at what happens if we put twice more material,

162
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:47,119
but a bit differently: we put it on the depth, here I have compression

163
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:55,599
over a depth h, and afterwards tension on the lower part.

164
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:06,677
Now, the distance between both centers of gravity z is equal to h.

165
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,607
Before, it was equal to h over two.

166
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:13,377
If I look at the formula, t does not change, but h is replaced

167
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:18,777
by h squared, and now, this cross-section has four times more strength.

168
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:21,407
That is interesting, I have put twice more material,

169
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,527
and I obtain four times the strength, because I have created not a wider

170
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:28,257
cross-section, like in the case B, but a deeper cross-section.

171
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:31,470
So it means that a deeper beam is more efficient

172
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,143
than a wider beam.

173
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:37,316
Now, it could happen that we are in situation in which we have

174
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:40,576
two beams which we want to place on top of each other.

175
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:42,236
So what is going to happen?

176
00:14:42,236 --> 00:14:45,486
Here, if I have two beams which are one on top of each other, actually,

177
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:53,566
I will have compressieon in the upper part of the beam, and tension

178
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,426
in the lower part of each of the beams.

179
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:08,170
Actually, each of the beams will have an effective depth z equal to h over two.

180
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,570
The consequence of this is that we are going to have twice the strength,

181
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,440
while we have the same depth than in the solution C, but because

182
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,250
we have put two beams which are not linked between each other,

183
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,180
we do not have this advantage to be able

184
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,380
to consider the entire depth at once.

185
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,920
In this lecture about bending, we have seen that bending

186
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,620
is the combination, in a same cross-section, of tension and compression.

187
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:40,766
We have seen how to determine the strength of a rectangular beam,

188
00:15:40,766 --> 00:15:43,666
on the basis of hypothesese about the strength of the material,

189
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:48,296
such as we already know them since &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

190
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:51,796
And then we have finally seen that the shape of the cross-section

191
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:55,436
has a certain importance, since certain combinations of shapes

192
00:15:55,436 --> 00:16:00,686
can bring us advantages with a constant amount of material.
