00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:02,290
Hello, in this lecture,

2
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,090
we are going to talk about superimposed beams.

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:08,252
Actually, we have already partially dealt with this topic

4
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:09,741
during the last lecture,

5
00:00:09,741 --> 00:00:13,527
and I have told you that when we placed two beams on top of each other,

6
00:00:13,527 --> 00:00:15,703
actually, it had not the same effect at all

7
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:18,056
than when we had a beam with a double depth.

8
00:00:18,056 --> 00:00:19,556
We are going to revisit this subject,

9
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:21,478
to understand a bit what happens,

10
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:24,869
especially sliding between two superimposed beams,

11
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,311
which is really the cause of the problem I told you about,

12
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:31,940
then we will look at solutions to prevent this sliding,

13
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:36,006
and thus to improve the performance of superimposed beams.

14
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:41,442
So there is first a beam on the bottom with a depth h,

15
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:46,260
which is subjected to two loads Q

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,797
which are at the first and of third quarter points

17
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:52,986
of the beam.

18
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:57,530
Then, we have two beams of depth h,

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,916
they are the two superimposed beams of the last time,

20
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,884
I have just spreaded them a bit,

21
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:05,350
to be able to see a bit better what happens,

22
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,579
then we finally have a beam which has a depth h.

23
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:14,235
On the right, we can see the result of a calculation

24
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:16,583
made with a calculation program for engineer,

25
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:19,270
regardless how we have actually calculated it,

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,886
but we can see the results.

27
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:26,349
What is interesting is to notice the amplitude difference.

28
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:29,028
I can measure here,

29
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:33,837
the maximum deflection of the lower beam, with a depth h,

30
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:36,882
for me it is roughly equal to 20 millimeters, 

31
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:41,530
while the maximum deflection of the upper beam

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,189
is significantly smaller since it is approximately equal to 3 millimeters.

33
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,530
Yes, we have seen that the stiffness,

34
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,380
we have seen in the previous lecture,

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,107
that if we have a stiffness which is equal to one here,

36
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,599
the stiffness will be equal to 8 here,

37
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,632
so it means that the deformation will be 8 times smaller.

38
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:07,585
In a non-surprising way,

39
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:13,785
here, we have a vertical deflection which will be equal to one half,

40
00:02:13,785 --> 00:02:15,639
that is to say, we approximately had 20 mm,

41
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,486
we roughly have 10 milimeters measured here.

42
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:22,579
Obviously, these deformations are not the ones we will have in reality,

43
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,956
they have been exaggerated by the calculation software,

44
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:27,718
otherwise we would not see anything.

45
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,418
It is interesting to notice

46
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:35,236
what happens in the zone where we have the two beams,

47
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,620
because if we take a point

48
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:44,397
which was maybe initially just in the lower part of the upper

49
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:47,232
beam, under the beam,

50
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:50,633
then another point which was at the same place,

51
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:54,699
but in the upper part of the lower beam,

52
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:59,843
so what we can see is that these points tend to move away from one another.

53
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:05,855
This point here moves in this direction,

54
00:03:05,855 --> 00:03:10,161
while this one moves in this direction.

55
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:13,663
That is very clear I think, we can see at the ends of the beams,

56
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:17,049
where there is really a relative displacement

57
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:21,183
between the top of the lower beam,

58
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,330
and the bottom of the upper beam.

59
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:25,789
That is what we call sliding.

60
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:30,345
Here, I have replaced these things together,

61
00:03:30,345 --> 00:03:33,095
you remember what we have seen the last time,

62
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:35,081
when we have a monolithic beam,

63
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:40,391
we have compressive stresses in the upper part,

64
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:44,489
tensile stresses in the lower part,

65
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,069
while when we have two superimposed beams,

66
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,191
in the upper part of each of the beams,

67
00:03:50,191 --> 00:03:52,615
there will be compression,

68
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,706
and then in the lower part, there will be tension.

69
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:07,198
And then, along this interface here,

70
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:10,737
we will have a sliding, this part slides in this way,

71
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:13,171
this part slides in the other way,

72
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:15,062
it is also true here.

73
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:22,786
And then in the other direction, the same thing.

74
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:27,360
That is what we call sliding.

75
00:04:31,928 --> 00:04:34,371
And twe can first notice

76
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:38,642
on the basis of this observation, it is clear,

77
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:50,722
that reinforcements will be difficult.

78
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,840
Imagine that you have, for example, in a building,

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,738
a beam which would be, for example, the upper beam,

80
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,830
which tends to deform too much,

81
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,296
and perhaps cannot carry enough loads,

82
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:09,393
and at this moment, we consider how to reinforce it

83
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,522
by placing a second beam underneath.

84
00:05:11,522 --> 00:05:15,149
At this moment, they are not going to be linked, they are going to slide on top of one another,

85
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:18,563
and thus, instead of having eight times less deformations,

86
00:05:18,563 --> 00:05:20,789
there will be much more.

87
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,229
You can notice that here the ratio 8 is not represented

88
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,172
because we wanted to have something

89
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,669
from which we could see the rotation of both beams.

90
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:33,176
We can try to fight against sliding,

91
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:40,404
that is what we do here, in the example of a composite steel-concrete beam.

92
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:45,183
What have we done?

93
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:47,757
On the metallic beam, you can see on the left,

94
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:52,967
we add these elements which are welded here on the bottom,

95
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:57,062
or fixed in a very strong way, but generally, that is welded,

96
00:05:57,062 --> 00:06:00,900
these elements, we call them dowels.

97
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,346
These dowels have the function of limiting sliding

98
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:07,591
which can occur between the steel part,

99
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:09,013
we are going to say the first beam,

100
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,847
and the concrete part, the second beam,

101
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:14,057
which we just cast on it in a second phase.

102
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,939
This is an efficient solution.

103
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:18,891
We will soon see an example

104
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:22,006
about how to pre-dimension such a composite beam.

105
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,392
Another solution, which is also an interesting,

106
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:28,075
I show it here, in this video,

107
00:06:28,075 --> 00:06:31,744
where we can clearly see that the beam which I hold in front of me,

108
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:35,305
is constituted of a certain number of elements

109
00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:38,165
which are superimposed on top of one another.

110
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,722
So, in principle, it should not work well,

111
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:45,144
but afterwards, these timber strips are glued together,

112
00:06:45,144 --> 00:06:49,897
in a system which works at high pressure

113
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,953
and at a quite high temperature.

114
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:57,459
As a result, sliding at the interface between these elements

115
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,239
is not possible anymore.

116
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:03,687
Here, we can see these various elements in more details,

117
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:08,349
so we can see here a timber element, a strip

118
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:10,906
which is separated by these two yellow lines,

119
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,456
and here another strip, and so forth.

120
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:17,243
The interest of these strips

121
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:21,616
is that we can make them from relatively young trees,

122
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:26,629
here, we can see the annual growth rings.

123
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:31,268
Here, that is a tree which is maybe a couple decades old,

124
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,560
but which is not particularly old,

125
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,607
and which will enable, being combined with other trees,

126
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:41,818
here, I am going to draw the rings for the lower strip.

127
00:07:41,818 --> 00:07:45,277
So using relatively young trees,

128
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:48,019
and glueing them together, we can obtain beams

129
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,869
with sizable dimensions, like the one I have in front of me.

130
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,488
This solution thus enables us

131
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:58,138
to create beams with quite large dimensions,

132
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:01,217
here, I indicate the dimensions,

133
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,573
and also with quite free dimensions,

134
00:08:03,573 --> 00:08:08,900
you can see here, a beam which has been created has a variable depth,

135
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,991
it is deeper in the part which is far from us,

136
00:08:12,991 --> 00:08:17,317
and shallower in the part which is close to us.

137
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:21,357
This has been made with a material which is just

138
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:26,877
initially a juxtaposition of strips on top of each other.

139
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,114
If we look at all the beams here,

140
00:08:30,114 --> 00:08:32,613
it is maybe a bit more than one meter deep,

141
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:36,349
if we had to extract this beam from a tree,

142
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,408
this tree should be hundreds of years old.

143
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:42,177
There are not a lot of these trees in nature.

144
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:46,504
Here, composing this cross-section with strips, we have the chance

145
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:51,553
to dispose of almost infinite dimensions of timber,

146
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:55,833
and then it has enabled a very rational use of young timber,

147
00:08:55,833 --> 00:09:00,543
and the availability of timber beams with very large dimensions.

148
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:06,041
In this lecture, we have revisited the principle of superimposition of beams,

149
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,909
explaining why sliding is what prevents

150
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:13,706
two superimposed beams to be really efficient.

151
00:09:13,706 --> 00:09:17,687
We have looked at two methods to prevent sliding,

152
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:20,735
a method with dowels,

153
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:24,798
this is the solution which is used for the composite steel-concrete structures,

154
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,184
or else, the other method, that is a gluing system,

155
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,330
in the case of glued-laminated timber

156
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,888
which enables us to obtain beams with quite large cross-sections,

157
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:38,757
made from relatively young trees.
