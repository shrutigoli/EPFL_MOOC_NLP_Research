00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:02,578
Hello. In this video,

2
00:00:02,578 --> 00:00:04,679
we will look at the maximum internal forces

3
00:00:04,679 --> 00:00:07,501
which act in a beam or in a cantilver.

4
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:12,182
To do so, we are going to establish together a table

5
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:16,065
which links the main parameters of each of these structures

6
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:20,071
to the maximum internal forces which act in.

7
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:23,883
We will look at concentrated loads,

8
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:26,695
and also at uniformly distributed loads.

9
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:31,747
We are going to work on simple beams on the one hand,

10
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:36,849
with a fixed support on one side and a mobile support on the other side.

11
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:44,355
What we are interested in is the span, which is the distance between both supports,

12
00:00:45,095 --> 00:00:47,580
which we will call L, as usual.

13
00:00:52,594 --> 00:01:00,662
And then on this beam, in the middle, we are going to place a concentrated load

14
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:09,569
Q, expressed in kiloNewtons;

15
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:13,249
or else a uniformly distributed load

16
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:25,415
over all the length of the span,

17
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:37,624
and this load, we will call it q, in kiloNewtons per meter.

18
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:41,859
We will also look at cantilevers.

19
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:48,270
Cantilevers are supported by a clamping on one side.

20
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,261
Their span is the distance between the clamping

21
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:58,408
and the end of the cantilever.

22
00:02:00,029 --> 00:02:05,680
And here again, we will have a load Q in kiloNewtons,

23
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:15,239
or else a uniformly distributed load q in kiloNewtons per meter.

24
00:02:23,272 --> 00:02:28,314
We are now going to establish a table

25
00:02:30,694 --> 00:02:38,690
which is going to link the loads Q or q

26
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:48,083
to the maximum tensile internal force of our structure.

27
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,449
And we have already seen that the maximum compressive internal force

28
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,613
is going to be similar to the maximum tensile internal force.

29
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:58,947
Our parameters are then first the static system

30
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:09,970
with a simple beam, here;

31
00:03:11,677 --> 00:03:13,510
or else a cantilever.

32
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:22,568
We will gradually fill the different parts

33
00:03:22,568 --> 00:03:24,043
of this table.

34
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,043
We will have the type of load as a parameter;

35
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,738
either a concentrated load, either a uniformly distributed load.

36
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:39,581
The span is obviously an important parameter,

37
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:46,062
such as the effective depth of the beam, named z.

38
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:54,334
An important note to be able to do comparisons:

39
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,954
we are going to admit, each time, that Q

40
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:08,937
is equal to the uniformly distributed load times the span, both in kiloNewtons,

41
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:11,644
so we will be able to compare the effect of a given load,

42
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,389
whether it be concentrated or distributed,

43
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,344
on the internal forces in each configuration.

44
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:22,413
Let's start with the first case, the simplest one.

45
00:04:22,413 --> 00:04:25,928
That is a simple beam with a concentrated load.

46
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:32,500
We can solve this inscribing an arch-cable,

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,607
that is the simplest solution of the truss,

48
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:44,583
an arch-cable with compression in these inclined elements,

49
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:50,047
and tension in the lower cable.

50
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:58,199
We can solve the internal forces in this structure

51
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:00,796
looking at, for example here, the right support.

52
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:04,544
I draw your attention on the fact that

53
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:07,370
the depth which we have given to our arch-cable,

54
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,336
is not the depth of the beam, but the depth z which is the effective depth

55
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:14,732
so there is enough space for all the stresses

56
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,689
to remain inside the cross-section of the beam.

57
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:25,179
We come here on the right: our free-body is subjected

58
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:29,797
to the right support reaction, which is simply the half of Q;

59
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:34,839
and then turning counterclockwise,

60
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:38,935
we are first going to meet the inclined compression,

61
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:48,214
and then the tension in the cable.

62
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,825
We are going to call it N, like in this figure on the left,

63
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:03,468
because we are going to do some interesting operations

64
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,578
with this element, now.

65
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:15,104
If we compare this triangle here and this triangle

66
00:06:15,104 --> 00:06:19,739
in the Cremona diagram, this polygon of forces,

67
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:23,734
we have constructed it by drawing parallels,

68
00:06:23,734 --> 00:06:29,458
obviously the support reaction is parallel to the vertical applied force,

69
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:37,008
this blue part is parallel to the inclination of the arch,

70
00:06:37,068 --> 00:06:39,070
and then this, it is obviously parallel.

71
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,690
So both these triangles are similar triangles.

72
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:53,826
We are going to use the properties of similar triangles

73
00:06:53,826 --> 00:06:56,653
to derive formulae which are going to link

74
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:59,866
what we have in the diagram of the real structure

75
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,755
to what we have in the Cremona diagram.

76
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,899
If we look at these two catheti of the triangle in the Cremona diagram

77
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:18,770
we know that Q over 2N must be equal to z divided by L over 2.

78
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:29,076
From this, we can directly obtain N which is equal to

79
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:35,588
Q times L over 2 divided by 2 z

80
00:07:36,318 --> 00:07:40,171
or, to write the complete formula, we are going to write it here

81
00:07:40,171 --> 00:07:46,324
Q times L over 4 z,

82
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:49,369
that is the maximum tensile internal force.

83
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:58,146
I am going to surround these formulae each time for us to remember them well,

84
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:04,345
and then I am directly going to copy these formulae on the previous page.

85
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,590
So we are going to get the first solution here:

86
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:15,823
N equal to Q times L over 4 z.

87
00:08:16,374 --> 00:08:18,584
We now move to the solution

88
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,576
for a simple beam with an uniformly distributed load.

89
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,306
What we have seen a long time before already in &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;,

90
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:30,849
is that this curve here is a second order parabola,

91
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:33,105
and therefore the tangent, either at the beginning,

92
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,828
either, in our case, at the end of this parabola,

93
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:44,271
is equal to a straight line which is twice steeper than the maximum depth

94
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:47,142
of our parabola which is equal to z.

95
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,948
We then solve one more time

96
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:58,863
the free-body around the right support.

97
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:03,974
This free-body is subjected to the right support reaction,

98
00:09:03,974 --> 00:09:09,498
which is equal to q times L, that is the total load, divided by two.

99
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:17,542
And then, I have forgotten before to draw the compression and the tension.

100
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,655
I do it quickly now.

101
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:24,215
Here we have the compression in the arch,

102
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:28,853
and the tension in the lower cable.

103
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:34,271
So in our Cremona diagram, we have the support reaction q L over 2,

104
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:44,103
then we have the compression in the bar on the far right of the arch,

105
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:51,642
then we have the tensile internal force N to close the polygon of forces.

106
00:09:56,139 --> 00:10:00,094
We have here again similar triangles.

107
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,762
This triangle in the real structure,

108
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:09,208
and this triangle in the Cremona diagram.

109
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:14,909
This enables us to write the relation:

110
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:20,897
again, q L over 2N, this is in the Cremona diagram,

111
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:26,935
is equal to 2 times z divided by L over 2.

112
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:33,572
That enables us to directly obtain here

113
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:39,459
that N is equal to q times L squared over 8 z.

114
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,966
Again, an important formula, which is a result for us.

115
00:10:51,664 --> 00:10:56,856
So with a uniformly distributed load we have, for a simple beam,

116
00:10:56,856 --> 00:11:03,953
N equal to q times L squared divided by 8 z.

117
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,518
We now want to look at the cantilever with a concentrated load.

118
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:13,569
In this cantilever, we are going to have compression here on the bottom

119
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,952
and then tension on the top.

120
00:11:22,547 --> 00:11:25,422
We are going to consider a free-body like this,

121
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:30,801
which includes the whole structure with the load at its end.

122
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:35,444
So this free-body is subjected

123
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:40,930
to the load Q, which acts downwards.

124
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,950
Then, turning counterclockwise,

125
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,041
we manage to obtain the internal force N in the upper chord.

126
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:03,678
Then, the compression in the diagonal.

127
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:15,232
Again, we can recognize similar triangles,

128
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,773
well they are not placed in the same direction,

129
00:12:17,773 --> 00:12:20,634
but we built them with parallels,

130
00:12:20,634 --> 00:12:24,650
so they remain similar triangles.

131
00:12:25,392 --> 00:12:29,051
So we have here this big triangle in the Cremona diagram,

132
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:33,243
and then a smaller triangle in the structure.

133
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:45,314
And we directly manage to obtain that Q over N is equal to z over L.

134
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:51,940
That means that N = Q·L/z.

135
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:00,840
I am going to copy this result on our table,

136
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,291
for a cantilever with a point load,

137
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:08,942
N = Q·L/z.

138
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:12,345
We are going to look at the last case for this video.

139
00:13:12,345 --> 00:13:15,407
That is a cantilever with a uniformly distributed load,

140
00:13:15,407 --> 00:13:19,768
so we have a compression on the bottom which has a parabolic shape,

141
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:22,552
a tension on the top,

142
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:31,618
and then we are again going to look at

143
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:36,031
a free-body which includes all the loads,

144
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:38,789
so all the length of the beam,

145
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,450
cutting near the supports.

146
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:46,896
And near the supports, we will have again the same property:

147
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:56,587
we have a tangent which is steeper than the shape of the curve.

148
00:13:56,587 --> 00:14:03,141
That is to say that this tangent intercepts the horizontal at a distance L / 2

149
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,904
from the support, just here where the load is applied.

150
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,007
This, that is the geometry that says it to us.

151
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:13,527
Now, let's come back to the graphical construction.

152
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:18,529
This free-body is subjected to the load

153
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,584
q times L which acts on the whole cantilever.

154
00:14:24,273 --> 00:14:32,648
Then a horizontal tensile internal force which I call N,

155
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:39,533
then an inclined compression which I call C.

156
00:14:52,218 --> 00:15:00,924
This triangle here is similar, by construction, to the this triangle here.

157
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:13,086
So we have q times L over N is equal to z over L divided by 2.

158
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:22,157
So we obtain that N is equal to q L squared over 2 z.

159
00:15:33,795 --> 00:15:37,726
We insert this last result in our table.

160
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:42,023
So for a cantilever with an uniformly distributed load,

161
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:47,449
N is equal to q L squared over 2 z.

162
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,167
We now want to look at what happens if there is a changing.

163
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:58,940
Let's first look at the first changing, which is maybe the most obvious.

164
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:03,117
What happens if, instead of having a uniformly distributed load,

165
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:04,370
I have a point load?

166
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,366
Instead of taking a load which I distribute

167
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,525
over the entire length of my beam,

168
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,934
I take the whole load and I put it in the middle.

169
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:13,222
because we can see this very clearly through this formula,

170
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:18,469
for a simple beam, the internal forces are multipled by two,

171
00:16:18,469 --> 00:16:24,392
since we have Q·l over 4 z and not Q·l over 8 z.

172
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:28,036
I remind you that Q is equal to q times L,

173
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:32,400
so we have q times L squared on both sides, if you prefer.

174
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,406
If we look at a cantilever, that is also the case.

175
00:16:37,265 --> 00:16:40,908
So if instead of having unformly distributed loads

176
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:46,293
we concentrate them in the middle of the span, the internal forces are doubled.

177
00:16:46,723 --> 00:16:49,073
Conversely, if we moved from concentrated loads

178
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:50,470
to uniformly distributed loads,

179
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,413
we would diminish the internal forces by a factor 2,

180
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:55,519
that is not really negligible.

181
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:56,757
And then now,

182
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,524
well, that is a comparison which is a bit less usual:

183
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:04,200
what happens if we decide to pass from a simple beam system

184
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,592
to a cantilever system?

185
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:11,116
Well, with a concentrated load, we move from Q·L over 4z to Q·L over z.

186
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:15,197
That is very significant, the internal forces are four times larger!

187
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,005
What happens if I do this for a uniformly distributed load?

188
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,908
Well, that is the same thing, I have q·L squared over 2z,

189
00:17:24,908 --> 00:17:29,964
so that is also four times larger. That is very significant.

190
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:37,950
This picture is an illustration of what we have just seen today.

191
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,152
If we look at these two trees and that we imagine when they are full of leaves,

192
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:44,085
that is going to give us here

193
00:17:44,085 --> 00:17:47,526
a relatively small crown but at a large elevation,

194
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:48,780
and then here, that is going to give us

195
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,140
a very large crown but a smaller elevation.

196
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:02,352
The wind is going to act on our structure in this way, obviously much less low.

197
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:05,087
Why? Because the wind is weaker on the bottom,

198
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,271
and in addition to this, the exposed surface is larger here.

199
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:12,974
We have a structure, a tree, which is extremely exposed,

200
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:15,284
and a little bit exposed on the bottom.

201
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:19,072
What is interesting is to see how nature

202
00:18:19,072 --> 00:18:21,911
equipped these two trees.

203
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:24,523
This tree works like a cantilever

204
00:18:24,523 --> 00:18:28,117
with a concentrated load acting approximately on the top.

205
00:18:28,121 --> 00:18:32,733
And then, we have here tension on the external face

206
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:37,045
and compression on the internal face.

207
00:18:37,521 --> 00:18:40,862
And then, for the right tree, that is going to be exactly the same thing,

208
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:45,414
we are going to have tension on the external part,

209
00:18:46,234 --> 00:18:49,063
that is to say on the side from which the wind comes,

210
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:52,516
and compression on the other side.

211
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:55,573
What is interesting is to note that for these trees,

212
00:18:55,573 --> 00:19:03,558
the effective depth z is adapted according to the internal forces.

213
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:07,242
When we have larger internal forces, for the right tree,

214
00:19:07,242 --> 00:19:10,201
because of the larger crown, even if this tree is less high,

215
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,469
then the trunk naturally has a wider shape,

216
00:19:14,568 --> 00:19:18,783
which enables it to have a larger effective depth z.

217
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:22,261
While the left tree, which probably has smaller internal forces,

218
00:19:22,641 --> 00:19:25,090
has a smaller effetive depth.

219
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:28,029
In this video, we have established together a table

220
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:31,142
which gives us the maximal tensile internal forces,

221
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,532
but that would be equal for the compression,

222
00:19:33,532 --> 00:19:36,637
in the case of a simple beam or of a cantilever.

223
00:19:36,637 --> 00:19:39,122
We have subjected these elements to either a concentrated load,

224
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:41,427
or a uniformly distributed load,

225
00:19:41,427 --> 00:19:45,618
and then we have made a comparison shows that it is more favorable

226
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:48,630
to have uniformly distributed loads than concentrated loads,

227
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,519
and very clearly more favorable to have a simple beam than a cantilever

228
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,508
if the other parameters are obviously equal.
