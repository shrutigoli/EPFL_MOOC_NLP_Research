00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,274
Hello.

2
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:07,381
In this lecture, we change thematic

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:09,366
in the course &quot;The Art of Structures II&quot;

4
00:00:09,366 --> 00:00:11,814
since we move to the subject of beams.

5
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:15,901
We will see in this video, that there is a strong relationship

6
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,321
in the way trusses and beams work.

7
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,962
Just a few words to get our bearings;

8
00:00:23,962 --> 00:00:27,501
in the course &quot;The Art of Structures II&quot;, we have already studied trusses

9
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:29,161
and their extensions in 3D

10
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:33,916
and we now start looking at the subject of beams.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,994
On the basis of what we have already seen for trusses,

12
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:43,463
we can design the required width

13
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:45,610
for each of the elements of the structure

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,566
and afterwards, build a truss which would exactly have

15
00:00:50,566 --> 00:00:52,597
the required dimensions.

16
00:00:52,863 --> 00:00:55,441
Here, certain diagonals are very thin,

17
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,081
while others are a bit wider,

18
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:01,296
certain chords are also quite thin

19
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:04,521
and others require more material.

20
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:11,266
On the basis of the calculation of the structure,

21
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:15,300
assuming that there are no other load combinations of course,

22
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,301
which would need larger dimensions,

23
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:21,587
we could very accurately create a truss

24
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:25,222
which would perfectly resist the internal forces we have calculated

25
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:27,968
under the loads which are imposed

26
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:31,688
and this, with a minimal amount of material

27
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:36,171
since we would just use the required amount of material.

28
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:40,668
We could make this truss using timber, concrete or steel.

29
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:44,565
Let's imagine for example, that we build it using

30
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:47,720
a large board of timber.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,807
There is no problem to have these cuttings done

32
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,317
but we can notice that

33
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,601
we would have, in all likelihood,

34
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:05,431
to throw away these triangular elements because they would be useless for us.

35
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:10,560
Likewise, we could imagine that this truss is made by concrete

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,012
in which case the formwork to make all these triangular openings,

37
00:02:16,012 --> 00:02:17,723
we can do it of course

38
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:21,577
but it would constitute a non-negligible work.

39
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:25,244
And, if we had to do this with steel,

40
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:28,597
we would either do it with lots of small bars

41
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:31,189
which would impose a very significant welding work,

42
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:33,764
either we would do it in the same way than for timber,

43
00:02:33,764 --> 00:02:36,046
from a steel plate

44
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:39,031
and then with important losses.

45
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:44,121
A solution could be to say: &quot;what if we kept

46
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,704
the orange parts?&quot;

47
00:02:59,217 --> 00:03:01,772
We do not strictly need them

48
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:04,376
since they are not necessary for the strength.

49
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:08,032
Only the grey part can carry all the loads,

50
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:10,292
however, it would simplify our life.

51
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:13,506
For example, if we make the concrete truss

52
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:16,284
we could make a much simpler formwork

53
00:03:16,284 --> 00:03:18,622
only making

54
00:03:18,622 --> 00:03:20,801
the lower beam.

55
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:23,112
That is to say, a beam which has

56
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,163
a constant depth

57
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:29,728
and which does not have any holes.

58
00:03:29,728 --> 00:03:34,394
Here, we have the whole beam which is here

59
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:37,986
and it would be much easier to form it of course

60
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:40,036
and we would use quite a lot of additional concrete

61
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:43,056
but on the whole, it could be simpler.

62
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:51,756
Let's define here the dimensions of this beam,

63
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,225
so it has a span

64
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:56,335
which is the distance between the supports, which is equal to L.

65
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:04,155
It has a cross-section depth

66
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:06,602
which is equal to h

67
00:04:10,278 --> 00:04:12,330
and a cross-section width

68
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,428
which has a value of t.

69
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,562
In this case here, we have a rectangular cross-section,

70
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:19,636
we will see other types of cross-section later.

71
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,387
So we have here a beam

72
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,237
with a rectangular cross-section,

73
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,330
knowing however that all the concrete, steel, timber,

74
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:39,234
all the material is not necessary,

75
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:41,142
the orange part is not needed,

76
00:04:41,142 --> 00:04:44,772
only the grey part is indispensable but for simplicity,

77
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:47,875
we have decided to keep all the material.

78
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,629
This enables us, according to the title of this slide,

79
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,368
to move from a truss to a beam.

80
00:04:56,553 --> 00:04:58,907
What is a beam?

81
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:05,496
As we just saw it,

82
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:08,736
it is an element which carries loads

83
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,245
but when we hit it, it does not reply to us.

84
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,738
That is not an element which is transparent,

85
00:05:14,738 --> 00:05:17,587
which enables us to see what happens inside.

86
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,108
Using the same amount of material,

87
00:05:21,108 --> 00:05:23,608
I have rotated my beam, I have kept the same loads.

88
00:05:24,051 --> 00:05:27,521
From the outside, nothing different happens.

89
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:32,093
Actually, what we want to see in the following lectures among other things,

90
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,657
is what is the influence of depth

91
00:05:34,657 --> 00:05:37,159
on the internal forces inside a beam.

92
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,363
Since the beam does not tell us anything by itself,

93
00:05:40,363 --> 00:05:41,637
what we can do

94
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,071
is to imagine what happens inside;

95
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:47,250
so I have my beam that I had on the screen,

96
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,537
one of both with either the large, or the small depth,

97
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,432
both loads of ten Newtons

98
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:56,622
and I can imagine a truss inside this structure

99
00:05:56,622 --> 00:06:00,043
and this truss, I can calculate it.

100
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,349
A condition that I have to respect

101
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,909
is that the depth of my truss

102
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,754
cannot exceed the depth of the beam.

103
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:16,190
So my truss is entirely included within the beam,

104
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,740
that is not exactly what happens inside

105
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,041
but that is a visualising which enables to understand

106
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:25,199
what happens inside the beam

107
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,373
and which, as we will see, is very efficient

108
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,858
to design the beam itself.

109
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,262
In this introductory lecture,

110
00:06:32,262 --> 00:06:34,608
we have seen what is a beam

111
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:36,921
and we have seen that there is a strong link

112
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:39,253
between a truss and a beam,

113
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:42,058
either as we conmsider the beam as a truss

114
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:45,180
in which we have filled the holes,

115
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,203
or on the contrary, when we seee the the truss

116
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:50,098
as a way to understand

117
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:53,277
how the internal forces act inside a beam.
