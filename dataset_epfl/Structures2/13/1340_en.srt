00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:04,623
Hello, in this lecture, we are going to continue our study of beams

2
00:00:04,623 --> 00:00:08,965
to look at what happens inside these beams

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:11,765
in terms of internal force, of stress and of deformation.

4
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:15,042
We will finally establish together a table

5
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:20,988
to directly determine the maximum deflection, particularly as a function of the various effects

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,992
which act on a beam.

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,687
Here, we find again something that we just did in

8
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:30,319
the previous video, so I am not going to get into the details,

9
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:37,452
but here we have the effective depth z

10
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:41,722
which is equal to half of the depth of our rectangular beam

11
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:43,459
whose width is t.

12
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,704
You remember, we had subjected this beam to two loads of QRd,

13
00:00:48,704 --> 00:00:52,007
with a support reaction of QRd on the left and on the right.

14
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,020
And we had developped the formula:

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:02,129
QRd is equal to h over 2a times N.

16
00:01:03,587 --> 00:01:06,993
That is enough for us, we had developped other formulae, it allows me

17
00:01:06,993 --> 00:01:20,822
to say that N is equal to QRd times 2a over h.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,523
I am now going to introduce a symbol which I will use a lot thereafter.

19
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:33,246
This symbol here means &quot;proportional to&quot;. 

20
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:45,266
For example, the length a, I can admit for my beams,

21
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:47,973
is proportional to the span.

22
00:01:48,884 --> 00:01:56,436
Since I have N which is equal to QRd times 2a,

23
00:01:56,436 --> 00:02:04,146
I can also say that N is proportional to Q, I am going to forget Rd,

24
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:08,621
times l divided by h.

25
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:15,114
We are going proceed, in the remainder of this video, only with

26
00:02:15,114 --> 00:02:18,946
proportionality relationships, which will enable us to avoid to solve

27
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:23,174
certain equations which are quite complex, while still giving us a very interesting

28
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:27,141
perspective on the relative importance of the various parameters

29
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:29,345
in this configuration.

30
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,070
So, here we look at the stresses and the deformations.

31
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,591
I still have, I have written it here, z which is equal to h over 2.

32
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:52,050
We have the stress sigma which is equal to N over A, that is proportional.

33
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,693
N, we know it, is proportional to Q·L over h.

34
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,827
And now, we still divide by A and then for A,

35
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:08,178
we know that the cross-section is equal to t times h,

36
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:11,031
so we can also say that it is proportional

37
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:17,829
to Q times L over t times h square.

38
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:23,648
And then the strain

39
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:35,199
epsilon is equal to sigma, the stress, divided by the modulus of elasticity E,

40
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:42,049
and is also proportional to Q times L over E,

41
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,946
modulus of elasticity, t·h squared.

42
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,424
We now move to bending.

43
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,056
We have already observed when I did this demonstration

44
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,886
in the previous video, that we are dealing with a curvature.

45
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:14,799
The curvature is this continuous changing in the orientation of these little lines

46
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,960
still perpendicular to the axis, but which change their orientation.

47
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:21,789
I think that the word &quot;curve&quot; is quite clear

48
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:23,589
in the common language.

49
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,080
We generally rather look at the radius of curvature

50
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,850
than at the curvature.

51
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,347
The radius of curvature is, actually, the distance between the neutral axis

52
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:43,860
of our cross-section and the center of the circle which would be tangent to our shape.

53
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:54,222
What we can notice here, is that we had here

54
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,933
an epsilon on either side.

55
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:05,655
We are going to say that we had, in the upper half of the cross-section, a negative epsilon,

56
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:10,083
in the lower part, a positive epsilon, one half on each side.

57
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:14,261
On the other side, thre is here another small element,

58
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,866
same thing, epsilon over 2,

59
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:24,278
and then we have here the depth, in this case, that is really the total

60
00:05:24,278 --> 00:05:27,318
depth of our cross-section.

61
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,969
If now we take a cross-section which has a double depth,

62
00:05:34,832 --> 00:05:43,299
we will still have the same epsilon over 2 on the left and on the right for the compression

63
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:46,588
and for the tension.

64
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:55,291
And what we can immediately notice is that the radius of curvature...

65
00:05:55,291 --> 00:06:01,540
we are not going to be able to enter, to touch the centre of the circle here

66
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,333
because the radius of curvature - I should have drawn it till here -

67
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,282
here, the radius of curvature is much larger than

68
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:13,489
on the left here.

69
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,504
So, what we can notice here is that now there is 

70
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:23,174
a proportionality between r and one over epsilon.

71
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:29,570
r is proportional to one over epsilon. That is to say that if I increase

72
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,336
epsilon, the radius of curvature is going to decrease.

73
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:36,950
If I decrease epsilon, the radius of curvature is going to increase. What we can see on the right part is that here I have doubled the depth,

74
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,785
the radius of curvature doubled, so, actually the radius of curvature

75
00:06:41,785 --> 00:06:51,148
is proportional to h over epsilon.

76
00:06:52,677 --> 00:07:00,480
Here, it concerns the radius of curvature r.

77
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,858
Now, we are going to look at the curvature psi.

78
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:13,401
Psi is defined as one over r, the inveres of the radius of curvature,

79
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:19,739
so psi is naturally proportional to epsilon over h.

80
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:24,491
since r is proportional to h over epsilon.

81
00:07:58,329 --> 00:07:59,950
We now look at

82
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,987
the slope, here,

83
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:10,186
the slope of our beam.

84
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:14,157
The maximum slope in this case, can be found near the supports.

85
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:18,280
The slope, if you remember what you have seen,

86
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,964
for those who followed advanced mathematics courses,

87
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:28,547
the slope is the integral of the curvature over the length.

88
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:45,550
In practice, this means that the slope phi is proportional to psi -

89
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:49,057
I draw your attention on the fact that they are not the same greek letters.

90
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:53,841
The letter phi from which comes our f, we draw it without raising the pencil,

91
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,599
the letter psi, we make a kind of trident. -

92
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:03,501
so phi is proportional to psi times the length, that is to say,

93
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:13,559
it is proportional to Q·L squares over E·t·h cubed.

94
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:28,809
The maximum deflection w.

95
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:32,380
Here, the maximum deflection, in this case, is located in the middle.

96
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,948
That is often near the middle.

97
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:49,935
The maximum deflection is the integral of the slope over the length, again.

98
00:09:54,193 --> 00:10:07,288
So the maximum deflection w is proportional to phi times L, that is to say proportional

99
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:17,725
to Q·L cubed over E·t·h cubed.

100
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:26,617
The stiffness is the property that measures the ability of a beam

101
00:10:26,617 --> 00:10:28,436
not to deform too much.

102
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:32,887
That is defined by the load we apply divided by the maximum deflection.

103
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:42,053
This value is itself proportional to E·t·h cubed over L cubed.

104
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:56,143
In a structure, the maximum allowable deflection is usually defined

105
00:10:56,143 --> 00:11:06,436
as the a relative value, that is to say that codes give us w as a fraction of the span

106
00:11:06,436 --> 00:11:10,607
should be approximately equal to one over 300.

107
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:14,114
Maybe this value can be one over 250 or one over 350,

108
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:16,636
this will depend from the various national codes,

109
00:11:16,636 --> 00:11:20,570
this is not very important at the level of this course.

110
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,574
If, however, we have fragile elements,

111
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,414
that means elements, for example walls with tiles

112
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:30,813
or highly glazed elements,

113
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:42,528
we will rather have an admissible value for the maximum deflection

114
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,200
of one 500th of the span.

115
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:58,133
And we know that the maximum relative deflection is proportional to Q·L squared

116
00:11:58,133 --> 00:12:02,224
over E·t·h cubed.

117
00:12:03,327 --> 00:12:06,955
And the stiffness Q over w.

118
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:11,136
When we have concentrated loads and that there are not too many,

119
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:15,378
one or two, we will get something which is going to be

120
00:12:15,378 --> 00:12:19,944
proportional to Q times L over h.

121
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,259
The stress is going to be proportional to

122
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:31,447
Q times L over t·h squared.

123
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:37,478
The strain epsilon is going to be proportional to

124
00:12:37,478 --> 00:12:42,454
Q times l over E t h square.

125
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:53,778
The curvature psi is proportional to Q times L over E·t·h cubed.

126
00:12:54,965 --> 00:13:05,908
The slope phi is proportional to Q·L square divided by E·t·h cubed.

127
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:19,022
The maximum deflection w is proportional to Q·L cubed over E·t·h cubed.

128
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:24,763
The maximum relative deflection w over L is proportional to

129
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:30,656
Q·L squared divided by E·t·h cubed.

130
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:43,520
The stiffness Q over w is proportional to E·t·h cubed over l cubed.

131
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:48,156
Finally, without getting into the details of how these values have been obtained,

132
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:50,602
I can give you the most important values

133
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,052
for an uniformly distributed load.

134
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:58,330
The maximum deflection is proportional to lowercase q, that is to say the load

135
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,881
in kiloNewtons per meter, the uniformly distributed load,

136
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:08,078
times L to the 4th, divided by E·t·h cubed.

137
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:19,356
The stiffness is proportional to E·t·h cubed over L to the 4th.

138
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:25,412
Let's now come back to this diagram, you remember that we had developped it

139
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:26,725
together before.

140
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,526
There is always compression

141
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:33,726
in the upper part of these cross-sections.

142
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:37,977
Here, we have a cross-section which is composed of 2 superimposed beams,

143
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:41,373
that is slightly different, there is a bit of compression in the middle

144
00:14:41,373 --> 00:14:43,707
but actually there are two separated beams.

145
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:47,097
And then tension on the bottom.

146
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:56,451
We have seen before that this had consequences

147
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,257
in terms of strength.

148
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:15,046
The formula was Q rd is equal to h squared divided by 4 times t

149
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,487
over A times fd.

150
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,501
And then we have seen that if we give a factor one times to this beam,

151
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:27,962
this one, twice wider, had a factor 2 times,

152
00:15:27,962 --> 00:15:30,829
this one, twice deeper, had a factor 4 times,

153
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:34,297
and then this one which was composed of two superimposed beams,

154
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,329
only had a factor 2 times.

155
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:42,193
If we now look at the stiffness,

156
00:15:45,494 --> 00:15:58,017
that is to say Q over w which is proportional to E·t·h cubed, and not squared anymore,

157
00:15:58,017 --> 00:16:01,876
divided by L cubed, so we have,

158
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:07,735
if we give here a factor one to this first beam, when we are going

159
00:16:07,735 --> 00:16:10,360
to double the width, we are going to double t,

160
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,605
so it is simply going to be twice larger.

161
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,076
However, when we are going to double the depth,

162
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:21,485
we are going to have 2 cubed, so this beam with a double depth

163
00:16:21,485 --> 00:16:26,077
will have 8 times the stiffness of the initial beam,

164
00:16:26,077 --> 00:16:28,781
and then when we place two beams on top of each other,

165
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:33,398
we will again have only a factor 2 as advantage.

166
00:16:33,398 --> 00:16:36,144
So, what we can see, is that both in terms of strength and

167
00:16:36,144 --> 00:16:41,256
stiffness, it is favorable to place the material over the depth of the beams,

168
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,084
into one unique element.

169
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,454
We have also seen that the shape of the cross-section

170
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:51,522
has a quite decisive importance on the stiffness of the beam.
