00:00:00,776 --> 00:00:03,129
Hello, in this video, we are going to look at

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:05,002
the influence of the cross-section of a beam

3
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:06,853
on its strength.

4
00:00:07,334 --> 00:00:09,316
We will see how to arrange the material,

5
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:11,382
how to optimize the shape of the cross-section

6
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:15,016
and we add some general comments about the optimization

7
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:17,384
of the shape of a beam over its entire length.

8
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:20,507
We are going to look again at an example which we have already seen

9
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,849
a short time ago.

10
00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:25,636
We have a beam here, which has a width of 2 h

11
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,065
and a depth of h,

12
00:00:27,275 --> 00:00:31,612
and here is another beam which has a width of h and a depth of 2 h.

13
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,151
What we know, if that is the cross-section of a simple

14
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:39,205
beam with vertical downwards applied loads, is that

15
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:43,635
we are going to have compression in the upper part of the beam

16
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:48,481
and then tension in the lower part.

17
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:52,498
Compression here, tension...

18
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:08,205
and the effective depth is equal to h / 2 on the left,

19
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:11,330
and to h on the right.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,422
So, clearly, with the same amount of material,

21
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:16,984
we have a more efficient structure.

22
00:01:17,566 --> 00:01:21,553
Actually, what we have seen, is that moving from one solution to the other,

23
00:01:21,807 --> 00:01:26,623
we have multiplied the strength by 2

24
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:31,217
and the stiffness by 8.

25
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,369
So that is something which is very significant

26
00:01:34,809 --> 00:01:39,210
and we can thus say that the cross-section which has the largest depth

27
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,793
is largely more efficient.

28
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:47,067
We have here a square cross-section with a width of h and a depth of h.

29
00:01:47,727 --> 00:01:51,085
We can simply think that putting it on its side,

30
00:01:51,514 --> 00:01:53,481
we are going to have a larger depth,

31
00:01:54,606 --> 00:01:57,005
which will be equal to h times the square root of 2,

32
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:04,795
and then a larger width

33
00:02:05,302 --> 00:02:08,764
which will also be equal to h times the square root of 2.

34
00:02:15,616 --> 00:02:18,100
Is this cross-section really more efficient?

35
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,618
As for the distribution of stresses,

36
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:23,999
we know that we have compression

37
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,652
in the upper part on the left

38
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:29,235
and that is going to be the same thing on the right.

39
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:37,398
And then tension in the lower part,

40
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:43,775
as well as on the right.

41
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,854
Let's try to calculate z.

42
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:51,343
On the left, we know that z here,

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,839
the effective depth, is equal to h / 2.

44
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:05,861
Here, we want to find the center of gravity of the triangle.

45
00:03:06,616 --> 00:03:11,523
We have a triangle which has a depth h times the square root of 2 over 2,

46
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:16,686
so its center of gravity is located

47
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:21,880
at h times the square root of 2 over 2 over 3.

48
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,386
So in total, the distance between both centers of gravity,

49
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:27,454
of the lower and the upper part,

50
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:42,975
is equal to h times the square root of 2 divided by 3, that is roughly equal to 0.47 h.

51
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:47,506
So, we can see that the strength is almost identical actually.

52
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:51,128
We had 0.5, 1 / 2 ; now we have 0.47.

53
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:59,570
The strength is almost identical.

54
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,209
Actually, if we look at the stiffness...

55
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:07,255
We are not going to do it, that is a calculation which goes beyond

56
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,626
the content of this course.

57
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,759
But the stiffness is smaller.

58
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:19,661
So, the principle of maximizing the depth is not the right principle.

59
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,183
The principle that we will have to follow is the following one:

60
00:04:23,493 --> 00:04:29,770
we have to take the material away

61
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:34,979
from the neutral axis.

62
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,273
I had not drawn the neutral axis,

63
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:46,089
I am going to draw it now.

64
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,645
We have here the neutral axis of the cross-section.

65
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:57,316
And clearly, if we had used this criterion, we would have seen that

66
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,590
in the right part, there is a lot of material

67
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,301
which is quite close to the neutral axis since we have this triangle.

68
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,524
There is only a small part of the material

69
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:07,600
which is really located at a distance of h times the square root of 2 over 2,

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,242
while here, the material is more compact.

71
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:12,921
But we will see better methods thereafter.

72
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:21,010
If I have a certain amount of material, on the one hand,

73
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,761
so I have a depth which is equal to h,

74
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:30,704
and then for example, a depth which is equal to 2 h.

75
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:33,374
So, I have a certain amount of material,

76
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,265
what we have done till now is arranging

77
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:38,753
the material to give the cross-section a rectangular shape

78
00:05:42,545 --> 00:05:47,461
with, obviously, tension on the top and compression on the bottom.

79
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,908
It is still necessary to respect the depth of 2 h, but however,

80
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:57,140
what is important, is to take the material away from the neutral axis.

81
00:05:57,682 --> 00:06:00,715
I am maybe going to rewrite this principle.

82
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:11,448
Take the material away from the neutral axis.

83
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:23,262
So, I can think about a solution to do so.

84
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:30,025
I am going to up to the top but I am going to spread the material laterally.

85
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:35,278
At the end, what I have just drawn here, that is approximately the same surface than here,

86
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:43,153
and likewise, for the tension, I am going to spread the material in the lower part.

87
00:06:46,852 --> 00:06:51,242
If we look at the effective depth z of the cross-section,

88
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:55,284
it is not exactly equal to 2 h, but almost.

89
00:06:56,309 --> 00:07:00,656
So z tends towards 2 h,

90
00:07:01,061 --> 00:07:03,999
it will never be able to reach it because a certain thickness

91
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,753
of material is required anyway

92
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,167
while here, unfortunately, or let's say, that was normal,

93
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,789
we only had z equal to h.

94
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:20,224
So we can see that arranging the material according to this principle,

95
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:22,502
- as far as possible from the neutral axis -

96
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:26,614
we can obtain a structure which will be significantly more efficient.

97
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,364
That is what is used, for example, for the steel sections here,

98
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,602
which we call shapes...

99
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:38,242
with large flanges

100
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:47,577
and we also call them double T shapes.

101
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:52,375
Some of you

102
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,452
would maybe like to call them H shapes,

103
00:07:55,452 --> 00:07:58,587
I will come back to why this is not a good idea later.

104
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:03,581
Let's look here, if we have a cross-section with a depth h,

105
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:07,709
let's look at the distribution of stresses.

106
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,337
We are going to have compression

107
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:17,484
in the upper part till here

108
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:22,293
and then tension in the lower part.

109
00:08:22,422 --> 00:08:29,257
If we think about where is located the center of gravity of the material,

110
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,020
we probably have something like this,

111
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,133
so we have a quite favorable z

112
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:41,496
which is maybe equal to, I don't know, 0.7-0.8 times h.

113
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:47,436
If however we have one of these cross-sections

114
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,928
and that we arrange the material in the form of H...

115
00:08:50,224 --> 00:08:52,345
That is why I do not like the shape of an H,

116
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:56,963
because if we arrange it in the form of H, so we will have compression here

117
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:03,375
and then a little bit of compression in the part which is very close to the neutral axis,

118
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:07,702
and likewise, a little bit of tension very close to the neutral axis,

119
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:12,579
and then most of the tension here, vertically,

120
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:17,783
and here, what we can see is that the effective depth...

121
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:24,426
the center of gravity is roughly here so the effective depth is approximately

122
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:28,938
h / 2, even a bit less since the material is a bit 

123
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:35,797
close to the axis in the horizontal part of the H.

124
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:38,069
That is why we talk about double T shapes.

125
00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:40,495
There is a T here, and then an inverted T below.

126
00:09:40,717 --> 00:09:42,113
That is much more correct.

127
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:46,002
A H shape is actually a double-T shape which is not positioned well.

128
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:48,403
Sometimes, we have to position them in this way,

129
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:52,338
but the right way to position them, that is in the double T position.

130
00:09:53,941 --> 00:10:00,265
If we now look at the effective depth of various cross-sections,

131
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:04,760
so we have here a solid circular cross-section

132
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:18,898
with compression on the top and tension on the bottom

133
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,504
and then the center of gravity of half a circle,

134
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:28,542
we can find them in a textbook, that is not very important,

135
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:32,848
we can see that the effective depth is clearly smaller

136
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,515
than h over 2.

137
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:42,665
If we do not arrange the material in a solid circular cross-section,

138
00:10:42,665 --> 00:10:45,146
but in a tubular circular cross-section,

139
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:49,667
actually the center of gravity is going to be similar,

140
00:10:52,223 --> 00:10:57,262
so z... here, I should have indicated z,

141
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:00,249
so z here is going to be quite similar

142
00:11:00,822 --> 00:11:04,115
however the material is efficiently arranged

143
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:07,902
because a big part of the material is far from the neutral axis

144
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,636
while here, not at all.

145
00:11:09,828 --> 00:11:12,559
We have a cross-section below, the tubular cross-section which is a

146
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,379
quite efficient cross-section.

147
00:11:15,427 --> 00:11:18,445
We do not have to only use circular tubes,

148
00:11:18,492 --> 00:11:21,824
we can also have square or rectangular tubes

149
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,482
and these tubes are quite efficient since we can see here:

150
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:27,925
most of the material tends to be

151
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,807
really far from the axis. There is a vertical part

152
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,216
but there are also horizontal parts which are very far from the axis, and thus,

153
00:11:35,406 --> 00:11:43,339
the effective depth is quite significant, that is about the same than what we have here.

154
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:49,469
Of course, we can also have double T or tubular cross-sections

155
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:54,416
which have a larger depth, as you can see on the right.

156
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:57,261
Here, that is even more favorable, because here,

157
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:01,469
there are the vertical elements but the horizontal elements

158
00:12:01,469 --> 00:12:07,497
which we call the flanges for the shape with wide flanges,

159
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:11,718
these elements are very far from the neutral axis.

160
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:14,101
They are very efficient cross-sections.

161
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:17,036
This, that is for the steel construction.

162
00:12:25,326 --> 00:12:28,960
We are going to say that z is probably from there to there

163
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:41,903
and then just slightly smaller for tubular shapes.

164
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:45,446
They are a bit lower because there are two vertical elements

165
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:49,547
which we call webs and then the center of gravity is a bit more

166
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:51,948
on the inside, next to the axis.

167
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:56,016
This way to proceed can be used for other cross-sections

168
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:58,601
than the cross-sections used in steel construction.

169
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:02,690
Here, we have the construction of a box girder bridge.

170
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,659
You can see on the right that it built as a cantilever.

171
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:12,503
If this is a cantilever, then we have compression

172
00:13:12,742 --> 00:13:18,978
in the lower part of the bridge and tension in the upper part.

173
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,714
That is what we recognize here in the cross-section on the left.

174
00:13:22,714 --> 00:13:25,644
We have a very thick part in compression,

175
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,183
which is about one meter thick,

176
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:31,879
here, which is able to support very large compressive internal forces.

177
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,006
There will also be a part of the compression which will be carried by

178
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:37,239
these vertical elements.

179
00:13:37,469 --> 00:13:41,702
And then in the upper part where we will have tension,

180
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:47,483
we can actually see many holes into which we are going

181
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:51,149
to insert prestressing cables,

182
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:56,635
so they are elements which have a very high strength

183
00:13:56,955 --> 00:13:59,492
to carry tension.

184
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:10,235
There are also some reinforcements, there is also a little bit on the bottom

185
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:13,308
because we always put some reinforcements in reinforced concrete elements.

186
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:17,116
And what we can see, that is the same principle than for a tubular cross-section

187
00:14:17,404 --> 00:14:21,093
where we have a compressed element, vertical elements

188
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:25,036
because we have to separate them and then a horizontal element

189
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,870
which is again strongly in tension.

190
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,202
Finally, we want to look a bit at 

191
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,292
the statical efficiency, that is to say:

192
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:39,330
what can we gain varying the cross-section along the beam?

193
00:14:39,563 --> 00:14:43,156
What we have seen so far, is the solution which I am going to call

194
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:44,760
solution 1.

195
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:50,161
We have seen rectangular cross-sections.

196
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:57,705
That is what we have here, in this graph, and then here, in this other graph.

197
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,712
Let's look at what this graph indicates us as a function of the slenderness ratio.

198
00:15:01,723 --> 00:15:03,569
You remember, the slenderness ratio,

199
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,850
that is the ratio between the span and the depth of the cross-section.

200
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:11,991
The more the cross-section slender is, the more it is going to need material,

201
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,276
that is very clear.

202
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,658
That is what we can see here:

203
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:20,594
the volume, which is normalized, but the volume of material

204
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:23,720
which increases very quickly, quicker than all other systems.

205
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:30,183
Conversely, if we look at the stiffness, w divided by L,

206
00:15:30,474 --> 00:15:32,952
we can see that a beam with a constant cross-section

207
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:36,764
will deform less.

208
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:44,290
So here, we have the curve 1 and also the curve 1 here.

209
00:15:46,786 --> 00:15:51,624
On this curve 2, we have the idea to make the depth of the beam vary,

210
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:54,699
that is to say that in the middle, where we have the largest internal forces,

211
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,489
we place a maximal depth, and in the direction of the supports,

212
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,267
we are going to make it decrease.

213
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:04,454
We can find again this curve 2 here and here.

214
00:16:06,844 --> 00:16:11,844
And we can see that, we need reasonably less material

215
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:16,330
to make a beam which has the same performance

216
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:19,113
than a constant depth beam.

217
00:16:20,406 --> 00:16:24,134
Here, we have this curve here for this configuration number 2.

218
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:33,003
Configuration number 3 for a wide flanges shape

219
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,117
and a constant cross-section.

220
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:47,542
We can see that this solution is quite efficient,

221
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:52,111
requiring even less material than what we have seen before

222
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,396
with a deformation which will however be larger,

223
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,799
that is logical since we really have very little material

224
00:17:06,988 --> 00:17:08,498
in such a cross-section.

225
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:20,062
Solution number 4 is a solution which is similar to number 2 where

226
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:25,940
we have a maximal amount of material at mid-span, and we remove material

227
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,410
without decreasing the depth, but decreasing the width

228
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,696
of the cross-section.

229
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,776
So here, we have solution number 4

230
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:43,822
and we can see that it is quite efficient and it requires even less material

231
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:51,000
and it rather deforms a bit less than the solution in which we made the depth

232
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,956
of the cross-section vary.

233
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:06,461
The last solution is solution number 5, which is a combination of

234
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,690
solution number 4 and solution number 3, so we have a beam which has a width which varies

235
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:15,842
along the cross-section, but this beam is initially composed 

236
00:18:15,849 --> 00:18:18,830
of large flanges profiles, but we have cut a part of the flanges

237
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,364
so we have less material.

238
00:18:20,727 --> 00:18:27,239
We can find again this solution here and here.

239
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:36,073
Thus we clearly use less material than previously

240
00:18:37,105 --> 00:18:40,584
and the deformations remain quite reasonable,

241
00:18:43,046 --> 00:18:45,232
but they are almost as large as those

242
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:49,021
of the beam with variable depth anyway.

243
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,385
What can we learn from this?

244
00:18:52,385 --> 00:18:55,565
Well, what is interesting is to compare the results

245
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:59,312
which we just got with the good results

246
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,656
which we have obtained before.

247
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:05,359
Here, we have a solution with a truss, in yellow.

248
00:19:06,037 --> 00:19:09,334
What we can see is that a beam with a constant cross-section

249
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,003
requires much more material than a truss.

250
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:15,509
Likewise, it is going to deform considerably less.

251
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:21,612
If now we look at a beam with an optimized shape,

252
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:25,203
like solution 5, so an optimized beam with large flanges.

253
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:29,894
We can see that we reach an efficiency which is comparable to that of a truss with

254
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:31,436
variable depth.

255
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,809
So it is possible to get extremely efficient structures

256
00:19:35,097 --> 00:19:38,115
in the form of beams, but they cannot have 

257
00:19:38,306 --> 00:19:42,322
a constant cross-section, their cross-section must vary along the beam

258
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,416
according to the internal forces.

259
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:47,681
Let's write down these conclusions.

260
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:57,767
Beams with a constant depth require more material

261
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:01,913
than trusses.

262
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:08,468
So, if we want to have a structure which is light, which uses little material,

263
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:13,024
beams with a constant cross-section are something which is less favorable.

264
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,771
However, we have also seen that it is easier to make

265
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:19,276
a beam with a constant cross-section, for example if we want to make it out of concrete,

266
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:22,008
because the formwork will be relatively easy to make.

267
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:24,928
Steel beams with a double T shape

268
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:39,065
are comparable to trusses with constant chords

269
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:49,350
regarding their efficiency, they are relatively efficient.

270
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:53,686
And finally, with regard to variations, it is favorable

271
00:20:57,153 --> 00:20:59,017
to make the cross-section vary,

272
00:21:05,114 --> 00:21:09,973
especially to make the width of the cross-section vary.

273
00:21:10,137 --> 00:21:15,415
We have seen than the depth has a less significant effect.

274
00:21:16,978 --> 00:21:20,282
In this lecture, we have seen that the way to arrange the material in

275
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,088
a beam has an influence.

276
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:25,622
Changing the orientation of the cross-section, when it was a square cross-section,

277
00:21:25,622 --> 00:21:29,022
was not very efficient, but however, to put a rectangular cross-section

278
00:21:29,022 --> 00:21:32,646
with its largest side in the direction of the depth,

279
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:34,746
that is something which is very efficient.

280
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:38,071
We have also seen that the shape of the cross-section can be optimized,

281
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:41,930
using the general principle of taking the material away from the neutral axis.

282
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,595
Finally, we have done some comments about the efficiency

283
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:48,763
of the load-bearing systems and we have compared them

284
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:49,962
to that of trusses.

285
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:52,322
For beams with a rectangular cross-section,

286
00:21:52,322 --> 00:21:54,734
they are clearly less efficient than trusses,

287
00:21:54,734 --> 00:21:58,781
beams with a double-T cross-section are relatively efficient,

288
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,732
and the best is to have the cross-section vary along the length of the beam in addition to that,

289
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:05,840
according to the intensity of the internal forces.
