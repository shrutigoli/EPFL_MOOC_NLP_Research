00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,724
Hello.

2
00:00:01,724 --> 00:00:04,320
In this video, I am going to introduce the topic of stability

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,632
which is the last topic we are going to see within the course &quot;The Art of Structures&quot;.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,900
I am going to present to you the phenomenon of stability

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,179
or rather of instability of structures,

6
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,920
and then I am going to remind you what we have already seen

7
00:00:16,959 --> 00:00:19,440
in the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,538
Here you have the complete path of structures.

9
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:28,370
For those who have joined us in the middle, I remind you that we have started here

10
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,671
that is to say, with trusses,

11
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,671
then we have treated beams and wall-beams,

12
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:36,760
frames and then of courses beam grids and slabs.

13
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:40,874
Today we reach the last topic : that of stability.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,304
The phenomenon is very simple.

15
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:46,240
In this video, you can see me with a bar made of bamboo

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,760
on which I lean.

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,085
When I push on it,

18
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:53,064
this bar gives way like the cane of a certain comedian.

19
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,642
The result is that I cannot really lean on it.

20
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:57,439
The load is limited.

21
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,936
The structure takes a funny shape.

22
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:04,540
This picture summarizes quite well the phenomenon of stability:

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,297
at once the knowledge we have about it and also the technics

24
00:01:08,297 --> 00:01:12,242
we can use to prevent it.

25
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:15,462
Of course, the fact that the cane bends

26
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:17,656
does not mean that columns are always going to bend.

27
00:01:17,656 --> 00:01:21,550
On the left, we have a structure which is about 2000 years old, from the Roman era,

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,261
with columns which have very significant dimensions

29
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:27,719
and which are also extremely close to one another.

30
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,960
And on the right, we have a modern structure from the 20th century,

31
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,200
the end of the 20th century, designed by Norman Foster.

32
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,540
We can see columns which are really distant from each other,

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,176
which are very tall,

34
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:40,736
because they are in the background, they are taller

35
00:01:40,736 --> 00:01:44,681
than the Roman columns and they are extremely thin.

36
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,563
How can it be possible?

37
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:50,765
We are going to look at this and we will get back to this subject later on.

38
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:54,680
Fundamentally, we want to look at what happens

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,379
with a bar either in tension, either in compression

40
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,691
when it is subjected to a load Q.

41
00:02:03,283 --> 00:02:06,040
If I first start by the bar on the which is in tension,

42
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,277
what happens when I place a load on it

43
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:15,040
and when I give it a certain deformation to find out if it is stable or not

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,393
- generally, we are going to deform the structure a little bit and look at what happens -

45
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:21,120
well here,

46
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:25,025
the structure returns in place,

47
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:37,651
that is to say that the deformation decreases

48
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,408
thus the structure is stable.

49
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,323
Even if we bother it a little bit as I did at first,

50
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:50,324
it is going to come back to its initial position.

51
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:54,883
If however, I have a structure in the configuration that I have drawn on the right

52
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:59,033
if I had made a model of this, you would have seen me trying

53
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:02,902
to hold a bar up at the end of my fingers.

54
00:03:02,902 --> 00:03:06,312
That is already not easy when I do this,

55
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:19,404
but if in addition, we apply a deformation then the structure keeps going further and further.

56
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:27,263
That is to say that the deformation increases

57
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:34,499
and thus the structure is unstable.

58
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:38,799
Somewhere along the line, quite quickly, it is going to end on the ground.

59
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,273
Remember:

60
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:42,572
that is a video which is from &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;

61
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:45,234
when I introduced the topic of arches.

62
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:50,037
When I add a second load on this arch on the right,

63
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:53,879
we can see that it collapses and the structure falls.

64
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,321
That is a relatively serious topic.

65
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:01,773
Let's get back to this topic through two examples.

66
00:04:01,773 --> 00:04:06,926
I am first going to apply a load Q

67
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:12,952
on the left and on the right on both my structures,

68
00:04:13,346 --> 00:04:16,627
so a cable structure and an arch structure.

69
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:23,262
Well, in both cases, since the shape of the structure

70
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:27,563
is identical to the shape of the pressure line or of the tension line

71
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,405
if we want to talk about...

72
00:04:29,405 --> 00:04:33,323
or of the funicular polygon, if we want to talk about the cable.

73
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:38,205
In both cases, we have a stable structure.

74
00:04:44,474 --> 00:04:46,255
The pressure line

75
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:52,899
is identical

76
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:59,891
to the shape of the structure.

77
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,343
Therefore this structure is stable.

78
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:11,166
Here too the structure is stable.

79
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:16,080
Do not say that all structures in compression are unstable.

80
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:17,760
They can absolutely be stable.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,289
However, if now we add a load on the right, that is what we had done in &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;,

82
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:25,906
- I encourage you to watch this video if you have not -

83
00:05:27,348 --> 00:05:33,077
what is going to happen is quite different for the arch and for the cable.

84
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,026
Indeed, in the case of the cable,

85
00:05:36,026 --> 00:05:38,915
the cable is going to change its shape

86
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:44,885
but keeping the same property: the pressure line

87
00:05:45,077 --> 00:05:51,376
is going to remain identical to the shape of the cable.

88
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:07,764
So we still have a stable structure.

89
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:13,734
However, what happens on the right is quite different.

90
00:06:13,734 --> 00:06:18,361
I first drew, here, the grey shape,

91
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:24,043
the shape that the structure tends to take

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,764
- actually, that is the one it takes in my video -

93
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,918
that is to say that where there are more loads on the right, the structure goes down.

94
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:42,253
The bad news is that the shape of the funicular polygon

95
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:46,565
- we have seen it in the course &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot; but you can understand too

96
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:50,354
that it must be symmetrical to the one of the cable -

97
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,586
this is the pressure line,

98
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,045
so where the structure wants to go down,

99
00:07:04,045 --> 00:07:06,371
the pressure line, on the opposite, would like that the structure goes up.

100
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:11,165
If we think about a mirror, it works with the cable but it does not work here.

101
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:15,070
Here, the pressure line

102
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,004
gets further

103
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:23,795
from the arch

104
00:07:25,155 --> 00:07:28,107
therefore the structure is unstable.

105
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,845
This is fundamentally what happens and which explains

106
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:35,724
the difference between tension and compression

107
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:37,433
and the phenomenon of stability.

108
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,922
That is this distance, for example here,

109
00:07:39,922 --> 00:07:43,132
between the shape of the structure or the shape the structure

110
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,205
would like to take and the pressure line.

111
00:07:46,205 --> 00:07:49,831
In this video, I introduced to you the basic principles of stability.

112
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:54,065
We have seen that the behavior of elements in tension is fundamentally different

113
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:55,792
from that of elements in compression,

114
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,079
the elements in tension being always stable

115
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,525
and the elements in compression being either potentially or really unstable.

116
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:06,335
We have seen the importance of the position of the pressure line.

117
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:09,339
In the following videos, we are going to see in more details

118
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,606
how this stability phenomenon works, and how to prevent it.
