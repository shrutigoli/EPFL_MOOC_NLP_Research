00:00:00,284 --> 00:00:01,541
Hello.

2
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:04,685
In this video, we want to look at structural solutions

3
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:07,827
that can be used to solve the problem of instability,

4
00:00:07,827 --> 00:00:12,430
that is to say how to design structures which will be sufficiently stable.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,121
We will see that there is a great similarity

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,794
between what happens with instability

7
00:00:18,794 --> 00:00:22,724
and what happens with bending deformations,

8
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,934
we will look at the internal forces in these structures,

9
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:28,783
and we will dÃ©duce the types of cross-sections which are favorable.

10
00:00:28,783 --> 00:00:31,514
We will also see that the shape given to the element

11
00:00:31,514 --> 00:00:34,352
can contribute to increase its stability.

12
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:37,224
Here, we have two columns:

13
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:41,560
one we have already seen within the framework of this lesson,

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,629
which is subjected to a vertical load

15
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,008
and which deforms under the effect of instability;

16
00:00:48,008 --> 00:00:51,736
and then another one which is subjected to a horizontal load.

17
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:54,449
This is a cantilever in bending,

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,889
a type of structure which we have also seen within the framework of this course.

19
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:00,045
Let's look at what happens at the bottom of these columns:

20
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:05,533
on the side of the center of curvature, or inside the curve,

21
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,869
we have compression

22
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,813
while outside, we have tension.

23
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,761
That is not exactly identical, but it looks alike a lot.

24
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,248
And what does it mean?

25
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:22,177
For us, we can directly learn lessons from it:

26
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,647
the cross-sections

27
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:31,477
which resist well to bending

28
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:41,008
are also favorable

29
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,708
from a stability point of view.

30
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,131
We had seen that what is important

31
00:02:04,131 --> 00:02:10,092
is the distance between the material

32
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:16,653
and the axes of the cross-section.

33
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,415
In the intermediate part here,

34
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:24,465
I have drawn a certain number of cross-sections which all

35
00:02:24,465 --> 00:02:28,071
use the same amount of material.

36
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:36,200
So, if these are steel shapes, they all have the same weight per meter.

37
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,125
What about their axes?

38
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,968
If we look here, we have the axes

39
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:44,332
- I am going to draw the axes for all these cross-sections -

40
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:07,493
the axis of the center of gravity.

41
00:03:07,493 --> 00:03:10,180
We can see that both these cross-sections here,

42
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,836
- the compact cross-sections -

43
00:03:11,836 --> 00:03:15,695
are not favorable since material is too close to the axes.

44
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:21,780
However here, these tubular cross-sections are favorable

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,311
since the material is on average very far from the axes.

46
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,417
There are small differences between the solutions,

47
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,182
but that is clear that the material is much further from the axis

48
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:33,235
than for these two solutions.

49
00:03:33,235 --> 00:03:36,953
And then here, the solution with a double T beam,

50
00:03:36,953 --> 00:03:42,733
is more or less favorable since actually that is favorable around this axis

51
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:56,132
and then less favorable around the other axis.

52
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:07,620
This type of structure can still be used if in one direction,

53
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,120
the one for which it is less favorable,

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,693
there are more intermediate supports than in the other direction.

55
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:17,020
In this case, we make an efficient use of this kind of cross-section.

56
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,830
However, it is better to use a tube.

57
00:04:20,695 --> 00:04:25,641
Let's look at this again, purely from the point of view of bending.

58
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:30,284
We have this fundamental solution with an element in compression

59
00:04:30,284 --> 00:04:33,454
and an element in tension.

60
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:38,285
Fundamentally, we have already seen the solution, it is an arch-cable.

61
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:48,160
We have also already seen this within the framework of this lesson, that is a guy-wire.

62
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,242
You remember that the first structure which I stabilized,

63
00:04:52,242 --> 00:04:54,270
I stabilized it with external wires or cables.

64
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,698
The use of external cables is thus a good solution,

65
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:59,622
a good structural variant because we have something

66
00:04:59,622 --> 00:05:01,253
which resists well horizontal loads

67
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:06,274
and which also deals well with the instability issues.

68
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,293
We want to find other variants for this structure.

69
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:12,166
That will be in the form of a truss,

70
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:16,416
for example a truss like this one.

71
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:31,226
This kind of truss is a favorable type of structure

72
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:35,414
to stabilize a structural element if we have loads which act downwards.

73
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,886
And then finally,

74
00:05:36,886 --> 00:05:41,851
all sorts of beams are also favorable for this. 

75
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,871
Here, I am going to draw an example of a beam

76
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,186
with diagonals in compression.

77
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,462
And then I have tension of course

78
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:06,918
on this side here and then in the posts.

79
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:13,979
This is also a favorable solution.

80
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,534
You should note that in the three cases, we need space.

81
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:22,975
The horizontal distance between the support which is in tension

82
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,218
and the support which is in compression is very large.

83
00:06:26,218 --> 00:06:31,782
Here, we thus have structures which resist well

84
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:42,002
horizontal forces

85
00:06:45,562 --> 00:06:52,233
and which are favorable for stability too.

86
00:06:58,588 --> 00:07:00,455
Let's see with this example ,

87
00:07:00,455 --> 00:07:04,424
which accompanied us during most of the semester,

88
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,082
what we can understand in these large trusses

89
00:07:08,082 --> 00:07:14,760
First of all, what we can see here is that both these elements are in tension.

90
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,374
- I think you know it now - 

91
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,292
and they are very thin elements.

92
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:22,446
Likewise, these elements of the lower chord,

93
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:25,275
there are also two, they are very thin,

94
00:07:27,755 --> 00:07:29,384
because they are in tension

95
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:31,257
so there are no instability problems.

96
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:34,584
That is also true for these diagonals

97
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:37,286
and then obviously for the rest of the lower chord.

98
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:41,685
Conversely, if we look at the upper element here, there are two tubes

99
00:07:41,685 --> 00:07:44,665
actually, we can see one behind the other.

100
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,836
And this is really thick.

101
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,036
Why?

102
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,491
Because we have taken two tubes. Here in the red part,

103
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:55,975
we managed to take elements with material very close to the axis

104
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,273
because they are in tension, there are no instability problems.

105
00:07:59,273 --> 00:08:02,970
on the contrary, for the upper chord

106
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,120
and then for the diagonals in compression,

107
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,784
we must use thick elements

108
00:08:13,164 --> 00:08:16,164
to insure stability.

109
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:21,417
So, these elements are thick but they are tubes.

110
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:22,813
So actually, they are not obviously

111
00:08:22,813 --> 00:08:25,195
much heavier than the red elements,

112
00:08:25,195 --> 00:08:29,145
however, they are a little bit more complicated to make.

113
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:33,215
On the external facade of this building,

114
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:40,435
we can recognize here elements which are extremely thick,

115
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:43,196
with large dimensions and, at the same time,

116
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:47,746
which work together with very thin elements.

117
00:08:47,746 --> 00:08:50,314
Here we have a type of structure,

118
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:54,355
which, working with the remaining part of the facade truss,

119
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:59,911
- there are these inversed V-shaped elements which are crucial -

120
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:04,415
can support horizontal loads induced by the wind or by an earthquake

121
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,633
and which would come from the left.

122
00:09:05,633 --> 00:09:10,165
We have the same structure upside down for the case of an earthquake or of wind

123
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,356
which would come from the right.

124
00:09:13,356 --> 00:09:18,775
To conlude, we are going to look at the structure of the Milenium Dome in London,

125
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,939
which was built for the 2012 Olympic Games.

126
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:26,528
We can see that all this roofing is suspended from cables

127
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:29,503
which are fastened to top of the masts.

128
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:37,276
So the load which act on these masts is relatively large.

129
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,638
There loads which come from the left,

130
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:41,096
from the right, with many different angles.

131
00:09:41,096 --> 00:09:44,808
But we essentially have a compressive internal force in this element.

132
00:09:46,098 --> 00:09:50,783
This element looks like my cane and it is going to bend in this way

133
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:57,757
when the critical buckling load will be reached.

134
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,873
What we can see

135
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:03,502
is that the curvature will be maximal in the central part.

136
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:08,316
So what was done for this solution,

137
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:14,061
was to give it a maximal depth

138
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,776
- the depth is the distance between the left part and the right part -

139
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:25,287
where the internal forces are the largest.

140
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:37,138
You maybe remember other structures which we have seen

141
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:41,005
which did not have a constant prismatic shape over their entire length,

142
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,834
well here, we have spread these elements

143
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:48,410
since it is where bending will tend to be larger.

144
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,172
We thus can find a solution to the stability issue by choosing,

145
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:56,089
that is important, a good cross-section, tubular cross-sections for example,

146
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,591
cross-sections with material away from the axes;

147
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:05,358
and then, making the longitudinal shape of the element vary

148
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:08,971
for it to deflect as little as possible.

149
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,083
In this video, we have seen

150
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:16,178
the internal forces and the deformations which are linked to stability.

151
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,888
We have seen that it is relatively similar

152
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:21,551
to what we have already seen for bending.

153
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,205
This leads to the fact that the cross-section with shapes

154
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:26,489
which are favorable to resist bending

155
00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:29,531
are also favorable to resist instability

156
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,103
and, just like in the case of bending,

157
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:36,612
we can adapt the shape of the element to give it a larger effective depth

158
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,540
where the internal forces are larger.
