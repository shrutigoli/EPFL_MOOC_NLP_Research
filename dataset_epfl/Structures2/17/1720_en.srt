00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:01,555
Hello,

2
00:00:01,555 --> 00:00:04,029
in this video, we will deal with support conditions

3
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,683
and I will introduce the concept of buckling length

4
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:10,953
which is essential for the theory of stability.

5
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:13,029
We will see two fundamental cases.

6
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:15,603
Actually, we have already seen them, but we will see them again.

7
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:18,559
We will introduce, within the framework of these fundamental cases,

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,575
the concept of buckling length,

9
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,604
then we will see the effect of supports on the buckling length,

10
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,652
as well as the effect of intermediate supports.

11
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:32,215
In the previous two videos, you have seen two cases of stability.

12
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:39,185
On the left, you have a cane, which bends taking the shape of half a wave.

13
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:42,375
And then, on the right, you have a vertical column,

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,863
clamped on its base, which bends taking the shape of a quarter wave.

15
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:48,841
Why do I talk about waves?

16
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:54,769
Because the shape a column takes when it reaches

17
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:59,302
its buckling critical load is the shape of the sine function.

18
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:06,675
So, here that is half a sine, if you want, between 0 and 180Â°,

19
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:08,678
if you know a bit about trigonometry,

20
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:11,648
but it is not necessary to know trigonometry 

21
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:13,966
for the following part of this course.

22
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:19,574
Here, I then have a column, with a height h

23
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,699
on the left.

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,409
We are rather going to say a height 2h.

25
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:42,624
And then, the right column has a height h.

26
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,245
Under the effect of a load applied on the top,

27
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:50,638
as we have seen it in the second video,

28
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:53,519
it is going to deflect in this way.

29
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,711
We call the buckling length, the length of the half wave.

30
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:06,040
So, for the left column, the buckling length

31
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:11,980
which I identify by L_fl,

32
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:15,388
is equal to 2h.

33
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:19,051
What is about the right column?

34
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,796
Here, we can see that we have a quarter wave.

35
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:23,217
Actually, the complete wave,

36
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:28,089
or rather the half wave, which would correspond to the other example,

37
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,935
would have this shape,

38
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:38,876
and then we would have a buckling length

39
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:43,227
such as for the left case,

40
00:02:46,797 --> 00:02:51,823
which is equal to 2 times the height of the column.

41
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:55,253
So what we can see here is that the buckling length

42
00:03:02,323 --> 00:03:04,070
of a column

43
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:12,781
depends on its support conditions.

44
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,915
The left columns has a hinged support on the bottom and a hinged support on the top,

45
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,659
whereas the right column

46
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,737
is clamped on its base but it does not have any supports on the top

47
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:33,154
so it can move transversally;

48
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:34,524
consequently, as we can see,

49
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:38,731
its buckling length is larger, it is actually twice its height.

50
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:41,864
We are going to see a whole series of cases,

51
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:46,276
all these columns have the same height this time

52
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:51,835
but they have varying support conditions.

53
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:58,538
Here, I have a series of columns with the same height h

54
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:05,240
and then, the leftmost one, that is the case we have previously seen,

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,253
so that is the case of a column clamped on its base.

56
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:15,063
And then below, we have the other half wave

57
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:19,161
with a buckling length of 2h.

58
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:36,337
If the column, in addition to be clamped on its base, is held on its top,

59
00:04:36,337 --> 00:04:37,643
what happens?

60
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:38,780
On the top,

61
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,687
it will not be able to move transversally, but it will be able to rotate.

62
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:45,016
However, it will not be able to rotate at the base,

63
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:49,020
it is thus going to deform according to this shape.

64
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,389
We try to identify the wave.

65
00:04:54,389 --> 00:05:00,367
Maybe I am going to take another color to facilitate the identification.

66
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:09,229
Here, you can see in orange, we find the half wave.

67
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:13,679
And then, for this column, with these particular support conditions,

68
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:19,661
we will have a buckling length smaller than h.

69
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:29,392
Typically, the buckling length is 0.7h.

70
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,148
If I now keep the support on the top,

71
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:38,586
the same than here but now I enable rotation at the base,

72
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,895
we are going to have a deflected shape which we have already seen.

73
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:48,195
We thus have a wave, I mean, a half wave which is like this.

74
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:53,340
And then that is the fundamental case of the cane we saw before,

75
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,918
the buckling length is equal to the height of the column.

76
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:08,013
If we have a column clamped at its base like both these columns here,

77
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,819
but which, in addition, cannot rotate on the top,

78
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,364
thus the column can go down but cannot rotate,

79
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,806
this means that there will no rotation here,

80
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:16,996
the deflected shape will be like this

81
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:19,631
and there will not be any rotation at the base either.

82
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:29,171
I take the orange color again

83
00:06:29,171 --> 00:06:39,212
to identify that we have the half wave in the middle part

84
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:44,316
and thus the buckling length of this column

85
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:48,570
is equal to half its height.

86
00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,173
Finally, we have here a case in which we do not enable rotation either;

87
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,984
but we enable displacement.

88
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,368
What is going to happen?

89
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:04,238
This column cannot rotate on the top, it cannot rotate on the bottom,

90
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:09,057
but it can transversally move on the top.

91
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:13,071
How are we going to find the wave?

92
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:18,837
We will have here a half wave, such as the one we had in this case,

93
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:22,001
and then we would have the other half wave below.

94
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:30,770
As a result, the buckling length for these support conditions

95
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,924
is equal to the height of the column.

96
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:38,028
But that is quite different from this case

97
00:07:38,028 --> 00:07:39,783
because here, that was also the height of the column,

98
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,796
but the buckling deflected shape,

99
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:43,402
the shape taken by the column

100
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:47,150
is fundamentally different from this case here.

101
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,582
Why is it important?

102
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:52,294
Because the critical load, as I said before,

103
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,221
depends on the height

104
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:58,717
or more exactly, the critical load

105
00:07:58,717 --> 00:08:03,868
is inversely proportional to the square of the buckling length.

106
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,510
That is very important.

107
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,751
That means that if we divide the buckling length by two,

108
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:14,813
then the critical load is multiplied by 4.

109
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:19,265
You remember, at the beginning, I proposed you two configurations.

110
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,502
The configuration with the Romans.

111
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:26,289
This Roman temple essentially has this configuration.

112
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,881
The columns are not really held

113
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,672
by what is on top of the structure

114
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,026
and that means that we can have

115
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:38,012
a displacement with a buckling length of about 2h

116
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:45,617
while the solution of Norman Foster rather locates here,

117
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:49,703
with a buckling length which is the half.

118
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:52,240
We thus have a factor 4 on the buckling length,

119
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,501
so the solution of Romans and the solution of Norman Foster..

120
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,540
that means that Norman Foster, for the same column,

121
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,863
would have a critical load 16 times larger.

122
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:04,790
You remember, his column does not have the same size

123
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,027
because he does not need such a large critical load.

124
00:09:07,027 --> 00:09:08,225
It is much smaller.

125
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:12,170
And moreover, that is amplified by the fact that in the case of Norman Foster,

126
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,618
steel was used, a material with a very very large strength

127
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:18,747
while Romans used stone,

128
00:09:18,747 --> 00:09:21,030
which has a smaller strength.

129
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,852
That really explains the possibility,

130
00:09:22,852 --> 00:09:25,429
if we choose well the support conditions,

131
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:30,821
to decrease the dimensions of a column for a given length.

132
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,822
There is another case which is interesting,

133
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:37,269
which is the one of an intermediate support on a column.

134
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:39,675
Here I have the basic column, the one we have already seen,

135
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:42,174
that is the same cane than before.

136
00:09:42,174 --> 00:09:45,013
It deflects in this way.

137
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:50,735
But if now I hold it in an intermediate way;

138
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:53,526
it can for example be a facade

139
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,357
which leans on the slabs of a building;

140
00:09:56,357 --> 00:10:00,929
then, the facade element is going to deform

141
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:04,306
in this way under the effect of buckling.

142
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:07,445
And then, if we had at first,

143
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:17,890
a buckling length which was equal to the height of the structure;

144
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:22,896
I am going to add the total dimension,

145
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:26,162
the total length of my column which is h.

146
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,408
Here, I have a buckling length which is equal to h.

147
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:39,928
Already in the second case, we can see that we have two half waves.

148
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:43,941
Actually, we have a complete sine in the second configuration.

149
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:48,744
Here I have a buckling length which is equal to h/2.

150
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,873
That means that the critical load, if we keep everything else identical,

151
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,676
the critical load is already 4 times larger.

152
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:59,501
If now I manage to have two intermediate supports,

153
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:05,330
then the deflected shape is going to have this appearance,

154
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,625
with a buckling length

155
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,899
which is equal to the length between the supports,

156
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:21,228
the distance between the supports, and in this case,

157
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:25,642
the bucklin length is equal to h/3,

158
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:32,865
which means that the critical load will be 3 squared so 9 times larger.

159
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:38,244
If we manage to hold in an intermediate way a compressed element,

160
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:42,306
it will significantly increase its buckling resistance

161
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:45,664
and it will therefore decrease the risk of instability.

162
00:11:46,194 --> 00:11:49,962
In this video, we have seen two fundamental cases of stability,

163
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:54,021
a column which is hinged on the top and on the bottom,

164
00:11:54,021 --> 00:11:56,885
and a column which is only clamped at its base.

165
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:59,472
We have introduced the concept of buckling length

166
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:03,644
and we have seen the effect that the supports have on this buckling length

167
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:07,990
and, as a consequence, on the critical buckling load.

168
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,481
We have also seen that intermediate supports

169
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,634
along a compressed element contribute in a significant way

170
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:18,547
to increase this critical load by reducing the buckling length.
