00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,051
Hello, in this video,

2
00:00:02,051 --> 00:00:05,944
we will see how to stabilize a bar in compression

3
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:10,352
and then, I will introduce the concept of the buckling deflected shape.

4
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:13,567
We are going to start with a bar in compression,

5
00:00:13,857 --> 00:00:16,206
we are going to stabilize it with guy-wires,

6
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:19,666
in the way we learned -- we have seen it in &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

7
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,428
And then, we are going to look at how these structures can remain in equilibrium

8
00:00:23,428 --> 00:00:25,522
when we deform them a bit.

9
00:00:26,178 --> 00:00:30,172
And then, I will introduce the principle of the critical buckling load.

10
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:36,163
I will discuss the importance of the deflected shape and of the buckling length.

11
00:00:36,893 --> 00:00:39,330
In this video, you can see a vertical bar stabilized

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,198
by two guy-wires on the left and on the right.

13
00:00:41,198 --> 00:00:43,991
These guy-wiresare chains, but, on the bottom, they have springs.

14
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,052
I have first placed only one spring on each side,

15
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:49,518
then, you can see that with only one spring, the structure deforms.

16
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:55,060
However, here, I put two springs, and you can see that I can place my load

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,041
and the structure holds.

18
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:01,173
If I move it a bit leftwards, it holds and comes back to its initial position

19
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:05,832
and if I move it a bit rightwards, likewise, it comes back to its initial position.

20
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,644
Here, the structure is in a stable state.

21
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:11,521
If I now add a second load,

22
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:17,776
you can see the same behavior than the one we have seen before with a single spring,

23
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:20,606
so the structures ends up giving way

24
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:22,923
It gave way on the right while before it was on the left,

25
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:24,849
that is not very important.

26
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,204
Here, we have a structural scheme for this structure,

27
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:31,345
so we are going to place a load of ten Newtons.

28
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,653
We have recognized well in our...

29
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,263
in our configuration

30
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,504
this load of 10N.

31
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:43,224
We will work on it in a force diagram later on,

32
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,482
so I already introduce it.

33
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,491
This is the initial position.

34
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,359
What interests me is especially the deformed position.

35
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:52,527
In the deformed position, what do we have?

36
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:56,572
We have a bar which is compressed, because the force of 10N

37
00:01:56,572 --> 00:02:00,143
must be taken by an element.

38
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:05,758
Then, at the same time, the left guy-wires is in tension.

39
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:09,014
To simplify, but it does not change much,

40
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:13,447
we are going to neglect the right wire

41
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,517
to only consider the left one.

42
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:22,949
Here, I look at a free-body, so I do not cut the right wire,

43
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,023
because the right wire does not exist anymore,

44
00:02:27,513 --> 00:02:31,933
but I insert my force of 10N,

45
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:35,965
Then in the direction parallel to the cable,

46
00:02:35,965 --> 00:02:40,955
I insert the internal force, the tension in the wire.

47
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,966
We are going to get back to it later on.

48
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,874
Then, finally, the polygon of forces

49
00:02:48,874 --> 00:02:53,287
is closed by the compressive internal force

50
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:55,847
in the bar.

51
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:57,969
Now, what is the value of this tension?

52
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,566
What we can see is that, actually,

53
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:04,966
the bar changed its length,

54
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:08,435
here, initially, it was 17.5,

55
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,265
and then, now, it is --

56
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:13,888
it lengthened, here,

57
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:18,048
of a value delta L,

58
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:19,880
it lengthened.

59
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,775
Then, since we have a spring --

60
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,873
we are going to consider that the entire bar is a spring,

61
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:26,183
which is not exactly the case in my experiment,

62
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:30,663
but the additional internal force due to the lengthening of the shroud

63
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:32,063
is equal to K,

64
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:36,107
the spring constant in Newton per millimeter,

65
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:37,897
times delta L.

66
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:42,677
What happened during the first experiment

67
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:43,683
I have just shown?

68
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:47,605
Well, the value of K being too small, maybe we actually only reached

69
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,823
a force which had this value here.

70
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:52,518
And then, at this moment, equilibrium was not possible,

71
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:56,186
since the compression needed to be larger

72
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:58,143
that what could be offered by the system.

73
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:02,453
Then, we have doubled: we have put two K by placing two springs

74
00:04:02,453 --> 00:04:07,188
in the lower part of the model, and then this equilibrium became possible.

75
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:09,660
So, this is the equilibrium

76
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,745
in a deflected

77
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:18,954
position.

78
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:24,672
The principle for stability: we always try

79
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,196
to express the equilibrium of the structure in its deflected position.

80
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:30,650
So, that is a good news, we have seen that our bar,

81
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,057
which was unstable when we had not any guy-wires,

82
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:35,967
can be stabilized.

83
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:41,207
We call the critical buckling load, the load --

84
00:04:41,207 --> 00:04:43,116
we are just going to draw it here on the right --

85
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:46,313
the critical load,

86
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:53,093
that is the maximum load

87
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,106
beyond which

88
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:15,518
the structure is unstable.

89
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:22,240
We have seen it in the experiment,

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,006
when I tried to add a second load of 10N,

91
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:27,664
the structure became unstable.

92
00:05:27,664 --> 00:05:30,566
So, somewhere between both, there was a load

93
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:34,356
which was just acceptable, maybe 15N, I do not know,

94
00:05:34,356 --> 00:05:38,834
which was acceptable, and then beyond, the structure becomes unstable.

95
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:41,302
So, we call this load, the critical buckling load,

96
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:44,168
and obviously, it is important not to exceed it,

97
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,913
because otherwise, we will have this instability phenomenon.

98
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:50,195
Here, I have a second model which is similar,

99
00:05:50,195 --> 00:05:54,345
so, I have a bamboo, the one you have seen before with the cane,

100
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:58,919
which is clamped at its base, and then, I place a load of 10N

101
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,821
on top of it through a small steel element,

102
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,983
and then, we can see that the structure is stable.

103
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,911
If I proceed to the same experiment with a steel bar,

104
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:13,953
it is a bit wider, but it could have the same size,

105
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:19,241
we can see that the structure remains stable, and then, I add a whole series of weights,

106
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:23,437
just to show that the structure is really much more stable.

107
00:06:23,947 --> 00:06:29,049
The type of material, and specifically the modulus of elasticity of the material,

108
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:33,705
is very important for the stability phenomenon,

109
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:36,724
that is why we can see more concrete columns,

110
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:40,504
or even steel columns when the instability phenomenon

111
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,571
is very significant.

112
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:47,915
The buckling deflected shape is the shape that my column takes

113
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:51,006
when I apply on it a compressive load.

114
00:06:53,336 --> 00:06:55,052
The structure is going to take

115
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,550
this shape,

116
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:05,814
it is thus going to move aside

117
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:18,216
the pressure line --

118
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,856
the pressure line, in this case, that is very clear

119
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:27,216
that it is going to extend vertically downwards.

120
00:07:27,357 --> 00:07:29,424
We move aside from it in this case.

121
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:34,148
The buckling

122
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,630
deflected shape

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,795
is the shape taken

124
00:07:48,655 --> 00:07:51,365
by a compressed

125
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,495
element

126
00:07:57,274 --> 00:08:02,939
under an applied load.

127
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,543
You will maybe tell me: &quot;If I have a column

128
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:12,600
which is perfectly rectilinear, then I will not have this deflection.&quot;

129
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,715
Maybe in theory,

130
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:20,143
but it will be sufficient that, at the beginning, the structure is slightly imperfect

131
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:24,345
for it to start moving aside at a given moment.

132
00:08:24,345 --> 00:08:27,369
We cannot assume to have a perfect column,

133
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:29,912
because it will never be perfect, in reality,

134
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:35,164
and, anyway, eventually, when we will be close to the critical load,

135
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:37,408
then it will start deforming,

136
00:08:37,408 --> 00:08:39,804
but in practise, it starts much earlier.

137
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,192
Another thing which is significant

138
00:08:42,192 --> 00:08:45,324
is the influence of the length of our column.

139
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,405
I am just going to show it on the left,

140
00:08:48,845 --> 00:08:51,264
and then, for the others, you will do it mentally

141
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,349
or you will add it in your notes, whatever.

142
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:56,787
Here, I have a length h

143
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,517
for my column,

144
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:03,812
so I will have a quite low load.

145
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:07,496
If I have a length h for my column,

146
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:14,677
I will have a certain critical buckling load: Qcrit.

147
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:21,685
If I take a column half as high --

148
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,317
so, here, I have h/2 --

149
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:30,005
I am going to have a quite increased critical load,

150
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:37,357
I divide again the length of the column by two

151
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:39,752
to reach h/4.

152
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:45,124
I am going to increase again the critical load,

153
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:54,149
and then, I divide again this length,

154
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:57,142
then I will have a value which becomes very large,

155
00:09:57,142 --> 00:10:01,557
I cannot even represent it, but it is somewhere here on the top:

156
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,548
h/8t.

157
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,808
All this has

158
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,608
a hyperbolic shape,

159
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:20,284
because the critical load is proportional

160
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,335
to one

161
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:25,315
over the length of our column squared.

162
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:29,995
We call this curve the Euler's curve,

163
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:36,054
Euler was a Swiss mathematician who was interested in many problems

164
00:10:36,054 --> 00:10:38,517
including this stability problem.

165
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,138
The critical load cannot exceed a certain value --

166
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:45,275
I am going to draw it, for example, around here.

167
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:52,748
Here, this value corresponds to the strength of the cross-section,

168
00:10:52,748 --> 00:10:56,140
that is to say the area of the cross-section times the compressive strength of the material used.

169
00:10:56,774 --> 00:11:02,464
We can, in theory, go further with the Euler's curve,

170
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:06,387
but we will be limited to a certain value of this critical load,

171
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,909
but which would be very interesting to reach.

172
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,418
What happens if we exceed the limit load?

173
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:19,535
So, I place a second load, and my bamboo bendst erribly,

174
00:11:20,235 --> 00:11:24,766
but actually, it still does not break, but it is terribly deflected.

175
00:11:24,766 --> 00:11:27,896
We took off one load, it remained quite deformed,

176
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:32,613
now, I put a third one, and then, here, the bamboo breaks,

177
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:39,353
so indeed, the result, if we exceed the ultimate buckling load

178
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:42,334
we are going to have a tremendous increase of deformations

179
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:46,171
and then, as a result, a tremendous increase of internal forces,

180
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,825
we will talk about internal forces in the next video,

181
00:11:49,035 --> 00:11:51,236
and then, in this case, the bamboo collapses

182
00:11:51,696 --> 00:11:54,134
without any hopes to save it.

183
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:55,545
In this video,

184
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:58,421
we have seen how the equilibrium of a compressed bar

185
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:00,846
enables us to understand the stability phenomenon,

186
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,054
and to understand how to really stabilize a bar.

187
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,923
The importance comes from the stiffness of the springs,

188
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:10,296
so stiffness is an important parameter

189
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,216
for the stability phenomenon.

190
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:17,255
Concerning buckling, we have introduced the concept of critical load,

191
00:12:17,255 --> 00:12:19,825
and then, that of deflected shape.

192
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:22,078
We have not talked yet about its length,

193
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:23,930
this is coming in the next video.

194
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:27,698
Then, we have seen that, finally, if we exceed all the values,

195
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:31,749
then the strength of the material is going to lead to the final collapse.
