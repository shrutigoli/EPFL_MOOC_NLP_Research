00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,900
Hello, in this video, I will talk about the beams with cantilevers,

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,310
and about Gerber beams.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,490
So far, in these videos, we have mostly looked at

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,580
what happens in Gerber trusses.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,580
And we now want to look at what happens in Gerber beams.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,760
We will see what is the effect of the cantilevers,

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,380
how the combination of the internal forces works in beams with cantilevers,

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,520
how to build Gerber beams, in particular the Gerber joints

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,350
between the elements, then we will see how it can be interesting

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,350
to use Gerber beams in agreement with the construction process.

11
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,708
Here, we are going to compare various configurations of beams.

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:45,928
We will always have an arch and a cable.

13
00:00:48,887 --> 00:00:55,377
This arch and this cable form if we have a simple beam here, subjected

14
00:00:55,377 --> 00:01:02,587
to a uniformly distributed load over the whole length of the beam,

15
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:08,886
a uniform load q.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,790
And then you can see that here the beams have a greater length,

17
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,180
and in all the cases, that is going to be distributed over the whole length of the beam,

18
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,540
not only on the central part, but here, since we have not a beam

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,520
which goes further, here we have a length L.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,770
And then, we are going to compare each time the length of the cantilever l'

21
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,440
to the reference length L.

22
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,280
So, initially, we have a simple beam, without any cantilevers, l' over L equals to zero.

23
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,999
We have a rise which is equal to f, which is the maximal distance between the arch and the cable,

24
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,749
which is obviously at mid-span.

25
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:53,969
And then we have a radius of curvature... an upward curvature,

26
00:01:53,969 --> 00:01:57,039
with a radius of curvature which indicates it.

27
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,499
If we create two small cantilevers of 0.2 times the span, on the left and on the right,

28
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:06,149
then the arch takes this shape,

29
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:12,303
again under the uniform loads distributed over the whole length of the beam,

30
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:14,753
and then the cable is here.

31
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:23,637
Between the arch and the cable, we have a rise which decreased to 0.84f at mid-span,

32
00:02:23,637 --> 00:02:26,427
therefore the internal forces are smaller than before,

33
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:30,377
however, we have a small rise of 0.16f, so internal forces,

34
00:02:30,377 --> 00:02:33,457
while before, in theory, the internal forces were zero at the supports

35
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,537
since the distance was zero.

36
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:40,617
For the curvature, we still have an upward curvature,

37
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:44,477
over the whole length of the beam, even if we can see a little 

38
00:02:44,477 --> 00:02:48,417
something which tends to bend in the other direction at the ends.

39
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:57,837
If we lengthen the cantilever to approximately 0.35L, what we can notice is that

40
00:02:57,837 --> 00:03:05,867
the cable is located at mid-depth between the upper part and the lower part of the arch.

41
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:16,344
We can see it here, with 0.5f upwards, and 0.5f downwards at the supports.

42
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:21,686
You can note that now, the internal force is half of what it was before.

43
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:25,866
That is a quite interesting configuration to have a beam with cantilevers

44
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:30,076
which are about 0.35, approximately 1/3 of the span.

45
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:37,376
If we increase the length of these cantilever to 0.4 times the span,

46
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:45,756
then the configuration has this shape, that is to say that the arch tends to be

47
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:49,956
lower than the cable, except in the central part.

48
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:58,007
That is to say that we have 0.33f, 1/3 of the initial rise, at mid-span,

49
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:02,427
and 2/3 of the initial rise on the supports.

50
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:06,697
The curvature - I have forgotten to do it for the case of 0.35 -

51
00:04:06,697 --> 00:04:10,787
here we had a curvature upwards in the central part,

52
00:04:10,787 --> 00:04:14,687
and here a curvature downwards, on the sides.

53
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:21,091
For the case l'/L = 0.4, we still can see a bit of upward curvature

54
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:25,681
in the central part, but we especially have a downward curvature

55
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:31,211
in most of the structure, from here to here.

56
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:37,769
Finally, the last step here is to have l'/L = 0.5,

57
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:44,529
that is to say cantilevers which are as long as 0.5 times the span between both supports.

58
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,739
And in this case, the arch is completely under the cable,

59
00:04:54,282 --> 00:05:00,732
As a result, as we can see it here, the rise is here integral.

60
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:05,812
The rise is equal to f, but in this case, it is entirely on the supports,

61
00:05:05,812 --> 00:05:09,472
at mid-span, the internal forces are equal to zero.

62
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:14,001
If we look at the curvature, over the entire length of the beam,

63
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:17,491
we now have a downward curvature.

64
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,981
The upward curvature has entirely disappeared,

65
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,341
there is only a downward curvature now.

66
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:26,811
So we can see that the effect of the cantilevers on a beam is very significant,

67
00:05:26,811 --> 00:05:32,601
it can significantly reduce the internal forces and change the deformations.

68
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:39,631
The cantilevers of about 1/3 of the span enable to decrease the internal forces

69
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,141
as much as possible, dividing them by two.

70
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:47,075
What we have just seen about beams with cantilevers,

71
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:51,075
the animals know it, at least their skeleton is built in a way

72
00:05:51,075 --> 00:05:56,125
which demonstrates that it is efficient under the effect of these loads.

73
00:05:56,125 --> 00:06:04,205
An animal is schematized here as a beam with two cantilevers, and

74
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:12,105
we can see here, the muscles are tied at the top of its spine, we have system

75
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,195
of muscles which is like this: the rear is very limited here with

76
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:21,825
a very small tail, but we can see that its system is well adapated.

77
00:06:21,825 --> 00:06:27,915
In the first case, it is a cow which is characterized by

78
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:35,815
a very heavy head, it is thus necessary to have a large depth here,

79
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:39,715
since that is here that the internal forces are maximal

80
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:42,195
to support the weight of the head.

81
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:47,565
The animal on the bottom, I think you have guessed what it is,

82
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:50,495
that is a diplodocus.

83
00:06:52,958 --> 00:07:00,468
Here we have a different configuration with a very long tail, then again

84
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:05,828
a spinal column able to carry compression,

85
00:07:05,828 --> 00:07:08,468
and then a relatively small head.

86
00:07:08,468 --> 00:07:13,908
So the internal forces are going to... the muscles are going to be tied at

87
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:18,068
the top of the crest, here. And we can notice that there is

88
00:07:18,068 --> 00:07:24,478
a good similarity between the shape which is given to this animal,

89
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:31,198
and the internal forces which are likely to act on it: essentially uniformly

90
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:35,088
distributed loads, probably slightly variable,

91
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:39,018
there are a bit more load in the middle than at the ends, but there are no

92
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:42,578
large loads like the one of the head of the cow.

93
00:07:43,579 --> 00:07:48,019
In this video, I show you how we can build a Gerber beam.

94
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:54,539
We have already seen this for trusses with the example of the Forth bridge.

95
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,619
We can then build the left beam and the right beam

96
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,759
with cantilevers - for example, above a highway -

97
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,759
then afterwards, we can place the central part which misses and which will be able

98
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,439
to carry loads and to distribute them onto the elements on the left and on the right.

99
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:18,204
So we can notice that the middle beam takes support on the end of the cantilevers

100
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,144
of the left beam, and of the right beam.

101
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:27,187
Obviously, we cannot drive on such a structure, so we must create

102
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:31,187
a joint to make what we have drawn here:

103
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:37,677
that is to say, we have drawn something with a support which is placed on the top,

104
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:41,557
but obviously, a vehicle or a pedestrian could not pass here.

105
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:47,017
So what we want to do is to create a joint which enables traffic to pass

106
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:55,737
without problem, while corresponding to what has been decided.

107
00:09:01,753 --> 00:09:05,753
So we are going to create the first beam which is the one on which

108
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:12,273
the second beam is going to take support, then we are going to put a support here.

109
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:16,593
That could be for example a neoprene block, we have seen that during the first semester.

110
00:09:16,593 --> 00:09:22,233
Then, we will have the second part of the second beam which will have a complementary

111
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:27,273
shape to take support on this element.

112
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:34,383
I will show you soon a picture of such a detail.

113
00:09:34,383 --> 00:09:38,383
So here, that is a support.

114
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:45,451
And obviously, with this, we have created a flat surface on which

115
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:50,281
we can pass, and something which also respects the fact that the arch and the cable

116
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,281
must cross in one point, that is going to be this point here, which is the support.

117
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,407
There is a problem with this configuration

118
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:00,057
when we apply it to bridges.

119
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,862
Why?

120
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:17,000
When we have a bridge, we are going to have here a water inlet, H2O, plus, if we are

121
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,247
in a northern country for example, salt, Na Cl, or chlorides in general.

122
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:31,267
With the possibility here to go through the joint, the water is going to attack these zones here.

123
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:35,937
These zones are not easy to inspect or to repair.

124
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:40,517
As a consequence, the bridge is going to deteriorate in this zone here.

125
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:46,557
In this case, we are going to avoid Gerber joints.

126
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,173
But these joints are absolutely practicable in other types

127
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:02,393
of constructions which are not exposed, or less exposed to the aggressive action

128
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:09,053
of water and salt: for example, in buildings, it is a practicable solution.

129
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:16,573
So here, without too much detail because we have just seen it,

130
00:11:16,573 --> 00:11:22,563
we are going to create this Gerber joint, on the left and on the right,

131
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:30,435
to enable the support of the beam such as we have designed it.

132
00:11:30,435 --> 00:11:34,335
- I draw it in one go not to waste time -

133
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:44,230
So, we have what enables us to make what I have demonstrated to you

134
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,850
with the model, with a beam which is now a Gerber beam.

135
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,950
Let's just check if it is statically determinate or not.

136
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:02,200
So here we have two support reactions. Here we have one, here one, and here too.

137
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,570
So we have a total of five support reactions.

138
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:13,890
Let's now count the number of bars: we have one, two, three bars.

139
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:19,365
Let's now count the number of nodes: we have one node here,

140
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:21,775
- but not here because that is not the end of a bar -

141
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:25,775
a second node here, a third node here, a fourth one.

142
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:30,775
I thus have two times four which is equal to eigth,

143
00:12:31,595 --> 00:12:35,595
and therefore the structure is statically determinate.

144
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:44,265
So Gerber beams, because we have added a certain number of joints,

145
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:49,615
remain statically determinate while normally, if we have a beam

146
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:53,512
which has more than two supports, it would be statically indeterminate.

147
00:12:54,298 --> 00:13:01,028
Here I have an example of Gerber slab, which I have observed at the Bern train station.

148
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:06,128
Here we have a Gerber joint, another Gerber joint on the other side.

149
00:13:06,128 --> 00:13:10,768
It is quite clear that these elements on the left and on the right have been built

150
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:14,848
first and that this slab has been added later.

151
00:13:14,848 --> 00:13:18,724
Here, there is no joint problem since this is a zone which

152
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:22,404
is not exposed to salt, it is even quite dry.

153
00:13:22,404 --> 00:13:26,404
So that is a good solution which enables a very rational construction.

154
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:32,144
You remember that in the first example of beam with cantilever,

155
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:36,114
I could, increasing the load at the end of the cantilever,

156
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:40,964
lift up the opposite supports. When I have a Gerber beam,

157
00:13:40,964 --> 00:13:45,274
I can also have this configuration in which the end supports lift up.

158
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:47,834
- of course, it is necessary to apply a larger force -

159
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:51,404
That is not necessarily a problem, but in some configurations,

160
00:13:51,404 --> 00:13:55,514
it is necessary to be careful with the construction process to avoid it happening.

161
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:59,954
If it had to happen, that could be catastrophic.

162
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:04,384
The solution is often to ballast, or to retain the supports to

163
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,288
prevent them from lifting up.

164
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:13,359
Here we have an example from the 1950's of a bridge in Italy with Gerber joints.

165
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:18,359
We cannot see them well, so I am going to evidence them.

166
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:31,109
Here we have a Gerber joint, here too, and then here too for each of these beams.

167
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,949
So we have two families of beams: we have already seen this configuration

168
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:45,069
when we were looking at Gerber trusses.

169
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:51,619
We have these large beams here, with cantilevers,

170
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:58,457
and Gerber joints at the end.

171
00:15:03,505 --> 00:15:08,515
So it corresponds here to this configuration here on the top.

172
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:26,250
And then between these beams, we have beams which have been placed at a later stage.

173
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,440
- I draw them in blue -

174
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,040
This kind of construction was very popular in Italy because

175
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,490
it really makes sense to use Gerber joints

176
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,240
since it enables to build very quickly.

177
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,830
Obviously, the previously notified problem for these Gerber joints

178
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,400
remains valid: that is something which we did not know at that time,

179
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,150
but that now we would avoid building.

180
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:58,743
So here, we have parts of Gerber beams.

181
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:08,365
In this applet, I have already inserted all the loads,

182
00:16:08,365 --> 00:16:13,115
as well as the initial values for the support reactions.

183
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:18,885
I am going to show you how we can obtain the solution of this structure.

184
00:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,885
So I call the funicular polygon, then I select, using

185
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:30,095
the Control button, the support reactions, which are obviously not correct.

186
00:16:30,095 --> 00:16:34,675
What will be necessary is that the arch and the cable cross

187
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:39,715
in all these points, so, for this, I am going to, pressing the Shift button ,

188
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:45,035
slowly increase the support reaction, then we can see that as we go along,

189
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:50,912
it goes down, and we did not exactly reach it yet, still a little step, one try.

190
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:58,522
That is not easy, we have to be accurate. Here, that is not that bad.

191
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:01,523
We can see that here the arch and the cable cross,

192
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:04,213
here that is quite close, here too, and so on.

193
00:17:04,213 --> 00:17:07,853
So with this, we have just solved a system

194
00:17:07,853 --> 00:17:11,853
where there was four unknown forces, four support reactions, in such a way

195
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:16,353
that the system works as expected, like a Gerber beam.

196
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:20,713
You will have the opportunity to do the same kind of work in your exercises.

197
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,966
In this video, I show you how to build a Gerber beam

198
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:32,233
with a different system: usually, we built end beams,

199
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:37,104
then we placed an element in the middle. Here, we start by the left,

200
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:43,884
we create two supports, then a beam with a cantilever, an additional support

201
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:48,174
on which we place the following beam, which also has a cantilever

202
00:17:48,174 --> 00:17:53,971
on which the last beam is going to lean, carried as well by the last support.

203
00:17:53,971 --> 00:18:00,211
That corresponds in a quite accurate way to the construction sequence of a bridge.

204
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:10,691
For example, we can imagine to have here a first beam which we have built.

205
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,050
Under this beam, we have a scaffolding,

206
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:29,421
with temporary supports, something like this.

207
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:35,898
Then we are going to be able to take off this scaffolding,

208
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:45,378
to move to the second beam which we are going to build here.

209
00:18:46,762 --> 00:18:51,422
So we will have disassembled the scaffolding, and we will be able to re-assemble it

210
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:56,902
under the second beam, here,

211
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:05,707
with again some posts.

212
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:10,321
Thanks to this way to proceed, we will succeed to build the entire

213
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,141
structure, for example a bridge, but it can be something else,

214
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:18,141
in a logical way, using the parts which are already built

215
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:22,141
as supports for the parts which still need to be built.

216
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:28,961
Here on the bottom, I have drawn, as seen previously, a practical solution

217
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:34,621
for this configuration of Gerber beams, with intermediate supports.

218
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,391
Again, that is not a solution which is used nowadays for bridges,

219
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:42,551
but for other types of structures, that is not a problem.

220
00:19:42,551 --> 00:19:48,011
Finally, here, a configuration with slightly particular Gerber joints

221
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:51,481
for the Confederation bridge in Canada.

222
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:56,671
What we can see under is the estuary of the Saint-Lawrence River, which can be

223
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:00,671
seriously frozen during part of winter.

224
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:05,641
On the other hand, that is a zone by which big ships, oil tankers, etc, pass.

225
00:20:05,641 --> 00:20:12,391
What could happen, in one of the scenarios which have been considered, is that one of these ships

226
00:20:12,393 --> 00:20:17,093
hit the bridge which would risk to be damaged.

227
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:21,979
What is the strategy which has been set up for the bridge not to be entirely

228
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:26,622
lost in the event of an impact? What we have done is that we have created

229
00:20:26,622 --> 00:20:32,928
Gerber joints at the ends of segments which are delimited

230
00:20:32,928 --> 00:20:34,805
every two piers.

231
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:45,701
Between these Gerber seals, we have placed a structural element, that element here,

232
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:54,558
in the middle, so every two elements, there is a blue element, and so forth,

233
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,558
over all the length of the bridge. If an impact had to occur,

234
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,468
and that, let's say, we lost this part, in orange, because there had been an impact on

235
00:21:04,468 --> 00:21:11,178
one of these two piers, this orange part would thus fall down, and also the two blue

236
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:15,448
parts since they take support on the orange part, but

237
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:21,198
the rest of the bridge would remain stable, because the other elements of the bridge would not be

238
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:25,209
affected: this Gerber element has been placed with a crane later on,

239
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:29,209
so we could let it fall down into the water and rebuild

240
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:34,209
the orange element to make the bridge continuous again.

241
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,349
That is an unusual strategy, as I said,

242
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:40,289
usually we do not really like Gerber joints in bridges,

243
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:43,699
but in this case here, there is a logic to respect.

244
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:46,859
In this video, I have shown you the effect of cantilevers on beams,

245
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,599
how the combination of beams with cantilevers, of intermediate beams,

246
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,679
is very interesting, how, in Gerber beams, we solve the problem

247
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,560
of details using Gerber joints, and some examples of application.
