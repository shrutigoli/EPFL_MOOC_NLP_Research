00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,024
Hello.

2
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,886
In this video, I am going to talk to you about superimposed shear walls,

3
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:07,001
we could also say about the superimposed wall-beams.

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,761
The principle is to put a shear wall

5
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,293
or a wall-beam, on top of another

6
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:16,709
and as you will see, that enables us to have a great flexibility

7
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:20,378
in the creation of rather modern buildings

8
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:24,472
which have a free layout.

9
00:00:24,472 --> 00:00:27,625
The structure I am showing you here is a very simple structure,

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,841
it schematizes modern buildings,

11
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,744
I will show you by the way some examples thereafter

12
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,288
which are very dispossessed and which have of a great freedom

13
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:39,125
in the layout of the storeys thanks to the use

14
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:41,962
of superimposed wall-beams.

15
00:00:41,962 --> 00:00:44,800
We only have four posts at the ground level

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,625
which can only carry a vertical internal force,

17
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:52,744
to be honest, that is clear that in a structure nowadays,

18
00:00:52,744 --> 00:00:56,275
there should also be elements to carry horizontal internal forces,

19
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:58,953
for example the ones induced by earthquakes or wind,

20
00:00:58,953 --> 00:01:02,053
in this example here, that is not considered

21
00:01:02,053 --> 00:01:04,701
but obviously, it would be necessary to add these elements.

22
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,875
That would be some additional horizontal load-bearing elements.

23
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:13,612
Here, I add a first level which is constituted of four beams

24
00:01:13,612 --> 00:01:15,741
which cross in twos.

25
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,824
I put the intersections of the beams on the columns

26
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:22,182
and you can see that I can very easily place my load

27
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,912
of 10 Newtons on this structure

28
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:27,052
which is however only constituted of cardboard elements.

29
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:30,318
I now place the cardboard which represents the slab under this story

30
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:32,377
to have a complete structure.

31
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:35,107
I then add two walls in cross

32
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:37,960
on the previous structure,

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,275
so the slab remains between both,

34
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:44,277
and again I can add my load of 10 Newtons on this structure,

35
00:01:44,277 --> 00:01:46,795
still only constituted of cardboard

36
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:49,485
which resist very well and which does not deform.

37
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:51,439
The last story finally,

38
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,315
is composed of an outlying wall,

39
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,676
which is a bit inside the building,

40
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,505
enabling for example a corridor or a balcony

41
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:02,182
and then, which leans on what we have built so far

42
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:05,043
and here again, I still can place my 10 Newtons,

43
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,440
so I have a structure which is very stable

44
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,135
despite its large dimensions.

45
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:13,227
Let's see how it works:

46
00:02:13,227 --> 00:02:16,294
we have here four columns

47
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:18,262
at the level of the ground floor,

48
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:22,915
I add the shear walls which we have seen for the first story,

49
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:25,074
so these are two shear walls in each direction

50
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:28,136
which cross above the columns

51
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:30,966
What is interesting in this configuration

52
00:02:30,966 --> 00:02:34,529
is that at the level of the ground floor there are only the four columns

53
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:38,018
so there is a wide range of possibilities to organize this ground floor,

54
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:40,746
even, for example if it is a school,

55
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:43,438
to have a part which is outside-

56
00:02:43,438 --> 00:02:45,678
a playground covered by the building.

57
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:49,010
I then add on these four red shear walls

58
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,415
two blue shear walls,

59
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:54,605
which have the particularity

60
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,426
that they do not really touch the red shear walls

61
00:02:57,426 --> 00:03:00,177
except in four points,

62
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:03,353
on which they can take support.

63
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:05,547
We have to remember that these shear walls

64
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:08,877
are beams whith a small slenderness ratio and a large depth

65
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:11,537
so they are able to carry loads,

66
00:03:11,537 --> 00:03:14,132
we are going to come back to this in a short time,

67
00:03:14,132 --> 00:03:19,380
they will be able to carry loads over relatively short distances

68
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,534
and then the system is really stable.

69
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:28,522
The third story is constituted of a green outlying wall,

70
00:03:28,522 --> 00:03:32,705
this wall only takes support on four points

71
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:36,773
on the blue walls of the lower story

72
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:41,397
which, I remind you, only take themselves support

73
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:44,768
on four points on the red walls,

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:47,793
which themselves lean on the four columns.

75
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:50,402
So we have a system which is absolutely stable,

76
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:55,709
a structure which works, obviously the internal forces must be quite significant,

77
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,781
that is important that these pink and green nodes

78
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:01,488
are correctly dimensioned.

79
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:06,092
Well, let's see in principle how we are going to be able to dimension this shear wall on the ground floor,

80
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:10,612
so we are going to look at the internal force in this shear wall of the ground floor, here on the right.

81
00:04:10,612 --> 00:04:15,255
That is the internal force which comes from the blue story

82
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,740
through the shear wall

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,556
and it is constituted in particular of the internal forces

84
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:26,116
which are carried by the green outlying walls.

85
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:30,911
I only look at the red walls in this configuration,

86
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:34,542
so I have a very large load, but this very large load

87
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:37,730
is going to be easily carried

88
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,778
by a structure,

89
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:42,514
we can call that a truss or an arch-cable.

90
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:48,673
I am going to have a large compression in the concrete of these walls,

91
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:53,678
and I am going to place a significant amount of reinforcement

92
00:04:53,678 --> 00:04:55,392
at the level of the slab.

93
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,882
Here I have a lot of space to place it,

94
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,837
so I will be able to easily resist tension.

95
00:05:01,837 --> 00:05:04,680
The question we asked ourselves before was:

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,986
where could we create openings?

97
00:05:06,986 --> 00:05:10,558
Very clearly, in this configuration, if I want to place a door

98
00:05:10,558 --> 00:05:12,576
I can absolutely place it here,

99
00:05:12,576 --> 00:05:14,834
obviously on the other side,

100
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:17,659
but, if I have enough depth,

101
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,245
we can even imagine placing an opening here.

102
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:24,333
So despite the fact that we have concrete walls,

103
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,687
we can place a certain number of openings,

104
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,687
we could also place windows,

105
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:33,260
which enables to have a relatively flexible structure.

106
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,944
Of course, if these concrete elements had to become much wider,

107
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,812
we would maybe start having a problem

108
00:05:39,812 --> 00:05:44,426
because we would start encroaching upon the planned size of the door.

109
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,818
So of course, we could place it somewhere else

110
00:05:46,818 --> 00:05:51,620
or else the other solution would be to increase the thickness of the wall

111
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,436
to respect the internal force which must be carried.

112
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,735
As I said in the previous video,

113
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:59,604
we do not directly perceive what the thickness of the wall is

114
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:01,874
so it is not necessarily problematic

115
00:06:01,874 --> 00:06:03,944
to have a slightly thicker wall.

116
00:06:03,944 --> 00:06:05,908
Of course, it is going to cost money.

117
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,359
What is interesting with this configuration

118
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,533
is that, you see, I can switch the two last stories

119
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:14,955
and I also get a solution which still remains stable

120
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:17,297
and enables to carry loads.

121
00:06:17,297 --> 00:06:19,476
So if we come back here now,

122
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:21,603
to this configuration,

123
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:25,334
we can see, here we had the points on which -

124
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:28,935
there is probably one just behind here -

125
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:32,536
here, the second story leans on the first story

126
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:35,358
and on the top, we have these points

127
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:38,620
where the third story takes support on the second story,

128
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,939
there are obviously four all around.

129
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,375
When we switched both structures,

130
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:48,321
the points on which the stories lean on changed,

131
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:52,343
but the principle still remained the same,

132
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:54,833
that is to say that it is always possible

133
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,968
to make the loads go down

134
00:06:56,968 --> 00:07:01,312
so we have a big flexibility; if we decide to have a large free space

135
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:06,072
with nothing inside at this level here, we can absolutely have it,

136
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:08,595
or else, if we prefer to have four large rooms,

137
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:11,468
well, we can quite freely choose

138
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:15,091
where we want to have these system changings.

139
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:18,819
Of course, we could also have the same system over several stories.

140
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,466
Here I have an example: the Kerez house

141
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:25,034
which has been created by the architect Christian Kerez

142
00:07:25,034 --> 00:07:27,529
and the engineer Joseph Schwarz, in Zurich.

143
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:30,052
We can notice before going any further,

144
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:33,719
that the thicknesses both of the slabs

145
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,389
and of the walls, are quite significant.

146
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,339
That is something which belongs to architecture

147
00:07:40,339 --> 00:07:43,199
but we will see, that is also something which is necessary

148
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,379
for this structure to work.

149
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,880
Aside from this, we can also notice a big transparency

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,565
since we have glass to make the balustrades

151
00:07:52,565 --> 00:07:56,723
and we have large bay windows in this house.

152
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,667
On the right, you can see the model which has been made

153
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:01,148
by the architect of the structure,

154
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:04,774
we can recognize on the left, here, and in the middle,

155
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:07,585
the entrance tunnel for the underground car park.

156
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:11,019
We want to look at how this house has really been designed

157
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:13,200
starting from the bottom,

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,936
so here we have the car park,

159
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:17,750
we have this entrance tunnel which I have just indicated to you

160
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,059
and then an ideal car park in which there are no columns,

161
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:24,590
no load-bearing elements, so a large degree of freedom to place the vehicles

162
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,141
without risking to hit something.

163
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,369
So we have load-bearing walls all around

164
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,598
and here some particular walls.

165
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,222
On the ground floor, we have these blue walls

166
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,923
and we can notice that these walls

167
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:38,803
do not correspond at all to what we had downstairs,

168
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,961
that is normal, we are not in a car park anymore.

169
00:08:40,961 --> 00:08:44,739
Some of these walls clearly take support on the pink walls

170
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,679
of the lower story.

171
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,266
Others, however, do not lean on these walls

172
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,786
since they are located at a certain distance.

173
00:08:53,786 --> 00:08:55,862
It is however necessary to take into account

174
00:08:55,862 --> 00:08:59,816
the fact that we have here slabs which are thick

175
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:01,762
so thanks to the thickness of the slab,

176
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:04,096
we are going to be able to transmit an internal force

177
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:07,231
from the end of the blue wall to the pink wall,

178
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,776
through the thickness of the slab.

179
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:12,990
So, this is an explanation of why these slabs are thick.

180
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,990
On the first floor, we have these sky blue walls

181
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,979
and we can notice that some of thems take support perpendicularly

182
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:25,073
on the blue walls of the lower story, that is quite clear,

183
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:28,031
others are laterally staggered,

184
00:09:28,031 --> 00:09:30,740
probably that this lateral gap is acceptable

185
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,289
thanks to the large thickness of the slab.

186
00:09:33,289 --> 00:09:37,248
So here, there are clearly again supports

187
00:09:37,248 --> 00:09:41,455
of the sky blue wall on the wall of the lower story.

188
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,101
If we move to the second floor,

189
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:49,560
these green walls take support in a certain number of cases,

190
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,541
on the blue walls.

191
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:55,178
That is quite clear.

192
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,579
However, in some other cases,

193
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,946
we can notice that for example here, these walls are really staggered,

194
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:03,236
they are really far away from each other

195
00:10:03,236 --> 00:10:07,018
and the only way in which this wall here... that corresponds to -

196
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:09,662
I am going to draw it in yellow for us to see it well,

197
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:12,014
that is this wall here,

198
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:16,452
this wall is too much staggered compared to the lower wall

199
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:19,276
and the only way in which we are going to be able to carry it,

200
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:22,708
is holding it from the top

201
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,328
thanks to what is possible on the upper floor.

202
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:29,049
We even have walls which are hung up.

203
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,864
This is the last floor, we precisely have these orange walls,

204
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,350
we can find this orange wall

205
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,286
which clearly hangs up the green wall,

206
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,045
there is no problem,

207
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:41,028
we can see that here this other green wall

208
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,889
is also hung up on the yellow wall

209
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:44,708
of the upper floor.

210
00:10:45,028 --> 00:10:48,581
I do not pretend to explain you all the functioning of this house,

211
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,613
I hope you are not going to start too quickly

212
00:10:51,613 --> 00:10:54,083
to design such a complex structure,

213
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,299
but however, that gives you and idea

214
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,362
about the very large flexibility

215
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:02,622
that this system prof superimposed shear walls can give us

216
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:05,548
in combination with appropriate thicknesses.

217
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:07,945
In this video about superimposed shear walls,

218
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,579
I have shown you how,

219
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,526
by placing them in crossed configurations

220
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:14,899
we can get a very large degree of freedom

221
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,152
to change the spatial organisation from one floor to another.

222
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:21,661
This enables variations from one story to another,

223
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,495
that provides a large degree of freedom.

224
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,692
I have also shown you in the example of the Kerez house in Zurich,

225
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:29,819
that we can even go slightly further in this freedom

226
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:32,888
using a gap between some walls

227
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,843
taking advantage of the thickness of the slabs

228
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:37,224
or even hanging up certain walls

229
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,640
on the walls of the upper floor.
