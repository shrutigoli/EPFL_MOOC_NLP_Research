00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:03,494
Hello. In this video, we will see how to consider

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:05,980
beams and trusses with cantilevers.

3
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:10,032
In fact, the phenomena which occur are the same

4
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:12,942
for beam or truss structures,

5
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:16,540
that is why I decided to gather these two topics together

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,755
and to deal with them after the subjects, respectively,

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:23,008
of trusses and of beams, unlike what is done in the book.

8
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,237
We will see how the fact to add a cantilever to a beam 

9
00:00:27,237 --> 00:00:30,100
changes the effects inside the beam,

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,712
we will see that this is particularly important for internal forces,

11
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:36,296
but also for support reactions.

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,470
In this video, you can see how I turn

13
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,249
a truss which we have often calculated

14
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:45,313
into a truss with a cantilever,

15
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:49,793
simply applying a load of 10 N at the end of the cantilever.

16
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:51,320
When we apply this load,

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,284
or at least when we apply a load a little bit larger,

18
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:56,193
because there are friction forces

19
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:58,194
and the self-weight of the structure is at stake,

20
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:01,116
when we apply a load in this way,

21
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,457
the lower part of the structure, which is composed of chains,

22
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:07,773
turns into compression, so that the structure becomes unstable.

23
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:11,717
For it to be stable again, I add timber elements

24
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:13,118
in the lower part,

25
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,737
which can support a compressive internal force.

26
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:21,623
In the case of a truss, to which I add a cantilever

27
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:26,724
at the end of which acts a load of 10 N,

28
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:33,980
the result of our addition is a truss beam,

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,825
with a cantilever and a load of 10 N at the end of the cantilever.

30
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,989
So we have a truss,

31
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,202
plus a cantilever --

32
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:49,711
we have already seen how to deal with these two scenarios --

33
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,502
and here we obtain a truss with a cantilever.

34
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:04,897
Let's see how to obtain the support reactions of this structure,

35
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:09,706
we are going to use the technique of the auxiliary cable.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,386
That is just going to be an arch-cable a little bit particular,

37
00:02:21,386 --> 00:02:28,521
since we are going to have an element in compression here,

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,387
and an element in tension, here.

39
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,411
Since it is a cantilever, to have equilibrium,

40
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:40,491
it is still necessary to have a compressive internal force

41
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,446
which acts here.

42
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:47,718
We want to solve, now, this auxiliary arch-cable

43
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:56,360
starting here, with a free-body around node F.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,761
This free-body is subjected, on the one hand, to the load of 10 N, then,

45
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:06,484
turning counterclockwise,

46
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:11,691
to the inclined tensile force -- I directly draw it in tension,

47
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,887
since I have already indicated it as being in tension,

48
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:17,268
that is clear that it pulls on the free-body --

49
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:24,460
and then, we are going to finish with a compressive internal force in bar E-F.

50
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:36,508
So here is the contribution of node F to the Cremona diagram

51
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,799
of this auxiliary arch-cable;

52
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,543
now, what interests us

53
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:43,822
is really to obtain the support reactions.

54
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:49,524
We are going to start by support E,

55
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:53,682
for which I look at this free-body;

56
00:03:53,682 --> 00:04:01,593
this free-body is subjected to the internal force in E-F, in the other direction;

57
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:09,446
then to a horizontal compressive internal force, that is the internal force in C-E,

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,092
or in A-E, actually, since we have simpler system,

59
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:26,843
and then finally, to the support reaction in E which must close the funicular polygon

60
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:35,671
I draw it slightly staggered, here, that is RE -- vertical since it is

61
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,560
a mobile support.

62
00:04:37,853 --> 00:04:41,373
And then, it has larger value than the 10 N, actually,

63
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:45,054
it is equal to 12.5 N.

64
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,276
Ha, I am also going to indicate

65
00:04:48,276 --> 00:04:56,349
the contribution of node E to the whole Cremona diagram:

66
00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,457
so the equilibrium of the node E is here;

67
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:06,852
now, we want to look at node A,

68
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,163
here, which is subjected,

69
00:05:13,163 --> 00:05:16,589
still turning counterclockwise,

70
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:23,863
to the compressive internal force in A-E, then to the tensile internal force in A-F,

71
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:32,520
then finally, to the support reaction in A, so we can see that it is going to be downwards.

72
00:05:33,552 --> 00:05:37,800
That is RA.

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,470
If I indicate the contribution of node A to the Cremona diagram,

74
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,498
that is this part here.

75
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:57,413
The support reaction in A is equal to 2.5 N, with a force which acts downwards.

76
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:04,040
This is the effect of the cantilever; as you can see it in the next video,

77
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,625
where I have increased the internal force -- so, you can see

78
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:10,539
that I also stabilize the structure because it tends to go sideways,

79
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:15,458
but you can see that pushing at the end of the cantilever, I can indeed

80
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,596
lift up the left part, the left support;

81
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:21,476
that is normal, there is a support upwards reaction.

82
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:24,159
So this support can lift up; obviously, in our case,

83
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:28,013
it was not lifting up, because there is a certain weight in the support

84
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:29,837
and in the structure.

85
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:34,020
We are now going to quickly solve this entire truss.

86
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,163
We have already partially done it, so I am going to do it quite quickly:

87
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:45,100
here, that is node F; this node is subjected to the force of 10 N,

88
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:51,543
then to an horizontal internal force in D-F which is going to be in tension --

89
00:06:51,724 --> 00:06:58,570
so I already draw it here, horizontaly, and then finally,

90
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,622
-- so this, it is D-F -- and then the Cremona diagram must close,

91
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:10,131
with the inclination of E-F, so necessarily, that is on this place here.

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:16,465
So here, this is in E-F, so I can indicate the end of the arrow,

93
00:07:16,997 --> 00:07:30,380
then I quickly indicate the contribution of node F to the Cremona diagram.

94
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:36,474
Now, I am going to consider node E.

95
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:48,149
This node is subjected to the internal force in E-F, in the other direction;

96
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:55,175
to the internal force in D-F -- in D-E, sorry.

97
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:07,987
That is also a compressive internal force; then to the internal force in C-E,

98
00:08:09,244 --> 00:08:11,874
that is still a compressive internal force.

99
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:21,437
So here, this is D-E and here, this is C-E.

100
00:08:21,857 --> 00:08:24,185
Then we finish by the support reaction on the right,

101
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:26,520
whose we have determined the value before,

102
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,894
that is 12.5 N.

103
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:37,126
RE is equal to 12.5 N.

104
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:40,660
We are maybe going to indicate the signs of the internal forces in the bars:

105
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,130
so here, this bar is in compression, this bar is in compression,

106
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:48,441
this bar is in compression, while this one is in tension.

107
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:56,327
The contribution of node E to the entire Cremona diagram is here.

108
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:07,827
Here you go. We are now going to move to node D, which is an unloaded node.

109
00:09:08,972 --> 00:09:16,109
This node is subjected to the internal force in D-E, in the other direction

110
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:22,531
to the internal force in D-F, in the other direction, then to the internal force in B-D

111
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:27,439
which is again going to go leftwards, and then we are going to finish by the internal force in C-D,

112
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:34,801
which is going to be parallel to EF. So this, it is going to be the internal force in CD...

113
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:41,359
and then here, we have the internal force in B-D.

114
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:57,502
Here is the contribution of this node to the global equilibrium.

115
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:02,704
We now move to node C, which is also an unloaded node;

116
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:09,082
so, yes, I should have first indicated the signs of the internal forces -- so we have here

117
00:10:09,082 --> 00:10:15,620
tension in B-D and tension in C-D.

118
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:19,253
And now, we move to the equilibrium of node C:

119
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:23,716
so we are going to have the internal force in C-E, in the other direction,

120
00:10:23,716 --> 00:10:28,169
then the internal force in CD, in the other direction,

121
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:35,489
then the internal force in B-C, which is going to be parallel to D-E.

122
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:42,444
This is the internal force in B-C.

123
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:49,471
And then we are going to end by the internal force in A-C, which I am going to stagger again

124
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,438
for us to be able to see it...

125
00:10:56,393 --> 00:10:58,654
... which is also a compressive internal force.

126
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:04,195
So, in A-C, we have compression and in B-C too.

127
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:12,449
The contribution of this node the Cremona diagram can be seen here.

128
00:11:16,253 --> 00:11:20,542
We now going to look at the equilibrium of node B:

129
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:27,354
node B is subjected to the internal force in B-C, in the other direction;

130
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:37,643
to the internal force in B-D, in the other direction; then to the internal force in A-B.

131
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:44,389
And here, if I had drawn it well, everything should gather on the same point.

132
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:49,828
There you go. This is the internal force in A-B,

133
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:54,513
so we can see that A-B is in tension;

134
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:59,053
the contribution of the grey node to the Cremona diagram

135
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,846
is this part here.

136
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:07,007
We finish by a control at the level of node A:

137
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:11,079
this node is subjected to the internal force in A-C, in the other direction,

138
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,311
to the internal force in A-B, in the other direction, and, finally,

139
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:22,024
to the support reaction RA of 2.5 N downwards.

140
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:32,314
And the contribution of this node to the Cremona diagram

141
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,053
can be read here.

142
00:12:34,886 --> 00:12:37,575
So we have obtained the internal forces in this truss

143
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:40,821
in a way which is absolutely similar to what we have done before,

144
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:44,134
starting by the determining of the support reactions,

145
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:48,123
and then attacking the structure from this node and progressing

146
00:12:48,123 --> 00:12:51,176
step by step, until we have solved everything.

147
00:12:51,413 --> 00:12:55,259
In this lecture, we have seen what is the effect of the introduction

148
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:57,248
of a cantilever on a truss,

149
00:12:57,248 --> 00:13:00,474
concerning the support reactions and the internal forces.

150
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:04,190
Regarding the support reactions, the introduction of a cantilever can lead

151
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,404
to a lifting of certain supports, under vertical downwards loads.

152
00:13:08,502 --> 00:13:12,255
The internal forces generally have opposite signs,

153
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:15,438
that is to say that we got compression

154
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:17,526
