00:00:00,365 --> 00:00:04,691
Hello, in this video, I am going to introduce the superposition principle.

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,012
This principle, which I am going to formulate,

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:12,510
will enable us to quite simply obtain the effect of several causes

4
00:00:12,725 --> 00:00:14,325
by a simple addition.

5
00:00:14,626 --> 00:00:18,256
In this video, you can recognize the truss configuration

6
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:20,304
with a cantilever, with which we have just dealt with,

7
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,651
on which I add 2 loads,

8
00:00:24,017 --> 00:00:27,402
which was a configuration that we have often seen before

9
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:31,358
in the trusses, with a load of 10 Newtons on the left and a load

10
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:36,099
of 20 N in the middle, I mean... on the right but it has become the middle.

11
00:00:36,523 --> 00:00:40,117
Since we have already previously calculated the effet of both these load cases,

12
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:44,037
either a load of 10 N on the cantilever, either a load of 10

13
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:46,287
and a load of 20 on the truss,

14
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:50,468
we would wish to directly be able to obtain the combined effect of

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,009
these two load groups.

16
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:54,356
The superposition principle tells us

17
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:56,185
that in linear

18
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:03,221
elastic systems,

19
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:15,070
the effect of the sum

20
00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:20,309
of two actions

21
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:32,352
is equal to the sum of the effects

22
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:41,151
of both actions taken separately.

23
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:50,789
To be more clear, in our case,

24
00:01:50,946 --> 00:02:01,161
the internal forces induced by the loads &quot;1&quot;,

25
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,190
I use quotation marks, that is a group of loads,

26
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,755
I can have one load or several loads,

27
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:14,715
plus the internal forces due to the loads of a second group of loads

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,162
which I call &quot;2&quot;,

29
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:25,891
are equal to the internal forces induced by the loads

30
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:30,817
&quot;1&quot; + &quot;2&quot;.

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,501
That is to say that if I know the internal forces, in my case,

32
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:38,150
induced in the structure by a load at the end of the cantilever,

33
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,743
and on the other hand, the internal forces due to the loads I have put 

34
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:45,696
of 10 and of 20 N, on the structure itself,

35
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:49,713
therefore, the internal forces in the structure due to the combination of the loads

36
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,184
of the group &quot;1&quot; and of the group &quot;2&quot; will simply be obtained by addition. 

37
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:56,720
I have put in the statement that this principle is valid in linear

38
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:58,933
elastic systems, which is perfectly correct.

39
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:03,106
In our case, we will be able to apply it in all the cases which interest us.

40
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:07,900
We have here these two load cases which we have previously calculated,

41
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,727
we are simply going to apply this principle, that is to say that we are going

42
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:15,923
to add the effect here, I start by bar A-B.

43
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:21,324
We have, for the first load case, a compression of 14.4, which is negative,

44
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,117
in the second case, a tension of 2.9.

45
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:27,846
The sum is going to remain negative

46
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:32,895
and will be equal to -11.5 N.

47
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:37,093
I keep going with bar B-D.

48
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,858
This bar is compression in the first case,

49
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:42,437
in tension in the second one, but the tension is smaller

50
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:49,208
so the result remains negative, a compression of -5.8 N.

51
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:53,609
And then I keep going, for example, on the bottom.

52
00:03:53,809 --> 00:04:01,570
We had 7.2 minus 1.4, that remains in tension, so that is equal to 5.8 N.

53
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:10,242
Here, 10.1 minus 4.3, that is also equal to 5.8 N.

54
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:15,280
Here, that is interesting for the diagonals.

55
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:20,142
Here we have 2.9, positive, minus 2.9, negative, so

56
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:21,962
the sum is 0.

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,301
Likewise, -2.9 plus 2.9, that is also equal to 0.

58
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:32,536
The big diagonal here is the only one to be in compression in both cases,

59
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,066
so it is obviously going to be in compression,

60
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:40,657
with a slightly larger compression of -23.1 N.

61
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:45,664
Concerning the cantilever, nothing changes since it was not existing

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,594
in the previous structure, or at least it did not have any internal forces,

63
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:55,019
so we have 5.8 N and then a compression in the diagonal

64
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,968
which is equal to -11.5 N.

65
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:01,931
What is interesting is that with this method, we can see that

66
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:06,723
we have been able to obtain, by a simple arithmetical addition, nothing complicated,

67
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:09,995
the effect to add a load of 10 N.

68
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,101
What is interesting is that we could also very easily decide to add,

69
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,091
for example, a load of 20N,

70
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:17,823
and what we would do, is that we would multiply

71
00:05:18,077 --> 00:05:20,871
all this by two, then we would add it to the first case and we would get

72
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,060
results which would be different. Maybe there would be

73
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:26,431
some changings in the signs of the internal forces, at least their amplitude would vary

74
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:28,775
but the calculation would be done in a very simple way.

75
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,358
What is interesting to notice when we look at this configuration,

76
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:40,089
is that in almost all the bars, the absolute value of the internal forces decreases

77
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,957
when we add the effect of the cantilever.

78
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,533
Here, the internal force decreases,

79
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,004
here, it decreases,

80
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,358
here, it decreases,

81
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,754
obviously, both zeros, it also decreases here.

82
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,661
There are only these three bars...

83
00:05:57,851 --> 00:06:00,093
these two bars here, that is exactly the same thing

84
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:01,535
than in the cantilever, which is logical,

85
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,876
and there is only this bar here near support E

86
00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:08,247
in which the internal force increases,only slightly in the present instance,

87
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:10,783
since it increases by about 3 N,

88
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,605
but that is interesting to note that in almost all the structure,

89
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,307
the internal forces are smaller.

90
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:20,807
This property will be used in the next video

91
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:24,064
when we will talk about the Gerber beams.

92
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:27,183
We want to look at the application of this principle

93
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:30,461
to something more complex, and for this, we first want to

94
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,934
come back to the level of arch-cables.

95
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:37,228
For the first truss, on the top, there are 2 loads, one of 30, one of 10,

96
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,854
which act on this truss.

97
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:42,022
We know this truss, and then we have an arch-cable

98
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,402
which looks like this.

99
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:46,220
In the second configuration, we have a cable

100
00:06:46,487 --> 00:06:47,771
in the upper part

101
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,389
and then a lower arch, since there is a cantilever,

102
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:56,793
a load of 20 N at the end of the cantilever,

103
00:06:57,113 --> 00:07:00,290
and the sum of both, we can see here both components

104
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:01,995
drawn to the same scale,

105
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:05,784
it gives us an arch-cable which has a particular configuration

106
00:07:05,987 --> 00:07:11,120
since the arch is sometimes above and sometimes below the cable,

107
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,588
this does not cause any problems.

108
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,405
We then obtain this kind of configuration.

109
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,839
What is interesting is that the principles which we have previously seen

110
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,344
for trusses with a variable depth remain valid, that is to say that

111
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:32,248
when the cable is under the arch, that is the lower chord

112
00:07:33,815 --> 00:07:35,973
which is in tension,

113
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:42,848
while the upper chord is in compression, we are going to have

114
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:45,643
a reversal of these internal forces here,

115
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:50,715
in the right part of the truss.

116
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:57,093
Likewise here, of course, these diagonals will be in compression while

117
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,538
this diagonal, for example, will be in tension.

118
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:02,012
And then here, we will also have a diagonal in compression.

119
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,875
We are going to see this again in details.

120
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:07,274
We can simply superpose our arch-cables and obtain

121
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:11,166
a combined arch-cable from which we can get the internal forces.

122
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:16,850
Here we have the detailed results for these 3 structures with

123
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:19,866
the superposition of the internal forces which is induced

124
00:08:20,058 --> 00:08:23,056
and we can see that, for example, for this element here, we have

125
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:26,903
a tension of 27.1 in the first case and a compression of 7.3,

126
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:29,319
which gives us a tension of 19.8,

127
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,701
while the largest tension on a support can be found in the case

128
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,545
of the cantilever where there is nothing on the left,

129
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:40,872
so, 58.3 N of tension just over the right support.

130
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:45,036
In this lecture, I have introduced to you the superposition principle

131
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:50,086
which says that the effect of the sum of the loads is equal to the sum

132
00:08:50,308 --> 00:08:52,202
of the effects of these same loads.

133
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:55,858
We can apply this principle to all kinds of structures,

134
00:08:56,056 --> 00:08:58,109
we have applied it here to trusses but we will be able

135
00:08:58,282 --> 00:09:00,298
to apply it to all the types of structures

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,349
which we have seen until now in this course.
