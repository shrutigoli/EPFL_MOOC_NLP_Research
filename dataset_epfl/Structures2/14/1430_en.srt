00:00:00,618 --> 00:00:01,839
Hello, in this video

2
00:00:01,847 --> 00:00:03,766
I am going to talk to you about Gerber trusses

3
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:07,940
which are directly issued from what we have seen in the previous lecture

4
00:00:08,346 --> 00:00:14,449
about the superposition of internal forces when we add a cantilever to a truss.

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:17,375
You indeed remember that adding a cantilever

6
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,003
to a truss, almost all internal forces decreased in the beam,

7
00:00:21,194 --> 00:00:22,415
in the initial truss

8
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:26,918
and thus this layout interests us since if we can decrease the internal forces,

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,647
we can also decrase the size of the elements to set up.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,120
We will also see that this Gerber truss layout is favorable

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,613
for the deformations and then I will show you

12
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:42,299
that it corresponds quite well to, at least, some methods

13
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:43,806
of construction.

14
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:49,358
Let's imagine that we are in the 19th century and that we want to build a bridge

15
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,355
to cross a large river.

16
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,915
Since we are in the 19th century, I am going to make...

17
00:01:01,864 --> 00:01:06,468
I am going to make a masonry abutment on each side,

18
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:10,112
on each embankment and I have the idea to have

19
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:19,038
a solution with 3 very simple trusses, which are drawn here.

20
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:22,656
So I am going to have 2 piers in the river,

21
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:28,334
still in masonry given the time it was built,

22
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,848
but that is not a problem.

23
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:37,542
Then a competitor which has studied well the lecture about trusses with cantilever arrives

24
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:39,803
and says : &quot;No, but I think we can do better.&quot;

25
00:01:40,186 --> 00:01:46,478
So, on both sides, I agree, I am going to make an end support

26
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,502
in masonry.

27
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:53,482
I am also going to place two piers in the river, but you should notice

28
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:57,827
that I stagger them a little bit compared to the piers of my competitor

29
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:05,304
and I bet you that my solution is more efficient.

30
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:08,185
Here, we have the river which we must cross.

31
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,588
You can notice that both these solutions are absolutely acceptable

32
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:15,889
to cross the river.

33
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:21,446
There is even, in the second solution, a part which is more open in the middle,

34
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:23,677
which can be favorable for navigation, but

35
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:27,065
we are going to consider that for the use we want to make, they are

36
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:27,955
approximately equal.

37
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,112
If I imagine that I have a load which is distributed over the whole

38
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:34,476
length of my structure, uniformly, to simplify

39
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:39,670
the reasoning, so I know that I am going to have, in the first solution,

40
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:43,487
compressive internal forces in the end diagonals,

41
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:47,537
and tensile internal force in the intermediate part.

42
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:54,637
In the second configuration, this part here is a normal truss,

43
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,429
which we know well, with compression on the top and

44
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,684
tension on the bottom.

45
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:08,690
We are going to add a cantilever which works in an inverted manner.

46
00:03:08,863 --> 00:03:15,091
On the top, we are going to place a truss which is absolutely normal.

47
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,543
If we compare both families of trusses, we can notice that

48
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:26,794
the trusses here have smaller spans than the trusses

49
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,552
which were proposed here.

50
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:33,645
Here is my solution with 2 trusses with cantilever

51
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,917
and 1 simple truss in the middle.

52
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:47,429
In this solution, as I said before, the trusses here

53
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,619
have smaller spans.

54
00:03:49,973 --> 00:03:54,075
We can see that it is also the case for the truss in the middle and in addition,

55
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,283
we have cantilevers, on the left for the one, on the right for the other

56
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:01,556
which are going to reduce even more these internal forces.

57
00:04:01,997 --> 00:04:05,993
That is quite clear that this solution, the second solution, with 2 trusses

58
00:04:05,993 --> 00:04:08,837
with cantilever and 1 simple truss will be more economical,

59
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:12,201
we will be able to use less material while solving the problem

60
00:04:12,455 --> 00:04:14,197
in a very similar manner.

61
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:18,845
Of course, if you want to make a train pass on this construction,

62
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:21,789
that is not going to be possible, it will be necessary to build it

63
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,241
in a slightly more practical way,

64
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,771
but it does not pose unsolvable problems.

65
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:32,640
We are going to build these two trusses with cantilever.

66
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:39,194
Here, that is going to be the part with the cantilever, we are going to have tension here on the bottom

67
00:04:39,678 --> 00:04:44,460
and instead of placing the intermediate truss on the top,

68
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:48,765
we are going to place an inverted truss, so we are going to have tension here,

69
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:51,700
here and here, compression on the top

70
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,926
but that is going to give us the same solution.

71
00:04:54,013 --> 00:04:57,257
Then, maybe you will tell me: &quot;Here, the train needs to jump.&quot;

72
00:04:57,258 --> 00:04:58,247
Obviously not!

73
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:02,879
We are going to add a bar, actually two bars,

74
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,485
which simply aim to let the train run, but there is no problem,

75
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:09,854
these bars are carried by some parts of the truss.

76
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:14,404
Please note that we have here two hinges

77
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,553
in this configuration,

78
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,642
two hinges which are important elements of the structure.

79
00:05:27,176 --> 00:05:33,112
Let's now quickly determine if the structure is statically determinate or not.

80
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:40,560
Here, we are going to have two support reactions. Here one, here one and here one.

81
00:05:40,815 --> 00:05:46,563
So we are going to have 2, 3, 4, 5 supports reactions.

82
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:53,663
We are going to add, as usual, the number of bars,

83
00:05:54,439 --> 00:06:01,020
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

84
00:06:01,321 --> 00:06:04,419
I do not count this bar here because it is not part

85
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:05,704
of the structure...

86
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:11,221
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16...

87
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,660
still not this one,

88
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:22,586
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 bars.

89
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:29,478
And now, we are going to count the number of nodes.

90
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:38,744
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

91
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,684
13, 14 and 15.

92
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:47,991
2 times 15 equal to 3, 2 times 15 nodes.

93
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:56,506
We can see that 5 + 25 is equal to 30, therefore this structure is statically determinate.

94
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,383
That is important if we talk about the 19th century, since actually

95
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:05,555
at that time, we preferred statically determinate structures

96
00:07:05,766 --> 00:07:08,632
because they were more or less the only ones which we could calculate

97
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:09,992
in a satisfying manner.

98
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:13,625
For us, of course, that is interesting but at that time, that was even

99
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:14,811
more important.

100
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:17,470
So, here is the practical

101
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:23,243
realization of our Gerber truss.

102
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,002
We can see that we can obtain a structure which is similar to the one which was initially

103
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,755
planned, structure which will be more efficient.

104
00:07:30,809 --> 00:07:34,950
Here, that is called the Gerber truss, because it has been invented by

105
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,830
a German engineer of that name.

106
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:46,151
Here, we can clearly recognize on this bridge over the Main in Germany, cantilever

107
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,787
elements, here in the upper part

108
00:07:50,656 --> 00:07:53,831
of the cantilever, and in this lower part as well,

109
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:56,939
we have a slightly lenticular beam

110
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,833
with compression here.

111
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,417
And if we only have loads on the cantilever,

112
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:06,491
we are going to have internal forces which will have this shape.

113
00:08:06,627 --> 00:08:12,175
Of course, there will not only be the case of the loads on the cantilever,

114
00:08:12,175 --> 00:08:15,951
so we will not always have tension over the whole length

115
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:19,161
but in this configuration, if I had only placed loads

116
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:23,387
on the central part, we would obtain internal forces like this.

117
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:39,423
Here, again, we can recognize the presence of hinges and when we have

118
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:44,283
a hinge, you can notice that the cable and the arch cross each other.

119
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:47,404
That is necessary if there is a hinge because

120
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:50,764
the hinge is the only point through which the internal forces can pass.

121
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:55,985
We have already seen this when we have looked at this kind of construction elements

122
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,015
in the first course: &quot;The Art of Structures I&quot;.

123
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:02,111
We first want to look at the case...

124
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,450
That is something similar to what we have looked at on the small drawing,

125
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,392
but now you can have a bigger view to have

126
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:13,673
a better understanding of what happens and maybe also

127
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:18,101
to gain approach tools which will enable us to more easily

128
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:21,032
understand what happens in this type of structure and in

129
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,983
similar structures thereafter.

130
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:25,551
Here, I have 4 simple beams.

131
00:09:27,548 --> 00:09:31,015
And if I have a simple beam, I know that each time,

132
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:35,382
for the indicated loads, I have an arch-cable.

133
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:37,322
I first draw all the arches.

134
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:47,863
I have 4 arches which follow each other and I obviously have a cable underneath.

135
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:55,475
The internal forces which act in the chords

136
00:09:55,983 --> 00:10:01,053
depend on the rise, the depth between the arch

137
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:06,742
and the cable. Here we can see that this rise is constant over all the spans.

138
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:16,537
We can see that this structure has been calculated

139
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,784
by means of the applet i-Cremona.

140
00:10:18,957 --> 00:10:22,083
So we can see, we have calculated the whole structure in one go,

141
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:26,137
we have introduced 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 forces for each beam and

142
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:31,793
we have introduced the effect of the intermediate supports, each time

143
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,357
by means of a load.

144
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,562
The result is indeed this shape where we always have the arch above

145
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,102
and the cable below, with some variations,

146
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:47,004
the largest internal forces each time acting in the middle of the arch.

147
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:53,695
Underneath, we have a different configuration where we have here

148
00:10:53,825 --> 00:11:00,189
a beam with a cantilever, a beam with a double cantilever,

149
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:02,893
a cantilever on the left, a cantilever on the right,

150
00:11:02,893 --> 00:11:05,354
and here, we cannot see the following part, but at least,

151
00:11:05,543 --> 00:11:07,540
a beam with a cantilever on the left.

152
00:11:07,828 --> 00:11:16,365
Between these cantilevers, we have each time placed a truss which is hung up.

153
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:19,902
We have each time a hinge when we pass from a yellow truss

154
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:23,963
to a blue truss, or from a blue truss to a yellow truss.

155
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:28,919
Let's see how to represent this using the applet.

156
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:32,858
Here, each time we have a hinge,

157
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:35,266
- there is a hinge here, another here -

158
00:11:35,366 --> 00:11:39,732
we made sure that the arch and the cable cross.

159
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:43,480
The arch and the cable also cross on some other points but

160
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,986
they at least cross each time there is a hinge.

161
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:53,028
We have been able to solve this case using the applet in a very similar way,

162
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:56,940
you can simply notice that now, the support reactions which we had to insert

163
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,039
are variable for us to respect this condition.

164
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:06,311
We have again a series of arches.

165
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:20,855
We have here a cable, or rather a series of cables, they are lined up,

166
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,466
we can say only one cable,

167
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,475
which represents the part in tension.

168
00:12:27,577 --> 00:12:32,847
Like before, we can see that there is a rise, a depth between the arch

169
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:34,612
and the cable.

170
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:38,366
We can see that these rises, f2, f3, f4, are clearly much smaller

171
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:42,986
than f because they are divided into a part where the arch is

172
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:45,888
above the cable and a part where the arch is below the cable.

173
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:51,803
The internal forces are always proportional to this distance and we can see

174
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,563
that they are divided: there will be certain internal forces on this support,

175
00:12:55,854 --> 00:12:58,184
some other internal forces in the span and so on.

176
00:12:58,692 --> 00:13:02,754
The sum of the rises always remains equal: if we consider this distance here,

177
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,162
the rises on the left and on the right, plus the rise in the middle,

178
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,533
that will always be equal to f.

179
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,881
However, the internal forces are significantly reduced.

180
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,495
So, that is advantageous to have a construction with Gerber beams.

181
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:22,718
Here, I show again the crossing

182
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,179
points of the arch and the cable.

183
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:41,316
The arch and the cable cross on each hinge.

184
00:13:47,963 --> 00:13:52,810
FInally, here I have the results of an electronic calculation.

185
00:13:52,945 --> 00:13:56,379
We could have calculated it by hand, but here that is an electronic calculation

186
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:58,397
of these two configurations.

187
00:13:58,426 --> 00:14:03,385
Here, we have a simple truss, or a series of simple trusses

188
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:13,602
and below, we have a serie of Gerber trusses.

189
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:16,273
Of course, there are many Gerber configurations,

190
00:14:16,463 --> 00:14:20,025
they are the ones we have seen before, with each time a cantilever here

191
00:14:20,246 --> 00:14:22,855
on the right, here on the left and on the right and so forth.

192
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:28,295
And here, what is drawn is the deformations,

193
00:14:30,506 --> 00:14:33,813
the shape which the structure takes

194
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:42,207
under the effect of these loads which are indicated here in red.

195
00:14:46,515 --> 00:14:52,836
This deformation is very strongly exaggerated.

196
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:59,245
That is the advantage of these calculation programs, we can show these

197
00:14:59,245 --> 00:15:01,171
deformations in a very exaggerated way,

198
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:03,229
they are much smaller in reality,

199
00:15:03,229 --> 00:15:06,516
but what is interesting is to see that the vertical deflection here

200
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:11,466
is quite larger than that of the Gerber truss.

201
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:14,166
So we also really have an advantage.

202
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:24,489
The Gerber truss has smaller

203
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,500
vertical deflections.

204
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:40,722
So, the solution with trusses with cantilever not only reduces

205
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:43,122
the internal forces in most of the bars,

206
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:47,781
but also the deformations, the vertical deflections of the structure.

207
00:15:48,811 --> 00:15:51,920
Here, we have the example of the Forth bridge,

208
00:15:52,132 --> 00:15:56,109
which you have seen on the first slide of this lecture.

209
00:15:57,077 --> 00:16:00,275
What is interesting is this illustration which had been made

210
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:06,214
by the designers of the load-bearing system.

211
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:10,262
We can clearly notice that here, there is some tension in their arms.

212
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:15,433
Thanks to the human being, we have small deviations of the internal forces

213
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,545
which are quite nice.

214
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:23,616
Obviously, there is compression in these sticks as well as in

215
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,926
the seat of the chair

216
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,619
under.

217
00:16:29,062 --> 00:16:34,076
We will obviously have tension here until these elements

218
00:16:36,364 --> 00:16:42,983
having a significant weight, which are used as anchors to avoid

219
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:45,867
that the arm here can lift up.

220
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:51,757
We are obviously going to have, somewhere through the spinal column,

221
00:16:51,757 --> 00:16:56,471
a compression which is going to go down and which is going to end up being transmitted

222
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,305
to the chair legs,

223
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:04,660
and then, in the intermediate part with this person which is suspended,

224
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:07,639
we will have a hangers system.

225
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,976
And then here, really, if we had to look at it in detail,

226
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:15,235
we have a small beam, a small arch-cable

227
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:18,087
for it to work.

228
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:21,937
If we have a look on the top, that is exactly like this that this structure

229
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:25,924
has been designed with two large cantilevers.

230
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:28,557
They were built in a symmetrical way

231
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:33,012
to facilitate their setting up,

232
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:38,474
and the upper part is in tension

233
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:42,003
here too.

234
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,388
We will have compression here, vertically in these piers

235
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:56,618
and the intermediate part is a system

236
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,774
which works a bit like I have drawn it before

237
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:02,281
for the intermediate person,

238
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:06,286
with compression on the top and tension on the bottom.

239
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:11,868
Here, we can see an elevation of this structure,

240
00:18:11,868 --> 00:18:14,636
I want to tell you how this structure was

241
00:18:14,638 --> 00:18:15,991
built.

242
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:19,483
I am going to take off the central part here.

243
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:22,087
How did we make this?

244
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:28,922
Well, we had built this part with tension here on the top.

245
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:31,694
I am not going to draw it over the whole length of the bridge.

246
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,092
Here, we had some tension,

247
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:39,026
we had some compression on the bottom

248
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:41,023
and some compression here,

249
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:42,363
as well as here,

250
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:47,696
and since this bridge crosses a large river or an inlet,

251
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:50,106
we have taken the liberty of 

252
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:53,933
coming with the last structural element, which has

253
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,143
this shape, approximately like this,

254
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:05,551
which we have been able to make float on a barge,

255
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:11,779
and then we have simply rised this element up thanks to cables

256
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,540
up to its final level,

257
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,443
which is a big simplification

258
00:19:15,443 --> 00:19:17,655
because this element here is not small,

259
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,700
it is about fifty meters long,

260
00:19:19,712 --> 00:19:23,065
we have been able to build it on the embankment in very good conditions,

261
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,005
while the work conditions in the other parts of the structures were

262
00:19:27,198 --> 00:19:28,968
slightly tougher.

263
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:32,586
What is also interesting is to look at the internal forces which we have

264
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:34,446
in the diagonals.

265
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,197
If we look at here, these diagonals here,

266
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,287
which are inclined in this direction, are in compression.

267
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,468
That is the same here.

268
00:19:46,139 --> 00:19:49,635
And if we look at the structure, here is a real photo

269
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:53,315
of the structure, we can see that these diagonals here, which have

270
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,030
this inclination, are indeed composed of large tubes,

271
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,222
such as these ones...

272
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,046
We can see that there is at once a lot of material and a large stiffness

273
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:06,504
to manage to have this, while the diagonals in the other direction

274
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:11,255
are in tension, here,

275
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:15,425
and we can see that these diagonals are indeed constituted

276
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,253
of very light and very transparent trusses.

277
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:25,795
Last comment: you can see that this bridge is used to carry a railway

278
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:30,260
track approximately sixty meters above the ground

279
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:34,382
and we can see this railway track here.

280
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:40,292
That gives us a very good idea about the scale of the structure.

281
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,787
Here, we have a train which passes on this bridge.

282
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:47,249
You can see the hugeness of the structure just to make a train pass.

283
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:51,739
That is a very large structure, a very beautiful record

284
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,783
of this time of the large truss structures.

285
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:57,628
In this lecture about the Gerber trusses,

286
00:20:57,628 --> 00:21:02,179
we have seen the advantages of a layout with Gerber joints,

287
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:06,521
hinges, we can see that this has positive consequences on

288
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:10,561
the internal forces in most of the elements, as well as on the deformations

289
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,428
of the entire structure.

290
00:21:12,816 --> 00:21:16,309
I have also shown you that it can be quite interesting

291
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:21,544
for certain construction methods enabling to assemble certain elements

292
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,328
in a separated way, which are added to the structure afterwards.
