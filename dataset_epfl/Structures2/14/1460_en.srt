00:00:00,284 --> 00:00:01,190
Hello.

2
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:04,514
In this lecture, I am going to talk to you about wall-beams and shear walls.

3
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:08,891
In this context, I will discuss the thickness to give to these walls,

4
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:12,682
I will define what is a wall-beam and what is a shear wall,

5
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:15,567
they are two concepts which are very close to one another.

6
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:18,468
We will look at how to create openings

7
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,819
and especially where to create openings in deep beams,

8
00:00:21,819 --> 00:00:24,907
and then I will give you some examples of configurations

9
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:28,251
where these elements are particularly efficient.

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:32,722
Here we have the photo of a private residential building

11
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:36,955
which is quite interesting:

12
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:43,249
there are very large openings above the entrance,

13
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:45,542
with essentially no load-bearing elements,

14
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:49,420
these small elements here probably have the main function

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,811
to carry the facade.

16
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:53,983
How does this work?

17
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:58,362
This works because above this very open space,

18
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:01,578
we have, by all appearances, a very large concrete wall,

19
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:05,434
actually, that is the wall of the room which is upstairs.

20
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:10,928
We have here a beam with a very large depth,

21
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,375
about more than 2.50 m.

22
00:01:21,213 --> 00:01:26,341
We can also see that it has a small slenderness ratio,

23
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:31,078
that means that it is quite efficient to carry internal forces.

24
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:36,632
When we can use the walls of a structure as load-bearing elements,

25
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:40,563
that is very interesting because we will always have a large depth

26
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,193
and a good efficiency.

27
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:48,846
So we are going to have the possibility to create a large concrete beam

28
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:50,609
(in the present case, that is concrete),

29
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,692
with, for example, a fixed support on the left and a mobile support on the right.

30
00:01:55,318 --> 00:01:58,113
What are the loads which can act on this structure?

31
00:01:58,113 --> 00:02:04,323
Well, on each floor, there will be loads which are, in all likelihood,

32
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:07,524
quite uniformly distributed and which come from the slabs,

33
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:10,541
and then loads which act

34
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:15,730
in each of the rooms of the housing.

35
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,370
And then on the roof, likewise,

36
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,002
we are going to have uniformly distributed loads

37
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:29,701
which, going down, will give rise to some slightly more concentrated loads,

38
00:02:29,701 --> 00:02:34,002
here on the right, that is not even very important,

39
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:37,028
because that is going to go almost directly into the support.

40
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:39,218
So, how can this beam carry loads?

41
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:44,027
We can imagine that it works as a beam with a very large depth,

42
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:50,056
with the possibility to develop an arch-cable

43
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:57,838
inside this zone here.

44
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,971
Of course some diagonals will also be necessary,

45
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:05,568
so we can imagine a shape,

46
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:08,121
I am going to schematically draw it below,

47
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:12,147
roughly a truss shape

48
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,680
with this configuration.

49
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:27,033
What simply matters is to place the openings in a suitable way,

50
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,739
because here, you can see, my drawing is not exact,

51
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,844
obviously the internal force cannot pass through this opening,

52
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:34,811
so we will have to deviate it a bit,

53
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,057
but overall, that passes in a quite easy way.

54
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:39,534
And then, I remind it to you,

55
00:03:39,534 --> 00:03:41,927
since we are dealing with a beam with a large depth,

56
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:46,011
the internal forces will be relatively small in this beam

57
00:03:46,011 --> 00:03:48,411
and then we do not need large zones

58
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,626
to carry these internal forces.

59
00:03:51,267 --> 00:03:55,234
One of the things on which this principle of the wall-beams is based,

60
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:58,960
is: how can we know the thickness of a wall?

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,034
The answer is not obvious, if you are in a building,

62
00:04:02,527 --> 00:04:05,864
try to find the thickness of a wall on which you are leaning.

63
00:04:07,068 --> 00:04:09,725
We can see it a bit here, this thickness,

64
00:04:09,725 --> 00:04:13,365
and we can see that it is not that small in the case of this structure,

65
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:15,730
probably because this structure

66
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,832
does not only have the function to seperate you from outside,

67
00:04:18,832 --> 00:04:21,859
here maybe only ten centimeters would be necessary,

68
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,120
plus, obviously, thermal insulation;

69
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,291
but it also have the function to carry.

70
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,800
But that is true that we are not really sensitive to the thickness of the wall,

71
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,593
and it is thus possible to use wall-beams,

72
00:04:35,593 --> 00:04:38,122
which are load-bearing walls,

73
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:44,169
and to give them a sufficient thickness to resist the internal forces which act.

74
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:49,897
A shear wall is simply a wall-beam over several stories.

75
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:54,871
Here I have an example of a building

76
00:04:54,871 --> 00:05:02,865
where, at the base, the idea was to have a very large open space

77
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,771
at the level of the groundfloor.

78
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:19,707
So here, it corresponds

79
00:05:19,707 --> 00:05:27,040
to a free space, that is to say that we will be able to place something there,

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,120
but there will not be any load-bearing elements to respect,

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,857
columns or walls,

82
00:05:36,315 --> 00:05:41,382
And here that will be a second configuration at which we will look afterwards,

83
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,789
also with a large open space.

84
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:47,026
We are going to assume that these structures are subjected

85
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:49,890
to uniformly distributed loads.

86
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,159
I am going to make them act only on the roof for it to be simpler,

87
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,383
but actually they clearly act at the level of the roof

88
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,489
and at the level of each of the story's slabs.

89
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,843
How can this structure carry loads?

90
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:10,211
We can imagine very well that a very large arch will develop,

91
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:13,147
not over one story but over several stories.

92
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:16,820
This arch can have a certain thickness, although, again,

93
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,266
since it has a large depth, the internal forces are relatively small.

94
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:27,493
And then we can very easily place the cable in the lower slab.

95
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,246
So here we have a load-bearing system.

96
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,813
You could ask me the question:

97
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:37,496
&quot;oh, but this entire structure is a concrete wall,

98
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:41,130
but how can I pass from one part of my building to another?&quot;

99
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,119
I need to be able to move, if I have several shear walls, that is annoying.&quot;

100
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,448
Of course in the example which we have seen before,

101
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,917
the shear wall was used as an external wall, so we did not need to pass through it.

102
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:52,731
We have put some windows though.

103
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:55,697
But if it is inside, we would like to be able to pass through it.

104
00:06:55,697 --> 00:07:03,609
It should be noted that in all the zones where the arch and the cable do not pass,

105
00:07:03,609 --> 00:07:05,326
we could make holes.

106
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:09,570
We cannot make holes everywhere, but we can make some.

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,955
So, in all the zones which I have indicated here in yellow,

108
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:21,769
we can create openings.

109
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,348
So, of course, maybe this configuration

110
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:38,937
is not suitable for what you imagined

111
00:07:38,937 --> 00:07:41,359
for the use of space.

112
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:50,998
You should know however that we will choose how we are going to distribute the internal forces,

113
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:55,728
for example, we will do it choosing where we place the reinforcement in the concrete.

114
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,921
If there is reinforcement, the internal forces will come,

115
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:00,122
if there is not, they will not come.

116
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:02,648
So I can absolutely choose,

117
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,337
instead of an arch-cable as I had proposed before,

118
00:08:05,337 --> 00:08:09,714
to have a structure which is rather constituted of trusses.

119
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:18,310
For example, a truss like this, with here diagonals in compression.

120
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:25,360
The possible arrangement of the openings is in this way slightly different:

121
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,455
There are places where suddenly, we can create openings, while

122
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:33,035
it was less easy to do so in the upper part.

123
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:35,308
Here for example, I can create an opening

124
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:37,411
which I could not make before.

125
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:41,239
And then the advantage is that I maybe have a bit more regularity,

126
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:46,947
the spacings between the yellow zones where we can create openings

127
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:49,479
are more regular.

128
00:08:50,985 --> 00:08:55,000
This picture shows an example of building which has used this principle.

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,873
I ask you to look at the facade for a little while,

130
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:01,323
and to find what is particular.

131
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,827
That is not a type of facade we are used to in Switzerland.

132
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:08,423
Why is it special?

133
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,913
Well, you can notice that the windows are staggered 

134
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,795
from one each other.

135
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,753
Here I have a window, and the one of the story below is here.

136
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:26,571
Respectively, there is one here, and the one of story above is here.

137
00:09:29,293 --> 00:09:32,502
And that is systematically the case for the entire building.

138
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:35,756
We are going to see that it is not really insignificant.

139
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:42,569
We can also notice that the thickness of this wall here is not insignificant.

140
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:47,578
And actually the thickness of the slabs which we can also see is not small.

141
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:52,159
All this, we will see it soon, plays a part in the load-bearing system.

142
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,052
Here we have an elevation, a side view of this structure

143
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:01,831
such as it has been developed by its deisgner,

144
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:05,209
the engineer Conzett in Chur.

145
00:10:06,844 --> 00:10:09,984
And the first thing to notice on this building

146
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:15,598
is that we have here, like previously, a very large free zone.

147
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:23,922
Here, this free zone is 28 m wide.

148
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,355
In this zone, there is nothing, no post,

149
00:10:31,355 --> 00:10:36,077
nothing mandataory for the structure.

150
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,708
How does this structure work?

151
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:44,097
We can see on the drawing of the engineer that he has designed a system

152
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:47,061
with diagonals:

153
00:10:47,061 --> 00:10:50,216
these diagonals here which are under compression.

154
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,874
We can see that the internal force is not constant in these diagonals.

155
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:59,520
It can be explained by the fact that there are loads which come from above

156
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,062
which do not act in a constant way from the top,

157
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:07,992
as I have supposed it for my previous drawing.

158
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:12,716
And then here, we have many diagonals in compression

159
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:17,116
with a maximal compression in the central part.

160
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:25,113
Well, all these elements are compressed.

161
00:11:25,113 --> 00:11:28,608
There are also vertical elements in compression.

162
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:38,332
And then, in the other direction, we have elements which are under tension.

163
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,900
They have been made with prestressing cables,

164
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,948
they are reinforcing elements which furthermore, are tensioned, 

165
00:11:45,948 --> 00:11:49,232
which prevents the concrete to crack,

166
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:52,603
and then they have a very large strength by cable.

167
00:11:52,603 --> 00:11:55,464
It enables to use the least possible space.

168
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,314
So, I draw all these cables.

169
00:12:09,265 --> 00:12:16,001
Finally, to carry the tensile internal forces in the lower part,

170
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:22,692
there are also obviously prestressing cables

171
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:24,969
which go over the whole length of the building.

172
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,172
To get the equilibrium, that is not drawn,

173
00:12:32,172 --> 00:12:36,810
but there is also compression here, in the upper part.

174
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:39,049
I draw it anyway.

175
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,596
In the upper parts, we can find compression in the slabs.

176
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:52,220
Now we can understand why the windows had to be staggered.

177
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,941
Look at here for example. I take this window.

178
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,455
This is a window.

179
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:04,956
And then I take the window which is just underneath, on the right.

180
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,151
Well, we can notice that the space between these windows,

181
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,130
here, you can see,

182
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,523
is constituted by, on the one hand,

183
00:13:18,523 --> 00:13:22,785
the gap between the windows,

184
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,910
which gives us a certain amount of material,

185
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,656
and on the other hand, by the thickness of the slabs.

186
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,923
That just leaves us enough space

187
00:13:31,923 --> 00:13:35,414
to make these elements in compression pass.

188
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:39,249
You can see, for example, here too, that is very sensitive

189
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:42,495
we just have enough material, enough space,

190
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:46,292
to make the internal force in this diagonal pass,

191
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:49,745
as well as the internal force in the prestressing system,

192
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:52,884
and then sometimes the cables in the other direction too,

193
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:54,631
but these cables are quite compact.

194
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:57,783
So it would be impossible to create this structure

195
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:00,254
if we wanted to make very thin walls,

196
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:02,601
because we would have much larger internal forces

197
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:05,126
and we could not manage to pass,

198
00:14:05,126 --> 00:14:07,600
and then if we had thinner slabs too.

199
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:15,040
Here, I have made a photomontage of the internal forces, superimposing them on the structure.

200
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,722
One more time, we can notice this zone, which is now used

201
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:24,612
for commercial premises.

202
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:30,808
That is a free zone, in which we could do something else in the future.

203
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:32,315
A free zone of 28 m.

204
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,391
In the right part, we can also see a free zone

205
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:40,390
which is in this case clogged by the ramp descending into the parking.

206
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:44,767
We can also have shear walls over several stories

207
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:47,807
to make large cantilevers.

208
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:52,464
That can be quite interesting, for example, if we are close to a road.

209
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:56,295
We can have here a road or a sidewalk which passes under the building

210
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,126
without having big complications.

211
00:15:00,126 --> 00:15:03,959
We thus have the possibility to create a building

212
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:05,803
with larger dimensions.

213
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:09,690
So, I am going to represent, here,

214
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,700
the loads which only act on the cantilever,

215
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,814
of course, when we will proceed to the complete dimensioning,

216
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,772
we will take into account the other loads,

217
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:22,992
but it enables me to concentrate on this component now.

218
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:26,603
So here, because of the loads which act on the cantilever,

219
00:15:26,603 --> 00:15:32,418
I am going to have an arch which is going to form in my structure,

220
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:37,345
and then to get the equilibrium, I must have inclined

221
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:42,004
tension in the shear wall.

222
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,383
And to have equilibrium on the right, I necessarily have compression

223
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,017
in the lower slab.

224
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,660
In this configuration, I have something which is quite interesting,

225
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,229
I have a large free zone under the cantilever,

226
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,858
like I had before.

227
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:04,919
I also have it here, but we could have not wished it,

228
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:06,437
maybe that is not useful.

229
00:16:06,437 --> 00:16:09,229
So now, I have these two large free spaces.

230
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,937
I already also indicate them in the lower part.

231
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,387
And I have the possibility to create openings

232
00:16:21,742 --> 00:16:29,639
in a large part of this shear wall, here,

233
00:16:31,117 --> 00:16:36,460
which will enable to open doors or, if necessary, windows.

234
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:42,186
If however this geometry is not considered as sufficiently flexible,

235
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:44,449
we can use another geometry.

236
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:49,881
Well, we will not escape from the development of the arch around there,

237
00:16:50,311 --> 00:16:54,485
however we can decide to bring tension

238
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:57,169
till the end of the building,

239
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,582
and then to only make it go down at this moment.

240
00:17:02,076 --> 00:17:08,723
To have equilibrium, we have an element in compression here,

241
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:12,772
and another element in compression in the lower slab.

242
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,238
It enables us to have a different distribution

243
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:21,583
of the potential openings in this shear wall.

244
00:17:24,772 --> 00:17:28,271
Of course, we could also choose a truss with V-shaped diagonals

245
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,901
as we did before, or something else.

246
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:36,569
There is a wide range of solutions to use depending on the requirements of the project.

247
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:43,420
Finally, some examples of structures with concrete shear walls.

248
00:17:44,068 --> 00:17:48,917
We can recognize them here. I indicate the free zone in sky blue,

249
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,635
the zone under which we are free.

250
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,552
We have large cantilevers

251
00:17:53,552 --> 00:17:56,747
which, at once, provide shadow underneath,

252
00:17:56,797 --> 00:18:01,947
and create a dynamic: here we have a conference room

253
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,783
which is completely outside the rest of the building,

254
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:07,724
and this part here protrudes.

255
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:15,387
Here that is a building near Lausanne with a very large cantilever.

256
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:20,782
Since it is a school, it enables to have a covered playground below.

257
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:22,868
In this video, we have seen

258
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:25,449
what are wall-beams and shear walls.

259
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:29,810
We have seen the importance of thicknesses, that of the shear wall itself

260
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,607
and that, if necessary, of the slabs which take support on this shear wall

261
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:36,816
to have a configuration allowing

262
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:41,025
to judiciously place openings in these shear walls

263
00:18:41,025 --> 00:18:44,623
for example to create windows or doors enabling passage.

264
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:47,450
I have given you some examples of configurations,

265
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,288
particularly to create a large central opening,

266
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,708
or else to have the possibility to create a large cantilever.

267
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,662
And then, I have given you some examples of realizations using these properties.
