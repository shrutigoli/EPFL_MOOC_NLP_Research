00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:01,596
Hello.

2
00:00:01,596 --> 00:00:04,357
In this video, I am going to talk to you about continuous beams.

3
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:06,540
We have seen, in the previous lecture,

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,921
that Gerber beams do not only have advantages,

5
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:11,781
especially because of joints which can, at least in bridges,

6
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:15,085
or in particularly exposed situations, cause problems.

7
00:00:15,085 --> 00:00:17,094
So, why not remove these joints?

8
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:20,979
We are going to see why and how we can remove them,

9
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,978
what are the consequences for the internal forces,

10
00:00:23,978 --> 00:00:27,693
a resolution method, and finally, we will make some comments

11
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:31,875
on the shape to give to continuous beams.

12
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,025
Here, I show you the internal forces which we have determined

13
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,494
in a continuous beam.

14
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:42,534
A continuous beam with a central span which is equal to L, here,

15
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:47,293
and lateral spans which are approximately equal to 0.8 x L.

16
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:50,750
The purpose of these spans which are shorter on both ends

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,453
is to limit the internal forces.

18
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,907
You maybe remember, when we looked at

19
00:00:54,907 --> 00:00:57,775
quite long Gerber beams, there was always

20
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,253
a longer distance between the arch and the cable

21
00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:04,042
in the end part of the beam.

22
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:07,953
In the present case, with this configuration,

23
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:15,963
we can see that the arch and the cable roughly remain at the same distance

24
00:01:15,963 --> 00:01:18,852
in all the spans, whether it be an edge span,

25
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:24,077
the first one or the last one, or else an intermediate span.

26
00:01:24,077 --> 00:01:26,882
If that is possible, that is very advantageous

27
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:30,822
that the first and the last spans be shorter,

28
00:01:31,048 --> 00:01:35,599
approximately 0.8 times the length of the other spans.

29
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,665
So here, when we have this configuration,

30
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:46,334
we will have 1/3 of the rise, f/3, here in the span

31
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:52,849
and then 2/3 of the rise, here, on the supports.

32
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:56,708
That means that 2/3 of the internal forces must be carried at the supports,

33
00:01:56,708 --> 00:02:00,954
and 1/3 in the span.

34
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,655
Here we have the same beam which we have just seen,

35
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:08,252
with two spans L in the middle and two side spans 0.79 L

36
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,417
on the left and on the right.

37
00:02:09,417 --> 00:02:12,777
We activate the resolution with the funicular polygon

38
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:16,132
and then we select the three support reactions.

39
00:02:16,132 --> 00:02:19,749
Let's now push the &quot;Control&quot; button to have the three.

40
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,801
Then afterwards, I push the &quot;Shift&quot; button , releasing &quot;Control&quot;

41
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,258
to change their amplitude

42
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:31,306
and we can see that the shape of the funicular polygon gets closer

43
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,083
to what we want to have.

44
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:36,616
And here, we can see that the rise on the supports

45
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,849
is twice the rise at mid-span.

46
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,380
So here, with the applet, we have just determined the internal forces

47
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,661
as well as the support reactions which we can read here

48
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:49,353
for this configuration.

49
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:52,518
Let's now maybe look at something interesting

50
00:02:52,518 --> 00:02:57,484
about this structure. We can see that there are here

51
00:02:57,484 --> 00:03:03,948
two support reactions, one here, one here, one here, one here.

52
00:03:03,948 --> 00:03:14,435
So we have six supports reactions plus, we have only one bar

53
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:19,594
and then, how many nodes do we have? Well, the nodes, actually,

54
00:03:19,594 --> 00:03:24,680
we have two. We have a node here

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,208
and the other node at the end.

56
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:33,718
So we have 2x2, which is equal to 4.

57
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:40,361
We can thus see that this structure is statically indeterminate.

58
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:46,791
We have 6+1, 7 on the left, 4 on the right.

59
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,816
Our structure is thus three times statically indeterminate.

60
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:51,962
Yes actually, what we do not know are the three forces,

61
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:55,203
for example, the three support reactions, 1, 2 and 3.

62
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:59,360
However, if you remember, we just graphically determined them 

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,554
through the use of the applet.

64
00:04:02,554 --> 00:04:06,820
So, in this case here, the applet enabled us to solve

65
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,751
a statically indeterminate structure, of course, in a particular way

66
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:14,678
since we knew, we have set down that this value was the half of this one.

67
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:19,479
If we had not known it, we would not have been able to proceed with this resolution.

68
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,122
We can notice that, like in the Gerber beams,

69
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:28,819
the cable and the arch cross on various points and on these points,

70
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:32,530
there are no hinges anymore since we do not have a Gerber beam anymore

71
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,940
but a continuous beam.

72
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,088
But however, the arch and the cable cross on various points.

73
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:42,515
Here we have the example of the Mont-Blanc bridge in Geneva,

74
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:46,586
which has a shape which reminds a little bit the one we have just seen

75
00:04:46,622 --> 00:04:49,435
for the case of a continuous beam.

76
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:55,276
And indeed, this bridge is constituted of a continuous beam.

77
00:04:55,276 --> 00:05:02,593
The representation which we have done till now of the arches and the cables

78
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:09,602
for the beams is very good for continuity

79
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:13,038
compared to what we have done till now. However, it has a defect

80
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,509
which will become particularly apparent when we are going to start dealing

81
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,400
with the case of slabs. That is why I am going to introduce to you

82
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,528
an alternative representation.

83
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:32,168
This is, let's say, the usual representation of these arches and of these cables.

84
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,686
I propose you to represent

85
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:43,857
in the lower part of the drawing, a configuration - so, I copy here

86
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:49,408
all the points where the arch and the cable cross, you will see why

87
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:56,245
later. That is important.

88
00:05:56,245 --> 00:06:01,937
And, in each part, I am going to represent an arch and a cable

89
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:10,560
so here, I indeed have an upper arch and a lower cable.

90
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:20,115
Then, here, I have an upper cable and a lower arch.

91
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:25,560
And then, to enable this arch to be correctly supported,

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,753
I must also have here an element which is in tension.

93
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:39,390
Likewise here, on the left, I am going to have again an arch and a cable

94
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,025
with a hanging element.

95
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,949
On the other side, that is going to be the same thing.

96
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:49,502
The interest of this representation is that, in this case,

97
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:54,880
the arches and the cables always remain inside the matter.

98
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,866
And this is quite interesting for the representation we will make soon

99
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:06,241
in the lecture about slabs.

100
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:11,730
I finish the drawing here, that is obviously repetitive since that is the same thing

101
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,677
for all the spans.

102
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,676
And what is interesting is that now we are going to compare

103
00:07:17,676 --> 00:07:22,597
the arch-cables according to their respective length.

104
00:07:22,597 --> 00:07:28,443
Here we have a nice example of a continuous beam bridge,

105
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:31,703
these are the Chillon viaducts which have been built

106
00:07:31,703 --> 00:07:35,911
at the end of the 1960's on the shore of Lake Geneva.

107
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,936
And what configuration do we have?

108
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:41,156
We have a configuration where we have tension

109
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:45,810
in the entire upper part of the bridge.

110
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,106
This tension is carried by many prestressing cables.

111
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:57,594
And then in the lower part, we have compression.

112
00:07:57,594 --> 00:08:02,115
That probably reminds you the configuration of the beam

113
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:06,165
with cantilevers of 0.5 times the length of the beam.

114
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:10,057
That is exactly this configuration which is used here

115
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,459
for a bridge which is continuous.

116
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,517
There are some places where there are joints but very rarely.

117
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,585
For the rest, it is simply a continuous beam.

118
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,567
In this lecture, we have seen that it is possible to design

119
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:24,877
and to build continuous beams without any joints.

120
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:27,299
The internal forces which act in these structures

121
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:30,817
are similar to the ones which act in a Gerber beam

122
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:33,682
with a regular crossing of the arch and the cable.

123
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:35,467
But these beams are statically indeterminate,

124
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:38,226
so, in general, we cannot solve them within the framework

125
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,047
of this course even though I have shown you

126
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:44,086
that it is possible to do it with the applet

127
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:46,750
with some additional hypotheses.

128
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,543
The shape which is given to a continous beam can be

129
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:53,949
either of constant depth as we have seen it, or of variable depth

130
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:57,891
which adapts according to the internal forces which act in the cross-section.
