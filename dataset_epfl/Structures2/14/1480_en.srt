00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,490
Hello.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,689
In this video, I am going to talk to you about steel shear walls.

3
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:07,468
In the previous lecture about superimposed shear walls,

4
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:11,084
you have been led to see how we could design

5
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:17,315
a structural system constituted of concrete walls, of wall-beams, of shear walls

6
00:00:17,315 --> 00:00:19,434
which are superimposed on top of one another.

7
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:22,572
That is a solution which is very efficient as I have shown you,

8
00:00:22,572 --> 00:00:26,343
but it is also possible to make this same system

9
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,968
using a steel structure.

10
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,847
That is what I am going to show you in this video

11
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:35,502
with a very nice example of a very beautiful structure.

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:39,501
That is the school of Leutschenbach in Zurich,

13
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,474
also designed by the architect Christian Kerez

14
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:45,361
and the engineer Joseph Schwarz.

15
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:51,128
We can see the principle of this structure on the right,

16
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:57,421
that is a model of this structure to the scale 1/10 which has been made

17
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:03,590
and exposed within the framework of a contemporary art museum.

18
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,837
So we have here a system. This system, we can also see it on the right,

19
00:01:08,837 --> 00:01:13,389
is clearly composed of shear walls since it has several floors.

20
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:17,952
We have a first large truss which takes support

21
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,604
- by the way, that is worth mentioning it here -

22
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:25,752
which takes support on a system of six tripods

23
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,272
and these tripods comply with the needs which I have brought to your attention

24
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:34,924
in the previous lecture, to be able to also resist seismic effects.

25
00:01:34,924 --> 00:01:37,494
So these tripods are not only able to carry

26
00:01:37,494 --> 00:01:41,741
vertical loads, but also horizontal loads.

27
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:46,191
On top of this structure, we have a second truss

28
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:48,958
which is only one story deep,

29
00:01:48,958 --> 00:02:00,007
which is arranged in such a way that it leans on the initial red truss.

30
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,635
Thus there is also a truss over the width,

31
00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:05,821
I should maybe have signaled it here because that is very important,

32
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,276
at the level of the red truss, there is obviously

33
00:02:08,276 --> 00:02:12,765
a truss which goes in the other direction, which leans on all these small tripods

34
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,935
about which I will talk to you later.

35
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:22,534
And then, a large depth truss takes support on this blue truss.

36
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,521
Actually, it is only one story deep because the upper floor

37
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:29,789
is a gymnastic hall, so we need a large depth

38
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:33,473
but that is only one story.

39
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:39,885
And that is a large outlying truss which goes around the structure,

40
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:45,949
obviously without any intermediate support because it is a gymnastic hall.

41
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:50,549
So we can notice, if we want to get a closer look on them, that there is here

42
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:53,809
the support of the green truss on the blue truss

43
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:59,530
and then, there is here the support of the blue truss on the red truss.

44
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,251
And then, these red trusses take themselves

45
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:06,233
support on the six tripods of which I talked to you about before.

46
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:09,818
That is the principle of this structure; let's see how it has been built.

47
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:13,773
On the left, you can see another model where we can clearly see

48
00:03:13,773 --> 00:03:16,567
the tripods in the lower part.

49
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,753
And then, on the right, you can see the beginning

50
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:20,543
of the building process of this structure.

51
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:27,158
We have already made a large part of the ground floor slab

52
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:31,680
and then we can see these large trusses which are developing.

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,233
We can see here, that is the red truss and then here, perpendicularly,

54
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:47,477
we have the blue truss which is being assembled.

55
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,292
Here, the construction process is more advanced. We have been able to remove the formwork of the first floor.

56
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:55,040
You can notice how free this structure is. There are only

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,770
the six supports of which I talked to you about.

58
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,535
Otherwise, we have the impression that it floats above the ground,

59
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:02,980
that is wonderful.

60
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,598
And then here, we can see the progress of the structure with the truss

61
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,650
which I called the green truss before, which is the gymnastic hall

62
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,915
at the top of the building.

63
00:04:12,915 --> 00:04:16,060
It is interesting to also note that great care

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,494
has been given to the details in this structure.

65
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:22,496
We have here the tripods about which I talked to you,

66
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:27,784
they are the supports and then the truss system of the first floor,

67
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,825
so I had drawn it in red before.

68
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:33,304
Here the red color is not refering to the internal forces

69
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:37,895
but to the level of the trusses.

70
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:42,097
And we can notice that the slab is very technological,

71
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:44,954
with a particular shape which enables it, of course,

72
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:49,013
to resist the internal forces, but also to contain all the conveyances

73
00:04:49,013 --> 00:04:53,719
of water, of fluids, of electricity, of light, and so on,

74
00:04:53,719 --> 00:04:57,733
in such a way that we have a structure which is free of installations

75
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,452
under the slab.

76
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:03,453
The shape which you can see is the definitive shape which we can see in the building.

77
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:06,443
In this video, I have shown you that it is possible to create

78
00:05:06,443 --> 00:05:09,653
superimposed shearwalls with a steel structure.

79
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:11,737
That is a very technological structure

80
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:14,448
which implies large depth trusses

81
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:18,217
but the principle of superimposed shear walls is also valid.

82
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,291
What is interesting in this structure,

83
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,848
is to also see that there is a logic to correspond

84
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:27,539
to the various functions of the different stories of the building.
