00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:09,399
Hello and welcome to this lesson dedicated to 
single phase sinusoidal steady state.

2
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:13,408
We will see in this lecture what the
single phase sinusoidal steady state is.

3
00:00:13,409 --> 00:00:16,059
and in which circumstances we use it

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,160
and define its sinusoidal
values at all time

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,959
with a very specific way
to write them.

6
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:26,219
We will also see how the
complex calculation will help us

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:28,160
to solve some problems,

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,229
it can seem paradoxicall to use
vectors

9
00:00:31,229 --> 00:00:33,558
to solve temporal problems

10
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:36,648
such as the single phase sinusoidal steady state.

11
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:40,279
By definition, we can say that the single phase
 sinusoidal steady state,

12
00:00:40,279 --> 00:00:42,859
or the steady state,

13
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,655
is when the external excitation,
current, voltage,

14
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,181
are sinusoidal functions

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,799
that are supposed established in time
from the infinite.

16
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:03,470
We therefore have sinusoidal functions

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,060
or in the same way,
co-sinusoidal

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,269
as it is the same function

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,119
out of step by π/2.

20
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:15,929
It is also interesting to note that the
sine and the cosine

21
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:19,529
are in reality the only periodic function
that have a derivative

22
00:01:19,529 --> 00:01:22,049
or an analogue integral.

23
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,369
It is the reason why this state
is very particular.

24
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,240
It has an important role in electricity

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,200
and this prevalence is linked
firstly

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,510
to the fact that the industrial production
of energy generally results from

27
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,039
a mechanical/electrical conversion

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,130
realised by the rotation of
a winding

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,790
placed in an magnetic induction field

30
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,370
and the induced voltage is rightly sinusoidal.

31
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,110
It's this characteristic that allows
to assure

32
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,620
an economical and efficient distribution.

33
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,262
We will now see how to define

34
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,674
this sinusoidal function.

35
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:59,788
So here is a sine drawn as
function of time,

36
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:02,430
we took x(t) as function of t,

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,929
here, X can symbolise any sinusoidal value.

38
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,408
We have defined here all the elements that
we will now have to understand

39
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:17,319
to be able to use thereafter this
sinusoidal function x(t).

40
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:19,179
So if we write this function,

41
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:22,005
we can write that x(t) is equal to

42
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:29,021
 x (peek)sin( (2πT)xt + α).

43
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:33,088
This is the equation of the function
drawn on the graph.

44
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,279
So we will be now able to define a certain
number of things.

45
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:38,959
First of all the amplitude.

46
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,850
The amplitude of this sinusoidal 
signal is x (peek),

47
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,701
or x said peak,

48
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:51,052
that will be the maximal
amplitude of this sine,

49
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,184
the peak value.

50
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:58,918
We can also define the initial phase.

51
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:06,179
This initial phase for t which
is equal to zero,

52
00:03:06,179 --> 00:03:08,309
we also call it the phase angle,

53
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:14,709
and this phase angle is identical
to the phase angle

54
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,209
and this is equal to alpha (α).

55
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,659
This is why the value that we see here

56
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:29,728
that allows to define the shift that
is between t=0 and - α.

57
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:35,458
We have another fundamental element that
is here: the period.

58
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:42,038
This period T corresponds to an
arithmetic sine

59
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:45,998
to the function 2π therefore we go
back to the beginning,

60
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,388
and we start another cycle again,

61
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,599
and this function T has for equation,

62
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,048
or connection with the frequency,

63
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:59,508
1/T.

64
00:03:59,508 --> 00:04:03,958
Therefore this frequency will be
in hertz, of course,

65
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,258
and is equal to 1 divided by the period T.

66
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:11,068
So T will be by definition
called the period.

67
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,685
A few other elements

68
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,932
can now be calculated from this.

69
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:22,749
So we can now define the pulse,

70
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,870
that we will write down small omega ω,

71
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,969
and this pulse is defined as being
2π times the frequency (f)

72
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:35,510
which is 2π divided by the
period (T).

73
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,999
This is why we have previously seen in
the equation that I remind you

74
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:47,739
x(t) = x (peek) sin ((2π / T) x t + α)

75
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:52,259
Therefore we have a pulse that appears

76
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,740
and that allows

77
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,629
to define this value as an angle
in radians.

78
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:02,352
Therefore this allows to make
the transfer, or the transformation,

79
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:04,935
between time and radians,

80
00:05:04,935 --> 00:05:07,438
between an angle and time.

81
00:05:08,088 --> 00:05:11,525
So as we have said before, this is
the peak value

82
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,978
by definition.

83
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:17,919
And this now allows us to
explain, or to write,

84
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,210
for the first time a voltage
equation of a current voltage.

85
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:24,378
So for the voltage,

86
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:27,330
we will write u(t)

87
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,265
is equal to U (peek),

88
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:31,551
the maximum value of the voltage,

89
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:35,479
times cos(ωt + α).

90
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,408
So here is a typical equation of
a sinusoidal voltage.

91
00:05:39,408 --> 00:05:42,428
And, by convention in
electrotechnics,

92
00:05:42,428 --> 00:05:45,448
we will simply note it u.

93
00:05:45,448 --> 00:05:48,469
So we will no longer write
T in brackets,

94
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:50,930
we will now see that

95
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,370
when we write a lowercase letter,

96
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,029
this means

97
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,345
that we are looking,
or that we are writing,

98
00:05:57,345 --> 00:05:59,021
the function of time (t).

99
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:01,019
Therefore here for the current,

100
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,698
Î

101
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,769
cos(ω * t + β).

102
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:09,490
We will add another angle.

103
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,678
So you see that all the functions finally
have the same form.

104
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:16,168
It is always a cosine,

105
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,519
peak value,

106
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,248
and a value as function of time,

107
00:06:19,248 --> 00:06:20,487
and an angle.

108
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:24,198
And another definition that we
will be able to write here,

109
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,589
is when we have a voltage and
a current in the circuit,

110
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:31,619
we will define phase shift
between these two values.

111
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:33,305
You can see these two values

112
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:35,961
are, here, at the same frequency.

113
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,568
Therefore all the values in the circuit
have the same frequency,

114
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,250
but the phase which is here,

115
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,999
so alpha (α) and beta (β)

116
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,559
can be different for the voltage or
for the current.

117
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:51,029
Therefore, by definition,

118
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,832
we will define the phase shift

119
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,689
between the voltage

120
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:03,707
and the current

121
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,765
as being the angle φ

122
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,743
that is equal to α - β.

123
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,460
Another definition is

124
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,109
when we say the word "phase".

125
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,560
The word "phase",

126
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,008
or" in phase",

127
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,278
which is a more accurate word,

128
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,183
means that all the values

129
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:34,339
have the same frequency,

130
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,579
it doesn't necessarily mean that
the phase difference is zero.

131
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,399
If the phase difference is
equal to π/2, then

132
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,499
we will say that these phases
are "in quadrature".

133
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,439
So I repeat, all the values

134
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,835
have the same frequency, and the
phase difference

135
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,431
is zero.

136
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:58,870
At this moment, we will say that the
system is in phase,

137
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,668
we will say "in quadrature",

138
00:08:02,968 --> 00:08:06,139
and all the values have
the same frequency

139
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,605
but the phase difference is equal
to more or less π/2.

140
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:18,079
We will now define here a concept well
known by students

141
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,716
that is the mean value.
Everybody knows how to calculate

142
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,053
the average of their grades

143
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:24,050
to know if they get to pass or not
their school-year. 

144
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:28,379
We will here calculate the mean of a signal with
its own definition of the mean.

145
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,062
So when we have a...

146
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:31,614
I repeat the equation x

147
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:39,976
that is equal to x (peek) cos (ωt + α)

148
00:08:39,976 --> 00:08:44,859
if I am looking for the mean value of this signal.

149
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,749
By definition,

150
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,119
The mean value of a signal

151
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:54,728
that we will write X uppercase underline

152
00:08:54,728 --> 00:08:57,129
is equal to 1/T

153
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,102
integral from 0 to T

154
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:03,646
of x(t) dt

155
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:06,108
So for a cosine,

156
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:10,602
if we integrate on 2/π,

157
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:15,710
so if we integrate on  2π,

158
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,449
we will get the mean value X(mean)

159
00:09:19,448 --> 00:09:21,819
equal to zero.

160
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,960
We can also realize it.

161
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,296
So if we have here X(mean) and the time t

162
00:09:27,296 --> 00:09:31,292
and that we have the sinusoidal
or co-sinusoidal signal 

163
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:34,620
that is like this.
We can clearly see that the integral

164
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,370
so the part here under the curve

165
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,700
will completely cancel itself

166
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,593
so a cosine or a sine

167
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:47,560
always has a mean value on its
complete period that is zero.

168
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:50,810
We therefore see that the
information of a

169
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,950
mean value isn't very

170
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,909
interesting in electrotechnics

171
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:59,100
because it will always be zero for
periodic functions.

172
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,400
We will then imagine

173
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,519
another way to allow us

174
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:06,789
to have an information

175
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:10,730
especially an information that will be
 linked, you will see, to power.

176
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:14,989
This will be the definition of the effective value
of sinusoidal values.

177
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,699
We have drawn here the power,

178
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,349
so you can see the current
i(t), that is

179
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,679
drawn here.

180
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,619
Then we did calculate Ri^2.

181
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,009
We know that the power is

182
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,019
the voltage (u) times the current (i)

183
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,359
If we are in a resistor,

184
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,100
and therefore that u is equal to R * i,

185
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,239
we can write that this
same power

186
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:50,399
is equal to u^2/R.

187
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,300
And if P is equal to u^2/R,

188
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,886
we then have u (peek)

189
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,856
cosine squared of

190
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:01,122
ω * t + α

191
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:04,014
divide by R.

192
00:11:04,014 --> 00:11:05,606
We also have u^2.

193
00:11:05,606 --> 00:11:09,159
So this the instantaneous power

194
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,449
that is represented here with
values that you have here,

195
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:18,029
so Ri^2, or u^2/R :
it's the same thing.

196
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,348
And you have this that is
strictly positive.

197
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:21,770
We can clearly see it here,

198
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:25,139
the mean of this function

199
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,308
is not zero.

200
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,595
It is determinate by

201
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:31,622
Ri^2

202
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:33,170
divided by 2.

203
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,040
We can calculate this to
convince ourselves.

204
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:40,569
Let's calculate the average power.

205
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:44,539
So the average power of 
a resistor

206
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,785
1/T integral from zero to T

207
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,741
of the average power

208
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:52,964
so let's write u^2

209
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:54,329
cosine squared

210
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,500
 ω* t + α

211
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,029
divided by R dt.

212
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:04,019
Imagine that we don't know

213
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,419
how to calculate the integral of cos^2,

214
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:08,506
we don't have a numerical index
on hand

215
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,593
we will say that

216
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:13,921
we shift this signal of π/2,

217
00:12:13,921 --> 00:12:16,159
we will get exactly the same form,

218
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,149
but instead of having a cosine,

219
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,760
we will have a sine, but i'ts
the same thing.

220
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,409
Therefore sin^2 of

221
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,799
ω * t + α

222
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:27,749
divided by R dt.

223
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,179
Then we add both

224
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:35,459
because we want to get a well
known trigonometric connection.

225
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,329
So 2 times the average power

226
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:41,620
gives us 1/T integral
from 0 to T

227
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,580
of u^2 (peek)

228
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,810
I have not written it,
sorry it's a mistake

229
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,803
divided by R

230
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:52,715
times, first of all, sin^2 of

231
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:56,607
ω * t + α

232
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:58,407
+ cos^2 of

233
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:01,047
ω * t + α

234
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:03,715
times dt.

235
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:05,962
What do we notice?

236
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,230
We take notice that this relation

237
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,453
sin^2 + cos^2 is equal to 1.

238
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:15,240
And therefore simplifies our
calculations.

239
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,250
So then we continue,

240
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,873
we get 2 times the average power
in a resistor

241
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:28,458
it is U (peek)^2

242
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,423
divided by R.

243
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:32,579
And then we find what we
are looking for:

244
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:37,689
the average that is equal to U(peek)^2/2R.

245
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,022
So we see here that,

246
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:41,444
contrary to the steady state,

247
00:13:41,444 --> 00:13:45,159
so when we where in cosine

248
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:50,116
or in single phase 
cosinusoidal or sinusoidal 

249
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,467
but if we are in continuous,

250
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,500
we know that the power
of a resistor

251
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,390
is U^2/R.

252
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,865
We see here this difference

253
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:08,325
of notions between U^2 and U.

254
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,368
Finally, this doesn't give the same
value, or the same concept of

255
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,200
information on the power inside
of the circuit.

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,649
And this will lead us to

257
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:22,380
define a new relation, that we
will call the effective value.

258
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,442
By definition,

259
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:29,024
the effective value

260
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:32,936
is equal to this:

261
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,980
X

262
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,900
square root of 1/T

263
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,250
integral from 0 to T of x^2 dt.

264
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,879
What have we done?

265
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,138
We calculate the mean of the signal squared

266
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,667
and we take the square root.

267
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:52,188
So here is the definition of
the effective value.

268
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,070
So let's know see

269
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,730
for a sine or a cosine
what it can give.

270
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,741
An example:

271
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,479
for the sinusoidal value,

272
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:10,105
I take an X(t)

273
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,859
that is equal to

274
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,563
sin (ω * t + α).

275
00:15:17,563 --> 00:15:20,181
And I look for the effective value.

276
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,809
So X is equal to

277
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:25,289
the square root of

278
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:27,722
X (peek)^2/T

279
00:15:27,722 --> 00:15:30,975
-there is X (peek) missing
here of course-

280
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,700
X (peek)^2/T  integral from 0 to T

281
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,122
of sin^2 (ωt + α) dt.

282
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,919
This when we do the entire calculation,

283
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,430
will give to us

284
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,483
X (peek)/√2.

285
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:54,019
And by definition,

286
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,120
we will therefore say that this

287
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,383
is the effective

288
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:03,086
value of X.

289
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,700
We will now

290
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,640
take back the example that is here, on top,

291
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,350
and calculate, but with the
effective value,

292
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,509
this new average power.

293
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,359
If I replace now

294
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,750
my U (peek),

295
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,070
I know that it is

296
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,220
U(effective) times √2

297
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,679
by replacing here by the
effective value,

298
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:35,789
what do I notice?

299
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:40,280
I notice that by putting
the effective value

300
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,180
instead of the peak value

301
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,590
the 2 disappears thanks to the √2

302
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,750
and finally this effective value  

303
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:53,490
represents an identical energetic
concept as the one that we had

304
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,240
in continuous current.

305
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,630
It is the value that will
be systematically used

306
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,050
in the calculation of powers,

307
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,366
but not powers only,

308
00:17:02,366 --> 00:17:04,412
also general markings,

309
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,380
we will generally write down 

310
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,912
that the effective value of
the voltage is equal to U,

311
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,103
the value of the current is equal to I.

312
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,309
We therefore have for the voltage:

313
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:21,730
√2 x U cos (ωt + α)

314
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,220
with U (peek) that is equal to

315
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,670
U x √2.

316
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,313
We have for the current,

317
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,178
√2 x I

318
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:36,855
cos (ωt + β)

319
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,582
with I (peek) equal to:

320
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:41,740
I x √2.

321
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,987
This √2 is the factor

322
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,284
to transform the effective value

323
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:51,560
into a peak value,

324
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,571
but the factor for sinusoidal values.

325
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,680
Warning, if we have a signal that is
square or triangle

326
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:07,100
or another, but
not sinusoidal,

327
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,446
well this factor won't be
equal to √2 anymore,

328
00:18:09,446 --> 00:18:10,889
but to another value.

329
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,810
In a conventional network 

330
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,883
that we have in a household 
or in an industry,

331
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:23,836
we say that generally the value of
the grid is equal to 230 volts.

332
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:26,620
What does this U = 230 volts mean ?

333
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,884
This is the efficient value.

334
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,740
This means that the maximum signal

335
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:41,169
that goes in the phase that we
connect tot the network

336
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:44,220
is not 230 volts peak voltage,

337
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,769
but it is 230 * √2 so almost
300 volts

338
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:52,250
in peak value.

339
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,180
So the U (peek) is equal to:

340
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,179
230 * √2

341
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,280
in a conventional network. 

342
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,429
We will now take every
known element,

343
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,369
the resistance, the inductance, the capacitance, 

344
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,880
to determinate what is happening 

345
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,696
when a resistor is crossed by
a sinusoidal current-voltage ;

346
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,779
same for the inductance,
same for the capacitor.

347
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,769
So first of all,
for the resistor,

348
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,670
let's imagine a resistor

349
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:31,539
where we will connect to
a voltage U = U(peek)

350
00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:34,710
cos (ωt + α)

351
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,269
Between those two terminals,

352
00:19:36,269 --> 00:19:38,752
will flow a current

353
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,235
inside the resistor.

354
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:46,116
Ohms law: U = R * i
is always true.

355
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:48,317
Therefore we can write this Ohms law

356
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,929
by replacing now
the different elements.

357
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:54,009
First, we have U(peek) that is equal

358
00:19:54,009 --> 00:19:57,359
to cos (ωt + α)

359
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:59,799
= R * ....

360
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,319
The current must be the same kind
and the same frequency,

361
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,929
so we can already write

362
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,355
I (peek) cos (ωt + β)

363
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,951
There are unknowns here,

364
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:15,129
these are β and I (peek),

365
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,769
if we know the U (peek)
and the α.

366
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,920
We get that,

367
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,750
U (peek)

368
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,309
is equal to R * I(peek)

369
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,972
by doing the identification,

370
00:20:29,972 --> 00:20:33,236
we see that it's the only way to
be able to solve this problem

371
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:36,220
And also that α

372
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,070
is equal to β.

373
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,649
This means that the resistor

374
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:43,449
doesn't change the phase angle

375
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,879
of the voltage.

376
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:48,729
In other words,

377
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,420
voltage

378
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,580
and current

379
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:57,110
are in phase in this
configuration of the resistor.

380
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,210
And this will be very handy
in the future

381
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,850
to always remember
that the resistor

382
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:04,489
doesn't change the angle phase.

383
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:06,892
Now in the case of the inductance.

384
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:10,974
Therefore we know that
the law that links the voltage

385
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,276
and the current in an inductance,

386
00:21:13,276 --> 00:21:16,470
is the fluctuation of the current
as function of time

387
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,319
multiplied by L, which gives
the voltage at the terminals.

388
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,440
So if we draw this sketch again.

389
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,339
We have here an inductance.

390
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:27,065
Here at the terminals we will put

391
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:29,499
U = U (peek)

392
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:32,633
cos (ωt + α)

393
00:21:33,313 --> 00:21:35,879
What about the current that goes through

394
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,599
this inductance here ?

395
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,750
We can write this
equation again.

396
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,053
First, the voltage equation:

397
00:21:42,053 --> 00:21:43,582
U (peek)

398
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:47,341
cos (ωt + α) =

399
00:21:47,341 --> 00:21:51,970
-so here we have a derivative, the derivative
of the cosine which gives a sine

400
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,362
with the internal derivative, ω that goes
up-front, and a minus sign-

401
00:21:56,362 --> 00:22:00,804
so we have - ω * L * I (peek)

402
00:22:00,804 --> 00:22:05,612
sin (ωt + β)

403
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,277
Now, we will put back
the sine and the cosine

404
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:09,842
to have an equality on both sides,

405
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:13,539
and therefore we transform 
this - ω

406
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:15,230
sin (ωt)

407
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,690
by a + ω cosine phase
shifted of π/2

408
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,205
So we have an equal sign, here, at ω * L

409
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:24,762
I (peek)

410
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:30,721
cos (ωt + β + π/2)

411
00:22:31,671 --> 00:22:33,534
By doing this identification again

412
00:22:33,534 --> 00:22:34,846
on both sides,

413
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:38,478
we get to the following  conclusions.

414
00:22:39,248 --> 00:22:45,159
First, U (peek) is equal to
 ω * L * I (peek).

415
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,830
We have a ratio that 
depends on the pulse.

416
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,129
Bigger the pulse is,

417
00:22:50,129 --> 00:22:54,308
more this voltage will fluctuate
as function of the current.

418
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,928
Finally, α is equal to

419
00:22:56,928 --> 00:22:59,668
β + π/2.

420
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:04,279
In short, the current and the voltage

421
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,650
will be in quadrature.

422
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,779
So a delay of the current

423
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:12,069
of an angle π/2 compared to the voltage.

424
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:14,419
So voltage

425
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,140
and current

426
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,780
in quadrature.

427
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,900
Finally, the case of the capacitor.

428
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,480
Here, we draw again the sketch.

429
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,506
We have here at the terminals,

430
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,352
a voltage U (peek)

431
00:23:28,352 --> 00:23:31,640
cos (ωt + α).

432
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,860
We are looking for the current

433
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:36,995
that will flow through this capacitance,

434
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:38,671
the capacitor.

435
00:23:38,671 --> 00:23:40,915
The link that we know,

436
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,969
is the fluctuation of the voltage
as function of time multiplied 

437
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:46,980
by he capacitance will
give us the current.

438
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,159
So we write here, this equation
as function of the current.

439
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,220
First I (peek),

440
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:58,560
that will necessarily be a cosine,

441
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,570
 ω * t + β

442
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:04,579
is equal to the derivative
this time, of the voltage.

443
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,480
So we get the same elements
as before

444
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,849
so finally ω * C * U (peek)

445
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:13,398
sin (ωt + α).

446
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:16,349
We convert this sine into a cosine

447
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:20,995
and we get ω * C * U (peek)

448
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:26,151
cos (ωt + α + π/2)

449
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:29,757
The result now is that

450
00:24:29,757 --> 00:24:33,173
U (peek) is in the end equal to

451
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:36,868
I (peek)/ω * C

452
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:40,655
and that α is equal to β

453
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:42,282
minus π/2.

454
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,819
We therefore have here

455
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:46,529
the voltage

456
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,319
and the current

457
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,393
in quadrature.

458
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,890
Here the current

459
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:56,090
is ahead of π/2

460
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:59,230
on the voltage.

461
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,980
So now let's imagine,

462
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,779
the case of a more complex problem

463
00:25:02,779 --> 00:25:04,918
where we have R and L at the same time

464
00:25:04,918 --> 00:25:07,519
on a same circuit.

465
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:09,569
What can we write down?

466
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:12,129
How can we pull through
in this way ?

467
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:14,689
We will realize that if
we stay

468
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,770
with our simple Kirchhoff
calculation

469
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,450
like we did until now,

470
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,679
the system will become
very complex.

471
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,250
So rather see.

472
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,109
If we want to write here
the Kirchhoff equation,

473
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:28,605
of elements linked to this voltage,

474
00:25:28,605 --> 00:25:31,736
we can write that U is equal
first of all to

475
00:25:31,736 --> 00:25:34,490
R * i  +

476
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,060
- at the crossing in the inductance-

477
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:39,090
L di/dt

478
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:41,640
By replacing now the
different elements,

479
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,960
we get U (peek)

480
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,940
cos (ωt + α) =

481
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,607
here we already have a simple connection,

482
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,500
R * I (peek) * cos (ωt + β).

483
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,200
So we always assume that

484
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,170
when we are in the
same circuit,

485
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:01,760
the pulses have to be
all the same.

486
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,180
So our unknown,

487
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,940
their are two for the current,

488
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,010
it's the magnitude
and the phase β

489
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,960
plus

490
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:14,150
here L di/dt that becomes
minus,

491
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,270
because the cosine becomes sine:

492
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,499
ω * L * I (peek)

493
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:25,066
sin (ωt + β).

494
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,030
So you see here, that
it becomes pretty complicated.

495
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,656
We can not make an identification anymore

496
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:33,070
by saying to the left or
to the right of the equation, 

497
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:35,810
because we have here three terms
and no longer two terms.

498
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,110
We must then simplify this
equation to be able to succeed,

499
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,823
we must break down the functions

500
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,506
sine and cosine

501
00:26:43,506 --> 00:26:44,890
into sums.

502
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,040
Here come the following thing:

503
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,653
we have U (peek) that multiplies

504
00:26:49,653 --> 00:26:54,686
the cos (ωt) *cos (α)

505
00:26:55,349 --> 00:27:00,329
- sin (ωt) * sin (α)

506
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:01,782
and this is equal to

507
00:27:01,782 --> 00:27:03,025
I (peek)

508
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:04,369
that multiplies

509
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:07,859
R * cos (ωt) * cos (β)

510
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,479
- R * sin (ωt) * sin (β)

511
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,777
- ω * L*sin (ωt) * cos (β)

512
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:26,844
- ω * L * cos (ωt) * sin (β)

513
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:31,243
You can see that we get to
very simple equations,

514
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:33,451
also called transcendental,

515
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:38,277
and that are not
very easy to use,

516
00:27:38,277 --> 00:27:41,965
even if our circuit is "only"
an RL circuit,

517
00:27:41,965 --> 00:27:43,256
so relatively simple.

518
00:27:43,256 --> 00:27:45,190
If we must do all this work
for just RL,

519
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,200
we will see that this will
really complicate everything.

520
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,950
So now we can do
an identification

521
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,610
so we can write that

522
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,329
U (peek)

523
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:57,009
cos(α) is equal to

524
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,120
R * I (peek) * cos (β)

525
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,040
- ω * L * I (peek)

526
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,289
sin (β)

527
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:06,730
And the we have the other one:

528
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,229
U (peek) * sin (α)

529
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:11,399
is equal to

530
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,940
R * I (peek) * sin (β)

531
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,689
+ ω * L * I (peek)

532
00:28:17,689 --> 00:28:19,759
cos (β).

533
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,960
So these are the two equations
that we can write by identification

534
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,473
and now by summing
the squares of the

535
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,781
equations that are here.

536
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:33,089
we will be able, 
to find the following

537
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,790
terms by gathering them,

538
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,359
but after a lot of calculations.

539
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,631
We get:

540
00:28:40,245 --> 00:28:43,561
U (peek) = I (peek)

541
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:49,475
√(R^2 + ω^2 L^2

542
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,968
So you can see that
it is relatively complex

543
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:55,959
to get to such a result.

544
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,830
And we will finally get to

545
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:00,721
α = β + φ.

546
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,020
But I will skip these calculations.

547
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,009
So the complexity of the result,

548
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:13,350
will lead us now to

549
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,269
another method.

550
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:19,990
We will now involve
complex calculation

551
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,859
In our different resolutions
of the circuit. 

552
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:26,988
So I remind you the formulation,

553
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:29,184
or Euler's formula,

554
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,029
to write any number,

555
00:29:36,029 --> 00:29:38,812
so I will write here X

556
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:44,572
that is equal to X(peek)  e^j θ

557
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:48,689
and this is what Euler's
formula tells us,

558
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:53,442
is equal to X (peek) * cos (θ)

559
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:58,355
+ j sin (θ).

560
00:29:58,355 --> 00:29:59,629
So you can see that

561
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:03,507
in our different
sinusoidal connections,

562
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:05,430
whether the current or the voltage,

563
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,150
we have made it this form.

564
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:10,007
We have a part of this vector,

565
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:15,307
here it's a vector because we have
a real part and an imaginary part. 

566
00:30:15,307 --> 00:30:18,602
So this is the real part,

567
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:22,245
and this is the imaginary part.

568
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:29,320
And so, in our everyday lives

569
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,392
their are sines and cosines,

570
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:33,488
it is either the real part

571
00:30:33,488 --> 00:30:38,175
or the imaginary part of
this vector or this relation,

572
00:30:38,175 --> 00:30:41,348
that I write X underline
to show you here

573
00:30:41,348 --> 00:30:44,107
that it's a vector or a
complex number.

574
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:46,575
The big advantage for
such a thing,

575
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:49,086
is that by noting Euler's formula,

576
00:30:50,996 --> 00:30:52,780
we have here some derivatives

577
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,470
- if we derive this
complex number -

578
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:58,363
that takes the same form as
the first element.

579
00:30:58,363 --> 00:31:02,850
And same for the primitive of
an integral, we get the same form.

580
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,689
It's always an exponential.

581
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:08,456
And this will paradoxically
simplify our calculations

582
00:31:08,456 --> 00:31:16,659
when we will try to solve an
alternative single phased circuit,

583
00:31:16,659 --> 00:31:20,659
is to use the complex notations.

584
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:22,652
So now, the idea is
to do this:

585
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:24,609
our voltage U

586
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:29,619
written U (peek) * cos (ωt + α).

587
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:33,619
This voltage that we will
decide to write differently.

588
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:36,270
We will write it U(vector).

589
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,966
We will make a complex
number with this relation.

590
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:43,425
What we are doing is

591
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:45,244
then purely conceptual,

592
00:31:45,244 --> 00:31:47,162
and will allow us to solve

593
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:50,399
the problems of complicated calculations
that we had previously.

594
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,088
So by writing Euler's formula

595
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,280
U = U (peek)

596
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,280
e^j (ωt + α).

597
00:32:00,141 --> 00:32:05,058
After all, we define our small u,

598
00:32:05,058 --> 00:32:07,811
the real world as function of time,

599
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:13,594
it is the real part of this complex
number that we just made,

600
00:32:13,594 --> 00:32:17,594
because it is only the part 
of the cosine and not the sine.

601
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:21,454
So right now,
as an example,

602
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:23,753
let's try to do
exactly the same thing

603
00:32:23,753 --> 00:32:26,633
for our example RL.

604
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:30,159
Since once we will finish
all our calculations,

605
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:33,144
but with complex numbers,

606
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:35,660
we will be able to come
back to the real numbers,

607
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,790
by saying that U or I

608
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,953
are the real parts of
complex numbers.

609
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:47,290
So we will now see

610
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,766
U that becomes U (vector)

611
00:32:50,766 --> 00:32:56,702
= U (peek) * e^j (ωt + α).

612
00:32:56,702 --> 00:33:00,702
The current will also have a
complex form :

613
00:33:01,228 --> 00:33:07,056
i (peek) * e^j (ωt + β)

614
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:09,790
So we make complex numbers,

615
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,526
we work with complex numbers.

616
00:33:11,526 --> 00:33:18,023
Our equation U = R * i + L di/dt

617
00:33:18,023 --> 00:33:19,450
becomes

618
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,042
U (vector) = R * i (vector)

619
00:33:24,748 --> 00:33:26,843
+ L di/dt

620
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:30,843
+ j ω L i (vector)

621
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:34,240
You see, we have here on top the current i

622
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,859
that is written with Euler's formula.

623
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,779
I (peek) e^j (ωt + β).

624
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:41,475
When we derive,

625
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:43,548
there is the j ω that comes up front, 

626
00:33:43,548 --> 00:33:45,798
and that simply multiplies

627
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:47,158
i again.

628
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:54,005
Therefore the derivation of a complex number
is the same thing as multiplying it by j ω.

629
00:33:55,549 --> 00:33:58,844
We will write it later, to sum up.

630
00:33:58,844 --> 00:34:01,994
So we can now write this
U (vector),

631
00:34:01,994 --> 00:34:03,571
by putting everything together,

632
00:34:03,571 --> 00:34:07,988
to R + j ω L times the current.

633
00:34:07,988 --> 00:34:11,771
And we will call this new
complex number R + j ω L,

634
00:34:11,771 --> 00:34:13,440
we will call it Z

635
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,724
if you wish.

636
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:18,036
So we will have U = Z * i.

637
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:21,738
In this Z, we can say that

638
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:28,168
R + j ω L is therefore this Z
that i just made

639
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:31,068
with Euler's formula,

640
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:34,525
it is Z e^j and we will
define an angle : φ.

641
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:37,291
So Z, the norm, will be

642
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:42,134
the square root of R^2 + ω^2 L^2

643
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:44,786
because here we have the form a + bj.

644
00:34:44,786 --> 00:34:47,725
To look for the norm
it's the square root of a^2 + b^2 .

645
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:50,118
And the angle φ

646
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:54,978
is the tangent arc of ωL/R.

647
00:34:56,075 --> 00:35:02,579
So we can now write what
we have here as a summary,

648
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:08,599
to be able to replace in the
equation of the beginning here,

649
00:35:09,033 --> 00:35:13,033
and also in the equation
that I just wrote.

650
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:18,722
Here, we will replace U and I
by their functions.

651
00:35:18,722 --> 00:35:20,262
This becomes:

652
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:27,138
U (peek) e^j (ωt + α)

653
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:29,107
on one side,

654
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,279
Z e^j (φ)

655
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:33,879
that multiplies the current I (peek)

656
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:37,879
e^j (ωt + β)

657
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:45,470
and this could be simplified into Z I (peek)

658
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:52,063
e^j (ωt + β + φ)

659
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,796
since the multiplication
of the two complex numbers here

660
00:35:54,796 --> 00:35:58,588
will make the sum of the arguments.

661
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:01,165
We get to the following conclusion:

662
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:04,521
U (peek) = Z I (peek)

663
00:36:04,521 --> 00:36:07,429
we have found in our I
if we had the U as data,

664
00:36:07,429 --> 00:36:11,429
α = β + φ.

665
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,499
Finally, what interest us,

666
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:15,392
because they are
complex numbers,

667
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:18,661
we can come back to
real numbers by saying

668
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:25,091
that U is the real part of
U (vector), so it's

669
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:32,069
Z I (peek) cos (ωt + β + φ).

670
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:40,542
And you see that we have drastically
simplified the calculation of RL,

671
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:44,501
by finding here directly,
the answer of what we were looking for.

672
00:36:44,956 --> 00:36:50,831
We can also represent, it's
interesting, the impedance Z.

673
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:56,704
This Z here, or written also here with
its complex form.

674
00:36:57,224 --> 00:36:59,246
This Z that i remind you,

675
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:06,933
has for value R^2 + ω^2 L^2 ,

676
00:37:07,307 --> 00:37:10,786
we can represent it
in the complex plane,

677
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:13,528
and the real or
imaginary components

678
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:19,506
make one vector which length is
equal to the modulus of the impedance Z.

679
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:22,636
So we will write here
that this length is Z.

680
00:37:22,636 --> 00:37:24,546
Here it's the vector Z.

681
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:27,786
The length is therefore
the modulus of the impedance

682
00:37:27,786 --> 00:37:30,347
and the angle φ, that is here,

683
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:33,547
is the tangent arc of ω L/R,

684
00:37:34,279 --> 00:37:37,409
that will be also be the phase
shift definition

685
00:37:37,409 --> 00:37:40,529
between voltage and current,
as we see here.

686
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:46,022
This φ is the phase shift between
the voltage and the current.

687
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,380
So to conclude, we saw the
single phased state, its definition,

688
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,380
how to represent these vectors
with complex numbers

689
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,989
that will help us paradoxicaly 

690
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:58,793
to simplify calculations.

691
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:00,553
Therefore the advantages of complex calculations

692
00:38:00,553 --> 00:38:03,686
for this differential equation in 
steady-state resolution

693
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:06,616
which otherwise becomes
pretty difficult

694
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:09,631
if we use real numbers .

695
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:10,887
Thank you.
