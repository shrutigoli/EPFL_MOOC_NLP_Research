00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,953
Hello, welcome to this new lesson

2
00:00:05,953 --> 00:00:07,966
of the Electrotechnics Course.

3
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:10,126
Today, we will discuss
about two methods

4
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:13,433
that we have developed
in the DC steady state and we will adopt

5
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,465
for the AC steady state. 

6
00:00:15,465 --> 00:00:18,031
First of all,
we will initially see

7
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,501
the Thevenin and 
Norton theorems

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,721
applied to a circuit
under the AC steady state.

9
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:27,922
Secondly,
we will see under which conditions

10
00:00:27,922 --> 00:00:31,312
we can apply
the superposition principle

11
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:32,709
in the AC steady state

12
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:34,475
and we will then see a small example.

13
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:38,685
To recall, the Thevenin theorem 
says that any dipole,

14
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:42,114
here we have an example of dipole

15
00:00:42,114 --> 00:00:43,612
with elements inside 

16
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:46,257
and we have here the two dipoles.

17
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,060
Therefore,  any dipole could be replaced

18
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:53,844
by a real voltage supply, then an ideal voltage supply,

19
00:00:53,844 --> 00:00:57,282
in series with an internal impedance.

20
00:00:57,282 --> 00:01:00,201
A real voltage supply

21
00:01:00,201 --> 00:01:06,590
when the voltage U0, here,
is the no-load voltage of the dipole

22
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,838
and that the internal impedance Zi correspond

23
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,976
to the ratio of the open-circuit voltage
 and short-circuit current.

24
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:20,122
Therefore Z, here, is equal to U0
the non-load voltage divided by

25
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,909
the short-circuit current
when we short the dipole.

26
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,678
Same, the Norton theorem
says that any dipole

27
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:30,938
can be replaced by
a real current supply,

28
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:35,473
then, here, by an ideal current supply,

29
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:38,703
in parallel with
an internal impedance.

30
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:42,015
Therefore, a real current supply

31
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:47,885
with the current Icc, here, is the short-circuit 
current of the dipole

32
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:50,078
and with an internal impedance

33
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,724
equal to the one of the real
voltage supply U0

34
00:01:54,724 --> 00:01:59,548
which is equal to Zi*Icc

35
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:02,928
The condition so that the
Thevenin theorem

36
00:02:02,928 --> 00:02:05,165
and Norton theorem
are applicable

37
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:09,902
is that all the supplies
in the dipole

38
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,763
should have the same frequency.

39
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:16,070
If the dipole is equivalent to

40
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,719
a real voltage supply
or an ideal voltage supply,

41
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,848
then, there is also an equivalence

42
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:30,604
between a real voltage supply 
and a real current supply.

43
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:33,440
If we replace the dipole, or the circuit,

44
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,596
by this real voltage supply,

45
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:41,973
or only part of the circuit
by this real voltage supply,

46
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:45,907
we obtain the equivalence
applying this relation,

47
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:54,782
namely, the ideal
voltage supply is equal to the ratio

48
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:59,577
of the no-load voltage U0 divided by
the internal impedance

49
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:02,998
and the internal impedance, which is 
in series with the voltage supply,

50
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:07,176
is here in parallel
with the current supply.

51
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,288
The inverse operation,

52
00:03:09,288 --> 00:03:10,768
that is to say if we isolate
in the circuit

53
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:14,971
or if replace the circuit, this dipole,

54
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:19,591
we find out the equivalence
of the real current supply

55
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:22,067
with the real voltage supply

56
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:31,106
replacing the tension U0 by
the product Zi*Icc.

57
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:37,129
And we replace the internal impedance in parallel
by an internal impedance in series.

58
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,894
As we've already seen in the DC steady state,

59
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:43,128
we can also determine
the internal impedance

60
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:47,616
removing all voltage 
supplies and computing

61
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:52,611
the impedance seen from outside,
the dipole impedance,

62
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:55,238
and we therefore obtain the internal impedance.

63
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:58,685
We will now see a small example.

64
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:06,657
If the voltage supply is equal to U0

65
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:10,342
that we write under
the exponential complex form,

66
00:04:10,342 --> 00:04:15,824
then a norm times an
exponent exp(j alpha)

67
00:04:15,824 --> 00:04:20,522
and that the internal impedance Zi is equal

68
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:26,771
to an internal resistance plus
an internal reactance Xi,

69
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,738
the current for the transformation,

70
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:44,588
the short-circuit current will be given
under Icc=U0/Zi

71
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:49,802
which is equal to the norm times exp(j alpha)

72
00:04:49,802 --> 00:04:57,076
divided by the internal 
resistance plus the internal j X.

73
00:04:57,076 --> 00:05:00,793
We can see at that stage of development 

74
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:06,714
that it is not easy to solve
this kind of fraction.

75
00:05:06,714 --> 00:05:10,212
We will then use the 
exponential properties,

76
00:05:10,212 --> 00:05:14,691
we will transform this part,
which is in cartesian form,

77
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:19,544
to an expression in polar form.

78
00:05:19,544 --> 00:05:24,773
Then we can rewrite
the identical numerator exp(j alpha)

79
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:29,971
and then the denominator
that we will write as a

80
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:38,497
norm times exp(j phi),
an argument, knowing that Zi,

81
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:45,404
using Pythagoras,
is equal to square root of Ri² + Xi²

82
00:05:45,404 --> 00:05:47,952
and that the argument phi is given by

83
00:05:47,952 --> 00:05:51,985
tangent arc of the imaginary part,
the reactance Xi,

84
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,016
divided by the internal resistance.

85
00:05:57,016 --> 00:05:58,222
Written like that, 

86
00:05:58,222 --> 00:06:11,774
we can simply rewrite the equation
as U0/Zi*exp(j(alpha-phi))

87
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:19,878
and this is the current expression,
namely, Icc*exp(j beta)

88
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:26,876
and, by analogy, we see that
the norm of Icc is U0/Zi

89
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:31,124
and the argument beta is equal to alpha minus phi.

90
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,288
Then, the mathematical operations 

91
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:39,229
must be carried out using
the rules of Complex calculation.

92
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:41,670
In this second part of the lecture,

93
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,108
we will see how
could we apply

94
00:06:44,108 --> 00:06:47,403
The superposition principle
in the AC steady state.

95
00:06:47,403 --> 00:06:52,685
As a reminder, the superposition principle
says that the response of a circuit,

96
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,230
namely a current somewhere
in the circuit

97
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,007
or a voltage across
an element of the circuit,

98
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:03,187
the circuit response to a sum of
excitations is equal to

99
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:06,913
the sum of the responses
of each excitation.

100
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:08,256
taken individually.

101
00:07:09,206 --> 00:07:13,413
As in the DC steady state, the superposition
principle is applicable 

102
00:07:13,413 --> 00:07:16,798
but as long as,
the steady state is linear.

103
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:23,850
As a reminder, the linear term
means that the value R of a resistor

104
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,076
doesn't vary with the current
flowing through it.

105
00:07:28,076 --> 00:07:32,654
Therefore, the relation U = R*I
is still valid.

106
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:34,108
Same for an inductance,

107
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:39,071
its value L will not vary
with the current flowing through it,

108
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:40,731
so it does not saturate.

109
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:44,422
And, finally, the value C
of a capacitor

110
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:49,157
doesn't vary with the voltage 
which is present at its terminals.

111
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:50,968
We will then threat these two cases:

112
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:53,554
The first case for which
all the supplies

113
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:56,616
of voltage and current
have the same frequency.

114
00:07:57,106 --> 00:08:02,819
We  successively consider
each individual supply

115
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,724
to know its response
for the requested variable.

116
00:08:06,724 --> 00:08:10,321
The final variable is 
the vector sum

117
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,452
of individual contributions
of each supply.

118
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:20,536
So for a variable
that we call here X,

119
00:08:20,536 --> 00:08:28,922
The variable Xtot is the contribution,
the vector sum

120
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:35,270
of each contribution
of each supply.

121
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,232
The variable X in this equation

122
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:42,001
can be either a voltage
or a current

123
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:44,950
but not a power.

124
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,974
Why? Because the power
is a quadratic function

125
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:53,055
and then not linear, so the superposition
principle is not applicable 

126
00:08:53,055 --> 00:08:54,828
in the case of powers.

127
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:56,656
We can demonstrate,

128
00:08:56,656 --> 00:08:59,740
namely, if we write
the power P1

129
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,005
that will be dissipated  in the resistor
R due to the supply 1,

130
00:09:04,005 --> 00:09:10,419
this power would be equal to R*I1².

131
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:16,498
The power P2 that would
be the dissipated power

132
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:26,532
in the resistor due to supply 2,
would be equal to R*I².

133
00:09:27,242 --> 00:09:34,162
But the total power is not equal
to this, why?

134
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:42,978
Because Ptot, which is
the sum of two powers,

135
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:50,783
is not equal to R times
the total current I1 + I2 squared.

136
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:57,072
Why? Because the last expression
can be developed as follows...

137
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:10,824
where you can see this double product,
here, showing that for the powers

138
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:14,314
the superposition principle
is not applicable.

139
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,288
We threat now a second case.

140
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:18,970
It is the case for which
all the supplies

141
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,311
of voltage and current 
don't have the same frequency

142
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,096
and the method is:

143
00:10:23,096 --> 00:10:28,535
We will first regroup
the supplies based on their frequencies,

144
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:31,104
that is to say we take all
the supplies that have the same frequency

145
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:32,439
and we will put them together

146
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:38,283
and for each group of frequency,
we will apply the method seen in case A.

147
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:43,886
Therefore, we will have a vector sum
of contributions for each frequency,

148
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,233
it is expressed here.

149
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:50,335
For the first frequency
we have a first contribution

150
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:52,008
of the supplies at that frequency

151
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:53,865
and for this frequency,

152
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,710
we have again a sum
of contributions,

153
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,015
and so forth for all the frequencies.

154
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:02,229
Finally, the addition of
the vector sums,

155
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:07,127
of the sums here, of the contributions

156
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:10,953
has to be done, finally, 
in the temporal domain.

157
00:11:10,953 --> 00:11:13,328
This transformation in
the temporal domain

158
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:16,382
we will do it now,
we will threat only a simpler case,

159
00:11:16,382 --> 00:11:20,068
a general case where we will
have only two frequencies.

160
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:22,812
For the first frequency f1,

161
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:31,637
we will have a sum of all
the contributions that we call Xtot1,

162
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,466
that i can write under
the exponential form

163
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:41,690
with a norm:
Xtot*exp(j alpha1)

164
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:48,083
and I will transform
this effective complex phasor

165
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,924
 in an instantaneous complex value,
in the temporal complex domain.

166
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:57,210
The norm which is here under effective form,

167
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,943
I will take its peak value,

168
00:11:58,943 --> 00:12:05,792
namely a square root of 2 times Xtot,
times exp(j),

169
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:09,833
we reintroduce the omega1 pulsation,

170
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:14,524
omega1 times t plus alpha1,

171
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:24,306
and this is equal to small x, lower case x,
because it depends on the time, xtot1.

172
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:30,369
Same for the second frequency
we've identified

173
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:34,960
where we have the sum of the contributions Xtot2

174
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,379
under exponential complex form

175
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:46,006
we can write as Xtot2
-- sorry I've forgotten here the 1 --

176
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:50,108
times exp(j alpha2),

177
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:54,327
that we transform in
a instantaneous complex value

178
00:12:54,327 --> 00:13:02,054
namely a square root of 2 times Xtot2,
-- sorry I've forgotten again the 1 here --

179
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:12,477
then the peak value times
exp(j oméga2*t + alpha2)

180
00:13:12,477 --> 00:13:17,690
and this is equal to xtot2.

181
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,214
Now, to have the final result,

182
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:25,777
we will add these two
partial results,

183
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:33,976
we have that xfinal, the instantaneous
complex value

184
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:35,804
in the temporal domain,

185
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:45,568
is equal to xtot1 + xtot2.

186
00:13:47,168 --> 00:13:54,909
If we develop, we have xfinal,
as function of time,

187
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:03,799
equals to square root of 2 times
xtot1 times the exponential.

188
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:10,736
And the second term
for the second frequency,

189
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:16,525
square root of 2 times
xtot2 times the exponential.

190
00:14:19,445 --> 00:14:20,900
The exponential sum
is not well suited

191
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,826
for the additions so we will transform
these instantaneous complex values

192
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:28,888
in instantaneous values
in the temporal domain

193
00:14:28,888 --> 00:14:30,945
and then the final value ....

194
00:14:32,695 --> 00:14:39,945
will be equal to square root of 2 times 
xtot1 times

195
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:48,620
the sin (oméga1 t + alpha1),
plus the second contribution,

196
00:14:48,620 --> 00:15:01,428
square root of 2 times xtot2 times
sin (oméga2 t + alpha2).

197
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,327
Let's consider now this small example

198
00:15:05,327 --> 00:15:11,473
where an RL circuit is supplied,

199
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,677
the circuit will be excited using two supplies:

200
00:15:13,677 --> 00:15:17,345
a first supply U0
which has a certain frequency,

201
00:15:17,345 --> 00:15:19,907
here a frequency null,
it is a continuous supply,

202
00:15:19,907 --> 00:15:23,384
and a second excitation,
it is the voltage U1

203
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:28,371
which has a second frequency equal to 50Hz.

204
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:32,766
Therefore, the excitation is caused
by these two supplies in this circuit

205
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:38,221
and we are looking for the response,
here in this case the total current.

206
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:42,168
We can then decompose this circuit
into two sub-circuits,

207
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:47,117
the first one where we consider only
the voltage supply U0

208
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:50,503
and we will have the following result:

209
00:15:51,513 --> 00:16:06,922
the voltage supply U0, the resistor R,
the inductance L and the contribution of Itot,

210
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:12,167
the contribution of U0
that we call here I0.

211
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:17,881
We will add the contribution
of the second excitation,

212
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:23,613
of the second supply
which lead us to the following circuit: 

213
00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:44,644
a voltage U1 which feeds the circuit RL
and whose answer is  the current I1.

214
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:50,972
The total current will be the sum
of these two contributions I0 and I1.

215
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:54,394
So let's develop now
the equations.

216
00:16:54,394 --> 00:17:00,478
the impedance Z of this circuit is given by

217
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:07,885
the real term R plus
the imaginary term j omega0 times L,

218
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:10,622
and omega0 is the frequency
of the supply U0

219
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:14,072
which is equal to zero so
this term here is null,

220
00:17:14,072 --> 00:17:17,309
it remains only R.

221
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:22,594
The current I0 resulting therefrom
is given by:

222
00:17:22,594 --> 00:17:29,366
I0 equals to U divided by
the total impedance, then R.

223
00:17:30,386 --> 00:17:32,638
It is our first result.

224
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:35,262
Concerning the second excitation,

225
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:42,562
once again we have the impedance Z
which is equal to R, the real part,

226
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:49,114
plus the imaginary part here
that is equal to j omega1 times L,

227
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:51,482
this time omega1 is not
equal  to zero,

228
00:17:51,482 --> 00:17:53,510
we will have to take this into account
in the calculations.

229
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,120
and we can write by Kirchhoff that

230
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,176
this voltage is equal to the voltage 
drop across the two elements,

231
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:06,155
we have then U1 equals
to the impedance Z,

232
00:18:06,155 --> 00:18:08,427
which are in series,

233
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:10,538
times I1.

234
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:19,387
And then, I1 is 
the ratio of U1 over Z.

235
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:30,964
We develop this term
and we obtain that I1 is equal to U1,

236
00:18:30,964 --> 00:18:36,849
we divide the normes,
divided by the norm of Z,

237
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:44,530
here using Pythagoras, we find
that it is equal to square root of R² + X²,

238
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,630
i directly replace X,
with omega square L

239
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:53,832
X2 times the exponentials.

240
00:18:53,832 --> 00:19:02,130
We assumed that U1
is equal to U1*exp(j0),

241
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,624
no phase shift with respect 
to time gives 0,

242
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:11,515
and then we have here the exponential
of -jφ1,

243
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:15,762
φ1 being the arguent here
of the impedance Z.

244
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:26,484
φ1 is equal to the arc tangente
of the imaginary part ω1L/R.

245
00:19:26,504 --> 00:19:34,374
In instantaneous value, we obtain that
the instantaneous complex current is equal to

246
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:40,008
the peak value,  that is 
to say the square root of 2 times the effective value I1

247
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:47,731
times exp(jω1t - φ1),

248
00:19:49,211 --> 00:19:52,399
that I express in the time domain,

249
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:59,434
we have then I1 equals to
the peak value Î1, this term,

250
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:07,205
times sin (ω1t - φ1).

251
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:14,582
The contribution current of the other supply
is equal to I0

252
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:19,284
and we recall here that it is U0/R.

253
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:29,284
The total current is therefore 
the sum of the two contributions ...

254
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:41,762
and it is equal to U0 over R plus
square root of 2 times U1

255
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:45,490
divided by the norm of Z,

256
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:58,788
this is the current, 
times sin (ω1t - φ1).

257
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:05,318
This being the final result.

258
00:21:07,978 --> 00:21:10,810
That's it, we have shown that the theorems
of Thevenin and Norton

259
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,336
are valid in the AC steady state

260
00:21:13,336 --> 00:21:17,128
but with the additional condition
 compared to the DC steady state,

261
00:21:17,128 --> 00:21:20,917
is that all supplies 
must have the same frequency.

262
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:23,814
Concerning the principle
of superposition,

263
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,911
it is also valid
under the AC steady state

264
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,003
but we should distinguish two cases:

265
00:21:28,003 --> 00:21:30,754
The first case where all
the supplies have the same frequency,

266
00:21:30,754 --> 00:21:33,632
and we can in that case make the addition 
in the complex domain

267
00:21:33,632 --> 00:21:35,405
with phasors,

268
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:39,853
The second case where all
the supplies don't have the same frequency,

269
00:21:39,853 --> 00:21:42,907
we should regroup in this case
the supplies according to their frequency

270
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:47,001
and then, in the end, go through 
the temporal domain to make the addition.

271
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,008
Thank you for your attention.
