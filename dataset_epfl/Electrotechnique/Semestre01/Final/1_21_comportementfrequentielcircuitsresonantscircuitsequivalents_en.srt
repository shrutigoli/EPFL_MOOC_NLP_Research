00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,415
Hello, and welcome to this new lecture
of the Electrotechnics course.

2
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,226
In the previous lecture,
we have studied and constructed

3
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:11,953
the geometric locus of an impedance.

4
00:00:11,953 --> 00:00:14,174
We have seen a particular
point of this locus,

5
00:00:14,174 --> 00:00:17,764
it is the point for which the impedance
is purely resistive,

6
00:00:17,764 --> 00:00:19,248
without any reactive part.

7
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:23,491
Today, we will study in more
details this particularity.

8
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,321
We will then talk about
resonant circuits,

9
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:28,696
composed of elements L and C.

10
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,770
We will see two different
type of circuits LC,

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:35,221
the case of a circuit LC in series,
and the case of a circuit LC in parallel,

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:39,753
we will see their behavior
in terms of frequency and the resonance condition.

13
00:00:39,753 --> 00:00:43,674
Finally, we will focus on
the equivalence of this dipole,

14
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:47,260
in series or in parallel,
and their frequency dependence. 

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,916
A dipole composed of two elements L and C,
connected in series or in parallel,

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,381
is called resonating circuit .

17
00:00:54,381 --> 00:00:57,483
We understand this name if we
refer to powers,

18
00:00:57,483 --> 00:00:59,812
we have shown that the
reactive power

19
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:04,617
is periodically transiting from
one element to another, L or C.

20
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,029
If we make an analogy with
the mechanical field,

21
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,425
for example a resonating
oscillator,

22
00:01:09,425 --> 00:01:11,653
made out of a mass and a spring,

23
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:16,305
in which there is a periodical exchange
between potential and kinetic energy

24
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:18,086
between the spring and the mass.

25
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:20,885
If we go back to our electric circuit,

26
00:01:20,885 --> 00:01:23,932
as function of the frequency
when it is excited, 

27
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:26,475
it's properties will be modified,

28
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:30,480
in particular because the impedance
changes value.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,933
Let's take the example of an inductance
and a capacitance in series.

30
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,263
They are presented in this figure

31
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:42,971
and we will calculate the total impedance
of the circuit, of the norm,

32
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:45,205
and we will represent it in
the complex plane.

33
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:50,696
Therefore if we call Zeq the total
impedance of the circuit,

34
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:57,821
it consists of a first part, it is the reactive
part of the inductance, 

35
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:03,503
plus, as it is in series,
the reactive part of the capacitor,

36
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:06,178
it is - j 1 over ωC.

37
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,881
We can write it differently,

38
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,319
by putting the two terms
under the same denominator,

39
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,451
we have j over ωC, and we
multiply it by ω²LC-1

40
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,735
We can calculate it's norm,

41
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:31,497
therefore the norm of Zeq is given
by the absolute value

42
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:43,332
of ω²LC-1 over ωC

43
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,447
The representation in the complex plane,
we have already done it many times,

44
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:51,806
is given by the sum of
these two vectors,

45
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:58,061
Therefore for the real part
and for the imaginary part,

46
00:02:58,061 --> 00:03:08,761
we have the vector that is the impedance of C,
and the vector that is the impedance of L,

47
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:16,010
that is to say - j over ωC and jωL

48
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,034
We see that these two vectors have
a length that depends

49
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:25,579
on the pulse or the frequency at which
the circuit is energized.

50
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:32,120
If we analyse this equation that
represents the total impedance of the circuit,  

51
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:40,070
we see that the pulse which the circuit is
energized the circuit tends to 0,

52
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,239
The equivalent impedance will
tend to infinity,

53
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,021
because we have a 0 at the denominator
and therefore this value becomes infinite.

54
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,916
Contrary to the other extreme,
if the pulse tends towards infinity,

55
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,831
The equivalent impedance also
tends to infinity,

56
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:06,657
because the term ω² is at the numerator

57
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:11,252
and therefore the norm of this term
will tend to infinity.

58
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:18,362
The resonance condition is achieved
for a particular point

59
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:23,083
when the numerator is here equal to 0,

60
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:30,389
that is to say, for a particular value
of ω that we will name ω0,

61
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:38,777
that is equal to 1 over √LC,
it is this numerator that is equal to 0

62
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:45,744
The resonance frequency that is
proportional to the pulse, 

63
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:52,640
is equal to 1 over 2π
multiplied by 1 over √LC

64
00:04:56,108 --> 00:05:03,420
Therefore ω0 is the resonance pulse
when the numerator is equal to 0

65
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:15,285
If we analyse this variable
as function of the pulse,

66
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,161
we see that the circuit is energized
at a pulse

67
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,726
that is inferior
to the resonance pulse,

68
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:31,367
we have that this term, the numerator
ω²LC is smaller than 1,

69
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:39,117
we therefore have an impedance Ẕ
that is a capacitive type.

70
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:46,859
The nature of the equivalent circuit
is capacitive type.

71
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:55,609
Therefore the circuit behaves in this case
as a capacitor.

72
00:05:55,992 --> 00:06:00,682
Contrary if the pulse which
energizes the circuit

73
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:07,073
is bigger than ω0 for
the resonance pulse,

74
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:11,436
we will have that ω²LC will be bigger than 1,

75
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:18,002
and the equivalent impedance
will be jX2 type,

76
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,388
and in this case here, the circuit will
behave as an inductance,

77
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:28,061
this is positive, we say that the nature of
the circuit at this frequency, is inductive.

78
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:34,794
The circuit globally behaves
as an inductance.

79
00:06:37,107 --> 00:06:42,906
Graphically, if we represent this
function in a ωZ plane

80
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:45,872
therefore Z as function of the pulse,

81
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:52,779
we will have that this Z,
as function of the pulse ω

82
00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:01,416
for a particular value of ω0,
is the resonance condition,

83
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,618
the numerator is equal to 0,

84
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:07,745
and therefore this impedance Z is equal to 0.

85
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,400
However when we get further from
this resonance pulse,

86
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,978
that is to say towards 0 or infinity,

87
00:07:14,978 --> 00:07:17,938
we have the norm of this impedance
that tend towards infinity,

88
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:22,207
which gives a curve that approximatively
looks like this.

89
00:07:23,178 --> 00:07:27,785
If we look at the imaginary part of Z
as function of ω

90
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,339
we will have something that
describes the following shape,

91
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:39,631
therefore as function of ω,
the equivalent imaginary part of Z,

92
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:46,983
we said that the circuit behaves
in a capacitive way,

93
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,080
under the resonance frequency,

94
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:59,022
and in an inductive way
above the resonance frequency,

95
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:02,330
therefore we have a curve that looks like this,

96
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:08,073
thus here a capacitive behaviour, and
here an inductive behaviour,

97
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:10,828
the imaginary part is positive.

98
00:08:12,198 --> 00:08:18,774
If we now consider the LC resonant
circuit but parallel,

99
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:24,841
we have this circuit here, we can again
write the equivalent impedance of the circuit,

100
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,786
that is equal, as the elements are
in parallel,

101
00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:36,477
to the inverse of the sum
of the impedance's inverse,

102
00:08:36,843 --> 00:08:43,830
which gives 1 over jωL, it's
the inverse of the inductance impedance,

103
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:54,120
+ jωC written differently to show the
scalar at the denominator,

104
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,263
it gives us this,

105
00:08:56,263 --> 00:09:04,811
the denominator is equal to 1 - ω²LC
and jωL at the numerator

106
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:10,560
If we analyse again the behaviour of the
circuit as function of the frequency,

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,672
thus when we energize at a frequency ω
that is very small, therefore that tends to 0,

108
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:20,871
well we have an impedance that
also tends to 0,

109
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:25,191
because this term in the numerator
cancels this term here.

110
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:31,256
Conversely if the frequency which
we energized the circuit tends to infinity,

111
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:34,632
we also have the impedance that
tends towards 0

112
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:38,003
because the term ω
at the denominator

113
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:41,021
becomes very high and cancels this term here.

114
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:48,138
For the particular value that cancels here
the denominator,

115
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:52,631
for this particular resonance
pulse value,

116
00:09:52,631 --> 00:10:00,588
ω is equal to 1 over √LC
thus we cancel the denominator,

117
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:05,570
this time the impedance
will tend towards infinity.

118
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:12,344
Therefore this is again
the resonance pulse,

119
00:10:15,203 --> 00:10:18,072
it is said that the circuit is tuned,

120
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:27,994
and it's the exact same condition as
in the LC circuit in series

121
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:32,550
Again, if we represent the norm
of Z as function

122
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:37,533
of the pulsation to which the circuit
is energized,

123
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:44,796
we have this particular value ω0
the resonance pulse,

124
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:47,532
for which the impedance is infinite,

125
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:54,838
and beyond this frequency,
the impedance tends towards 0,

126
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:58,917
thus this is the norm of the impedance,

127
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:04,045
we have something schematically,
which is like this,

128
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:14,656
with again an inductive behaviour
of the circuit,

129
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:20,554
for small values under
the pulse ω0,

130
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:27,654
and has a capacitive type when we
go above the resonance pulse.

131
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,918
So if we look now
the imaginary part

132
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:36,930
of the equivalent impedance
as function of the pulse,

133
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:43,061
we have again this resonant
pulse ω0

134
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:51,032
for which the imaginary part
of Z is zero,

135
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:58,014
and the circuit is of inductive nature,
at low frequency,

136
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:05,512
and of capacitive nature,
at high frequency.

137
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:10,327
This circuit is also called
tank circuit,

138
00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:20,097
because at the resonant pulse,
its impedance is infinite,

139
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:25,316
and therefore it will oppose to the
current flow at this frequency.

140
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,065
We have calculated by the real case
of a LC circuit in parallel ,

141
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:37,185
for witch we sketched the characteristic
with a simulation software,

142
00:12:37,185 --> 00:12:39,616
we can see as
we had said earlier,

143
00:12:39,616 --> 00:12:43,824
that we have this resonant
frequency here ω0

144
00:12:43,824 --> 00:12:50,555
The circuit is inductive for
frequencies smaller than ω0

145
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:53,637
and capacitive for
longer frequencies. 

146
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:57,072
If we power this circuit at a
pulse smaller than ω0

147
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:59,062
lets call it ω1,

148
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:04,441
the circuit will not oppose to
the current flow,

149
00:13:04,441 --> 00:13:07,310
because the impedance is low.

150
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:14,992
On the other side, if we power the circuit
at a frequency of pulse ω2

151
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:18,110
which corresponds to the
resonant frequency,

152
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,342
no current will flow because
the impedance is infinite,

153
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:25,084
the circuit opposes to this frequency.

154
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:32,076
If we increase again the
excitation pulse of the circuit,

155
00:13:32,076 --> 00:13:35,626
till a value, here for example, ω3

156
00:13:35,626 --> 00:13:41,110
again the circuit will not oppose
to the transit to this frequency,

157
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,738
their will be an output signal,
because the impedance is smaller.

158
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,893
Now, if we change the circuit
parameters,

159
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:52,710
that is to say that we will
change the value of LC,

160
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,308
and that we lower its values,

161
00:13:56,308 --> 00:14:00,541
the feature will move,

162
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:09,161
and will move to a value ω02

163
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:15,493
that is higher because
the LC pair is smaller,

164
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:20,179
and the signal at the pulse ω2
that was cut by the previous circuit,

165
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:25,842
is not for this circuit here because
the feature moved,

166
00:14:25,842 --> 00:14:31,137
and it's now this frequency that
will be attenuated by the circuit.

167
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:36,087
We see that one can use the
elements L and C of the circuit,

168
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:39,286
to finally bloc the frequency
that we want to.

169
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,962
This is the principle of filtering.

170
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:48,223
As a concrete case we have
a signal which is composed of two voltages,

171
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:49,809
first and second,

172
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:54,443
it can simply be 2
power supplies,

173
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,120
on at a frequency ω1,
the other at a frequency ω2

174
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,120
that powers our parallel circuit LC,

175
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:14,755
or it can be a more general case,
for example an audio signal

176
00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:18,700
which would include
many frequencies,

177
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,371
here we just have two but
it could be more,

178
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:27,279
if we add these two signals,
we find something like this,

179
00:15:28,593 --> 00:15:32,608
a signal that has two or
even several components,

180
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:35,550
we see here the first component
at a certain frequency,

181
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,921
and the second component
at another frequency.

182
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,403
If now we power the
parallel LC circuit

183
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:44,899
where the resonant frequency is ω01

184
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,195
which corresponds in this case,
to a low frequency,

185
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:51,030
which matches to this signal here,

186
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:56,667
I power my circuit with the total
signal here, that is the sum of both,

187
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:01,047
this frequency ω0 corresponds
to the low frequency here,

188
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:06,461
it will be attenuated, cut,
and therefore as output result,

189
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:09,032
we will have a signal that will
mainly have

190
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:10,800
a high frequency signal,

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,281
with a small low frequency
signal that is attenuated. 

192
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:19,886
If now we change the
resonant frequency of the circuit,

193
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,183
that is to say we change
the parameters L and C,

194
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:27,966
we decrease them so ω02 increases
and get the right frequency,

195
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:30,330
the high frequency of the signal,

196
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,667
well by powering the circuit
with this signal,

197
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:38,504
we will have the high frequency
that will be cut,

198
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:44,711
and a t the output, their will only be
the low frequency that remains,

199
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:48,481
here that is not attenuated by the circuit.

200
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:52,112
We can name two examples
from our everyday lives,

201
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:58,326
the first one is an ADSL link,
therefore it's a telephone link,

202
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,705
thus the human voice that has a
certain number of frequencies

203
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,031
between 16 and 15 kilohertz,

204
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:13,945
and on this signal we will superimpose
an information signal

205
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:18,163
to transit the information
of the network.

206
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:22,228
Well when we talk, we don't want to hear
all these frequencies,

207
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:25,438
we would rather only hear
the voice frequencies,

208
00:17:25,438 --> 00:17:28,069
when we are on the phone,
we have this filter here,

209
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,063
that allows to cut the high frequencies
of the digital signals.

210
00:17:35,924 --> 00:17:40,458
A second example, is what we
call Power Line Carrier,

211
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:46,524
that is to say that we will superimpose
to the 50 hertz domestic supply network,

212
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,461
we will superimpose a
high frequency signal

213
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:51,623
that is also an information,

214
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:54,761
and then this information,
we would like to split it

215
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:57,746
when it comes to the computer
for example,

216
00:17:57,746 --> 00:18:03,261
we have the information signal
and not the 50 Hz signal,

217
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,655
thus again we use the filtering,

218
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:09,214
as we have explained previously.

219
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,662
We will address one
final point today,

220
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:15,743
those are equivalent dipoles.

221
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,886
We have here a dipole that is made of

222
00:18:18,886 --> 00:18:22,642
a resistor R1 and an inductance
L1 in series,

223
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:27,310
we can determine the
equivalent impedance of this dipole,

224
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:33,327
we gave it in the previous lessons,
it is represented by the equation here,

225
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:41,329
and the circuit R2 L2 in parallel where
the equivalent impedance is given here.

226
00:18:42,632 --> 00:18:44,551
You will also find this result

227
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:47,448
in the tables that we have given
in the previous lessons.

228
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,891
So that these two circuits
are equivalent,

229
00:18:50,891 --> 00:18:57,388
it is necessary that firstly
the resistive portion of R1

230
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:02,003
must be equal to the resistive
part of the other,

231
00:19:02,003 --> 00:19:05,621
and on the other hand
the imaginary part of one,

232
00:19:05,621 --> 00:19:10,540
must be equal to the imaginary part
of the other.

233
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:15,074
Therefore R1 must be equal to this,

234
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,186
first condition,
and second condition,

235
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:38,049
L1 must be equal to this term here.

236
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:45,206
What is interesting to notice,
is that this equivalence

237
00:19:45,206 --> 00:19:48,089
is true only at one frequency

238
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:57,449
because the term R1 depends on R2 and
also the pulse ω

239
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:03,909
same for the equivalent inductance
that depends on the pulse,

240
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:06,371
thus this is true only
at a given frequency,

241
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:13,090
if we change the frequency, we must
change again the parameters R2 and L2

242
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,094
for the equivalence
of the two circuits.

243
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:22,384
It is clear that the transition is done here
in the direction parallel series,

244
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:25,351
but could be done
in the other direction, parallel series,

245
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:33,359
by extracting the term R2 of
this equation,

246
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:38,287
and for the inductance, extract the term L2
of this equation here.

247
00:20:38,724 --> 00:20:44,190
It's the same for the circuit RC serie
and RC parallel,

248
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,050
if we want those two dipoles
to be equivalent,

249
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:53,222
we write the relation that describes R
and the equivalent impedance,

250
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:56,816
it's this term here, we can
write it differently,

251
00:20:56,816 --> 00:21:04,215
for the parallel RC circuit,
we have this equation here,

252
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:06,128
and for there to be equivalence,

253
00:21:06,128 --> 00:21:17,346
the real part of one must be
again equal to the other

254
00:21:17,346 --> 00:21:24,919
and the imaginary parts also
have to be equal.

255
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,472
We can rewrite the term R3
as function of R4 and C4,

256
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:37,310
and we have that R3 is equal to R4
divided by the denominator,

257
00:21:42,332 --> 00:21:44,995
and for the equivalence
of the imaginary part,

258
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:49,464
C3 must be equal to this term,

259
00:21:56,825 --> 00:22:00,503
it's the equivalence condition
of these two circuits,

260
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:04,660
but again, at a given
pulse or frequency,

261
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,641
because this equivalence
depends on the pulse.

262
00:22:12,842 --> 00:22:15,470
We saw what were
resonant circuits,

263
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,974
what are their characteristics and under what
conditions they are in resonance.

264
00:22:19,974 --> 00:22:22,626
We saw how to change
the characteristics,

265
00:22:22,626 --> 00:22:27,151
and what we can do,
especially in the domain of filtering. 

266
00:22:27,536 --> 00:22:30,108
Finally, we saw the
equivalent dipoles,

267
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:34,156
and we saw that they depend
on the power supply frequency.

268
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:35,575
Thank you for your attention.
