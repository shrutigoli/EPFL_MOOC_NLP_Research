00:00:04,007 --> 00:00:08,959
Hello, welcome to this new lesson of the
Electrotechnique 1 course.

2
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,972
In the framework of electrical circuits,

3
00:00:10,972 --> 00:00:14,843
it is rarely needed to know the evolution
of the currents and voltages,

4
00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:16,452
in every location of the circuit.

5
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:20,222
It is then possible to find a basic
equivalent circuit

6
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,680
which is simpler but which
accurately translates

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,022
the behaviour of the original circuit.

8
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:28,611
We call equivalent bipoles or dipoles 

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,344
two dipoles that have the same current
at all times

10
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:34,590
when they are under the same voltage,
or vice versa.

11
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,101
A dipole can be reduced to

another, more simple,

12
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:39,414
dipole by way of different reductions,

13
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,936
provided that they keep the
same characteristics.

14
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:45,952
We have seen different possible reductions,

15
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:49,096
such as the Series or Parallel
reductions,

16
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:53,899
that apply to resistors, current sources,

17
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,875
and voltage sources.

18
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:59,568
We have seen the voltage divider,
or the current divider,

19
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,277
we will see even other transformations,

20
00:01:01,277 --> 00:01:04,859
like the Y-Î” transformation or 
other methods.

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,164
In most cases,

22
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:10,381
these reductions and transformations
are easily applicable,

23
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,396
but of, in particular, complex circuits,

24
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:17,288
we will mostly apply the 
principle of Thevenin

25
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,481
or the theorem of Norton.

26
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:23,074
These two theorems and also valid
for more simple circuits.

27
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:26,050
We will now develop these two theorems.

28
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:33,440
Lets consider a dipole that is characterised
by a certain number of resistors,

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,905
a certain number of sources,
whether these are voltage sources

30
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:43,948
or current sources, for which we 
have two terminals, two poles.

31
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:49,501
The respective expression of the Thevenin
or Norton theorems

32
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:53,765
say that it is always possible to
reduce such a dipole,

33
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:57,838
containing any combination of independent
sources and resistor

34
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:04,825
to a dipole that finally contains only 
one ideal voltage source, <i>U0</i>,

35
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:12,428
with, in series, an internal resistor <i>Ri</i>.

36
00:02:17,718 --> 00:02:22,050
So, this dipole - we put the terminals
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>-

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,860
presents a voltage <i>Uab</i>,

38
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,165
and the extreme simplification of
this original circuit,

39
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:33,202
is the theorem of Thevenin.

40
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:45,434
The theorem of Norton says that this dipole
can be reduced to a current source,

41
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:51,789
equal to <i>icc</i>, in parallel with
an internal resistor,

42
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:54,947
the same internal resistor,
put in parallel.

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:04,838
Once again, the terminals <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
and the voltage at the side of these terminals,

44
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:07,724
is the expression of the Norton theorem.

45
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,871
The equivalence of these dipoles is fulfilled
if they have the same no-load voltage,

46
00:03:16,191 --> 00:03:18,937
and the same short-circuit current,

47
00:03:18,937 --> 00:03:21,397
and so fatally, the same internal resistor,

48
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:26,062
is the equivalence between the real voltage
source and the real current source,

49
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:28,685
that we saw in the previous lesson.

50
00:03:28,974 --> 00:03:32,328
It is now a question of determining
these three parameters,

51
00:03:32,328 --> 00:03:36,102
the no-load voltage, the short-circuit
current and the internal resistor, 

52
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:40,152
that, in fact, represent this source,
this more complex dipole.

53
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,588
So, let's take these diagrams back, 

54
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:46,849
it is now a question of determining the
no-load voltage <i>U0</i>,

55
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:53,065
which is, in fact, the voltage <i>Uab</i>,
from the original voltage,

56
00:03:53,065 --> 00:03:55,709
when the current is equal to zero.

57
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,689
It is now still a question of representing
or determining the current <i>icc</i>,

58
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:06,449
which is the current between the
terminals <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,

59
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,285
when the dipole is short-circuited,

60
00:04:10,285 --> 00:04:14,888
namely when the voltage <i>Uab</i>
is equal to zero.

61
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:23,333
The internal resistor is the resistance
seen from outside the dipole,

62
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,911
when all the sources are cancelled.

63
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,140
I represent the dipole here,
the terminals <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,

64
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,141
the internal resistor seen from
outside the dipole, <i>Ri</i>,

65
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:42,901
it is the resistance between the terminals <i>ab</i>,
when all the sources are cancelled out,

66
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:46,693
namely all the <i>uj</i> are equal to zero,

67
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:50,492
and all the <i>ij</i> are also equal to zero,

68
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:59,530
and we have seen that this internal resistor
is the ratio of <i>U0</i> over <i>icc</i>.

69
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:06,773
By knowing these three parameters
between <i>U0, icc, Ri</i>,

70
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,795
we completely determine the source,

71
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:13,364
knowing that <i>Ri</i> is equal to
the ratio of <i>u0</i> over <i>icc</i>.

72
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:17,378
Lets now pass to a concrete
example.

73
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:24,335
We consider this circuit, which is
composed of a source and a load, 

74
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:31,070
we define the dipole <i>ab</i> between
these two terminals <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.

75
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,151
This is then the source,
this is the charge,

76
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:43,244
and this dipole here can be simplified
into the following dipole,

77
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,531
by the Thevenin theorem,

78
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:50,934
a no-load voltage in series with an internal resistor.

79
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:59,856
It now a question of calculating this
no-load voltage <i>Uab</i>,

80
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,517
and to calculate the short-circuit current.

81
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:04,571
For the no-load voltage...

82
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:12,311
the no-load voltage is the dipole voltage

83
00:06:12,311 --> 00:06:17,208
when the resistor <i>R3</i> doesn't exist,
the circuit is open.

84
00:06:17,347 --> 00:06:23,106
We can then write the following equation,
firstly,

85
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:29,728
the current <i>i1</i> is equal to the current <i>i2</i>,
so there is only one loop in the circuit,

86
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:35,409
and so <i>i1</i> or <i>i2</i> is
equal to the source <i>U1</i>,

87
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,880
divided by the sum of these
two resistors <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>,

88
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,589
since they are in series.

89
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,353
Finally, the voltage that appears between the
points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in no-load,

90
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:49,743
also correspond to the voltage drop at
the terminals of the resistor,

91
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:59,723
namely that <i>U3</i> is equal
to <i>R2 times i2</i>

92
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:10,440
and this is equal to <i>R2</i> divided by 
<i>R1 plus R2</i>, multiplied by <i>U1</i>,

93
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,843
and this is the no-load voltage.

94
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:16,269
Lets calculate now the short-circuit current.

95
00:07:22,702 --> 00:07:27,001
It is the current passing through 
the terminals <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,

96
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,472
when we short-circuit them,

97
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:32,257
namely when we replace the resistor
<i>R3</i> by a null resistor.

98
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:40,168
We simply find that <i>icc</i> is equal to
<i>U1</i> over <i>R1</i>,

99
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,901
since the short-circuit cancels out, here,
the effect of the resistor <i>R2</i>.

100
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:47,363
We have then determined the no-load voltage

101
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,932
and the short-circuit current,

102
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:57,767
we can now determine the internal resistor
of the circuit, the dipole,

103
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:03,396
the internal resistor is the ratio
of <i>U0</i> over <i>icc</i>,

104
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:10,045
and it is equal to, <i>U0</i> is <i>R2</i>
over the sum of these two resistors,

105
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:16,580
multiplied by <i>R1</i>, and
multiplied by 1 over <i>icc</i>,

106
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:25,681
namely <i>R1</i> over <i>U1</i>, which finally
gives for the internal resistor,

107
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:32,638
the product of <i>R1</i> times <i>R2</i>
over the sum of <i>R1</i> plus <i>R2</i>.

108
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:45,353
Here is our original dipole which is here,
replaced by the simplified dipole,

109
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:48,003
found with Thevenin's theorem.

110
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:52,279
We can assure ourselves that the internal
resistor seen from outside,

111
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:58,150
<i>Ri</i> which is the resistance seen when
all the sources are cancelled out,

112
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:05,666
well, <i>R1</i> in parallel with <i>R2</i>

113
00:09:08,177 --> 00:09:16,207
is equal to the product of <i>R1.R2</i>
over the sum of <i>R1 plus R2</i>.

114
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:18,595
Now that we have completely
determined

115
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:22,168
the three parameters <i>U0, icc</i> and <i>Ri</i>,

116
00:09:22,168 --> 00:09:32,003
we can express the current <i>i3</i>
and the voltage <i>U3</i>, or <i>Uab</i>,

117
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:35,289
in function of the resistor <i>R3</i>,

118
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:44,665
we know that the current <i>i3</i> is equal to <i>U0</i>
over the sum of <i>Ri</i> plus <i>R3</i>,

119
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:54,119
and the output voltage <i>Uab</i> or <i>U3</i>,
is equal to the product of <i>R3</i> times <i>i3</i>,

120
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:07,841
which is equal to <i>R3</i> over <i>Ri</i>
plus <i>R3</i>, multiplied by <i>U0</i>.

121
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:11,784
We recognise here the expression
of the voltage divider.

122
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:15,253
There, the simple simplifications
are often applicable,

123
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:19,961
but for complex circuits or sub-circuits,

124
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,833
we can usefully apply the theorems
of Thevenin and Norton:

125
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:27,665
they guarantee the dipole equivalences.

126
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:32,168
Later, we will see more methods for
circuit transformations.
