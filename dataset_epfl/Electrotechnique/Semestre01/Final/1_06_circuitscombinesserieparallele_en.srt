00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:07,225
Hello and welcome to this MOOC
or in this lesson

2
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,117
dedicated to the analysis and resolution
of linear circuits,

3
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:12,457
the second part of our chapter.

4
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:14,829
We will see in this second part

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,754
combined, series and parallel circuits

6
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:17,955
when we have multiple elements

7
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,359
that are together, in series
and in parallel.

8
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:25,873
We will then see these two elements or two
very special models

9
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:31,070
that are finally very very common
in the electrical circuits

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,199
that are tension and current dividers.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,810
Finally, we will have a conclusion
for this lesson.

12
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:38,868
We will start with an example.

13
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:41,247
An example here with only resistors,

14
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,779
an extremely clear example,

15
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,765
to see that it is very difficult in this
diagram

16
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:54,731
to know if R1, R2, R3 and R4
are in series or in parallel

17
00:00:54,731 --> 00:01:01,284
knowing that we wish to calculate an equivalence
of this dipole between  a and b.

18
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,448
When we are in such a case,

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,684
the first thing to do

20
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:09,023
is to redraw the circuit differently,

21
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:11,806
to play with it, to inverse it,

22
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:15,348
in order to find a more clear vision
of the diagram.

23
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,011
That is what we do here,
by extracting a and b

24
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,740
and by redrawing the same diagram.

25
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:25,133
We still have the circuit between R1 R3,

26
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:26,455
you have here between R1 R3,

27
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:29,730
and R2 R4 this diagram that closes

28
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,720
and so strictly the same thing.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,453
We can then notice a certain
number of things.

30
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:39,315
We note that the voltage that is here

31
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:42,468
on the boundaries of R1,

32
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:46,262
this voltage that we will call UR1,

33
00:01:47,488 --> 00:01:52,429
is the same as this voltage
here, UR2.

34
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:55,608
Why? Because this potential is the
same as this one

35
00:01:55,608 --> 00:01:57,934
and this potential is the same
for R1 and for R2.

36
00:01:58,246 --> 00:02:02,281
So UR1 UR2 being equivalent,

37
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:07,467
we know that R1 R2
is in parallel.

38
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,922
We can do the same thing with
R3 and R4 that are in parallel

39
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,891
and we can then write

40
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:17,790
that this diagrams transforms into
R12 and R34

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,817
and these two are in series since
the current

42
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:22,646
that circulates between these two
blocs will now be equivalent.

43
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:28,159
And to finish, we have the equivalence
between a and b, Rab.

44
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,271
So how do we calculate this Rab?

45
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:36,248
Well, for example for R12.
First, R12.

46
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:38,932
We know that to calculate R12,

47
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:48,015
R12 is 1 over the inverse of
the resistor's sum

48
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:51,862
so 1 over R1 plus one over R2.

49
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,258
This lets us writes that

50
00:02:55,557 --> 00:03:03,381
R12 is equal to R1 times R2
over R1 plus R2.

51
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,499
We can evidently write the
same thing for R34

52
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:09,664
that will, in the same way, be written as

53
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:16,819
R3 times R4 over R3 plus R4.

54
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:20,848
And finally, Rab being

55
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:23,836
R12 and R34 in series,

56
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,826
it becomes the sum of R12 plus R34,

57
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:33,778
so Rab is R12 plus R34.

58
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:37,354
We can now do a numerical example,

59
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,761
we give for example R1 equal to 2 kilo-ohms,

60
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:45,879
R2 to 8 kilo-ohms,

61
00:03:47,147 --> 00:03:50,507
R3 to 5 kilo-ohms

62
00:03:51,218 --> 00:03:54,585
and finally R4 equal to 200 ohms.

63
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,392
We get a Rab,

64
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:01,321
if you do the whole calculation
with all that was shown,

65
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:06,313
you will find 1792 ohms.

66
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:10,738
We can now do the exact same things
with capacitances

67
00:04:10,738 --> 00:04:13,320
and I will show you once again
a quite complete diagram.

68
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,415
How do we resolve such a diagram?

69
00:04:16,415 --> 00:04:17,918
To start with, here is the first question.

70
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,778
Which elements will be in series
and which will be in parallel?

71
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:23,588
It is also very good to ask
yourself the questions

72
00:04:23,588 --> 00:04:27,223
"Is this parallel?", 
"Is this in series?".

73
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:32,723
First, we have a tension that we
will call U1

74
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,855
that is exactly the same as U1 here.

75
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:41,344
This means that C3 C4
are in parallel with C5 C6.

76
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:44,907
We also see that the current
that circulates here,

77
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,447
lets call it i3,

78
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:54,630
will be the same as the current
passing here, i4,

79
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,919
so C3 and C4 are in series.

80
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:58,866
In the same way, C5 C6 
are in series.

81
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:01,301
Then, we ask ourselves these questions.

82
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:03,472
We can then write that

83
00:05:03,472 --> 00:05:06,827
C3 C4 being in series, we
can replace them by C7,

84
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,773
C5 C6 can be replaced by C8,

85
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:14,103
we then have C7 C8 in parallel

86
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,583
that will become C9

87
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:19,233
and that will be in series with C2

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,623
and then in parallel with C1

89
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:27,573
and this finally gives us our 
capacitance Cab.

90
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:30,258
Then, we can evidently give the
final elements.

91
00:05:30,258 --> 00:05:32,861
First, this C7 that
we have written before.

92
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,596
 C7 being in series,

93
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:39,836
so we have the inverse of the capacitance
that is equal to the sum of the inverses;

94
00:05:40,248 --> 00:05:46,261
we find the same rules again, we have
C3 times C4 over C3 plus C4.

95
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:53,282
Then, we have C8,
which in the same way can be calculated

96
00:05:53,282 --> 00:06:00,015
as being C5 times C6 over C5 plus C6.

97
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,779
We then have C9.

98
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:05,785
If you put C7 and C8 in parallel, you get C9,

99
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:10,809
so it is simple the sum of C7 and C8.

100
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,330
Finally, we have C10.

101
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,852
How do you find C10?
You put C2 and C9 in series.

102
00:06:19,382 --> 00:06:22,536
We will then have C2 times C9

103
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,881
divided by C2 plus C9.

104
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,862
And finally, we put C1 and C10
in parallel to get Cab

105
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:36,494
and it is simply the sum of C1
plus C10

106
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:37,930
that we have just calculated.

107
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,132
And that is how we simplify a diagram

108
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:45,533
when we put various elements in
parallel or in series

109
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:46,444
like the capacitance here.

110
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,730
I will also show you a specific example

111
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:55,719
of a circuit that can make you think that
we are neither in series nor in parallel.

112
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:58,905
So, yes and no is what we call
a ladder circuit.

113
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:04,628
We can see here that R5 R6 are in series
and then in parallel with R4

114
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:10,457
which is itself in series with R3 and
then in parallel with R2, and so forth.

115
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:14,400
We can then calculate this
resistance Rab

116
00:07:15,123 --> 00:07:17,605
in a successive way, 
beginning with R1,

117
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,698
R1 to which we add all of this,

118
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:28,479
so we have 1 over R2 plus 1 over 1 over R3

119
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,319
plus 1 over 1 over R4

120
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:39,909
plus 1 over R5 plus R6.

121
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,995
And finally there is that scaling

122
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:47,049
of the different elements in series,
which lets us simplify the problem

123
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,662
and have only one equivalent resistor.

124
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,582
Here is another example of a
complete circuit

125
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,523
with resistors this time.

126
00:07:57,462 --> 00:07:58,960
Once again in this diagram,

127
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,117
which resistors are in parallel
and which of them are in series?

128
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:05,004
We clearly have here R3 and R4
in parallel,

129
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:07,112
then are at the same voltage;

130
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,884
these two points here have the same
potential for R3 R4

131
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:14,326
and this one the same potential for R3 R4.

132
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:19,321
Then, if we simplify this by R34,

133
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,156
this will be in series with R2.

134
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,223
Then the whole will be in parallel with R1.

135
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,899
So this is the way to resolve
such a circuit.

136
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:29,245
We can then summarise in this way,

137
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:37,078
that we will have R34 which is equal to R3
times R4 over R3 plus R4.

138
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:45,759
We then have R2 in series with R34,
that we will call R234, namely

139
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:50,061
R2 plus what we have just calculated,

140
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:56,136
R3 times R4 over R3 plus R4.

141
00:08:57,672 --> 00:09:03,924
Finally, Rab will be R1 and
R234 in parallel.

142
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:07,017
So Rab finally is 

143
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,898
R1 times R234

144
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:15,867
over R1 plus R234.

145
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:19,904
We can now do a numerical calculation
to give us an idea.

146
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:22,453
We have, if we take a numerical example,

147
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:28,191
U equal to 73,45 volts for example.

148
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:33,897
A measurement example that was done lately
on this type of circuit

149
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,391
with R1 equal to 22 ohms,
R2 equal to 36 ohms,

150
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:48,282
R3 equal to 18 ohms
et R4 equal to 15 ohms.

151
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:52,842
So if we first ask ourselves, as suggested
earlier,

152
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,578
what is Rab equal to, 

153
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:00,499
we find the final Rab

154
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:07,108
equal to 14,69 ohms.

155
00:10:07,108 --> 00:10:10,819
It is now evident to answer an
initial question that

156
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:11,933
we could ask ourselves:

157
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:14,066
"What is the value of the current
delivered by the supply?".

158
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:19,792
We know that U is equal to Rab times i.

159
00:10:20,793 --> 00:10:25,127
And, if we are looking for the current,
i is equal to U over Rab,

160
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:29,717
we then find that this current is
simply equal to 5 amperes.

161
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,567
We now pass to a familiar diagram

162
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:37,025
that we often find in a more
complete ensemble

163
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,237
of an electrical model

164
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,966
which is the resistive voltage divider.

165
00:10:40,966 --> 00:10:43,427
Why do we call this the
resistive voltage divider?

166
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:46,972
Well because if we have an
initial voltage U

167
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:51,279
with 2 resistors in series,
at the boundaries of the second resistor,

168
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,057
here, as it happens, U2,

169
00:10:53,057 --> 00:10:56,699
we will have a U2 small
than the initial U

170
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,283
so this lets us uncouple, divide,
separate,

171
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:04,052
-- see it as you wish --

172
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:06,396
the initial voltage in a
smaller voltage,

173
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:08,652
more interesting for such and such a circuit.

174
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:12,668
For example, you have 24 volts arriving
from a supply

175
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:15,695
but you would like to get 5 volts
for this or that reason,

176
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:21,975
well, with the judicious choice of R1 
and R2, we can calculate U2

177
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,316
in such a way that we will get exactly

178
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,889
the 5 volts we are looking for.

179
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,796
How do we define or how do
we calculate

180
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:32,790
this kind of thing? Well, we simply
use Ohm's law.

181
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:40,515
We know that the sum of the voltage
U1 plus U2 is equal to U.

182
00:11:41,545 --> 00:11:48,334
We know that U1 is R1 times i
and that U2 is R2 times i.

183
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,354
All this being always equal to U,

184
00:11:51,447 --> 00:11:58,634
so i is equal to U over R1 plus R2.

185
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:04,434
Since U1 is equal to R1 times i
and U2 is equal to R2 times i,

186
00:12:04,438 --> 00:12:09,803
we finally get that for U2,
which is here,

187
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,929
and is equal to R2 times i,
it is also equal to

188
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:20,933
U times R2 over R1 plus R2.

189
00:12:21,552 --> 00:12:25,648
This lets us calculate, in a general and

190
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:29,304
fast way, that this voltage U2,

191
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:34,510
if I have chosen rightly R1 and R2,
I can do a voltage divider.

192
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,316
And this can evidently be done not
only with resistors

193
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:40,526
-- so it is here a resistive voltage divider --

194
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:44,967
but also with a capacitive voltage divider.

195
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:49,529
In this case, we take the exact same diagram as before

196
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:55,389
so we will have here a voltage U,
on who's boundaries we will have two capacitances

197
00:12:56,881 --> 00:13:00,876
that will let us, C1 and C2,
do the exact same thing

198
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:05,719
then before, with still U1
and here U2,

199
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:11,753
and to divide this voltage here
between C1 and C2.

200
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,293
In such a case, we can also
easily

201
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:19,032
convince ourselves that U1,
using Kirchhoff's law

202
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,228
as we did before,

203
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:26,612
U1 will be equal to U times C2
over C1 plus C2.

204
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:33,563
This will be the rule for a capacitive
voltage divider.

205
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:38,498
Finally, the inductive voltage divider.
Once again, we have the same diagram,

206
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:41,660
I will not redraw it here, but we will
find it again,

207
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,751
since the rules to put things in series
are the same

208
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,074
as those for resistances with inductance,

209
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:53,162
in the same way we see that

210
00:13:53,162 --> 00:14:00,235
U1 is equal to U times
L1 over L1 plus L2,

211
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,593
and from there we can also write

212
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:08,715
that U2 is equal to U times
L2 over L1 plus L2.

213
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:12,447
It is then easy to remember than the
final rule

214
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:16,891
for the inductive voltage divider
follows the same kind of relation

215
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:20,363
as the resistive voltage divider.

216
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:21,884
Now the current divider.

217
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:24,124
You have here another phenomenon,

218
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:27,974
so the current arrives at the boundaries
of this dipole,

219
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,052
separates in two on two resistors.

220
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:34,812
We very often have this kind of problematic
in a circuit.

221
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:39,869
We have R1 and R2 in parallel,
but if we wish to calculate i1 or i2,

222
00:14:40,387 --> 00:14:42,793
it is excluded to resolve this circuit

223
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,258
by replacing R1 and R2
by a single resistor.

224
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:49,933
We would then have i1 and i2 "drowned
in the equivalent resistor".

225
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,567
We must then keep these two resistors

226
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:58,318
et calculate separately the values
of i1 and i2.

227
00:14:58,318 --> 00:15:01,613
Once again, we will do this in a
very simple manner.

228
00:15:02,047 --> 00:15:05,149
We can apply here Kirchhoff's laws.

229
00:15:05,508 --> 00:15:09,526
We know that i is equal to i1 plus i2.

230
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:19,078
We also know that U1 which is equal to U2
is equal to R1 times i1

231
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:24,116
but it is also equal to R2 times i2.

232
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,870
From all this, we can easily find

233
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:33,912
that i1 is equal to i total
that multiplies R2 over R1 plus R2

234
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:42,265
and we also find that i2 is equal to i
that multiplies R1 over R1 plus R2.

235
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:45,821
Then, in a very fast way, if we wonder how
these two currents and

236
00:15:45,821 --> 00:15:47,975
two resistors finally separate,

237
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:50,768
we can evidently see how to calculate

238
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:53,367
the current i1 or the current i2.

239
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,507
A special case that we can see here,

240
00:15:56,014 --> 00:15:59,683
would be if R1 and R2
were equal.

241
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:03,130
For example, you take R1 and R2
equal to 100 ohms,

242
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:09,473
you will have 100 divided by 200,
which will be equal to 0,5,

243
00:16:09,473 --> 00:16:15,301
it is then logical that i1 and i2
are equal to 0,5 times the current.

244
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:20,153
The current is then divided in a uniform
manner on either side

245
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,918
of these equal resistors.

246
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:25,296
We can make an analogy with hydraulic circuits.

247
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:29,192
If we have two pipes of same section,
so of same hydraulic resistance,

248
00:16:29,192 --> 00:16:31,639
with only one tap bringing water,

249
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:36,356
well we will get the same amount of water,
an equivalent flow on both sides

250
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,848
since the resistance is the same.

251
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,550
Another special case that we can see here

252
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,365
is the case where R1 is equal to 0.

253
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:47,716
In such a case, we have a wire on
one side and a resistor on the other.

254
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:50,168
Now we have the question
then where does the current go?

255
00:16:50,168 --> 00:16:52,085
You see straight away here in i1.

256
00:16:52,476 --> 00:16:56,690
i1 is equal to i times R2 over R2.
If R2 is equal to 0, we have 1.

257
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,194
This means that all the current i,
whatever the resistor R2,

258
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,389
if R1 is equal to 0,

259
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,969
all the current goes towards the top

260
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:08,198
and so i1 is equal to i, i2 is equal to 0.

261
00:17:09,214 --> 00:17:10,784
In conclusion, I don't give you here

262
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:14,480
the rules for the capacitive current divider

263
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,013
and the inductive current divider,

264
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:19,002
I prefer to give you a recapitulation

265
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:21,917
with voltage dividers, current dividers,

266
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:25,613
with the resistance, the capacitance
and the inductance,

267
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:29,624
and so in this table, you have
all the necessary elements

268
00:17:29,624 --> 00:17:33,026
for the case where these
elements appear

269
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:38,035
in a circuit, to faster calculate the
current division

270
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:41,806
where you need it, the voltage
U2 or the voltage U1

271
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:42,888
in general.

272
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,262
Thank you.
