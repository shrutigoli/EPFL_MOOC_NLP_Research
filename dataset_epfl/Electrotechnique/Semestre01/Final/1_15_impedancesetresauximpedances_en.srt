00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,736
Hello! Today we will talk about the impedance
of a dipole

2
00:00:08,736 --> 00:00:14,307
and its inverse the admittance, and also
the way which can be carried

3
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:17,557
to combine them when
they are in a network.

4
00:00:17,557 --> 00:00:20,218
We will first remind the
definition of the impedance

5
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:23,636
and see its representation
in the complex plane.

6
00:00:23,636 --> 00:00:29,279
We will then see how we will combine
these impedances,

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,867
We will finally see the equivalent
tripoles in AC steady state

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,821
also the voltage divider and
the current divider,

9
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,489
as we saw in DC steady state

10
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,282
but this time in AC steady state.

11
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:47,738
So either a dipole characterized by
a complex impedance, 

12
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:51,122
its the real part of the
complex impedance,

13
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:54,361
called the resistance R of the dipole.

14
00:00:54,361 --> 00:01:02,419
The resistance R is therefore
the real part of Z.

15
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:10,457
I remind you that Z, is the ratio of
the voltage over the current,

16
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:18,912
and this is equal to U over I,
multiplied by cos phi,

17
00:01:20,429 --> 00:01:22,349
it's the resistance.

18
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:29,115
The imaginary part of the complex
impedance is called the reactance,

19
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:31,032
of the dipole written X.

20
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:37,722
Therefore X is the imaginary part of Z,

21
00:01:38,242 --> 00:01:43,790
and it's equal to U over I times sin phi.

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,758
Now lets considerate the inverse of the
impedance, that is to say the admittance.

23
00:01:54,044 --> 00:01:59,419
The real part of the admittance
is called the conductance.

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,676
G is therefore the real part
of the inverse of the impedance,

25
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:08,556
therefore the admittance that we write Y,

26
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:16,025
and is equal to I over U,
multiplied by cos phi,

27
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:19,247
it's the conductance.

28
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:24,059
Finally the imaginary part of the
complex admittance

29
00:02:24,059 --> 00:02:28,748
is called susceptance, and
is written B,

30
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:39,920
it is the imaginary part of Y, that
is equal to I times U time sin phi,

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,395
with the minus sign here
because phi is negative.

32
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,822
And this is the susceptance.

33
00:02:57,562 --> 00:03:03,177
In the complex plane, we can represent
the impedance and the admittance.

34
00:03:03,177 --> 00:03:09,152
The impedance Z is represented here.

35
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:11,700
These transformation equations
allow to transit

36
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,234
from a polar representation

37
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,196
to a Cartesian representation or
rectangular.

38
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:25,624
Knowing that R, the real part is the projection
of the vector Z on the real axis,

39
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:32,633
the imaginary part is the projection
of this vector on the imaginary axis,

40
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,839
and for the transit in the other way,

41
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:39,626
the norm of the vector Z can be found
by Pythagorean by calculating the square 

42
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:43,318
of each side of the right-angled triangle.

43
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,005
And the angle is determinate by
the tangent arc

44
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,390
of the imaginary part over
the real part.

45
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,439
For the admittance, which is
the inverse of the impedance,

46
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,131
again, we have the polar representation
with a norm and an argument, 

47
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,824
or the Cartesian representation,

48
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:08,790
With the real coordinate
and the imaginary coordinate.

49
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,647
As the admittance Y is the inverse
of the impedance Z,

50
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:17,416
at the norm, the length of the vector,

51
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:23,485
it will be the inverse, namely if
Z has a norm of 1.25,

52
00:04:23,485 --> 00:04:27,565
Y will have a norm of 1 over 1.25,
namely 0.8.

53
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:31,249
For the argument, it will be the opposite,

54
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:36,832
that is to say that if phi is positive for Z
it will be negative for Y,

55
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:39,659
we can easily see it here.

56
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:45,340
We will now combine the impedances
in series or in parallel. 

57
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,500
In the first case, the serial case,

58
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,844
we want to know the equivalent
serial impedance Z,

59
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:57,254
that is the sum of the impedances Z1,
Z2, till Zn,

60
00:04:57,254 --> 00:05:07,575
we find that Zs is equal to
the sum of k, d Zk.

61
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:19,798
By against for the total equivalent admittance
Ys, is the inverse of Zs,

62
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:24,081
and this inverse of the sum
of the impedances,

63
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,012
or the inverse of the sum
of the inverses,

64
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:38,157
namely 1 divided by the sum
over K of the inverses.

65
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:43,023
As regards the admittances, when
they are in parallel,

66
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:51,155
they add themselves, that is to say that
the equivalent admittance in parallel,

67
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:55,827
is the sum over K of all the
admittances K.

68
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:59,075
Therefore we here see the advantage
to use the admittances,

69
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:01,714
because in parallel it's easy, we
add them.

70
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:06,433
By against, for the equivalent parallel
impedance,

71
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:12,885
again, by analogy,
one is the inverse. 

72
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:16,444
Namely Yp is the inverse of Zp,

73
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:22,623
and is also the inverse of
the sum of the admittances,

74
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:25,888
or the inverse of the sum of the inverses.

75
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:35,157
On the following board, we have a few
examples of usual circuits,

76
00:06:35,157 --> 00:06:38,196
for which we have calculated the
impedance and the admittance.

77
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:41,099
We see that for two impedances in series,

78
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:46,060
here a resistance that is
purely resistive, 

79
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,911
we can add the impedance of the
inductance, that is omega L,

80
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:57,060
to get the equivalent total of
this dipole,

81
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,910
that is R + JωL,

82
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,055
ωL being the part, the reactance
of the inductance.

83
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:13,422
We can calculate the inverse, namely
the admittance of this circuit, of this dipole,

84
00:07:13,422 --> 00:07:19,770
and we find after a few calculations,
this result here with a real part

85
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,591
that is R divided by the denominator,
that is a scalar,

86
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:30,622
and the imaginary part omega L divided
by this same denominator. 

87
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,660
We have here other examples.

88
00:07:35,057 --> 00:07:38,223
Here, few examples
of circuits in parallel, 

89
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:42,056
we see the whole interest to work
with admittances

90
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:45,218
because the admittances in parallel add
themselves

91
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:48,807
and we find the admittance of R,
it's 1/R,

92
00:07:48,807 --> 00:07:54,262
the admittance of the inductance,
is 1/ωL,

93
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:57,628
and we can do minus 1/ωL, and we then
can do the sum very easily,

94
00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:01,799
and then return, at the impedance,

95
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:05,118
with a notation of that form there.

96
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,560
Here, a few other examples.

97
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:12,224
In DC steady state, we saw the
transformation πT.

98
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:19,344
This is a circuit in π,
and this one is a circuit in T,

99
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:23,507
and we have calculated a relation
to determinate,

100
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,407
to make the transit from one another,

101
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:30,394
namely to determinate the impedances,
or the resistances in this case here,

102
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:37,211
of Z12, Z31 and Z23, 
knowing Z1, Z2, Z3.

103
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,554
These two circuits are perfectly
identical,

104
00:08:39,554 --> 00:08:41,781
they behave in the same way.

105
00:08:41,781 --> 00:08:45,134
To make the transit between one another,
by considering the impedances,

106
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:49,222
we can do the same reasoning that we
did with the resistances,

107
00:08:49,222 --> 00:08:52,266
but we will do it this time with
the impedances,

108
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:55,134
we directly give the result,
for example,

109
00:08:55,134 --> 00:09:04,709
if we want to determinate the value of Z1
as function of the elements of the circuit in π,

110
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:18,039
Z1 is equal to Z12 times Z31, namely
the impedance from point 2

111
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,715
is from point 3, divided by the sum

112
00:09:23,715 --> 00:09:27,062
of three impedances of the circuit in π.

113
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:32,270
Z23 + Z31.

114
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:37,421
We write here that the additions and
these multiplications, divisions,

115
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:40,054
must be done with
complex numbers.

116
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:47,984
The transit of the circuit T into a circuit π
is done by applying the following relation:

117
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:56,025
we have that Z12, namely the impedance
between point 1 and point 2,

118
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:03,416
is equal to the sum of duplicates,

119
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:14,421
Z1 times Z2, plus Z2 times Z3,
plus Z3 times Z1

120
00:10:14,421 --> 00:10:22,749
divided by the impedance
of the opposite knot, namely Z23.

121
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:26,894
We give all these relations to calculate all
the impedances,

122
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:31,284
either the circuit in T,
or either the circuit in π.

123
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:36,462
As regards the voltage divider or
the current divider,

124
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:40,695
that are represented here,
voltage divider, current divider,

125
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:43,562
we found a result
with resistances,

126
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:48,249
one can extrapolate the impedances,
by knowing we must use

127
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:50,994
complex numbers to treat
these impedances,

128
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:57,026
for example U1 which is the voltage
drop at the terminals of this impedance Z1,

129
00:10:57,026 --> 00:11:06,560
is equal to Z1 divided by the sum
of the two impedances, multiplied by U.

130
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,301
For the current, we have found
the result that was the following type.

131
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:22,615
The current I1 that flows through a branch,
is the Z2 impedance's quotient,

132
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:29,621
opposed to the branch over the sum
of the impedances Z1 + Z2,

133
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,846
multiplied by the total current.

134
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:36,615
It also gives the relationship for U2 and I2.

135
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:40,931
Again, I remind you that these variables
are complex numbers,

136
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:44,772
and must be treated with
the rules of the complex calculation.

137
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:49,970
We define the dipole's impedance
and its inverse the admittance,

138
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,099
and also their graphical representation
in the complex plane.

139
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:58,938
We saw the combination rules
of these elements in a network, 

140
00:11:58,938 --> 00:12:02,398
and we also saw that it was sometimes
useful to work with admittances

141
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:04,117
to simplify the calculations.

142
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:08,799
We saw a board of usual circuits,
this board is not exhaustive.

143
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,139
As in the DC steady state,
we saw the equivalent tripoles, 

144
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,755
and the voltage dividers,
current dividers.

145
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:18,790
Always remember to work
with complex variables.

146
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,145
Thank you for your attention.
