00:00:03,846 --> 00:00:05,870
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,614
dedicated to the analysis and
resolution of linear circuits.

3
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:11,713
In this lesson, we will study

4
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:14,069
the combination of
simple linear elements.

5
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:15,958
First of all what is am element,

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,578
or elements,
in series like a network.

7
00:00:18,578 --> 00:00:22,307
This elements in series for the resistor
for the capacitor, for the inductor.

8
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:25,081
We will do the same for
these elements in parallel.

9
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,965
And finally, we will make a
conclusion of this lesson and chapter.

10
00:00:28,965 --> 00:00:32,575
Before starting with this combination
in series or in parallel,

11
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,940
I would like to define here,
what an equivalent dipole is :

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,394
Two equivalent dipoles have, at all times,
by definition, the same current

13
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:44,890
when they are submitted to the same voltage.

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,871
It is important to define this
to later on allow us

15
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:51,294
to render objects equivalent
in a Kirchhoff model.

16
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:54,552
For example, we will have here an element,

17
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,592
we know together
that it's a resistor,

18
00:00:56,592 --> 00:00:58,927
but let's assume
that we don't know that,

19
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:02,402
a different element,
that I write like so ;

20
00:01:03,092 --> 00:01:07,484
well, these two elements,
we can say that they are equivalent

21
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:12,625
if, submitted to a voltage u

22
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:17,391
and similarly
for your first dipole u,

23
00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:22,919
we have a current I

24
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,977
which is identical on both sides.

25
00:01:24,977 --> 00:01:28,785
In which case, we will say
that these dipoles are equivalent.

26
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:31,307
Now, the series connection of elements.

27
00:01:31,307 --> 00:01:34,423
It is fundamental to understand,
in a more complex circuit,

28
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,692
the elements that can be put, or which
are, in a serial configuration,

29
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:40,665
or elements that are in a parallel
configuration to, later on,

30
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,854
reduce the circuit,
and to know how to reduce it

31
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:48,015
so as to not create more problems
than we are solving.

32
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:53,250
You have here the fundamental properties
of putting elements in a serial configuration.

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,073
We have on this line,
in this model,

34
00:01:57,073 --> 00:02:01,748
put a resistor, a capacitor,
and an inductor.

35
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:04,673
The fundamental definition
of putting in series,

36
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:11,515
is to be able to say that the currents,
the three currents of these three elements,

37
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:15,491
are the same, or are identical.

38
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:20,056
Thus, placing elements in series,
means that the current flowing

39
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,444
through each element
is the same.

40
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,956
And then, another property derived
from Kirchhoff's equations,

41
00:02:27,956 --> 00:02:32,362
is that if these elements are in series
and have the same current flowing through,

42
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:38,844
the sum of the voltages, which is here
between the resistor, capacitor and inductor

43
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:44,442
this sum of voltages is also the voltage
at the terminals of the complete dipole,

44
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:48,154
Between this part of the dipole
and this part of the dipole.

45
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:56,363
We will thus have the voltage u present
here which is equal to uR + uC + uL

46
00:02:56,363 --> 00:03:00,678
Now that we've defined what is the
placing of elements in a serial configuration,

47
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:04,981
we will focus on
the three elements R, L, C

48
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:08,189
to separately see

49
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,506
what it means for
each of these elements.

50
00:03:10,506 --> 00:03:14,844
Let's start with the resistor
and placing resistors in series.

51
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:20,227
What we wish for, in the end,
when we have resistors in series

52
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:24,050
with the same current flowing
through R1 to Rn,

53
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,644
is to replace this set of resistors

54
00:03:27,644 --> 00:03:32,528
with a single resistor
known as equivalent, Rs,

55
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:36,774
through which the same current flows
and with the same voltage at the terminals,

56
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,726
so, it is the equivalence of dipoles
that we've seen earlier,

57
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:44,530
and in that instant, what can we say
about this new equivalent resistor ?

58
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,019
Well, knowing that the voltage u

59
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,567
is the sum of the partial voltages

60
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:59,185
from k to 1 up to n of uRk,

61
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,253
that this sum is equal to the complete u,

62
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:07,364
but that we can also replace
this uRk by this sum

63
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:11,895
from 1 to n, of the Rk times I,

64
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:14,197
the current being the same all the way through,

65
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:19,770
and we want this to be equal to
the Rs resistor times I,

66
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:27,061
from this, ensues an obvious fact that
most of you are already aware of,

67
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:31,550
that this series resistor in a series,

68
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,527
of several resistors in a series,

69
00:04:33,527 --> 00:04:38,867
is simply the mathematical
sum from K 1 to n

70
00:04:38,867 --> 00:04:43,217
of the separate resistors Rk.

71
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:46,008
We will do the same for capacitors
in a serial configuration.

72
00:04:46,008 --> 00:04:48,649
So once again, we have an
equivalence of dipoles,

73
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:51,208
we which to render 
equal these two dipoles.

74
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,821
We have a dipole of several 
capacitors in a serial configuration,

75
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:58,278
through which the same current flows,

76
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:01,404
we have at the terminals of
this complete dipole a voltage u

77
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:04,662
and we which to replace this dipole
with a single capacitor,

78
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:08,313
in other words, a capacitor equal

79
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:12,026
to the set of all the capacitors
in the serial configuration, here.

80
00:05:12,026 --> 00:05:13,262
How do we do this ?

81
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:18,044
we know that a voltage at
the terminals of the capacitor k,

82
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:23,833
is 1/Ck integral(from 0 to t)

83
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,672
i(t')dt'

84
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:30,482
+ the initial condition : Uck(0)

85
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:33,153
So know, we will sum
all of these voltages,

86
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:37,174
so we will have the global u
of the sum of all the voltages.

87
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:38,368
What is it ?

88
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:43,014
It's : 1/C1 + 1/C2

89
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:48,510
+ etc until 1/Cn

90
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:56,698
of the integral(from 0 to t) of i(t')dt'

91
00:05:56,698 --> 00:06:04,990
+ a set of initial conditions [Uc1(0) etc]

92
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,620
And we want this to
be equal to 1/C,

93
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,593
the series capacitor Cs,

94
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:17,065
integral(from 0 to t)

95
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:23,407
i(t')dt' + u(0)

96
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:28,734
it of course follows that 1/Cs

97
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:36,781
is equal to the sum of k=1 to n of the 1/Ck

98
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:41,357
This is the same as writing that Cs

99
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:49,633
is equal to 1 / sum of k=1 to n of the 1/Ck

100
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:56,290
This is the rule of putting
capacitors in series.

101
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,622
We say one more thing about
the initial value of the

102
00:06:59,622 --> 00:07:01,307
voltage at the terminals of the circuit.

103
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:05,655
This initial value, u(0)
is simply equal to

104
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:13,423
the sum of all the values of uck(0)

105
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,352
We can also say that the placing
of capacitors in a serial configuration

106
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,312
will insure that the final series
capacitor of all the elements

107
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:25,125
will  in general, necessarily,
according the equations here,

108
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:28,805
be smaller than each of the
partial capacitors.

109
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:32,056
Now, here is the placing of
inductors in a serial configuration.

110
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,871
So just like the previous ones,
you have understood it now,

111
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:40,076
between the resistor and capacitor,
we have here an equivalence of two dipoles.

112
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:43,934
We want this set of
inductors in series

113
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:47,580
to be equal to this single
equivalent inductor.

114
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,752
So then, we can write that,

115
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:56,957
knowing u is equal to L di/dt

116
00:07:56,957 --> 00:08:00,412
in a general manner for an inductor.

117
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:04,478
we can write that the global u
of placing in a serial configuration,

118
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:11,027
is the sum of k=1 to n of the uLK,

119
00:08:11,037 --> 00:08:17,090
which is equal to (L1 + L2 + etc Ln)

120
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,743
multiplied by di/dt ,

121
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:22,498
the i being common to all, it's the same,

122
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:26,818
and we want this to be
equal to Ls di/dt

123
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:31,347
It follows that the rules are exactly
the same as for the resistors,

124
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:35,686
that Ls is the mathematical sum

125
00:08:35,686 --> 00:08:40,975
of k from 1 to n of the Lk.

126
00:08:40,975 --> 00:08:45,244
An important element now is putting
voltage supplies in a serial configuration.

127
00:08:45,244 --> 00:08:49,979
What can we say when we put
different supplies in series

128
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:52,556
and that we want to,
like previously

129
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:55,387
for the equivalence
of two dipoles,

130
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:58,040
we wish to replace
the set of supplies

131
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,172
by a single equivalent supply Us ?

132
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:05,763
Well, here like previously,
it's actually relatively obvious, 

133
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:08,274
this global us, this supply

134
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:12,338
which replaces all the 
partial supplies in series,

135
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:19,571
is the sum of k from 1 to n,
of the partial supplies uk.

136
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,338
We can make a small example
to convince ourselves, by saying :

137
00:09:22,338 --> 00:09:27,055
well here we are, we have an example of 4
supplies in a serial configuration.

138
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:31,293
We wish to replace this element
of 4 supplies in series

139
00:09:31,293 --> 00:09:33,787
by a single supply
to simplify the diagram.

140
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,981
What is the value of Us,
knowing that we have 3 volts,

141
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:41,207
we have 4 volts, we have 1 volt
and 2 volts, but with different directions.

142
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:47,874
Well, we will have 3V - 4V + 1V + 2V

143
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:53,231
and this gives us a Us = 2V.

144
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:57,189
So of course, take care with the
direction of the mathematical voltages

145
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,833
when we proceed with the sum and the
placing in series of voltage supplies.

146
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:05,118
It is obvious that it is not possible to
consider placing several current supplies

147
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:10,629
in series without violating
Kirchhoff's first law,

148
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:16,225
except if all the individual supply
produce exactly the same current.

149
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,751
In which case, the equivalent dipole
will simply be equal to

150
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,089
any one of of the
individual supplies.

151
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:28,987
Thus, what we can say here is that
the placing in series here is impossible,

152
00:10:28,987 --> 00:10:34,925
except if all the supplies

153
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,437
are of the same value

154
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:40,149
and sign.

155
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,562
In this very particular case,

156
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:45,584
it is possible to put
current supplies in series.

157
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:50,306
And finally, an example of placing
several elements in series.

158
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,398
Once again, we notice
that all of these elements,

159
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:56,406
it's true that it's pretty obvious here,
having the same current flowing through,

160
00:10:56,406 --> 00:11:00,614
all of these elements in series.

161
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:03,392
We group them based on families,
in other words, all the resistors together,

162
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:06,713
all the capacitors together
and all the inductors together.

163
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:09,145
We can then already proceed
to a simplification

164
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:13,884
of this model on the left through
this equivalent model on the right

165
00:11:13,884 --> 00:11:17,983
with 3 elements
which represent the placing in series

166
00:11:17,983 --> 00:11:19,947
of the all separate elements.

167
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,619
Let us now proceed to parallel
placement of elements.

168
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:26,297
What is the definition of putting
elements in parallel ?

169
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:29,777
You have a diagram with a resistor,
capacitor and inductor

170
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:31,553
which are in parallel.

171
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:36,240
The definition, is that
the 3 elements R, L and C,

172
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,065
have the same voltage at their terminals.

173
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,475
So this is the definition.

174
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,156
R and C are parallel,

175
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:46,629
similarly R and L are parallel,
similarly C and L are parallel.

176
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,547
Because the voltage at their terminals
is strictly equal.

177
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:57,334
Thus, the three currents that flow through
these elements are different,

178
00:11:57,334 --> 00:12:01,395
but, through Kirchhoff,
the sum of these three currents

179
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:05,823
is necessarily equal to the total
current output here of the dipole,

180
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:09,022
so we can also write
that this current here,

181
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:13,089
is the sum of iR, of iC and of iL.

182
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:16,503
We will now go back to R, C then L,

183
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:21,267
and for each of these elements,
see what are the rules

184
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:26,898
to be able to simplify elements in parallel
of R, of C or of L.

185
00:12:26,898 --> 00:12:29,333
First of all, putting
resistors in parallel.

186
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,602
Once again, we decide
to define 2 dipoles :

187
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:39,350
the dipole with the number of resistors
at n resistors placed parallel to each other,

188
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,831
because, as you can see here,
connected to the same voltage uAB,

189
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,789
and we wish to replace this
with a single resistor

190
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:51,716
equivalent to the previous dipole,

191
00:12:51,716 --> 00:12:55,228
and this parallel equivalent resistor,

192
00:12:55,228 --> 00:12:57,168
with a single resistor Rp.

193
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:58,288
How do we do it ?

194
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:02,249
We know that the current
as written previously,

195
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,609
is the current in R1

196
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:07,923
+ the current in R2

197
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:10,957
+ etc the current in Rn.

198
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:15,001
It's the total current of
the dipole that we have, i.

199
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:21,437
We also know that
this current must be equal to i

200
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:22,643
of the right dipole,

201
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:24,169
as written already here.

202
00:13:24,169 --> 00:13:30,835
If we replace iR1, iR2, iRn
and so on, using Ohm's law,

203
00:13:30,835 --> 00:13:34,494
we have u/R1

204
00:13:34,494 --> 00:13:36,970
u/R2

205
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,936
etc u/Rn

206
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:43,443
and this must be equal to u/Rp

207
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:48,278
We define then the rules of placing
resistors in parallel,

208
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,291
which is the following :

209
00:13:49,311 --> 00:13:54,369
it's that 1/Rp is equal to the sum

210
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:03,458
of k from 1 to n

211
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,277
of the 1/Rk

212
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:13,217
In other words, we can also write this
in another way, it's that Rp

213
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:16,759
is equal to 1 over

214
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,721
the sum of the inverses of Rk

215
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:24,353
for k from 1 to n.

216
00:14:24,353 --> 00:14:26,605
We will now look at placing
capacitors in parallel.

217
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:28,625
We apply exactly the same rule.

218
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:34,895
We know that the total current
output here in this dipole,

219
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:38,033
is the sum of each of the
currents of each branch,

220
00:14:38,033 --> 00:14:40,537
We can thus write i

221
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:46,571
is the sum of kfrom 1
to n of the ick

222
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:52,267
in other words (C1 + C2 + etc until Cn)

223
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:56,355
of the voltage variation over time.

224
00:14:56,355 --> 00:15:01,586
And we want this to be equal to Cp times du/dt

225
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,950
Thus, we can write that Cp is equal to

226
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:12,765
the sum of k from 1 to n of the Ck.

227
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,077
So it's pretty simple

228
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,632
to calculate the placing
of capacitors in parallel.

229
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:18,579
It's simply the sum.

230
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:25,055
Finally, we need to calculate the placing
in parallel elements of inductors

231
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,557
before proceeding to supplies.

232
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:28,721
So we proceed once again
in the same manner.

233
00:15:28,721 --> 00:15:35,276
We know that a current iLK
as a function of time

234
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:39,786
is 1/Lk integral(from 0 to t)

235
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:44,316
of u(t')dt'

236
00:15:44,316 --> 00:15:49,938
+ an initial current iLK.

237
00:15:51,558 --> 00:15:55,611
We can then write that this current i, that
we want in the dipole on the right,

238
00:15:55,611 --> 00:16:00,462
is 1/L1 + 1/L2

239
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:04,773
and so on until 1/Ln
all of this in brackets,

240
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:11,275
times the integral of u(t')

241
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:15,797
+ all the initial currents,

242
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:22,400
[iL1(0) etc until iLn(0)].

243
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,924
And this, we want it to be equal

244
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:33,794
to 1/Lp integral(from 0 to t)

245
00:16:36,284 --> 00:16:41,644
u(t')dt' + i(0).

246
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:46,234
What we can say and what we can see,
is that placing in parallel

247
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:49,887
will allow us to compute
the equivalent L, Lp,

248
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:54,617
1/Lp is equal to the sum of k
from 1 to n

249
00:16:54,617 --> 00:16:58,547
of the 1/Lk

250
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:05,579
In other words, Lp is the
inverse of the sum of inverses,

251
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,951
from k=1 to n of Lk

252
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:15,708
And similarly, we will be able to say,
just like the resistor,

253
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,952
it's the inverse of the sum of inverses,
for inductors in parallel,

254
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:23,005
and add to this the fact that initial value of
the current flowing through the circuit,

255
00:17:23,005 --> 00:17:26,100
and simply equal to the mathematical
sum of the initial currents.

256
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,739
So we will have i(0) equal to a sum

257
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:36,798
from k=1 to n of the iLk(0).

258
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,449
So now we have the rules 
of putting in parallel elements

259
00:17:40,449 --> 00:17:42,533
of R, L and C.

260
00:17:42,533 --> 00:17:46,604
We will now see the placing in
parallel of current supplies.

261
00:17:46,604 --> 00:17:51,147
So here also, it's pretty simple
since we apply Kirchhoff.

262
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:56,409
By wanting to equalize the left
dipole with the right dipole,

263
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,531
we can see that i, which is defined here,

264
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:07,069
is we sum the currents,
we will discover that ip,

265
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,668
we will call like this,

266
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:16,474
is equal to the sum of ik currents

267
00:18:16,474 --> 00:18:18,990
by taking k=1 to n,

268
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,717
and we will thus define this i as ip.

269
00:18:22,717 --> 00:18:24,553
So we have an equivalence here,

270
00:18:24,553 --> 00:18:26,812
which allows us to,
once again, do a small example,

271
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:29,112
to show you in a practical manner
how this happens.

272
00:18:29,112 --> 00:18:33,692
So if you have here a dipole ab

273
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:37,612
with 3 current supplies in parallel

274
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:40,424
that we wish to replace
with a single current supply.

275
00:18:40,424 --> 00:18:43,240
What is the value of the iA current ?

276
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,547
We will have 3 amperes
which go up

277
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:50,457
- 1 ampere, 2 remain,
- 5 amperes.

278
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:54,347
Well, the current i is of - 3 amperes.

279
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:59,206
So this i is equal to -3A.

280
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:02,667
We continue with parallel placement
of voltage supplies,

281
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,686
and similarly,

282
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:06,383
we have a problem with putting
voltage supplies in parallel.

283
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:08,787
We cannot do this parallel placement

284
00:19:08,787 --> 00:19:13,492
without violating Kirchhoff's second law
and once again, here as well,

285
00:19:13,492 --> 00:19:15,352
except if they are all the same voltages.

286
00:19:15,352 --> 00:19:17,637
If they all have the same voltages,
in this case we can

287
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:19,006
simplify it to a single supply,

288
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:22,916
which will be the same
supply that each of these defines.

289
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:23,920
And thus we can write

290
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,907
that putting voltage supplies
in parallel is impossible

291
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:34,645
except if they all have

292
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:42,343
the same value and sign.

293
00:19:42,343 --> 00:19:46,091
To conclude, we've seen the
parallel and serial placement

294
00:19:46,091 --> 00:19:48,618
of all the elements R, L, C,

295
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:52,756
of ideal current and voltage supplies.

296
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:55,623
As a conclusion,
I will show you here a table

297
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:57,578
which sums up what we've just seen

298
00:19:57,578 --> 00:20:00,064
with serial configurations,

299
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:05,876
the definition of resistors in series,
capacitors in series, inductors in series,

300
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:07,099
voltage supplies in series,

301
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:10,862
and parallel configurations
with the resistor, capacitor, inductor,

302
00:20:10,862 --> 00:20:13,649
and similarly for the ideal current supply.

303
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,514
Thank you
