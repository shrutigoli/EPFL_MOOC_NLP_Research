00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,719
Hello. Welcome to this new lecture of the
Electrotechnics course.

2
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:12,236
So far, we have studied
many aspects of an electrical circuit

3
00:00:12,236 --> 00:00:16,376
but always with a power supply 
either in DC steady state,

4
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:19,876
or at a certain frequency, 
eventually at multiple frequencies

5
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:24,136
 but simultaneous, it was the case 
of the principle of superposition.

6
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:26,266
We will see
how a circuit behaves 

7
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:28,126
over a big range of frequencies.

8
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,178
Today we will start by defining
what a geometric locus is,

9
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:34,838
then we will see
the behaviour of an impedance 

10
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:39,418
while varying one of its parameters,
in this instance, the frequency,

11
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:42,418
we will see an example,
and finally we will look at

12
00:00:42,418 --> 00:00:46,418
the current in the circuit,
because if we change the impedance

13
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:50,418
the current will also change,
we will then compute the current

14
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,518
as a function of the frequency.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,886
We start then by a definition,
the definition of the complex domain.

16
00:00:56,886 --> 00:01:01,876
We call complex domain relative
to any complex variable,

17
00:01:01,876 --> 00:01:08,566
here it would be the impedance Z,
thus any complex variable,

18
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:12,566
the location, or the curve, the path, 
described by the extremity

19
00:01:12,566 --> 00:01:18,306
of the vector representing this variable
when we vary a parameter 

20
00:01:18,306 --> 00:01:22,006
of the network, usually
 it is the pulsation, the frequency,

21
00:01:22,006 --> 00:01:26,306
but it could be
the resistor, the inductance

22
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,056
or the capacitor

23
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:33,078
And today, we will only look at
the pulsation.

24
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:52,402
For a given circuit, 
for example this RLC circuit in series,

25
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:56,132
we can write
the expression of its total impedance

26
00:01:56,132 --> 00:02:01,162
that has a real part
and an imaginary part.

27
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:05,162
We can represent it
on the complex plane.

28
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,832
We have here Z.

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,490
Z of omega.

30
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:20,967
And we would like to know how varies
this extremity of the vector Z

31
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:24,967
when we move, modify
the frequency.

32
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:28,124
For a given circuit,
powered by an AC supply,

33
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:34,124
the goal is to compute the curve
covered here by the total impedance

34
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:37,244
when we vary the frequency.

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,480
So in the given example,
the RLC circuit in series,

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,950
we are facing three components, 
because there are three elements.

37
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:52,250
We have the impedance ZR which is equal to R,
which doesn't depend on the frequency.

38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,100
We have the component ZL here.

39
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,549
ZL which is equal to jωL.

40
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:03,572
And the last component ZC.

41
00:03:03,572 --> 00:03:09,522
ZC is equal to -j(1/ωC).

42
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:17,384
The two impedances ZL and ZC
are not dependent on the frequency ZC,

43
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:21,384
the inverse of the frequency,
and ZL is proportional to the frequency.

44
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,360
To get the total impedance of the circuit
we will conduct a sum,

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,660
since they are in series,
these three impedances.

46
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,900
Therefore, the sum of these three impedances,
using the property of 

47
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,360
the vector addition,
we have this first impedance ZR

48
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,870
to which we will add ZL,
which is represented here,

49
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,750
We add and we add again
ZC which is negative

50
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,190
in order to get the total impedance.

51
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:56,218
This total impedance has a norm
and an angle, a phase shift,

52
00:03:56,218 --> 00:04:00,608
with respect to the real axis 
and the end of this vector is

53
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:05,278
given here for a frequency of,
for example here,

54
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,468
omega equal 200 radians per second.

55
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:15,027
If now we change this 
frequency value and raise it,

56
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:21,717
that's it, we are here at omega equals
314 radians per second.

57
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:27,147
We see that ZL increased slightly,
and linearly with Omega

58
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,967
because ZL is ωL.

59
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:37,107
ZC, has decreased because 
its expression is  1 / ωC ,

60
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:41,887
and then the final result,
the sum of these three vectors,

61
00:04:41,887 --> 00:04:48,067
give a new point here for
omega equals 314 radians per second,

62
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:51,607
a new point that corresponds
to the new norm

63
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:55,607
and a new phase shift of the impedance
with respect to the real axis.

64
00:04:56,388 --> 00:05:01,368
If we increase again the frequency,
we have increased once again

65
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:06,078
the frequency or the pulsation, this
time we are at 550 radians per second.

66
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:09,338
We see that ZL has again increased
and ZC decreased

67
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:15,458
in order to end up with a value so
that both offset each other

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:18,438
and we end up here with 
a total impedance,

69
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:21,728
this point here,
at 550 radians per second,

70
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,598
a total impedance
purely resistive.

71
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:29,563
We will threat this particular case
in the next lecture.

72
00:05:30,526 --> 00:05:34,886
Increasing again the frequency,
this time we have omega

73
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:39,916
which is at 720 radians
per second for example,

74
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,976
so ZL becomes bigger than ZC.

75
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:50,346
Thus the nature of the impedance has 
become inductive, 

76
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:53,726
with a positive reactive part, 
whereas until now

77
00:05:53,726 --> 00:05:55,866
it was capacitive.

78
00:05:55,866 --> 00:06:02,026
And increasing again the frequency
we finally get a total impedance, ZT

79
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:07,126
which this time even more
inductive than before

80
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:10,866
and see our spot,
namely the curve described

81
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:15,036
by the end of the vector Z
as a function of the frequency,

82
00:06:15,036 --> 00:06:16,336
that is taking shape.

83
00:06:16,336 --> 00:06:21,736
I represent it but for
more values of omega

84
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:30,616
and we see that the spot of our impedance
which is a RLC circuit in series

85
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:33,536
is finally a straight line.

86
00:06:42,094 --> 00:06:49,174
This straight line goes from minus infinity to
plus infinity on the imaginary axis,

87
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:54,454
when the pulsation is null
we have in fact the term 1/ωC

88
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:58,244
which goes to infinity
and when the frequency is infinite

89
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:04,814
we have the term ZL that is worth ωL
and tends to infinity.

90
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:08,313
That's it, we will work on a concrete case.

91
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:13,213
We will take this circuit example
where we see we have a resistor

92
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:19,043
in series with an inductance,
and all in series with a resistor 

93
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:21,973
in parallel with a capacitor.

94
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:26,333
So we will define this first part
as Z1

95
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:29,763
and this second part
as Z2.

96
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,693
These two impedances, Z1 and Z2,
are in series.

97
00:07:33,602 --> 00:07:37,782
That's it, we can write the equivalent
impedance of all this circuit,

98
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,422
of all these impedances in series.

99
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:46,852
We see that we have a term
that corresponds to Z1 with its part, here,

100
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:52,122
resistive, R1, and 
the reactive part,  jωL1 .

101
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:58,857
Then for the Z2 part,
you can refer to the table

102
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:02,107
that we've given you
in the previous lectures,

103
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:06,547
but we can rewrite the real part,
here, of this impedance

104
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:15,737
as being this plus the reactive part
which is equal to jω times this term here.

105
00:08:16,616 --> 00:08:23,106
Now, we would like to compute
or determine the place of the impedance Z

106
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:27,106
when we vary the pulse,
the frequency, omega.

107
00:08:27,386 --> 00:08:30,896
The result, we give it to you
in the following slide.

108
00:08:30,896 --> 00:08:33,846
We have here this result
that i will comment.

109
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:40,046
So we represent here the impedance Z1
and the impedance Z2.

110
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:47,096
The first impedance here, Z1,
is given by, here,

111
00:08:47,096 --> 00:08:50,266
this Z1 which has a real part
and an imaginary part,

112
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:54,266
it is this term R1 plus jωL1.

113
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:59,906
A small remark because of the software
i use that is not able to

114
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:06,396
underline, we have actually
to write correctly this equation,

115
00:09:06,396 --> 00:09:11,786
we have to underline here the Y2, the Z2
times all the impedances,

116
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:18,036
even these ones to be correct.

117
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:27,786
Thus I said that the first part
here of the impedance Z1,

118
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:31,786
which corresponds to this term R1
and this term jωL1,

119
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:35,236
indeed, we find it here 
if we vary the frequency

120
00:09:35,236 --> 00:09:36,496
from zero to infinite.

121
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:42,376
This term does not vary,
we still have R1 which is this point here,

122
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:46,376
and the impedance will increase gradually 
with the increase of the frequency,

123
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:52,646
it's the term jωL1,

124
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:55,476
of a resistor and
an inductance in series,

125
00:09:55,476 --> 00:10:01,566
it is a straight line
that tends from zero to j infinity. 

126
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:08,738
Now for the second part of 
the circuit, the impedance Z2 here,

127
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:12,938
we can advantageously use
the admittances,

128
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:16,288
because we known that the parallel 
admittances can be added,

129
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:21,428
and it allows us to
 describe the location of Y2,

130
00:10:21,428 --> 00:10:25,428
 that is to say that Y2 is the sum 
of these two admittances,

131
00:10:25,428 --> 00:10:30,338
the admittance of R2 is here,
it is 1/R2, it is the inverse,

132
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:37,078
and the admittance of C2 it is jωC2
and we see that this term here,

133
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:39,008
these terms,
are very similar 

134
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:42,308
to these two terms here,
something constant

135
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:47,348
for the real case,
we have this term here, 1/R2,

136
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:51,648
and we add an imaginary term 
which is proportional to the frequency.

137
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:55,648
It also gives us a place, here, 
which is half-right 

138
00:10:55,648 --> 00:10:59,648
that goes from j null to j infinite. 

139
00:10:59,862 --> 00:11:02,382
So we can do the mathematical 
demonstration

140
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:04,262
but we will not do it here.

141
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:08,132
Making the mathematical demonstration 
that the inverse of a line 

142
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:13,002
in the complex plane, 
so that goes from j0 to j infinity,

143
00:11:13,002 --> 00:11:18,322
from the zero imaginary part 
to an infinite imaginary part,

144
00:11:18,322 --> 00:11:20,252
is a semicircle.

145
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,602
So the image or the inverse 
of a straight line is a semicircle 

146
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:27,742
that starts from this value here
for omega equals to zero 

147
00:11:27,742 --> 00:11:31,302
and tends to this value here.

148
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:39,412
To get the final result, 
one must add the impedance Z1, 

149
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:44,052
is this place here, 
and this impedance Z2 

150
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:46,812
we found in doing 
the opposite of this straight line here,

151
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:49,432
it's this semicircle here,

152
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:55,492
the sum of the two, is this impedance
plus this one, which is here,

153
00:11:55,492 --> 00:11:59,172
 which gives this result: Z1 plus Z2.

154
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:05,761
The sun of these two impedances
for omega equals zero,

155
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:11,251
we go from this point here
where we have the sun of R1 plus R2.

156
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:16,962
And increasing the frequency,
first we will be negative, 

157
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:20,962
which means capacitive,
because at low frequency

158
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:26,682
the impedance Z2 is very high,
it is capacitive.

159
00:12:26,682 --> 00:12:30,682
So we will first be capacitive,
we arrive at a particular value

160
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:34,852
where we are purely resistive
and when the frequency increases further,

161
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:37,952
we will become very inductive
to follow this curve here.

162
00:12:37,952 --> 00:12:42,132
So, we start with a total impedance value
for a frequency,

163
00:12:42,132 --> 00:12:45,522
a pulsation, null
from this point here.

164
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:48,532
We have actually 
the sum of the two resistors R1 and R2.

165
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,342
Why?

166
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:56,202
Because jωL1 is null
and 1/ωC is infinite,

167
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,382
So we have an open circuit here.

168
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:01,182
Instead of C2
we have only R1 plus R2,

169
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:02,812
it is this starting point.

170
00:13:02,812 --> 00:13:06,912
That's it, i launch the video and we see
that the impedance is first capacitive,

171
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:11,112
resistive, and she becomes
more and more inductive

172
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:14,252
progressively as the 
frequency increases.

173
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:19,851
We have seen what happens at
the impedance, at its norm,

174
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:24,311
at its phase in the complex plan
when we increase the frequency

175
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,581
of the circuit.

176
00:13:25,581 --> 00:13:29,581
We will now, for this example
given here, get interested in the current,

177
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:34,291
namely, its norm and its phase,
once again depending on the frequency.

178
00:13:35,054 --> 00:13:44,954
So we try to compute I of omega
and beta, the current argument.

179
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:49,115
So to know the current
which passes through the circuit, we need,

180
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:52,245
knowing here
the supply voltage U0,

181
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:56,615
we need to know the impedance here
of the RC circuit in series.

182
00:13:56,615 --> 00:14:09,245
So we can write that Z = R - j(1/ωC)
and then that its norm is equal to,

183
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:15,265
by Pythagoras, to the real part squared 
plus the imaginary part squared.

184
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:24,765
So we have that the norm of Z
it is √R² + (1/ω²C²).

185
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:26,698
This is the norm.

186
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:28,198
Now the phase shift.

187
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:34,918
The phase shift of the impedance,
it is given by the arc tangent

188
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:40,928
of the imaginary part
over the real part,

189
00:14:40,928 --> 00:14:47,858
namely the imaginary part 1/ωC
divided by the real part R.

190
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:52,898
That's it, we have completely defined
here the impedance Z, and now

191
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:55,118
to compute the current.

192
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:01,903
The current is given by the ratio
of u0 to Z.

193
00:15:02,451 --> 00:15:06,291
So, if I express u0
in function of the argument,

194
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:13,271
we have u0 times  e^jα,
usually we put α equal to zero,

195
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:18,241
and the impedance Z which is given
by the norm we have just computed

196
00:15:18,241 --> 00:15:21,731
multiplied by e^jφ.

197
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:27,343
From this equation
we can write the norm of the current,

198
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:34,443
which is u0 over Z,
multiplied by e^j(α - φ).

199
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:40,063
With identification, we have that this term here
is the norm of I

200
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:46,033
and this term here, is the argument of I,
it is beta.

201
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:50,021
We can express the norm of I, 
we develop.

202
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:56,691
We have that I it's u0, the supply 
voltage, divided by the norm of Z,

203
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:07,041
namely R² + (1/ω²C²),
and the angle beta,

204
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:11,711
the argument of the current,
it is given by -φ,

205
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:19,661
namely  tangent arc of 1/ωRC.

206
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,194
We will analyse now 
these two functions,

207
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:26,434
the norm of I and the argument of I
in function of omega

208
00:16:26,434 --> 00:16:30,314
and we will represent them in a plan
omega is the variable

209
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:32,544
we would like to represent.

210
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:43,107
We will first represent
the norm of I in function of omega.

211
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:51,255
And the argument of I in function of omega.

212
00:16:53,077 --> 00:17:01,757
For a pulsation omega equals zero,
we have that I is equal to zero.

213
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:02,637
why?

214
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:06,477
Because this term becomes very
big and then

215
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:10,547
the ratio of u over something 
very big is equal to zero.

216
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,210
So for a null pulsation,
we have a norm of the current

217
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,030
that goes from this point here.

218
00:17:19,384 --> 00:17:25,474
Concerning the phase,
we have that beta is equal to pi over 2.

219
00:17:25,474 --> 00:17:26,524
Why?

220
00:17:26,524 --> 00:17:36,444
Because the vector ZC is infinite
as long as omega is equal to zero,

221
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:43,114
therefore the norm of C is infinite
and we have an angle of minus pi over 2.

222
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:47,914
and since beta is equal to minus phi,
we go from this value

223
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:54,574
that worth pi over two
for a null frequency.

224
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:59,214
In contrast, when 
the pulsation is infinite,

225
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:06,044
the current tends to a value 
that is u0/R.

226
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:10,444
We see that in this equation.

227
00:18:10,444 --> 00:18:15,144
The pulsation being infinite,
this term is equal to zero

228
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:19,394
and we have then u0/√R², is u0/R.

229
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:28,328
The current, when omega equals
infinite, tends to u0/R.

230
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,090
In between, we will increase 
that way.

231
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:38,223
For the argument of the current,
beta at infinite equals zero.

232
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:39,473
Why?

233
00:18:39,473 --> 00:18:44,893
Because for an infinite value,
the capacitor behaves

234
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:50,483
as a Short Circuit
and this term here tends to zero.

235
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:56,777
The curve of the argument goes from
phi over two and tends to zero

236
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:59,487
for omega equals infinite.

237
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:04,603
We have completely defined
the behavior of the current

238
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:07,583
which passes through the circuit 
as a function of the frequency

239
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:10,833
in terms of the norm
and the argument.

240
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:16,131
Thus a steady-state capacitor 
acts as an impedance

241
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,381
infinite, then no current.

242
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:19,681
We are at this point here.

243
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:24,991
And a capacitor at an infinite frequency
behaves as a short-circuit 

244
00:19:24,991 --> 00:19:28,151
and then we only 
have the resistive part

245
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:32,871
We have defined and built
the geometric locus of an impedance,

246
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,971
here in function of the frequency,
but we could also have done it

247
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:39,971
in function of R, L or C for example
if we wanted to take into account

248
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:45,151
the aging of the components 
where R, L or C may change,

249
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:48,331
or in function of the load
that would be put in this circuit.

250
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:52,331
We have seen that a circuit could change
in nature depending on the frequency

251
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,331
to which it is supplied, 
so either capacitive, purely resistive

252
00:19:56,331 --> 00:19:59,941
or inductive, and there is a particular
value for which

253
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:03,221
it is purely resistive,
that is what we will see

254
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,901
in the next lecture.

255
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:10,149
We have seen that it is possible to delete
the reactive part of an impedance

256
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:13,529
but this is only 
possible at one given frequency.

257
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:16,879
Consequently, 
one can also remove

258
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:23,569
the reactive power in a circuit
combining the element L and the element C.

259
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:28,244
Finally, we have seen that if the impedance Z
changes with the frequency,

260
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:31,104
the current also changes
with the frequency,

261
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:37,214
we have shown how it evolves
in terms of its norm and its phase shift

262
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:39,514
as a function of the frequency.

263
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,804
Thank you for your attention.
