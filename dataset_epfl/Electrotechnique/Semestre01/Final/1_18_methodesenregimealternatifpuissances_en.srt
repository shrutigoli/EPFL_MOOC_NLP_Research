00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:07,512
Hello, welcome to this new lesson of the
Electrotechnics course.

2
00:00:07,512 --> 00:00:11,367
Today, we will solve an
exercise by the powers method

3
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,099
using only partially 
the complex calculation

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,656
to determine the impedances,
currents and voltages.

5
00:00:17,656 --> 00:00:19,760
We will begin
with a very brief recall

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,997
of the notions acquired on the powers

7
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:25,652
and their additivity
rules.

8
00:00:26,202 --> 00:00:29,281
We will then see
a concrete example.

9
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,051
So, as a reminder, the active power P

10
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:36,641
is represented on
the real axis of the complex plane

11
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:42,726
and the reactive power Q on the
imaginary axis of the same complex plane.

12
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:48,261
The additive rule for a system
of several elements says that:

13
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:53,388
the total active power is the sum
of powers for each system.

14
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:57,887
same for the total reactive power:

15
00:00:57,887 --> 00:01:02,645
it is the algebraic sum
of the reactive power units. 

16
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,563
We can perform this addition
algebraically, why?

17
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,752
Because these variables are collinear.

18
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:11,120
In this example, we see
that we have two systems:

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,787
the system S1 and the system S2,
and each of them consumes

20
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:20,736
an active power, P1 and P2,

21
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,494
that we will be able to add;

22
00:01:22,494 --> 00:01:26,362
and a reactive power Q1 and Q2.

23
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,981
Here, pay attention,
Q2  is negative,

24
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:33,569
and we can also add
the reactive powers.

25
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:36,219
Concerning the apparent power,

26
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:42,287
we can also add them,
but it is vector addition.

27
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:47,036
We see here that the total apparent power,
is the sum

28
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:53,310
of the apparent power  S1 plus the
apparent power S2, vector.

29
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,456
And then, we can find the total
power, the total active power,

30
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,887
as the sum of P1 and P2 :

31
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:06,464
We see that it corresponds to the real part
of the complex apparent power,

32
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,341
it is that term here.

33
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:15,310
Same for the total reactive power,
it is the sum of Q1 and of Q2,

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,898
Q2 being negative, and it corresponds
to the imaginary part of

35
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:22,534
the complex apparent power.

36
00:02:22,534 --> 00:02:25,180
Let's now see
a concrete example.

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,004
We have the following circuit that is composed
of an excitation,

38
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:37,101
an alternative voltage U that will feed 
three branches of a circuit:

39
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:42,168
a branch RL,  a branch RC,

40
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:46,947
and a third branch that
is only made of a resistor.

41
00:02:46,947 --> 00:02:51,718
And in each of these branches, a
current will flow  I1 ,  I2  and  I3 ,

42
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:56,738
and we ask to compute the total
active power of all the circuit,

43
00:02:56,738 --> 00:03:02,998
the total reactive power as well,
and the total apparent power,

44
00:03:02,998 --> 00:03:07,990
and last, we ask the total current delivered by the supply.

45
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,915
Finally, we ask also,
the total power factor,

46
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:16,839
that is to say, the power factor
seen by this supply  U .

47
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,453
In order to solve that exercise,

48
00:03:19,453 --> 00:03:27,157
we will compute the three currents I1, I2,
I3 in each branch

49
00:03:27,157 --> 00:03:30,340
and we will compute the norm
of the current; why?

50
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,406
Because, to determine the active power,
we only need to know  : I ;

51
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:37,827
to square it, multiply it by  R  
to get that active power.

52
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:43,743
same for the reactive power that is equal
to x multiplied by I².

53
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:49,502
To determine the current, we still
need to know the impedance Z1,

54
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:54,463
this impedance Z1 is given by:

55
00:03:56,203 --> 00:04:01,566
Pythagoras  R1²  plus  x1 ,

56
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:04,584
namely, ω.L squared.

57
00:04:06,364 --> 00:04:09,608
This, is the value of the norm
of the impedance.

58
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:18,320
The norm of the current will then be equal
to U divided by Z1.

59
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,084
Same for the branch n°2.

60
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:30,579
The impedance's norm, Z2  is equal to
the square root of the real part squared

61
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:37,302
namely,  R2² of the impedance Z2 plus
the imaginary part

62
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:42,033
it's then a capacitor
it's 1/ωC squared.

63
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:50,795
And then, the norm  of the current I2 is
given by U/Z2.

64
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:55,531
Finally, for the third branch,
it is simpler because we have

65
00:04:55,531 --> 00:05:05,073
only one resistive part, we have the current
I3 given by U / Z3 or R3.

66
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,858
The imaginary part is null.

67
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:12,632
Therefore, we can now compute all
the active and reactive powers

68
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:14,889
for each of the three branches.

69
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:21,180
We have that P1, is equal to R1 times I1²,

70
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:29,899
which is equal to R1 times
the current squared, that is to say,

71
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:31,655
we will develop this term,

72
00:05:31,655 --> 00:05:38,378
 U² divided by Z squared

73
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:47,509
then it is R1² plus ω²L² ,
times the resistance R1.

74
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,192
For the reactive power in this branch,
it is always equal to,

75
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:57,978
x1 times I1²,

76
00:05:57,978 --> 00:06:02,261
then, x it's ωL multiplied by I1².

77
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:09,984
And it is equal, after development,
to the current I1,
 

78
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,486
U² over Z squared,

79
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,572
times x1, namely ωL.

80
00:06:25,294 --> 00:06:28,592
For the active power in
the second branch,

81
00:06:28,592 --> 00:06:34,083
we have that P2 is equal to
R2 times I2², the norm of I2 squared,

82
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:47,529
and is equal to I², namely
U² divided by Z², that is to say;

83
00:06:48,216 --> 00:06:54,950
R² + 1 / ω²C², 
times R2.

84
00:06:56,422 --> 00:07:04,055
For the reactive power, it is x
the reactive part of the branch,

85
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:07,385
namely, negative.

86
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:14,114
minus one over ωC
times I2².

87
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:29,721
And this is equal to
-U² / ωC divided by the norm squared,

88
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:35,471
of Z2, namely R2² + 1/ω²C².

89
00:07:37,815 --> 00:07:41,243
Finally, for the third branch,

90
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:47,572
the active power is equal to
R3 times I3²,

91
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:52,144
it is equal to U²/R3.

92
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:55,555
And the reactive part is equal to zero,

93
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:58,980
because there is no reactance
in this branch.

94
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:07,966
The total active power consumed
by the circuit is given by the relation

95
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:15,854
that the total power is the sum
of all the active powers,

96
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:18,499
and it is equal to :

97
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:23,111
[Writes on the blackboard]

98
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,362
This is the result.

99
00:08:38,362 --> 00:08:41,979
For the total reactive power,
we can also

100
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:50,102
sum all the reactive powers
of the circuit.

101
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,436
and it is equal to :

102
00:08:52,436 --> 00:08:54,429
[Writes on the blackboard]

103
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,485
Here is the result for the total
reactive power.

104
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:13,090
Now, it is very simple
by Pythagoras, 

105
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,563
to extract the apparent power
from the circuit.

106
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:30,407
It is given by the square root of
Ptot² + Qtot².

107
00:09:33,387 --> 00:09:39,471
This result allows us to determine
very easily the norm of the total current

108
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:46,128
knowing that the apparent power
is U times I,

109
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:53,560
therefore, the current Itot is equal to the
total apparent power divided by U.

110
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,759
We see at that level that we have managed to 
determine the norm of the total current

111
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,791
without performing the vector sum 
of three unit currents.

112
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,874
and, we arrive at the last question
of the exercise. 

113
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:14,748
We have to calculate the global cosφ
of the circuit.

114
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:19,690
And it is given, we have seen it before,
by the total active power

115
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,511
divided by the total
apparent power.

116
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:27,597
We could determine the value
of cosφ by computing

117
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:31,670
the equivalent impedance of the five 
impedances, and we would found

118
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:37,103
the same result, the same cosφ, but
probably the calculation is longer.

119
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:41,794
That's it, we have computed all the powers
in the circuit:

120
00:10:41,794 --> 00:10:45,209
- The active power P
which is the algebraic sum of

121
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,040
all the active
powers of the elements.

122
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,707
- The reactive power Q which is
also the algebraic sum

123
00:10:51,707 --> 00:10:54,428
of all the reactive
powers of all the elements.

124
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:58,568
- And the apparent power S which is,
this time, the vector sum

125
00:10:58,568 --> 00:11:01,105
of all the apparent
powers in the circuit.

126
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:05,206
The method avoids the explicit 
complex calculations,

127
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,960
only the norm of the currents 
is sufficient; Why?

128
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,954
Because the powers are calculated only 
with the norm of the current

129
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:21,238
with the active power, it's RI²;
the reactive power it's x times I².

130
00:11:21,238 --> 00:11:27,065
The phase of the currents and the impedances, 
it is not necessary to calculate it.

131
00:11:27,065 --> 00:11:28,878
Thank you for your attention.
