00:00:03,739 --> 00:00:07,532
Hello, today, we will discuss
about a particular circuit

2
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:11,543
much used in metrology:
it is the Wheatstone Bridge.

3
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:14,219
This is the content of today's
lesson:

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,619
first of all, we will do an analogy with
another measuring device

5
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,847
that is the beam balance.

6
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:27,717
Then, we will describe the circuit that
builds the Wheatstone bridge.

7
00:00:27,717 --> 00:00:31,980
Then we will establish a condition
for the bridge to be at equilibrium,

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,563
and calculate it's equilibrium condition.

9
00:00:34,563 --> 00:00:37,656
Finally we will give 
two application examples

10
00:00:37,656 --> 00:00:39,730
and we will end with a conclusion.

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,794
The Wheatstone bridge is
an interesting circuit example 

12
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:45,698
capable of satisfying, a particular
equilibrium condition,

13
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:48,683
a little bit like
balance beams.

14
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,141
So, here is the Wheatstone bridge.

15
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:54,685
It is a circuit that is essentially
made of 

16
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:59,189
two branches of
two resistors in series.

17
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:03,754
And, the condition for the
bridge to be at equilibrium

18
00:01:03,754 --> 00:01:09,548
is that the voltage between the points A
and B has to be equal to zero.

19
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:14,679
So if we connect a resistor
between these two points,

20
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:17,880
resistor that we can name R5

21
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:25,407
well, the current that crosses
this resistor, that we name I5,

22
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:28,827
must be equal to zero,
at equilibrium.

23
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:31,063
So if we connect a galvanometer,

24
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:34,379
which is a device allowing
the measure of the current.

25
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,725
If we connect a galvanometer in series
with this resistor her,

26
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,583
this last one will indicate a null value.

27
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:47,573
This condition is independent of the
value of R0 and of U0.

28
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:51,253
It should be noted that such a principle
can be used as continuous current.

29
00:01:51,253 --> 00:01:53,417
This is what we are going to work on today,

30
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,228
to perform the measurement
of an unknown resistor,

31
00:01:56,228 --> 00:02:00,996
or generalize an alternative  state to
define the unknown impedances. 

32
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:05,986
The purpose is to cancel the voltage
between the point A and the point B,

33
00:02:05,986 --> 00:02:11,750
this voltage U5, whatever  the values
of U0, R0 and R5 are

34
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,664
To get the equilibrium criteria,

35
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:15,698
we will first of all calculate,

36
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:20,253
the voltage that there is between
the terminal A and the terminal C,

37
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:25,342
and secondly, the voltage that
is between the terminal B and the terminal C

38
00:02:25,672 --> 00:02:27,575
and by making these two voltages equal,

39
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:30,758
we will get a voltage U5
that is equal to zero.

40
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:33,397
The equilibrium condition is that

41
00:02:33,397 --> 00:02:39,186
Vac must be equal to Vbc

42
00:02:40,596 --> 00:02:45,517
which will give a current I5 equal to zero

43
00:02:45,517 --> 00:02:49,122
and a voltage U5 also equal to zero.

44
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:53,788
We can also define this voltage U5 between
the points A and B as being: 

45
00:02:54,481 --> 00:03:01,384
U5 = Vac - Vbc

46
00:03:01,384 --> 00:03:03,385
This must be equal to zero.

47
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:08,488
The voltage Vac is given
by the following relationship:

48
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:12,481
It is the voltage Vdc

49
00:03:12,481 --> 00:03:17,448
between the point D and
the point C, the voltage Vdc

50
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:21,327
multiplied by the resistor R2

51
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,016
divide by the sum R1 + R2.

52
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:28,007
We recognize the voltage divider.

53
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:31,911
We do the same thing for the
voltage at the terminals of B and C.

54
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:37,168
So we have that Vbc is equal to Vdc

55
00:03:37,168 --> 00:03:43,375
multiplied by R4,
divided by R3 + R4.

56
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:47,684
And again, this expression of
the voltage divider.

57
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:50,383
For the equilibrium condition,
the voltage Vac needs to be

58
00:03:50,383 --> 00:03:53,492
equal to the voltage Vbc.

59
00:03:53,492 --> 00:03:56,484
We can rewrite this equation
the following way:

60
00:03:57,134 --> 00:03:59,636
[Silence]

61
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,747
that we can expand and that gives:

62
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,318
[Silence]

63
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:21,129
We can simplify this equation
by deleting these two products.

64
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,312
Which gives us the following
relationship:

65
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:30,784
The product R2 * R3 must be equal to

66
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:34,386
the product of R1 * R4

67
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:37,539
so that the bridge is in equilibrium.

68
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:43,913
Rather than embarrass ourselves with
indices which are, moreover,

69
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:46,418
not from a conventionality

70
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,963
we can clearly see here that
the indices R1, R2, R3, R4

71
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:52,308
can be arbitrarily
chosen

72
00:04:52,308 --> 00:04:55,943
we will then remember the
following rule, that says that:

73
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:57,737
the equilibrium condition of the bridge

74
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:01,959
is reached when the cross
products of the resistors,

75
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,424
R1 * R4

76
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:10,070
is equal to the product of
the resistors R3 * R2

77
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:13,330
[Silence]

78
00:05:19,478 --> 00:05:22,980
Now that we have defined
the equilibrium condition

79
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,092
we can see that we can use this circuit,
or this bridge, in two different ways:

80
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:31,573
either by adjusting the
resistors R1, R2, R3, R4

81
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:36,393
so that the voltage
Vab is equal to zero,

82
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:40,077
or by the equilibrium
of the circuit,

83
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,481
that satisfies this
equation her, 

84
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:45,306
we look at the voltage
that appears at the terminals Vab

85
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:49,029
when we change one or
several of the four resistors.

86
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:55,188
So the first mode of use,
is the resistance measuring.

87
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,316
If we start with a circuit

88
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,813
where a first resistor is known

89
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:03,800
and a second resistor,

90
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,978
we can get the result,
the computation of a fourth resistor

91
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:15,295
simply by adjusting
the resistor, here, R3,

92
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,898
in a way that the voltage Vab,

93
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:23,650
that appears between these points,
becomes equal to zero,

94
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,233
namely that we satisfy
this equation here.

95
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:30,780
So the analogy with the
beam balance is total.

96
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,646
We have here an unknown
that we will like to know the mass,

97
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,235
we will simply add here calibrated
weights

98
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:42,105
such that the beam balance
comes back to equilibrium.

99
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:44,176
This is what we do here with the bridge.

100
00:06:44,176 --> 00:06:47,672
If we know the reistor R1
and the resistor R2

101
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:50,312
The resistor R4 can be obtained

102
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:52,992
by adding or replacing R3

103
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:56,329
by known calibrated
resistor values,

104
00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:59,132
so that the voltage AB

105
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,744
becomes equal to zero.

106
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:06,163
Which makes that the resistor R4

107
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:09,712
will be equal to the product
of the resistor R2

108
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:11,828
multiplied by

109
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:16,904
the equivalent calibrated resistor,

110
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,501
divided by R1.

111
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:25,029
R1 and R2 are known and
also the calibrated resistors.

112
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:28,896
The second application example is
an electronic scale,

113
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:32,529
a scale such as the ones
in trade,

114
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,331
that allows to measure
a force, or a weight,

115
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:42,973
by using strain gauges.

116
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:46,772
This scale, here disassembled,

117
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:51,826
is made of a deformable
mechanical structure

118
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:58,021
where a part is linked to the
stationary part of the balance, the table,

119
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:01,745
and another part that is
connected to the plate.

120
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:08,063
Schematically, here, this element here,
is what we call a bearing neck,

121
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,146
that is a deformable structure

122
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:14,279
with the four necks
that are here very thin,

123
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,453
and so we put a resistance here

124
00:08:19,453 --> 00:08:24,500
on the part that deforms itself,
and when we will push here on the plate

125
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,067
all the structure will deform itself
and change the resistance.

126
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:34,166
We can see here a picture a little bit more
detailed of such strain gauges.

127
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:41,173
Here, schematically, to picture
the element in a better way,

128
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:43,881
we see that it is a coil

129
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:50,546
with L times the length of
a copper cable

130
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:57,774
and if we pull on this gauge her,
each of these strands will lengthen

131
00:08:57,774 --> 00:09:01,653
and the section will decrease so the
volume remains the same

132
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:05,023
So we have a resisitance
that will change.

133
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:09,394
If we pull on the strain gauge,
the resistance will increase

134
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:13,054
and if we compress
the strain gauge,

135
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,780
the resistance will decrease.

136
00:09:14,784 --> 00:09:18,501
We see here on these two
sketches the bearing neck

137
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:21,408
in its equilibrium position

138
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:25,937
and when we apply a force
on the plate

139
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:29,296
so we deform this extremity here
the other one remaining stationary

140
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,438
and so the resistance,
or the strain gauge,

141
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,966
that is positioned at this place

142
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:36,824
will elongate, so we will increase
its resistance,

143
00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:39,669
while this one will
be compressed.

144
00:09:39,669 --> 00:09:41,423
We will decrease its resistance

145
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:42,837
of a value ΔR.

146
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:47,601
Here is the circuit used within
the electronic balance.

147
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:50,757
We have four resistors

148
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,795
where two of them are known and fixed.

149
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,959
The two others are the strain gauge
resistors,

150
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,039
and that are capable to fluctuate.

151
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,762
At equilibrium, these resistors are equal

152
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:08,675
and so the bridge is at equilibrium
the voltage Vab is equal to 0.

153
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:13,967
Under stress, the bearing
neck will change.

154
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:19,478
The resistor R3 will increase,
the resistor R4 decreases,

155
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:24,710
and so at equilibrium Uab will be broken

156
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,470
and a voltage between these
two points will appear.

157
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,922
We find the equation that
we have expanded before,

158
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:36,076
with the crossed products
that must be equal,

159
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:40,513
the resistor R4 will be
changed of a value - ΔR,

160
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:45,704
the resistor R3 will be modified
of a value + ΔR.

161
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:51,927
We see in this equation that ΔR
can simply be changed here, compensate itself.

162
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,494
And the voltage that
appears at the terminals,

163
00:10:55,494 --> 00:10:58,051
between the terminals A and B

164
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:02,439
namely given bay this equation that
depends on the fluctuations of the resistor

165
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:06,106
and therefore the deformation that
has been done on the scale.

166
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:09,199
There will the be a voltage between
the points A and B that will appear,

167
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:12,368
it is a little bit like the needle of the balance,
here that will

168
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:18,889
deviate from the equilibrium position
if we continue our analogy.

169
00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:22,592
Note that we can arrange the
resistors in different ways

170
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:25,803
to increase the sensibility of the circuit,

171
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:29,647
eventually go from two gauges
to four gauges.

172
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,378
But anyway, the big
advantage of this set up,

173
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:35,884
is that it is indifferent to
external disturbances,

174
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,980
for example the temperature.

175
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,858
At equilibrium, if the circuit's
ambient temperature increases,

176
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,150
then the bridge stays at equilibrium

177
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,722
because all the resistors will
increase because of the temperature.

178
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,514
And therefore, the equilibrium will be guaranteed.

179
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:55,175
So we have seen a particular
circuit linked to metrology,

180
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:57,766
it is the Wheatstone bridge.

181
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:02,742
We have done the expansion of the
functioning in DC mode

182
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:05,679
but it is also valid for
the alternative mode.

183
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:07,918
We have seen that we could use this bridge
in two different ways

184
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,757
either by searching for the equilibrium

185
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:12,665
either by starting at equilibrium,
and moving away from this equilibrium

186
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:16,890
and calculate the resistance fluctuations .

187
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,059
This circuit has a lot of advantages,

188
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,301
as being indifferent
to the temperature.

189
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:29,349
It is clear now that, there are
many electronic devices

190
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,602
that allow to
measure the resistances,

191
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:34,295
and that make the circuit
a little bit obsolete, 

192
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,990
but the structure of the bridge remains
used in many assemblies,

193
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,546
even in embedded electronics,

194
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,933
when it is not possible
to add another device.
