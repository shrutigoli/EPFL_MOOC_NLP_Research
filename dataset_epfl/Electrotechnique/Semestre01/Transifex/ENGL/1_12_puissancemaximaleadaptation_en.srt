00:00:04,106 --> 00:00:08,146
Hello. Today we will discuss about
the power transmitted by a real voltage

2
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:10,926
supply to a load.

3
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:16,713
First of all, we will define the real
voltage supply and the load.

4
00:00:16,713 --> 00:00:21,013
We will then calculate the power provided
by the supply to the load.

5
00:00:21,537 --> 00:00:25,317
Then, we will calculate the maximal
value of the power

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,777
as function of the value of
the load resistance.

7
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:31,677
We will then define the condition
of adaptation.

8
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:34,997
And finally, we will calculate the
efficiency of the system

9
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:36,717
and we will and with a conclusion.

10
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:42,557
On this sketch, we see on the left part,
the ideal voltage supply

11
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:46,977
and the internal resistance that is both,
the real voltage supply

12
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:50,327
and on the right side,
the load resistance.

13
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:54,757
On this circuit we can define
two values:

14
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:58,237
the current that goes through the circuit,

15
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:00,647
there is just one loop,
there is just one current,

16
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:08,247
and the voltage at the terminals of the load
resistor that we call uR indication L.

17
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:10,927
By Kirchhoff we find very easily,
as long as

18
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:15,277
the two resistors are in series,
the current that goes through the circuit.

19
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:24,811
We have that i is equal to u0
divided by Ri + RL.

20
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:28,886
In terms of the power,
power that is dissipated

21
00:01:28,886 --> 00:01:30,596
in the resistor RL,

22
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,799
we can write that this power is
the product of the voltage drop

23
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,479
at the terminals of the resistor
multiplied by the current,

24
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,559
therefore it is uRL multiplied by the current
and if we replace the voltage drop

25
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:50,909
at the terminals of the resistor
by the resistance times i,

26
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,519
u is equal to Ri, we get that
the power is equal to RL

27
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,039
multiplied by i squared.

28
00:02:00,575 --> 00:02:05,795
By replacing the value of i by the
expression found here above,

29
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:11,255
we finally write that the power in the
load resistor is equal to

30
00:02:11,255 --> 00:02:22,425
(u0^2 * RL)/(RL + Ri)^2

31
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,460
This is the first result.

32
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,789
If we analyse this function,
we see that in two extreme cases,

33
00:02:33,789 --> 00:02:37,789
when the load resistance is zero,

34
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:46,541
then the power in this resistor
is also zero.

35
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:52,513
On the other extreme, if the load
resistance is infinite,

36
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:03,821
we have a power in this load that is equal to
the term RL becoming

37
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:08,101
much bigger than Ri
we can express Ri,

38
00:03:08,101 --> 00:03:21,102
we have (u0^2 * RL)/RL^2,
it is equal to u0^2/RL

39
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:24,052
and it is also equal to zero.

40
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,209
Therefore we see that for two
extreme values the power is zero.

41
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:31,288
And in between, there is
necessarely a maximum,

42
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,248
it is this maximum that we will calculate.

43
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:37,248
Is repeated on this slide
the results obtained earlier.

44
00:03:37,762 --> 00:03:41,282
We have represented the same sketch
and the power dissipated

45
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:44,942
in the load resistor is given
by this equation.

46
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:50,882
To get the maximum of this function
with the load resistor RL

47
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:55,842
as a variable, we just have to
derivate this function

48
00:03:55,842 --> 00:03:58,442
with respect to the variable RL.

49
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:06,264
Therefore the maximum is found when
the derivative of the power

50
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:10,264
with respect to RL is equal to zero.

51
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:15,458
To calculate this derivative, we will
write that this power function

52
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:20,398
is equal to a numerator that
is a function f

53
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:24,398
divided by the denominator of function g

54
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:32,701
f is therefore equal to RL x u0^2,
it is the numerator.

55
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:38,718
The denominator g is equal to (RL + Ri)^2.

56
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:47,718
And to calculate this derivative, we know
that the derivative is equal to

57
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:53,918
(f'g - g'f)/g^2.

58
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:58,061
We now calculate the derivative
of the function f, 

59
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:04,661
that we call f', derivative with respect to RL
that is equal to u0^2,

60
00:05:05,652 --> 00:05:18,612
and the derivative of the denominator g' that is
equal to 2 (RL + Ri).

61
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:24,992
We can therefore replace these functions and
those derivatives in this equation

62
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:30,442
and is obtained for the derivative function
power with respect to

63
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:34,442
the variable RL
that it is equal to...

64
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:46,172
the numerator divided by
the denominator squared

65
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,670
which is equal to (RL + Ri)â‡¥^4.

66
00:05:55,223 --> 00:06:00,013
And we will like to find a zero value of
this derivative

67
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,869
so we just have to say that the numerator
is equal to zero,

68
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,179
that we expand and rewrite here...

69
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:26,718
we can simplify it by writing it
like -RL^2 + Ri^2 = 0

70
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:32,578
and we then find the condition for what we call
power adaptation

71
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:38,318
which means that when RL is equal to Ri.

72
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:46,244
We have now found the power adaptation
condition

73
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:55,614
that is fulfilled when the value of the
load resistor is equal to

74
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:58,024
the value of the internal resistance.

75
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:03,844
In this case, we say that the
load is adapted to the power supply.

76
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,100
Now lets calculate the
efficiency of the system.

77
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,070
The efficiency is determinated by the ratio
between the useful power,

78
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:20,380
which means the power given to the load resistor,

79
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,240
it is here represented by this
little green arrow here,

80
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,240
divided by the total power
given by the power supply.

81
00:07:34,223 --> 00:07:37,583
This total power given by the
power supply is represented here

82
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,113
by the big green arrow.

83
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:44,073
Therefore the useful power in the load
resistor is RL x i^2.

84
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:51,099
And the total power given by the power
supply is the current squared

85
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:59,589
times the sum of two resistors, which
is (RL + Ri) x i^2.

86
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:04,859
We can rewrite this formula in
a simpler way.

87
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:11,189
So the efficiency is given by the
load resistance divided

88
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:13,389
by the sum of the two resistors,

89
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:17,397
load resistor and internal resistance.

90
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:22,760
Let's look what is happening concerning
the adaptation efficiency,

91
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,760
so when the load resistance is equal
to the internal resistance.

92
00:08:36,523 --> 00:08:47,943
We have the  adaptation efficiency that is
equal to RL/(RL + Ri)

93
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:52,143
but these two values being equal,
we simply have

94
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:59,398
that the efficiency is equal to RL/2RL
if we replace Ri by RL which are equal,

95
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:09,798
so we have a 50% efficiency
for Pmax and therefore 50% for the adaptation.

96
00:09:10,232 --> 00:09:14,232
Let's take an example with
numerical values.

97
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:19,949
We recover here our real
voltage supply

98
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,389
with the load resistance,
let's take the case

99
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,049
of an internal resistance that is equal to 9 ohms.

100
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,729
We can calculate the power
as function of RL.

101
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:33,139
We have traced it here, it is the blue curve.

102
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:41,519
We see that the maximum power, here,
is for a value RL,

103
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,979
9 ohms.

104
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:47,929
We also see that for this load resistor
value,

105
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:55,429
the adaptation efficiency is 0.5
therefore 50%.

106
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,970
So on this graph, we can see that the
maximum power

107
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,180
that can be transmitted to the load
resistance RL is not only

108
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,240
depending on RL but it is also very dependent
on the internal resistance.

109
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,900
We can see that there is a limit to the power
given by the voltage supply.

110
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,790
If we take another value with a higher
internal resistance,

111
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,900
therefore a less performant real
voltage supply,

112
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,770
we see that the maximal power decreases
by this equation,

113
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:39,280
but most of all the maximum is now
again at a value

114
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,460
that is equal to the value of the
load resistance

115
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,400
that matches the value of the
internal resistance,

116
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,430
so 12.5 ohms, and again
the efficiency

117
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:54,790
at this value is 50%.

118
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:57,241
If we take a third internal
resistance

119
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:02,441
therefore a real voltage supply
of lower quality

120
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:06,231
with a higher internal resistance, the
maximum power is again

121
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:11,011
smaller but we recover the
same adaptation conditions

122
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,991
for the load resistor at the value 
of the internal resistance

123
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:21,671
and the efficiency is 50%
at the value of the internal resistance.

124
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:28,308
If we consider a battery
to power a car

125
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:33,328
for example, electric,
this battery can be modelled

126
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:37,778
with a first approach by this real
voltage supply

127
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:41,778
with a no-load voltage
and an internal resistance

128
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:45,778
that represents the chemistry of
the battery, the connectivity,

129
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:50,573
the electrodes ...
worse the battery is

130
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:53,943
lower the power thus bigger the internal
resistance is

131
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:57,943
and less power can be transmitted to the
load

132
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,323
  therefore to the electric motor.

133
00:11:59,323 --> 00:12:03,443
We mostly see that we can not transmit an
infinite power

134
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:05,803
but a power that depends on
the internal resistance.

135
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:08,463
In conclusion, we can say two things.

136
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:10,773
First, a real voltage
supply

137
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:15,953
and its load are adapted in power to
one another if the internal resistance

138
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:21,873
of the real supply voltage is equal
to the load resistance.

139
00:12:21,873 --> 00:12:25,873
And secondly, 

140
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,773
The power transmitted by the supply
to the load is maximum

141
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:33,783
and secondly, the adaptation
efficiency is 50%.

142
00:12:33,783 --> 00:12:36,053
We understand it well
because there is as much power

143
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:40,203
that is dissipated in the internal resistance
then in the load resistance

144
00:12:40,203 --> 00:12:41,433
because they are equal

145
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:44,253
Thank you for your attention.
