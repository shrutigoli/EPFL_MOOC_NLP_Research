1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,270
Madam, Sir, good morning and welcome
to this new lecture about powers.

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,255
We will discover during this lecture
that it exist not only one power

3
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:17,242
with only one name, but several
types of powers,

4
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:19,974
starting with the instantaneous power
then we will discover

5
00:00:19,974 --> 00:00:22,944
what are the active, reactive,
apparent,

6
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:25,794
and also the complex apparent powers.

7
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,615
First of all, the instantaneous power. 

8
00:00:27,615 --> 00:00:31,506
We can right what we already know from
a long time ago

9
00:00:31,506 --> 00:00:32,920
about the power.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,970
The power being defined by the product
of the instantaneous values

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,702
of the voltage and the current.

12
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:44,077
We can then write
that this instantaneous power

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,780
product of the current and the voltage,
but in instantaneous values, gives that.

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,580
After small development, 

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,769
we will end up with an equation
or a clearer result

16
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,424
in order to understand what means
this instantaneous power.

17
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:11,912
First of all, a linked part here
not to the time but rather to an angle

18
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:18,730
and then a cosine
whose frequency is twice

19
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:24,089
which gives, for the effective values here
and not anymore peak values

20
00:01:24,089 --> 00:01:26,012
in order to simplify the writing ...

21
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:32,678
So, to simplify here,

22
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:36,401
I note that phi, as we've 
already seen previously,

23
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:39,026
it is the difference of angle between 
the voltage's angle

24
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:41,180
and the current's angle.

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,779
This instantaneous power function

26
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:46,744
has a constant component 
 UIcos φ,

27
00:01:46,744 --> 00:01:48,974
as you see, it doesn't depend on time,

28
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,858
and a sinusoidal component

29
00:01:50,858 --> 00:01:55,665
of amplitude  UI and of a double frequency.

30
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,593
What's interesting to do now,

31
00:01:57,593 --> 00:01:59,946
it is to draw the graph
of this function

32
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:03,669
in order to better understand
what's happening in terms of exchange.

33
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,710
First of all, we've represented here,
high above,

34
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,140
the graph of the voltage U(t),
instantaneous voltage,

35
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:14,201
then, the current graph
as a function of time I(t).

36
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:16,657
And finally, that instantaneous power

37
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:18,784
we've just computed.

38
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:23,740
We remark here, the dotted line

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,667
that corresponds to UIcos φ,

40
00:02:27,667 --> 00:02:30,460
it's that constant
that we've talked about before,

41
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,140
that we've found in the equation
of the instantaneous power.

42
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,540
And around this constant,

43
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:40,009
an added a cosine
at the double frequency.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,093
We therefore see that, from time to time,

45
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:45,738
we have a exchange of positive power

46
00:02:45,738 --> 00:02:47,495
even, here in this graph,

47
00:02:47,495 --> 00:02:49,511
an exchange of negative power,

48
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:54,411
but, in average, 
we have this exchange here: UIcos φ.

49
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:55,740
It is now interesting,

50
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,513
to develop what w
have previously written

51
00:02:58,518 --> 00:03:00,177
to write it a bit differently.

52
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:02,470
We will bring out

53
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,080
two fundamental components

54
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,496
of the instantaneous power

55
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:07,365
under sinusoidal steady state.

56
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,977
First, we put:

57
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:15,710
the angle beta which is equal
to alpha minus phi

58
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,612
and we also put
the following trigonometric identity:

59
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:29,409
cos (2ωt + 2α - φ)
It is equal to :

60
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:42,914
cos φ cos (2ωt + 2α)
+ sin φ sin (2ωt + 2α).

61
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:44,280
It looks more complicated,

62
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,150
it even complicates the equation
that we have seen before,

63
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,364
but if we replace this identity

64
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,760
in the pulsating part

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,492
of the instantaneous power

66
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:56,916
that we have previously written,

67
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,690
we end up with the following result:

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,361
this instantaneous power that will be equal to

69
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:05,820
to UIcos φ that multiplies

70
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:23,861
[1 + cos (2ωt + 2α)]
+ UIsin φ sin (2ωt + 2α).

71
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,766
So, here we will see something very
interesting in these two components,

72
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:29,746
the first one, that corresponds

73
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:31,310
to the first term of the second member,

74
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,555
is a component
pulsed always positive, 

75
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:37,504
it's:
cos (2ωt + 2α)

76
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,424
always positive,

77
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:42,603
hovering around the 
average value  φ UIcos.

78
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,698
It translates an exchange
of a unidirectional energy

79
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:48,433
between a supply and a load.

80
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:52,243
Then, the second part corresponds

81
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,359
to the second term of the second member,

82
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,257
and it is an alternative component 

83
00:04:56,257 --> 00:05:02,988
that varies sinusoidaly
with the amplitude UIsin φ

84
00:05:02,988 --> 00:05:05,335
and then, the average value
is always equal to zero.

85
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:06,899
It is then alternatively 

86
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,104
positive and negative,

87
00:05:08,104 --> 00:05:12,789
and it shows here,
an oscillatory and reversible energy exchange

88
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,900
between the supply and the load.

89
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,599
So, we can already observe something,

90
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:22,014
when phi is equal to zero,

91
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,782
namely, a load purely resistive,

92
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,200
the cosine of phi here will be equal to 1,

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,959
the sine of phi here will be equal to 0,

94
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,240
the average value UIcos φ

95
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,695
is therefore maximal and is equal to U time I

96
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:38,888
whereas the second part,
as we've already said before, will be null.

97
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:41,941
On the contrary, there is another extreme,

98
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,541
when phi is equal to π/2 or -π/2,

99
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,827
then the load is purely reactive,

100
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,597
an inductance or a capacitance,

101
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:51,654
so in this case, it is this power

102
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:56,240
which will be maximum because
sin φ will be equal to 1 or -1

103
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,826
whereas the  UIcos φ will be equal to 0

104
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:01,350
and this part becomes zero.

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,181
We will then define here
this first part

106
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:10,760
as being an active power

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,408
and this second part.
reactive power.

108
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,370
This active power indicates

109
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,947
an energy transformation.

110
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:28,355
This energy will be transformed,
will be used,

111
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:32,291
whereas the reactive power
is an energy exchange

112
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,051
between the supply and the load

113
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,941
but without transformation.

114
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:37,792
It is the fundamental
part of our course

115
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:39,792
that we will see
during all that lecture

116
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,953
and we start 

117
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,400
by defining now
one after the other,

118
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,783
that active power
and that reactive power.

119
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,400
But before that, and to
better understand,

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,083
I would like to show you now
a movie that will allow you

121
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,494
to visualize that exchange of energy

122
00:06:55,494 --> 00:06:59,280
either active or reactive
or both at the same time

123
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,063
when in the presence

124
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:05,449
a load of both resistive 
and reactive

125
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:07,316
As you may seen in this graph

126
00:07:07,316 --> 00:07:10,075
we have drawing here the total power,

127
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,830
with the reactive and active terms

128
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,515
and you see actually in the top middle,

129
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,837
in the imaginary plane,

130
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:21,595
the vector of the impedance Z.

131
00:07:22,455 --> 00:07:24,997
We see that impedance Z that changes.

132
00:07:24,997 --> 00:07:28,653
Now, that impedance
is purely reactive.

133
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:33,877
We then see that the reactive term
in dotted purple lines, is maximum

134
00:07:33,877 --> 00:07:36,033
whereas the active term is null.

135
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:39,114
We will see when that impedance
varies again

136
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:42,051
the change of this power,

137
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:43,566
with once again a passage

138
00:07:43,566 --> 00:07:45,753
with an impedance purely reactive,

139
00:07:45,753 --> 00:07:49,151
at that moment, the active term is complete 

140
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,742
and the total power is equal to the active term.

141
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:54,948
And here again a change arriving 

142
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,985
to a capacitance, because Z has now

143
00:07:56,985 --> 00:08:00,949
an angle of -π/2 (capacitor)

144
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,006
and you have again

145
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,349
the reactive power
that completely dominates

146
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:07,291
and the active term which is null.

147
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:11,302
Here again a change,

148
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:15,522
in other to well understand
that energy exchange 

149
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:18,151
between the supply and the load.

150
00:08:18,151 --> 00:08:20,280
And as I mentioned previously,

151
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,152
either that exchange is purely alternative
in supply and load,

152
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:29,400
or we have then
an energy transformation.

153
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,948
We define now
the active power.

154
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,018
As we have seen before,

155
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:37,275
this active power is the mean
value of the instantaneous power,

156
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:43,160
this is the definition
of the active power,

157
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:51,727
the mean of the instantaneous
power p(t).

158
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:55,285
We can then write that
this average of p(t),

159
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,301
which is written as p(t) with a bar,

160
00:08:58,301 --> 00:09:00,005
which is equal to capital P,

161
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:04,203
we will define this as a variable now,

162
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:07,673
P will mean the active power,

163
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,127
or the mean value
of the instantaneous power,

164
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:12,943
and by definition, the mean value

165
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:17,696
is the integral from 0 to T
of the function p(t)dt

166
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:20,040
and this mean value

167
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,935
if we reconsider the equations
previously written,

168
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:26,320
it is only the part 
that does not vary with time

169
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,053
that to say UIcos φ.

170
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:32,905
So, to be very clear,

171
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,430
we can maybe already 
do three small cases.

172
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,951
If we take the case of the resistor.

173
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:44,371
A resistor has an angle
of the impedance which is null

174
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:47,801
and that will make this active power equals,

175
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:51,547
for only a single resistor,
to U times I.

176
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:55,978
For the case of the impedance.

177
00:09:55,978 --> 00:10:00,431
The inductance has an angle
equals to π/2,

178
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:03,635
which leads us
to an active power = 0.

179
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,741
The cosine of π/2 will be equal to 0,

180
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:10,415
So here we have an active power which is null.

181
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,409
And for the capacitance, the angle is equal to -π/2

182
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:18,791
and the active power
is still equal to 0.

183
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,862
The active power, measurable
 by a power meter,

184
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,067
corresponds to a real supply

185
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:25,626
of convertible work 
or heat energy.

186
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,276
And, we can see it here,

187
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,331
this is possible only
with a resistor.

188
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,174
The two other elements,
inductance and capacitance,

189
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:37,611
can't transform that energy,
convert it

190
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:39,298
to work or heat

191
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,347
and, as mentioned before,

192
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:44,373
the active power is maximum

193
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:46,394
in case of load purely resistive,

194
00:10:46,394 --> 00:10:49,732
this is what we see
in this small table.

195
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,106
We can then define now

196
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:52,493
a reactie power.

197
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,499
Definition:

198
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:58,306
This reactive power,

199
00:10:58,306 --> 00:10:59,544
you have seen it before,

200
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:02,523
there is an exchange 
of energy.

201
00:11:02,523 --> 00:11:05,051
With the active power we notice that,

202
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:06,971
when we try to compute

203
00:11:06,971 --> 00:11:09,960
the active power of an inductance
or a capacitance, 

204
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,440
we end up with a result null

205
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,127
and yet we know that 
there is an exchange of energy.

206
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,760
We have seen it in the equation,

207
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,449
where we clearly see these two different terms.

208
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:25,433
this exchange is described being 

209
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:29,059
oscillating around a value UIsin φ.

210
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,120
We will define
this reactive power.

211
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,480
We will choose the symbol or the letter Q

212
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,537
as UIsin φ

213
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:44,895
that corresponds to this alternative
exchange of energy.

214
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:46,931
So, so that there is
no confusion,

215
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:52,704
we will give to it an other variable

216
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:57,542
than the active power,
written in Watt,

217
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,957
and this reactive power
will be written as var

218
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:05,853
for Volt Ampere Reactive.

219
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:10,845
Therefore, the reactive power P,

220
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:15,895
which is equal to UIcos φ, is measured in Watts

221
00:12:15,895 --> 00:12:23,072
and the reactive power defined here,

222
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:26,871
is measured in Volt Ampere Reactive

223
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,583
in order to avoid any confusion.

224
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,470
It's actually here,
for the reactive power,

225
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,535
a fictive power.

226
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,729
It doesn't respond to a 
real physical definition

227
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:38,510
but it allows us to characterise

228
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,492
that nonconvertible exchange of energy

229
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,009
that appears in the case 
of a reactive load:

230
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:46,663
Inductance or capacitance.

231
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:49,187
Although this exchange corresponds 
to a zero balance

232
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:52,345
after an integer number of periods, 
it must nevertheless take account

233
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,185
 the circulation of this energy

234
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:57,080
in particular on 
a distribution network.

235
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,772
If you have here a pylon with wires

236
00:13:03,772 --> 00:13:08,180
from one load to another,

237
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,285
the energy that flows here,

238
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:13,475
we have a current i,
a voltage between the wires,

239
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:17,823
even though this current is going back and forth

240
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:19,074
as function of time,

241
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,716
fifty times per second,

242
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:23,875
and even if finally this balance is zero,

243
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,606
we will have losses on the line

244
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:29,079
and these losses have an 
overall impact on the network.

245
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,042
So it is necessary to 
characterize this exchange

246
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:36,031
by this so-called reactive power.

247
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:39,113
We will again define
a third power.

248
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,200
If we consider the two first

249
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,329
were reactive and active,
the third one is called apparent power.

250
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:49,135
It corresponds to 

251
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:52,489
the product of the effective values 
of the voltage and the current.

252
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:55,109
It is expressed conventionally,

253
00:13:55,109 --> 00:13:57,378
to distinguish it,
in yet another unit

254
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,309
as we saw earlier

255
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,535
which are the Volt Ampere.

256
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,927
This product has the dimension of a power

257
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:04,810
but it does not necessarily
 provide a work

258
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,849
hence the name of apparent power .

259
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:10,897
By definition, this power

260
00:14:10,897 --> 00:14:13,812
which will take the S symbol,

261
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:16,491
is the product of U times I.

262
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:18,600
As now said,

263
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,122
we will note it in Volt Ampere.

264
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:23,930
Is the amplitude of the fluctuations 
of the instantaneous power

265
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,499
compared to its average value

266
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,308
so called apparent power.

267
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:34,264
This variable is finally linked

268
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:38,880
to the two powers that 
we have seen before:

269
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,607
the reactive and the active power,

270
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:50,619
because if I remind you that 
P is equal to UIcos φ,

271
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:54,752
that Q is equal to UIsin φ

272
00:14:54,752 --> 00:14:57,542
then it seems almost obvious here,

273
00:14:57,542 --> 00:15:00,458
when we know
the trigonometry calculations,

274
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:07,639
that S is equal to P² + Q².

275
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,166
Then the apparent powers,

276
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,161
corresponding to a module,

277
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,680
can not be 
added algebraically

278
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,618
because of this.

279
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,721
Contrariwise, one of the properties

280
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,477
is that if one is looking

281
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:23,974
at the total power in a circuit,

282
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:26,160
the total power in a circuit

283
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,043
is the sum of individual P

284
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:35,321
and the individual is from 0 to k, the number of 
items that we have in the circuit.

285
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:36,621
We can do the same

286
00:15:36,621 --> 00:15:39,858
for the total reactive power,

287
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:44,636
it is the sum of i from 0 to k
of individual Q.

288
00:15:44,636 --> 00:15:46,171
This is a very good way,

289
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:48,517
that will be seen in another lesson,

290
00:15:48,517 --> 00:15:50,801
we can use this property

291
00:15:50,801 --> 00:15:52,700
to solve the problems.

292
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,533
On the other side, beware the total S

293
00:15:56,533 --> 00:16:03,298
is not equal to the algebraic
sum from 0 to k of Si.

294
00:16:03,298 --> 00:16:06,044
We can only do that 
on the active and reactive power

295
00:16:06,044 --> 00:16:07,840
but not on the apparent power

296
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,323
because of this relation
that you have here

297
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:13,024
and making things non-linear 

298
00:16:13,024 --> 00:16:14,878
and therefore impossible to solve.

299
00:16:14,878 --> 00:16:18,898
To finally allow the possibility

300
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:22,681
of having the sum of these powers

301
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,183
corresponds to the sum 
of the different elements,

302
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:28,802
a new power is invented,

303
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,382
 another new power 

304
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:33,122
called complex 
apparent power.

305
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:36,993
It is a pure conceptual product

306
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:40,338
to mathematically finally allow

307
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:44,845
to do the sum, 
this time a vector sum,

308
00:16:44,845 --> 00:16:46,475
of the different apparent
powers of the elements

309
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:50,280
correspond to the total complex apparent
power of the circuit.

310
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:54,129
We will therefore define

311
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:55,788
this complex apparent power

312
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,543
as being always S,

313
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,863
but now it is vectorial,
it is underlined,

314
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:07,791
P + jQ or Se(jφ)

315
00:17:07,791 --> 00:17:08,994
Once again,

316
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:10,422
it is purely conceptual.

317
00:17:10,422 --> 00:17:12,840
Here you have in the imaginary plane

318
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,794
written the vector S with 
its purely real component P,

319
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:21,091
its purely complex component Q.

320
00:17:21,091 --> 00:17:22,412
It brings together

321
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:25,440
the various powers 
previously defined

322
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,141
by making its real part the active power

323
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:30,211
and its imaginary part the reactive power.

324
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:32,800
Here, the property is that

325
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,160
this total underlined S, but this is vectorial,

326
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,524
this time is equal to the sum,

327
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,030
 but this time vector sum,

328
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,120
of the different apparent powers.

329
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,251
It is interesting to see again

330
00:17:47,251 --> 00:17:51,130
some properties of
the complex apparent power.

331
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:56,920
In fact, if we define
the complex conjugate of the current

332
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,392
as being this current

333
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:04,702
with a negative angle relative 
to the normal current,

334
00:18:04,702 --> 00:18:10,185
we can say that

335
00:18:10,185 --> 00:18:16,942
the complex apparent power it is
U times I complex conjugate.

336
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:18,680
We will demonstrate here.

337
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,747
We take an impedance Z

338
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:24,388
which is equal to R + jX.

339
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:27,559
We will replace in this expression,

340
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,342
the expression written here:

341
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,133
U times I conjugate complex,

342
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:37,695
replacing U with the equation
of the law of Ohm Z times I.

343
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,795
This becomes S underlined,

344
00:18:41,795 --> 00:18:46,128
we replace U with Z.I

345
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:49,983
that further multiplies the 
complex conjugate I.

346
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,986
One of the well-known relations

347
00:18:51,986 --> 00:18:55,813
is that a vector multiplied by
its complex conjugate 

348
00:18:55,813 --> 00:18:58,048
becomes purely real,

349
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:01,633
we have then here Z underlined that multiplies I²

350
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:06,082
but which is not a vector anymore,

351
00:19:06,082 --> 00:19:07,382
it is just I².

352
00:19:07,382 --> 00:19:08,540
And if we write it  ZI² and we develop it

353
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:15,822
it becomes obvious that we have RI² + jXI²

354
00:19:17,432 --> 00:19:19,360
What have we just discovered?

355
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,210
We've just discovered here

356
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,187
the active power,

357
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,350
that corresponds to the Joule losses,

358
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,966
and here the reactive power,

359
00:19:34,446 --> 00:19:36,463
that corresponds to the exchange of energy 

360
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,992
related to the reactance X

361
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:42,800
which may be here a capacitance
or an inductance.

362
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,112
We can then write and summarize that P,

363
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:50,347
which is equal to UIcos φ,

364
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:53,920
is also equal to RI²

365
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,910
and that the reactive Q,
which is equal to UIsin φ,

366
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,371
is also equal to XI²,

367
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,840
another way to compute

368
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,196
the active power
or the reactive power

369
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:11,516
if we know for instance
the impedance value and,

370
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,073
even better, the current value.

371
00:20:14,073 --> 00:20:18,483
I come to the synthesis of our lesson

372
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:23,000
where I summarized here, 
on this graphic or rather on this table,

373
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,227
the active power, the reactive 
power and the apparent power

374
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:31,140
for a purely inductive,
 capacitive or resistive load.

375
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,554
We summarize and we note that,

376
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,894
for a single resistor,

377
00:20:35,894 --> 00:20:40,749
the active power,
as it is equal to UIcos φ,

378
00:20:40,749 --> 00:20:43,555
will be equal to UI.

379
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,694
On the other side, as we have already seen,

380
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:50,188
the reactive power UIsin φ,

381
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:54,200
if sin φ is equal to 0, this is null

382
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,194
and the apparent power
is always equal to UI.

383
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,177
Then, the inductance.

384
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:04,028
The inductance, as we have seen
for the active power,

385
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,437
the angle of this impedance is equal to π/2,

386
00:21:07,437 --> 00:21:08,890
we have here an active power null

387
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,571
whereas the reactive power
is equal to UI,

388
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,520
and the apparent power
doesn't depend on the angle

389
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,815
so it is always UI.

390
00:21:17,815 --> 00:21:21,288
And finally for the capacitance where
the angle is equal to -π/2,

391
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,420
the active power is alway null,

392
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,445
the reactive power is negative -UI,

393
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:30,160
and finally the apparent power is equal to UI.

394
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,192
We first remark here

395
00:21:32,192 --> 00:21:35,690
for those who discover
the active and reactive powers,

396
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,067
and especially those who are used to
the active power

397
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:39,352
which is always strictly positive,

398
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:40,652
they are Watts,

399
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:43,592
we can only see 10, 100, 100 Watts
but not negative.

400
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:46,185
The reactive power,
cant be negative.

401
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,460
It will characterize the load

402
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,588
and its reactive value,

403
00:21:50,588 --> 00:21:52,742
either inductance or capacitive

404
00:21:52,742 --> 00:21:54,467
depending on the plus or the minus.

405
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,217
the apparent power is
always positive.

406
00:21:57,217 --> 00:22:03,010
We notice then
that we have two elements:

407
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,616
the inductance and  the capacitance,

408
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,521
whose power is not convertible,

409
00:22:08,521 --> 00:22:10,799
or the energy is not convertible.

410
00:22:13,718 --> 00:22:16,322
As we see,
the active power being null,

411
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:19,068
this inductance
and this capacitance can only create

412
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,467
 energy exchanges

413
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,699
of power exchanges
in the circuit.

414
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:29,077
Only the resistance allows 
this energy transformation

415
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:31,893
into work or heat.

416
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,978
That's it, as you have discovered
during this lesson,

417
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:37,711
we have seen a multitude 
of different powers:

418
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,959
the instantaneous power

419
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:41,970
which then is characterized

420
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,476
by active, reactive, apparent
and complex apparent powers.

421
00:22:46,476 --> 00:22:48,892
Only the active power represent

422
00:22:48,892 --> 00:22:52,166
a power or a convertible energy

423
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,850
and the reactive power,

424
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,480
corresponds to an energy exchange 

425
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,934
between the supply and the load.
