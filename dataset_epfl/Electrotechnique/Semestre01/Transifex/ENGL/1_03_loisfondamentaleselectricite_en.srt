00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:07,618
Hello and welcome to this third
lesson of Electrotechnics 1

2
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:11,038
dedicated to the fundamental
laws of electricity.

3
00:00:11,038 --> 00:00:15,038
After an introduction, we will see
what are electric charges

4
00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:18,438
and electric potentials, 
followed by the capacitor,

5
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:21,778
the electric current, the
associated Joule losses,

6
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:26,248
we will discover Ohm's law,
Kirchhoff's laws and finally,

7
00:00:26,258 --> 00:00:30,428
the inductance which will conclude
this chapter on the fundamental laws

8
00:00:30,428 --> 00:00:32,228
along with a small conclusion.

9
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:36,228
The electrostatic charge is a
quantity of static electricity,

10
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:41,328
The representative symbol,
It's the letter Q

11
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:45,198
the unit of measurement is the
coulomb, whose symbol is C,

12
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:53,328
So we have one coulomb is equal
to one ampere second and this,

13
00:00:53,328 --> 00:00:58,848
the letter Q, is
the electrostatic charge.

14
00:01:00,523 --> 00:01:02,662
We can also
define a very

15
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,021
important element in
the laws of electricity,

16
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:08,771
it's the difference of
electric potential.

17
00:01:10,399 --> 00:01:16,149
We will write here the difference of
potential between two points Va and Vb

18
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,796
that we imagine in a system like this,

19
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:27,873
bathed in a uniform electric field,

20
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:37,160
that we write like this, and
we have our electric field here

21
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,650
and our conductor, A and B bathed
in this uniform electric field.

22
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:54,320
We also define a
distance vector ds

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,990
here on this conductor
between A and B.

24
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,330
We can then write, I'll continue here,

25
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,480
the difference of potential
Va - Vb, as being 

26
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:12,950
the circulation of the electric field
along the edge linking A to B

27
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,440
which becomes the integration from 
B to A of this electric field

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,403
by this element of distance ds

29
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:26,848
or also, by reversing from A to B,

30
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,753
the minus sign disapears 

31
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:36,700
and by definition this is the
difference of potential between A and B

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,200
that we also call voltage.

33
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:45,992
it is this voltage that will
keep us busy all along 

34
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:50,272
these Electrotechnics 1 and 2 MOOCs,

35
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:53,522
and we will progressively start 
saying only voltage

36
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:56,512
and by extension, no longer
the difference in potential.

37
00:02:56,512 --> 00:03:00,172
The condenser is a very important
element in electrical engineering,

38
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:04,602
one of the three passive elements that
we will study all along this MOOC.

39
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:11,495
Its symbol is represented
by two vertical plates

40
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:16,495
upon which will in fact
accumulate, electric charges

41
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:23,059
that will characterize the
properties of the capacitor.

42
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:30,529
We can say that this property
of the capacitor, also known as capacitance,

43
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:38,288
this capacitance C
is defined as 

44
00:03:38,288 --> 00:03:43,414
the number of accumulated charges
between the plates of the capacitor,

45
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,152
these plus and minus that
are in front of each other,

46
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:51,312
divided by the voltage between A and B,

47
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:57,272
we will thus also define here
an A and B potential.

48
00:03:57,272 --> 00:04:00,965
The symbol, the unit of the capacitance

49
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:05,278
is the farad, written F,

50
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:07,936
and one farad is worth

51
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:13,194
one ampere second per volt

52
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:17,152
in the units of the MKSA
international system.

53
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:20,582
We can now go one step further
and define the relationship

54
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:24,258
between voltage and current
for this capacitor

55
00:04:24,258 --> 00:04:26,234
which will be very
useful later on,

56
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:30,052
we've seen with Ohm's law,
we will see it for the inductor,

57
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:34,542
we need this relationship 
between voltage and current

58
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,832
to later on solve
electric circuits.

59
00:04:38,832 --> 00:04:42,512
We've already seen the electric charge,
this electric charge

60
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:47,512
we know, is an accumulation of
charges, in other words

61
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:50,692
it's the integration of
the current over time,

62
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:56,975
since current is in fact this
progression of charges in a circuit,

63
00:04:56,975 --> 00:05:00,918
we can define here, by substitution,

64
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:05,292
the voltage which is equal to
1/C

65
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:07,222
integral of of idt,

66
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,932
by replacing with the
equation seen here.

67
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:16,652
Or,  also write that the
current is the capacitance

68
00:05:16,652 --> 00:05:20,112
times the variation of the voltage,
one or the other.

69
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,942
As we can see here
the relationship is nonlinear

70
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:26,762
and the voltage in a
capacitor is proportional 

71
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:30,492
to the integral of the
current over time.

72
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:35,172
Let us now see the electric current
and the associated Joule losses.

73
00:05:35,172 --> 00:05:38,854
The electric current, as we've
briefly mentioned it previously,

74
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:44,724
is an element that enables the quantification
of the number of electrons or charges

75
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:47,755
that or moving or flowing
through a conductor,

76
00:05:47,755 --> 00:05:50,018
that we will write using the letter I,

77
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:55,261
here, an I
that I'm purposefully writing in upper-case,

78
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:58,415
dQ over dt,

79
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:11,119
in other words, it's the variation
of charges over a unit of time

80
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:15,255
that defines the electric current.

81
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,689
Perhaps one more very
important thing to mention

82
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,345
this electric current will be written,

83
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:25,451
or the symbol of current ;

84
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,265
this unit of current
is the ampere,

85
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,519
that is written as A, in upper-case.

86
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:39,465
We can also define by the letter J
the current density

87
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:44,981
as being this electric
current over an area,

88
00:06:44,981 --> 00:06:49,277
so we have here the area

89
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:55,339
of the conductor through which
this current is flowing,

90
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,511
here we have the current
we've just defined

91
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:05,265
and here,
by definition,

92
00:07:05,265 --> 00:07:09,241
we have the current density

93
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:15,717
whose unit is then
ampere per meter square.

94
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:20,435
This notation of current density
will be very useful for us later on

95
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:25,195
to also define from the point of view
of power, what we are permitted or not

96
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,665
in a system defined by
the cross-section of the conductor. 

97
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:33,305
We can finally define the Joule
losses associated to a current

98
00:07:33,305 --> 00:07:36,425
that is flowing through a resistor

99
00:07:36,715 --> 00:07:41,785
and that will transform this 
electric energy into thermal energy.

100
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:44,925
A phenomena analogous
to friction is occurring

101
00:07:44,925 --> 00:07:46,835
which creates a heating.

102
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:50,835
The losses that result from it are
called Joule losses, or heating losses.

103
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:56,060
And these Joule losses, written P,

104
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,026
are equal to the resistance

105
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:04,494
multiplied by the current
flowing through, squared.

106
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:07,824
Thermal energy

107
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:14,384
which is dissipated by this power can be
characterized in the following manner :

108
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:19,177
we have the thermal energy
which is the integral over time

109
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:23,470
of this power : integral (RIÂ²dt)

110
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,084
Here is the definition of Ohm's
law, certainly very well known

111
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:33,414
to a few amongst you, but it is
always good to be reminded

112
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:38,764
in the basis of this law and also
later on in Kirchhoff's laws

113
00:08:38,764 --> 00:08:43,394
that will follow and which will allow
us to apply the conventions

114
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:46,404
seen during the
second lesson.

115
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:50,285
By definition, Ohm's law is so :

116
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:54,068
We have a voltage between
two terminals A and B

117
00:08:55,768 --> 00:09:00,992
that is equal to this resistor
between terminals A and B

118
00:09:00,992 --> 00:09:03,642
and the current flowing through.

119
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:08,938
In other words, the resistance R AB

120
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:13,194
is the relationship between
the voltage and the current,

121
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:16,432
thus we have a linear
relationship for the resistance

122
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,282
which will be 
very pleasant

123
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:22,842
for all the next steps in 
electrotechnic theory, this resistor,

124
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:28,752
or instead everything that flows
through the resistance and comes out

125
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:33,972
as the same image, in other words, whatever 
may be the voltage at the entrance,

126
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,732
we will have this same
image on the current

127
00:09:37,732 --> 00:09:40,402
which flows through this same resistor.

128
00:09:40,402 --> 00:09:44,042
I arrive now at the definition of 
meshes (or loops) and nodes (or junctions),

129
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:48,612
in general so as to later on
apply Kirchhoff's laws.

130
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:55,601
We will thus define here what
are meshes and nodes

131
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:57,594
and to do so,

132
00:09:57,594 --> 00:10:01,668
we will take an example which
will enable us to properly understand

133
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:05,668
what a node, a mesh and
also a branch is.

134
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:10,958
So let's take an example in which
we have different elements,

135
00:10:11,588 --> 00:10:14,118
that we haven't necessarily
completely seen yet

136
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:16,074
but which will allow
us, especially here

137
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:21,340
to define these meshes
and nodes problems.

138
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,916
So here is a first element,
I'm putting several random elements

139
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:35,396
to define here a circuit.

140
00:10:35,396 --> 00:10:38,136
So we have here a
random circuit,

141
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:42,676
we will first try to define
what are nodes, or junctions.

142
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:46,586
Well, nodes, which we will write n

143
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:56,566
a node is the point of convergence of
three or more conductors.

144
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:02,932
So, where are the nodes
in my circuit ?

145
00:11:02,932 --> 00:11:08,078
We've said three conductors
or more, so our first node is here,

146
00:11:08,698 --> 00:11:14,788
the second one here and
the third node is here.

147
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:19,928
This is not node,
this is not a node,

148
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:21,938
there are no other nodes
in this circuit.

149
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:27,608
Second definition : a branch,
which we will write as b.

150
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:32,098
A branch includes the elements
located between 2 nodes

151
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:34,958
and through which the same current flows.

152
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:40,278
So it's the elements located

153
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:46,010
between 2 nodes

154
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,242
through which the same current flows.

155
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:58,364
So let us try here as well
to indicate where our branches are.

156
00:11:58,364 --> 00:12:04,094
So between two nodes we have here
a branch, we have here a branch,

157
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:08,484
here a branch, and also here, and finally here.

158
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:16,515
Last element : the mesh, or loop,
which we will write as m.

159
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:20,111
It is formed by
several branches,

160
00:12:21,731 --> 00:12:26,307
branches through which we go 
through from one node and loop back to it 

161
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:35,466
By starting from a node to go back to it.

162
00:12:35,906 --> 00:12:39,146
Naturally, without passing twice
through the same branch.

163
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:47,146
So we can define here a first
mesh m,

164
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:52,772
we define here a second mesh m,

165
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:56,188
a third mesh m

166
00:12:56,918 --> 00:13:03,726
and eventually we can go from this,
come back here and make the entire loop,

167
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:08,636
so we would still have one big 
mesh m, that I will write here.

168
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:11,856
Here is by definition the node,
the branch and the meshes

169
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:17,916
which will allow us to tackle
as we've mentioned, Kirchhoff's law.

170
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:25,166
So, first of all, Kirchhoff's nodal rule.

171
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,305
The expression of this rule, or law,
is quite simple, universal

172
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:33,161
and absolutely fantastic ;

173
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:38,869
it says that the sum of
the currents at every node

174
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:43,169
is equal to zero.

175
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:45,219
An example.

176
00:13:45,219 --> 00:13:51,139
We take here various currents
that all converge on a node,

177
00:13:51,139 --> 00:14:05,269
So we will write here I1,
we will write I2, I3, I4, and finally I5.

178
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:12,067
What Kirchhoff tells us, is that
if we look at the sum of all

179
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,507
these currents at this point
it must be equal to zero.

180
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:24,607
so we write, first of all we have
I1 + I2 - I3, which exits the node,

181
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:30,947
+I4 and -I5 equal to zero.

182
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:36,017
Absolutely fantastic and which allows
us to systematically know that

183
00:14:36,017 --> 00:14:40,687
in every node, everything that goes in 
is equal to everything that comes out,

184
00:14:40,687 --> 00:14:44,247
and thus, allows us to write
this kind of relationship.

185
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:48,857
We can, more generally speaking,
I will draw you another diagram ;

186
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:52,360
let's imagine a diagram in which

187
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:59,293
you have this kind of circuit

188
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,993
with an I1 here,

189
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:08,803
an I2 here and an I3 here,

190
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:15,333
but with an I5, I6,

191
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,523
and here an I4,

192
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:24,055
of course, we a first node, a second
node, a third node

193
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,575
on which we can write
many relationships

194
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,535
as I've written them earlier ;

195
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:32,011
but what we can notice is that
we can imagine here

196
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:35,487
this like a generalized node

197
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:38,855
and we will be able to write
in the relationship

198
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:45,045
that I1 - I2 - I3 is equal to zero

199
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,295
without worrying about what is
inside this green circle.

200
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:50,915
We call this a generalized node.

201
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:55,075
We will now see Kirchhoff's
second law, or rule,

202
00:15:55,075 --> 00:15:57,735
which is Kirchhoff's mesh rule.

203
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,798
What does this rule say ?

204
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:08,368
It tells us that here as well
the sum of voltages in a mesh

205
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,648
are always equal to zero.

206
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:18,948
In other words, a sum of voltages
on the mesh is always equal to zero.

207
00:16:18,948 --> 00:16:22,908
So we can here also make an example

208
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:27,748
by taking here a voltage U5,

209
00:16:28,718 --> 00:16:34,521
a voltage U1 at the
terminals of the resistor here,

210
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:39,984
and a voltage U2 at the
terminals of a capacitor,

211
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:43,575
so I imagine here
a random circuit,

212
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,726
a voltage U3 on a supply

213
00:16:46,196 --> 00:16:50,408
and also an element
with a voltage U4

214
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:55,778
finally, on this inductor.

215
00:16:55,778 --> 00:17:01,358
Well, through Kirchhoff, since I
have here a mesh

216
00:17:02,898 --> 00:17:06,938
going from this point
and returning to this other point,

217
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,208
In my case, I systematically
choose

218
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:14,358
the clockwise direction
to always make my mesh calculations

219
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,094
in the same direction,

220
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:19,960
all that is needed is to define once
and for all a direction for each of us,

221
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,908
we then arrive at the following equation :

222
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:33,138
U1 + U2 - U3 - U4 + U5 = 0

223
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:35,418
and you can see that using
extremely simple methods,

224
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:39,018
we can write equations either
on nodes or on meshes,

225
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:42,368
which allow us to solve a
certain number of things in

226
00:17:42,368 --> 00:17:47,498
an electric circuit in an already
very simplistic and very evident way.

227
00:17:47,498 --> 00:17:51,498
To finish this lesson,
we will talk about the inductor

228
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:56,688
or the manner in which we write and model
an inductor and its physical relationship.

229
00:17:56,688 --> 00:18:05,868
The inductor is symbolized in
electrical engineering by a filled-in square

230
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:11,078
or sometimes also as a kind
of spring like this

231
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:15,968
since the reality of an inductor
is in fact a coil or

232
00:18:15,968 --> 00:18:20,518
or a grouping of copper wire coils
within which will happen a certain

233
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:24,538
number of magnetic phenomena which
we will go into detail for now

234
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:29,528
but that very clearly link
the electric world

235
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:31,988
with the magnetic world.

236
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:40,738
We can, by definition, say that the
voltage at an inductor's terminals UL

237
00:18:40,738 --> 00:18:51,088
is this definition of the inductance L
times the derivative or variation

238
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:57,568
of the current over time
flowing through this inductance.

239
00:18:57,568 --> 00:19:02,098
In effect, the inductance acts
like a brake to the current,

240
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:07,238
or to any current variations,
it will thus create a difference of 

241
00:19:07,238 --> 00:19:12,828
potential at its terminals the higher
the variation of the current is big.

242
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:18,378
The inductance is written in,
or the unit of the inductance,

243
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:22,378
in henry, symbolized by the letter H.

244
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:25,008
This concludes our lesson,
we have thus seen the different

245
00:19:25,008 --> 00:19:31,728
basic elements that in the end
constitute our different elements

246
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:34,828
in our study of electrotechnics,
in other words the resistor, the capacitance,

247
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:38,828
the inductor, the supplies, and the way
that they will interact with each other,

248
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:41,034
the physical aspects of every element,

249
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,460
the nodal rule and the mesh rule
in Kirchhoff's laws

250
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,514
which will allow us to
solve electric circuits

251
00:19:48,514 --> 00:19:51,500
and finally, an application
of the conventions

252
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,318
already seen in previous lessons.

253
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:59,561
Good bye and see you in the next lesson.
