00:00:03,466 --> 00:00:04,612
Hello,

2
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:07,511
A warm welcome to this MOOC course for electrotechnic 1

3
00:00:07,511 --> 00:00:09,286
that I shall give during this semester

4
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:10,926
with Paolo Germano.

5
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,798
Electricity is a relatively recent
scientific and technical subject 

6
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:16,178
that opened up in the 19th century

7
00:00:16,178 --> 00:00:18,778
but that appears in many
technical achievements.

8
00:00:18,778 --> 00:00:21,008
Several subdomains have appeared

9
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,828
that all depend on
applications of electricity,

10
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:26,028
ranging from communications to energy.

11
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:27,888
Electronics, which in itself can be distinguished

12
00:00:27,888 --> 00:00:30,758
between control electronics
and power electronics;

13
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:33,968
the technical information that includes
the domain of integrated circuits,

14
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,388
the brains of information processing ;

15
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:40,228
remote transmission,
telephones, televisions and GPS ;

16
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:44,770
electrical energy, including
generation, transmission, distribution

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:48,075
and conversion of energy, the measures,

18
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:50,494
their transmission and their management. 

19
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:54,022
All of these domains and subdomains
depend upon electrotechnics

20
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:56,709
that we shall discover
during this semester.

21
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,020
Before starting this course,
I would like to give you a preview

22
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,868
of what we do here,
at EPFL, in a laboratory,

23
00:01:03,868 --> 00:01:06,396
the laboratory of integrated actuators,

24
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,726
that is part of the Microengineering Institute.

25
00:01:08,726 --> 00:01:10,452
What is microengineering ?

26
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:15,462
Microengineering is at the heart of
a certain number of applications

27
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:18,560
such as watches, robotics,

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,020
applications that, of course
that combine precision,

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,525
that combine the link between energy,

30
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:28,208
between information,

31
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,520
between  mouvement 

32
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,674
between sensors, between optics, etc.

33
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:38,484
You can see here, on the image
3 automata that we call

34
00:01:38,484 --> 00:01:42,275
the Jaquet-Droz automata
-born in the 18th century-

35
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:44,289
which are, in fact, the first

36
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,951
completely mechanical robots,

37
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:51,473
born from the absolutely incredible
ingenuity of Mr. Jaquet-Droz.

38
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:54,794
Who was followed by a great
man such as Mr. Breguet,

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,850
who invented the perpetual 
self-winding watch

40
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,830
and whereby, in the
Jura part of Switzerland

41
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:07,509
between the Vaud, Neuchatel
and Jura cantons

42
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,482
we find what is known as
the cradle of microengineering,

43
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:14,698
that of course also extends
to neighbouring France 

44
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:17,566
and where we find a certain
number of businesses

45
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,316
linked to microengineering
that do, even today,

46
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:22,919
very high microengineering.

47
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,364
The laboratory finds itself in domains
at the heart of different subjects

48
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:32,819
such as electromagnetism, electornics,
mechanics, data processing

49
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,204
but also material sciences,
as we shall see later on.

50
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:39,794
Domains such as micro-motors,
energy transfer, electronics,

51
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:43,704
piezoelectric motors,
or even haptic devices,

52
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:46,723
are our topics of predilection

53
00:02:46,723 --> 00:02:49,854
within the laboratory
of integrated actuators.

54
00:02:51,815 --> 00:02:55,630
Quickly, we realized that one
of the key pieces

55
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,539
to enable miniaturisation, 
is to be able to integrate

56
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,754
different movements
and different functionalities

57
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:06,509
within a system.

58
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:09,340
You have here several
images that show you

59
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,301
how these functionalities
can be integrated.

60
00:03:12,301 --> 00:03:18,149
For example here, the lens of a DVD
reader, where the lens must focus

61
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:21,694
the laser beam on the optical disc

62
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:26,531
with a precision better than a micron.

63
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:30,190
And this must be done in
the vertical direction

64
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,573
but also in the lateral direction,
and you have here a microsystem

65
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:38,595
that allows the adjustment of
the position of the lens within a micron

66
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,346
in two different directions.

67
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:41,575
So here is an actuator.

68
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:45,529
Here as well, a micro-motor of 
a few millimetres in diameter

69
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,491
that can nonetheless turn
at 100 000 rotations per minute

70
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,536
and its command electronics
are much bigger than

71
00:03:50,536 --> 00:03:51,933
the motor itself.

72
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:55,607
Or even a hard disk motor,
here, alongside a coin

73
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:59,587
just to show you the
link between the size

74
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:04,545
and that currently allows us
a very powerful miniaturisation. 

75
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,069
As I have mentioned, integration
is at the heart of our activities

76
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,904
to allow - not for this lens
of a DVD for example,

77
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,793
to add two systems one upon the
other to make an XY table -

78
00:04:16,793 --> 00:04:19,913
but to combine two
systems together

79
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:24,237
allowing the combination of
ingenuity and microengineering

80
00:04:24,237 --> 00:04:26,275
to solve a problem in proper manner.

81
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:29,835
Or even here, you can see a motor.

82
00:04:29,835 --> 00:04:34,648
Here, a motor of an ancient belt DVD

83
00:04:35,748 --> 00:04:40,059
with four coils that
you can clearly see here

84
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:45,729
that are in fact a transformation of
the information of the belt sensor

85
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:50,131
that transfers without contact the
information within the motor.

86
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,875
Another element that we work on

87
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,559
is transmission of 
energy without contact,

88
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,747
here, a project that
we have worked on

89
00:04:55,747 --> 00:04:58,250
where we can see the belts

90
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,560
a lateral belt here

91
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,797
- we can see them better here -

92
00:05:02,797 --> 00:05:06,085
with a test bus that allows
supplying power to the cart.

93
00:05:06,355 --> 00:05:08,751
These carts, as we can see, move along

94
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:12,298
an assembly line.

95
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,217
Thus, the goal is to make
assembly lines

96
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:15,943
with these small independent modules .

97
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:17,592
And to go to the cleanroom, 

98
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:20,734
well, the rubbing of
these brushes on these bands

99
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:21,953
creates too much dust.

100
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:26,688
Thus, the idea here was to
create an entirely contactless system.

101
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,891
This contactless system is
reused here for a project

102
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:34,240
with a local business,

103
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,144
that we've managed to implement

104
00:05:36,144 --> 00:05:38,995
with the help of the CHUV
hospital of Lausanne

105
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,747
with problems where
energy need to be transmitted

106
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:43,275
within the human body.

107
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:48,532
You can see here an in vivo
experiment where we placed a "secondary",

108
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:53,766
It's a coil, here, on a flex print,
directly attached to the intestine. 

109
00:05:53,766 --> 00:05:56,001
We close the intestine and, from the outside,

110
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:58,816
we will activate the intestine
for people who have

111
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,712
chronic constipation problems

112
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:06,121
or severe problems
of gut motility.

113
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,386
Another application that
we've managed to do

114
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,163
for the company Logitech

115
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:12,637
is here a testing bench, a table,

116
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,638
upon which we can
place any object

117
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,780
and this object will be
supplied in energy.

118
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,466
The laboratory also works
on micro-motors

119
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,821
or very special motors.

120
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:24,697
We've also had the
opportunity of working

121
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:28,656
for very ambitious projects
on artificial hearts.

122
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:32,676
You have here one of the in vivo
experiments that has been done.

123
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:33,686
This has been done

124
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,390
in collaboration with Montreal,

125
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:39,693
with, here, a motor
with its titanium shell.

126
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:43,214
Blood is used to
cool down the motor

127
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:47,491
and this part here, of the motor
will find itself completely immersed 

128
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,734
within the left ventricle.

129
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,996
Several other applications :
we've worked on

130
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,291
a piezoelectric bistoury,
we shall see later on

131
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,491
what we mean by "piezoelectric".

132
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,964
It's a crystal that
we vibrate

133
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:03,790
and we got the idea
of making a bistoury

134
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,890
that can choose the tissue
that it is in the process of cutting, 

135
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,244
in particular for high risk
operations, like for example,

136
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:15,949
working on the
intervertebral disks

137
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,268
with the spinal cord
that is very close here,

138
00:07:19,268 --> 00:07:23,742
thus the risk of harming the
patient is relatively high

139
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:26,959
and to be able to have a bistoury

140
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,416
capable of selecting 
a soft or hard tissue,

141
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:35,226
endues an immense advantage for
the surgeon that is operating.

142
00:07:35,226 --> 00:07:36,850
Here is a piezoelectric
actuator

143
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,695
as I was describing it earlier

144
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,415
and that can
thanks to its vibrations

145
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:43,946
and to the fact that
we are acting based on a contact

146
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,848
between the vibrating part
and the stationary part,

147
00:07:46,848 --> 00:07:48,832
finally create movement.

148
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:49,983
Thus you have here

149
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,838
a small linear actuator
that was created in our laboratory

150
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:57,457
and that make you better understand
how this system works,

151
00:07:57,457 --> 00:08:02,100
we have prepared a small
animation, to show you

152
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,023
how, by increasing the vibration
at the tip of the system,

153
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:08,879
you can see here how it vibrates

154
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,278
"in the same manner as a fin",
like a fish in fact

155
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,409
and the tip of this "fin"

156
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:19,060
will touch the stator

157
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,622
and induce a movement.

158
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:23,928
And for two different frequencies,
we can create a going movement

159
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,723
or a coming movement.

160
00:08:25,723 --> 00:08:28,564
We've also worked on
focusing lenses.

161
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:31,612
You can see here this lens in green,

162
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,854
with a small box
that doesn't measure

163
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:37,276
more than 5 by 5 millimetres.

164
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:41,339
And within, you have a small
piezoelectric system described here,

165
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,731
or even with a picture here,

166
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,864
with a matchstick to give
a sense of the size of this object

167
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:49,249
that will in fact, this small actuator,

168
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:53,715
make the lens go up and down
to focus on the image.

169
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:57,282
And here are some piezoelectric
elements that are used

170
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:59,327
in the industrial domain.

171
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:03,913
And finally, the use of piezoelectrics
can also be done to create

172
00:09:03,913 --> 00:09:07,000
tactile impressions.

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,801
We've made here

174
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:12,038
- on an Ipod, a fake Ipod -

175
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:16,656
a wheel under which there
is a piezoelectric crystal

176
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,243
that is put in vibration.

177
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:20,002
The quarter, here, is shown to you

178
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:23,928
and you can see a wave
from this piezoelectric

179
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,991
that will happen on this wheel.

180
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,939
By placing a finger on this wheel,

181
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:31,002
the piezoelectric, through its vibration,

182
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:35,545
creates a film of air that will give you
the impression that your finger is sliding. 

183
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:36,873
When in fact,

184
00:09:36,873 --> 00:09:38,811
the matter has not changed.

185
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,916
By actuating and by
stopping this principle,

186
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:46,681
we can create an impression of
sliding, rubbing, sliding, rubbing,

187
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:49,879
and thus, give a tactile sensation

188
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,529
or a tactile impression to the user

189
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:59,012
and thus create a sort of
virtual tactile system.

190
00:09:59,688 --> 00:10:02,526
Knowing that there are also
several modes of vibration,

191
00:10:02,526 --> 00:10:05,973
we intend to continue work
for the next several years

192
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,749
to even give an impression

193
00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:12,129
of patterns to this tactile impression

194
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:15,012
and not just an on/off
change of the state

195
00:10:15,012 --> 00:10:18,327
of impression of sliding
and not sliding.

196
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,307
You also have here an image
of a robotic system

197
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:24,070
that takes pieces on a part,

198
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,843
here in color

199
00:10:25,843 --> 00:10:29,332
- you have pieces, here, that arrive
 on this part, that are dispersed -

200
00:10:29,332 --> 00:10:34,132
we wish to, with the help of
this piezoelectric system,

201
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:37,796
move these pieces in a
given direction

202
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:41,363
and to know very precisely  the position
of this small pieces of balls

203
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:44,447
that are included here in the video.

204
00:10:44,447 --> 00:10:47,522
A few other elements :
magnetic fluids.

205
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:51,175
You can see, here on top, a fluid
known as "magnetorheological",

206
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:53,225
this means that its
viscosity will depend

207
00:10:53,225 --> 00:10:56,991
on the magnetic field
that goes through this fluid.

208
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:59,356
We are researching actuators 

209
00:10:59,356 --> 00:11:01,150
that use this principle.

210
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,506
And below, an small
amusing video

211
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:08,189
to show that we can also work
with these magnetic fluids

212
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,524
and make them climb, like so,
this conic structure.

213
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:14,801
You can see here,

214
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,521
an explanation of a haptic glove

215
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,130
where we've used

216
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,042
- here on this haptic glove -

217
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:26,312
a small system that works
with magnetorheological liquids.

218
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:30,953
The hybrid MEMS
motor can also show you

219
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:33,005
the integration on which
we are working.

220
00:11:33,005 --> 00:11:38,387
We had the idea of making
a stator printed on silicon 

221
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:42,962
with a magnet, we'll say "classical",

222
00:11:42,962 --> 00:11:45,422
that we place above, here,

223
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,264
the silicon.
Why ?

224
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:49,828
To make an extremely tiny motor

225
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:54,885
and thus, finally, stators can be
made like hotcakes.

226
00:11:54,885 --> 00:12:00,429
You can see here a nice photograph
where we can see a layer of copper

227
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,328
and behind, transparent,
the other layer of copper

228
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,473
and we can like this,
sandwich

229
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,565
different layers of copper
on each other

230
00:12:08,565 --> 00:12:13,063
with here canals that are used
to link the different layers together

231
00:12:13,063 --> 00:12:14,989
to create a true winding.

232
00:12:14,989 --> 00:12:18,799
You have here the finished motor

233
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,459
along with a matchstick, again
to show you the size.

234
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:25,002
The efficiency is of more than 45%,

235
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:29,501
which, compared to the 
currently used 15% motor

236
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,486
enables us to
extend the battery

237
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:34,126
life cycle from two
years to about six.

238
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:37,574
Thus, the ecological impact by making these

239
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:41,648
kind of changes or these type of
integration studies is phenomenal.

240
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:44,430
This allows me to arrive
- now that you have seen

241
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,411
all that can be done in electrotechnics
and it's not an exhaustive -

242
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:51,896
all of this applications
that I've shown you

243
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,840
use the basis of
electrotechnics.

244
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,841
And thus, it is one of the first
engineering branches

245
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,260
in the microengineering course.

246
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,376
but just there : mechanics,
materials, robotics...

247
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:08,294
All of these courses do
and use electrotechnics.

248
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,246
We can thus make a definition :

249
00:13:11,246 --> 00:13:14,249
it would be 
"the technical use of electricity,

250
00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:19,506
either as a energy support,
or as an information support ".

251
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:20,754
And, as you have seen it,

252
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:24,250
an application to a very large
number of other disciplines

253
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,350
that use electric circuits
as a basic mapping.

254
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,438
Electrotechnic isn't that kind of
image where you can see that 

255
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:34,577
to go straight,
you have to go left.

256
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:39,698
And you also shouldn't think to yourself
"Absolutely go here !", no.

257
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:43,778
We will try to give you clues,
provide you with methods

258
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,216
that will allow you to
make the best choice

259
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:49,942
when faced with a
electrotechnic problem.

260
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:53,100
And what you must also know,
is that electrotechnic,

261
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,053
as a discipline of electricity,

262
00:13:56,053 --> 00:14:01,003
does not only apply
to electricity but

263
00:14:01,003 --> 00:14:03,409
as I've mentioned
to electronics,

264
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,220
but also to electric machines,

265
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,964
to micro-actuators,
thus to electromagnetism.

266
00:14:08,964 --> 00:14:12,450
And also, this may
seem strange,

267
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,474
to mechanical and thermal engineering,

268
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:18,606
because, in fact, we can
model thermal flow

269
00:14:18,606 --> 00:14:21,037
by equivalent electric diagrams

270
00:14:21,037 --> 00:14:24,882
and thus reuse
all this formalism

271
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:27,551
and methods studied
in electrotechnics,

272
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:30,314
with the help of the basics of electrotechnics

273
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:31,974
that we shall see here.

274
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:37,375
Thus, the writing, symbolic
and schematics that we shall see here

275
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:42,163
will be fundamental 
elements to be able to make

276
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:46,240
a coherent engineer's language
for all disciplines.

277
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,698
Here again, for example,

278
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:52,417
a wonderful application of the engineer
that benefited from the works

279
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:54,695
of electrotechnics
and electromagnetism.

280
00:14:54,695 --> 00:15:00,316
This is a hard disk motor
relatively ancient, from the 1990s,

281
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,872
and that shows you here two actuators :

282
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:05,156
one that enables
the rotation of the hard disk,

283
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,565
and one that will actuate,

284
00:15:06,565 --> 00:15:08,375
you can see here the linear actuator,

285
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:13,093
the playhead or playheads
the support the sensor.

286
00:15:13,093 --> 00:15:17,247
Another example of miniaturisation
that again calls for all of this

287
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,287
it's a watch that is made
by a Swiss company,

288
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,533
that's called the touch

289
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,445
and you have here, in fact
two actuators on this same watch,

290
00:15:27,445 --> 00:15:28,808
on the front and back.

291
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:31,711
So first two-phased motors

292
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,844
that will allow each
to command a needle

293
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:36,443
-since these needles are
independent from each other

294
00:15:36,443 --> 00:15:37,990
for the different functionalities

295
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,612
that are presented -

296
00:15:39,612 --> 00:15:41,832
and then, a small vibrator, here,

297
00:15:41,832 --> 00:15:46,069
that will allow to give out a silent
alarm within the watch.

298
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:48,078
Other natural phenomena, 

299
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,240
such as here, this magnificent
double lightening on Lake Leman,

300
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,394
can be explained
or can be formalised

301
00:15:55,394 --> 00:15:58,715
by what we will see
in electrotechnics.

302
00:15:59,374 --> 00:16:04,524
But also, here, three micro-tornadoes
on Lake Neuchâtel, in Switzerland,

303
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:08,265
that can also be, using fluid
mechanics, approached by

304
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:13,381
simplified models that call
for the schematics of electrotechnics.

305
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:17,750
This is the program of the course
I shall be offering you,

306
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,462
it's to first tackle conventions
and symbols,

307
00:16:21,462 --> 00:16:23,787
very important, since around the world

308
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:28,231
we don't all have the same way of
writing or conceiving the schematics.

309
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:31,205
Thus, to agree for
the beginning of this course.

310
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:33,505
Then, we shall see the laws of Kirchhoff,

311
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:36,806
the basis of electrotechnics
and electricity.

312
00:16:37,546 --> 00:16:39,581
Afterwards we shall study
the analysis of circuits

313
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:44,417
that will lead us to offer you
a certain number of methods

314
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:47,019
that will allow you
to solve circuits.

315
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,994
You will have the choice
of the methods,

316
00:16:48,994 --> 00:16:51,718
and it is through the
exercises that we will offer

317
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:56,958
that you will better feel the way
and which methods to finally use

318
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,646
for your own circuit solving.

319
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:04,732
Finally, we will move on to 
sinusoidal steady state

320
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,372
that will later bring us
to the study of power

321
00:17:07,372 --> 00:17:10,219
to finish the first course.

322
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:12,774
To conclude I wish
you all the best

323
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:16,804
and will re-join you in lesson
number two of this MOOC 1.
