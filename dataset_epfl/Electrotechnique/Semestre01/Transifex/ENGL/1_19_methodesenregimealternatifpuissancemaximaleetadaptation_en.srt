00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:07,510
Good morning, welcome to this new
lecture of the Electrotechnics course.

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,395
Today, we will talk
about a last point of theory

3
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:14,307
that we have developed in the context of
the supplied circuits under a DC steady state,

4
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:17,431
and we will deal with it for the AC steady state.

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:19,467
It comes to the power adjustment.

6
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:22,247
We will first start
by a recall of the results

7
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,601
that we have found
for the DC steady state.

8
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,077
We will then develop
the same theory,

9
00:00:27,077 --> 00:00:29,949
but adjusted to the AC steady state.

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:32,503
We will see the case of
a real voltage supply

11
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:36,744
that feeds a load impedance,
namely, with a reactive part.

12
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:39,528
Finally, we will see the case
of an adaptation 

13
00:00:39,528 --> 00:00:45,148
with a reactance in series
and a case with a reactance in parallel.

14
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:50,145
So, here we recall the circuit
we have used for the DC steady state.

15
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:53,277
It is a real voltage supply

16
00:00:53,277 --> 00:00:56,148
which is composed
of an ideal voltage supply

17
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,913
and of an internal resistor.

18
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:04,400
This real voltage supply supplies
a resistive load.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,164
Therefore, a current flows 
in the circuit.

20
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:11,898
This current is here.

21
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:15,247
What interested us was to 
calculate the power

22
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:18,485
which was dissipated in the load 
resistance.

23
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:23,650
To do so, we calculate this value of
power load

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,558
which is, in fact, the resistance 
multiplied by the current squared.

25
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:31,412
We represent it here in this equation,

26
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:34,991
the resistor is here,
and the current squared,

27
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:42,143
it is the voltage divided by the sum of 
the resistors, they are in series here.

28
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:47,128
Then I², is equal to u over total R
squared.

29
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:51,030
We can see in this equation
we have two extreme cases.

30
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,705
A power which is null when
the load resistance is null.

31
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:59,178
So if Rch is null, the power
is also null.

32
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:04,172
An extreme case: f the load resistance
is infinite,

33
00:02:04,172 --> 00:02:06,176
then the current is null.

34
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:09,777
There is no current flowing in 
the circuit, the power is also null.

35
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,707
Between these two points,
there is a maximum,

36
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,001
and to find that maximum,
what do we do?

37
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:16,810
We take this function,
a load power,

38
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,056
and we will derive it in relation to 
the variable, that is to say  Rch .

39
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,622
And we look for what values 
of  Rch  this derivative is zero,

40
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:30,539
 and it will allow us to 
find the value  Rch 

41
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:34,977
 for which the power is maximum.

42
00:02:34,977 --> 00:02:39,103
We have found that in order that the power
is maximal, 

43
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,418
we also speak of power matching,

44
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:45,885
the condition was that the value
of the internal resistance of the supply

45
00:02:45,885 --> 00:02:50,049
and the value of the load resistances
must be equal.

46
00:02:50,234 --> 00:02:54,221
And the power matching condition
is therefore realized when

47
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:59,236
the value of the load resistance
and of the internal resistance are equal.

48
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:02,944
As part of a circuit under an AC steady state, 
we perform the same approach,

49
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,986
considering, to stay in a general case, 
a real voltage supply

50
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:12,315
with a load with a
resistive part,

51
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:15,013
 the internal resistance, here,
 of the supply,

52
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:18,842
and the resistance of the load, 
first thing.

53
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:24,697
And a reactive part, it is an
internal reactance of the supply

54
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,499
and the reactance of the load.

55
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:34,588
We write now the expression of the
active power in the load, here, Pch,

56
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:38,236
it is the variable which one wishes 
to find the maximum value.

57
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:44,571
This value is given by Rch times I²,
namely:

58
00:03:47,451 --> 00:03:54,065
Rch multiplied by I²,
and therefore the modulus of I²,

59
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,732
and the modulus of I is given by:

60
00:03:55,732 --> 00:04:02,301
the voltage U0 divided by
the norm of the total impedance of the circuit,

61
00:04:02,301 --> 00:04:13,633
namely, U0², divided by  (Ri + Rch),
the resistive part, squared,

62
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:20,974
then the reactive part of the supply,
plus the reactive part of the load,

63
00:04:20,974 --> 00:04:22,550
squared.

64
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:29,398
So this is  Z² , the norm
of the square of the impedance vector.

65
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,685
We rewrite here the equation
a little bit cleaner,

66
00:04:32,685 --> 00:04:36,900
and we derive this 
expression of power load

67
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,624
that we would like to maximize,

68
00:04:38,634 --> 00:04:43,543
with respect to two variables of the 
load, that is to say  Rch  and  XCH ,

69
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:45,917
we will have to make a partial derivative.

70
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,147
First,  relative
to the load resistance  Rch 

71
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:51,824
the result is the same
as in DC steady state,

72
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,359
we won't do it again here.

73
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,484
And second, a partial derivative 
with respect to another variable,

74
00:04:57,484 --> 00:05:00,726
which is the load reactance.

75
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:06,019
So, we will write the partial derivative
of the power load,

76
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:12,473
with respect to the variable  Xch, 
which must be zero.

77
00:05:12,473 --> 00:05:15,606
So, we won't do again the same calculation,

78
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:20,752
because it is exactly the same
as the one for the derivative with respect to Rch,

79
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:24,048
but we obtain a result
as follows,

80
00:05:24,048 --> 00:05:32,411
which says that the derivative is zero for
the value of  X  is equal to minus Xch.

81
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:38,527
That is to say that the derivative is zero,
so the power is maximum,

82
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:46,958
when the internal reactance is equal
to the opposite of the load reactance.

83
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,119
That's it, based on 
this final result, here,

84
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:53,570
one can draw the conclusion,
is that under the AC steady state,

85
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,388
the power matching condition is 
realized when

86
00:05:57,388 --> 00:06:02,442
the load impedance value, here, the load impedance,

87
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,246
this elements here,

88
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:09,604
and the value of the internal impedance 
of the supply, this part here,

89
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,742
this part here,

90
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:15,492
are complex conjugates.

91
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,473
Namely, the
real part is the same

92
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:22,001
and the imaginary part is opposed.

93
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:26,674
The reactive power, since both 
reactances are cancelled,

94
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:29,699
 is therefore also cancelled.

95
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:33,362
The adaptation of the impedance
 tends to make it minimal,

96
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:37,578
so its norm, by 
adding a reactance in series or in parallel.

97
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:40,841
The purpose is therefore to cancel
the reactive part

98
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:44,945
to make the resulting impedance
purely resistive.

99
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:49,782
By canceling the total reactance, 
the current is then maximum

100
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:53,197
because the norm of 
the impedance is minimal,

101
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:59,005
and therefore, the active power
will be maximal.

102
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:06,951
Adding here a reactance in series
the solution is easily found.

103
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:14,408
We only need to write Xs, the reactance
in series must be equal to -X.

104
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:22,042
We therefore have these two terms which cancel,
 it only remains the resistance R.

105
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:26,208
Adding a reactance
in parallel, here,

106
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:29,151
we can advantageously 
work with the powers.

107
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:33,759
For the dipole considered, which is the 
same as the one earlier,

108
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,469
we will add the reactance in parallel,

109
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:42,215
and we wish to cancel the total
reactive power of the dipole.

110
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:46,857
In the base branch, this one,
we can write the two powers,

111
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:55,251
the active power which is equal to  R times I²,
of the current flowing through this branch,

112
00:07:55,251 --> 00:08:02,823
therefore we have R times I², and the value
of I, is U over the norm of Z,

113
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:09,422
namely, U² divided by R² + X².

114
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:13,117
For the reactive power, once again,
in this branch,

115
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,636
we can write that Q is equal to X times I²

116
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:22,404
then the resistance multiplied
by I² which has the same value,

117
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:30,109
it's U² divided by the norm of Z².

118
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,345
So what interests us 
is mainly this point.

119
00:08:33,345 --> 00:08:36,600
This is valid for this branch.

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,083
At the reactance here 
in parallel,

121
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:47,453
we can write that the power Qp which 
passes in the parallel reactance

122
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:57,304
and it is simply U²/Xp.

123
00:08:57,304 --> 00:09:02,513
And what we want is that these
two reactive powers cancel out

124
00:09:02,513 --> 00:09:04,588
so that the sum is equal to zero.

125
00:09:04,588 --> 00:09:09,144
We can then write that
the total reactive power

126
00:09:09,144 --> 00:09:18,678
which is equal to Q + Qp,
is equal to zero.

127
00:09:18,678 --> 00:09:22,030
If we rewrite this, it is simplified by U²,

128
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:32,986
we obtain that  X/(R² + X²),

129
00:09:32,986 --> 00:09:39,687
must be equal to -1/Xp.

130
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:43,534
And it follows that the value 
of the parallel reactance

131
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:47,913
we should add
to cancel the reactive part,

132
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:58,599
the reactive power, must be
equal to -R² + X² divided by X.

133
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:05,910
So for this parallel reactance 
that we add in order to adjust the supply,

134
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:13,422
we have the final result
in this window Xp.

135
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,904
That's it, in conclusion, we can say 
that in the AC steady state,

136
00:10:15,904 --> 00:10:17,575
to adapt a load to a supply

137
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,905
and therefore maximize
the output active power,

138
00:10:19,905 --> 00:10:21,896
we need two conditions:

139
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:25,722
as in DC steady state, it is necessary 
that the values of internal resistance

140
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:29,942
and of load resistance are equal,
it's this point here.

141
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:33,866
Also, we must delete
the total reagent,

142
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:38,249
The reactance of the supply and
of the load should then be opposite,

143
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:40,380
it is this equation here.

144
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,983
In the end, it is necessary
that the internal impedances,

145
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,855
of the supply and the load,

146
00:10:44,855 --> 00:10:46,739
are complex conjugates.

147
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,015
Therefore, adjust the load to a 
supply or vice versa,

148
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:54,754
 also means removing the 
reactive power, here,

149
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,641
we have seen it in the example treated.

150
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,491
Thank you for your attention.
