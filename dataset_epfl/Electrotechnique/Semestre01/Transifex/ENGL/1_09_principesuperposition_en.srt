00:00:04,381 --> 00:00:07,477
Hello. In today's lesson, we will present a method

2
00:00:07,477 --> 00:00:11,000
whose goal is not to simplify or to
transform a circuit

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,348
but to consider its subdivisions and to
treat them separately, one by one,

4
00:00:16,358 --> 00:00:20,725
and then to reassemble the partial results to
obtain a general result.

5
00:00:20,725 --> 00:00:23,129
It is what we call the superposition principle.

6
00:00:24,032 --> 00:00:27,117
To do so, we will see what are
the excitation

7
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:30,136
and the response of a circuit
to this excitation.

8
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:33,627
Then, we will formulate the
superposition principle.

9
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:38,740
We will then see what it means to

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,473
cancel out a voltage or current supply.

11
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,198
Then, we will see the aims

12
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:46,502
and mostly the advantages
of such a method.

13
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,811
And finally, we will do an exercise.

14
00:00:49,653 --> 00:00:52,489
If we consider the following
two circuits,

15
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:58,025
we see that there is a part that we
can call the excitation, 

16
00:00:58,604 --> 00:01:01,324
it is this voltage supply here,

17
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,805
and the response of this circuit,

18
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,700
all this part here,

19
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:08,369
to this excitation,
which will be currents

20
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:10,811
in each branches

21
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,347
and voltage drops

22
00:01:12,787 --> 00:01:14,742
at the terminals of each elements.

23
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:20,587
Likewise for a second example
in the case of a current supply,

24
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,776
so an excitation which is a current supply.

25
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:27,298
This supply will induce currents
in the circuit

26
00:01:27,298 --> 00:01:30,453
and the response of the circuit to this supply

27
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:33,614
will be a series of currents
for each element

28
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:37,548
and also a voltage drop at the
terminals of each element.

29
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:40,402
The superposition principle states that

30
00:01:40,402 --> 00:01:42,482
one of the most fundamental
properties

31
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:44,992
of systems made up of
linear elements,

32
00:01:45,471 --> 00:01:47,070
whether they are electrical or not,

33
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,151
one must know that the response of
the system to a sum of excitations,

34
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:54,426
we see here several excitations,

35
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:57,780
some small, some big,
positive, negative,

36
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,541
well the response of the system to
a sum of excitations is equal to

37
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:03,428
the algebraic sum

38
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:07,256
-- so one must be careful about the
direction of the response to the excitation --

39
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,050
so the algebraic sum of the responses due to

40
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,415
each excitations considered separately.

41
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,803
Applied to the case of electrical circuits,
the superposition principle

42
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:20,780
lets us avoid a global analysis method, 
often burdensome, 

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,519
by replacing it by a succession of
partial calculations.

44
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:29,030
These partial calculations are done
on simplified circuits.

45
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:33,949
At each step, only one of the original circuit's
supplies is taken into account,

46
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,473
all the others are cancelled out.

47
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,413
The total result is the algebraic sum

48
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:40,970
of the partial results.

49
00:02:42,444 --> 00:02:48,186
So in the notion of algebraic sum, one must
take into account the directions of the currents

50
00:02:48,186 --> 00:02:49,062
or voltages.

51
00:02:49,932 --> 00:02:52,544
We have just talked about cancelling
out a supply,

52
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,536
but what does that mean exactly?

53
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,266
Cancelling out and ideal voltage supply,

54
00:02:57,783 --> 00:02:59,938
that I represent here,

55
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:04,283
the voltage u0 for example,

56
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,335
well, for the voltage to be cancelled out,

57
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:09,668
it must be null

58
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,133
so we will replace this supply,

59
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,551
to cancel it out, by a continuous line,

60
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:19,494
namely a zero voltage drop

61
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,659
between these two points.

62
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:24,698
It is the case of a short-circuit.

63
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:27,691
To cancel out an ideal current supply

64
00:03:29,841 --> 00:03:34,981
such as this one,
that provides a current Icc,

65
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:38,129
well, cancelling out this supply

66
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,983
to get a current I equal to 0

67
00:03:41,527 --> 00:03:46,398
corresponds to an open circuit
or an infinite resistance.

68
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,693
In this case, U is equal to 0.

69
00:03:49,434 --> 00:03:52,250
In that case, I is equal to 0.

70
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:54,649
Lets now consider the following example.

71
00:03:54,649 --> 00:03:59,389
It is question of a circuit composed
of two supplies,

72
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,434
such as represented here on the figure,

73
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,872
for which we would like to determine

74
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:07,661
the current i2 passing through
the resistor R2.

75
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:11,802
We see that the circuit's two excitations are

76
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:18,332
the current supply i0 and 
the voltage supply u0.

77
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,309
Under the equivalence

78
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:23,398
of real voltage supplies and
real current supplies,

79
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,696
we could transform this middle
branch here

80
00:04:27,123 --> 00:04:28,609
in a real current supply

81
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,010
and combine the current supplies that are in parallel.

82
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:36,975
However, if we wanted to transform this 
real current supply

83
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:42,891
here, with this resistor R2,
we could make the transformation

84
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,433
but we would lose the information on the current

85
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,142
that is in the resistor R2.

86
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,808
So, we will apply here the
superposition principle.

87
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:53,766
To calculate the current i2
passing through the resistor R2,

88
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:56,681
we see that this current has two components.

89
00:04:56,681 --> 00:05:01,470
A first component that we call i2a,
the subscript a 

90
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:07,350
corresponding to a response due to the
excitation of the current supply,

91
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,140
plus a component due to

92
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,810
the voltage supply, that we call i2b.

93
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:24,517
According to the superposition principle,
we can redraw this circuits in two parts

94
00:05:24,517 --> 00:05:27,919
that correspond to the two
components of the supplies.

95
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:34,065
We have a first component
that only corresponds to

96
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,315
the supply i0.

97
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:41,282
We represent the resistor R1

98
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,409
with the voltage supply u0
that is cancelled out

99
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:50,934
and the resistor R2 stays in place.

100
00:05:54,106 --> 00:06:00,107
The current i2a is given here

101
00:06:00,678 --> 00:06:02,315
and we can easily calculate it.

102
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:10,134
We have that i2 is the sum
of i2a plus i2b

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,708
and the current i2a, we recognise
here the current divider,

104
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:17,828
is i0 multiplied by

105
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:22,033
R1  over the sum of the two
resistors R1 plus R2

106
00:06:24,793 --> 00:06:30,246
to which we add the component due to

107
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:33,819
the supply at the excitation U0,

108
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,153
and so we represent the circuit without
the supply i0.

109
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:50,436
R1 is here with the voltage supply U0,

110
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,642
the only one we consider in this
second exercise

111
00:06:52,642 --> 00:06:54,196
of this second part.

112
00:07:02,836 --> 00:07:08,624
And here, the part 0 which is from 
i0 to have a null current

113
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,763
and so we have the second component i2b

114
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:18,019
which is given by the supply U0.

115
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:26,789
So this term i2b is simply

116
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:33,670
the ratio of U0 over the sum of
the resistors R1 plus R2.

117
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,047
In this particular example,

118
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:45,039
we see that the current i2a and the
current i2b are going in the same direction

119
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,479
which is why we add them,

120
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:48,515
but in another example

121
00:07:48,515 --> 00:07:54,416
one of the two currents might be in the opposite
direction to the current one has made default

122
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,966
going towards the bottom in the
original drawings,

123
00:07:57,337 --> 00:07:59,265
in which case we would have to
subtract this current.

124
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,299
In conclusion, we can say

125
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,551
that from a relatively complex circuit

126
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:08,562
composed of more than one excitation,
by applying the superposition principle

127
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:11,340
we can get circuits,

128
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,594
a certain number of circuits,
that are easier to deal with

129
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:22,155
and by adding the results we
get the global result.

130
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:24,338
One must keep in mind

131
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,157
that the elements must be linear
on one hand

132
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:31,473
and on another hand pay attention
to the signs of the currents

133
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:32,668
and voltages obtained.
