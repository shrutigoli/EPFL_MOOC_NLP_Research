00:00:04,303 --> 00:00:07,113
Hello and welcome to this lesson
dedicated to the second part of

2
00:00:07,118 --> 00:00:09,838
sinusoidal single phase state.

3
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:13,458
During this lesson, we will first
resume an example

4
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:17,918
allowing us to better understand the
transit in complex calculations

5
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:22,428
to, paradoxically, simplify the 
calculations seen during the first lesson,  

6
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:27,798
then we will discover what the
admittance and the impedance are

7
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:34,308
and also Fresnel's representation that
will allow us to visualize 

8
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,928
these elctrotechnic values, as
the voltage and the current, 

9
00:00:37,928 --> 00:00:41,368
in a complex plane,
that is to say vectors.

10
00:00:41,852 --> 00:00:45,852
First, a small example and a
reminder to tell you

11
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:48,892
what we saw during this first
lesson dedicated to

12
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:51,292
sinusoidal single phased state.

13
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:56,522
We then saw that a
function of time,

14
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:00,522
such as the voltage at the terminals
of any element

15
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:03,512
in electrotechnics,
that is thus written...

16
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:12,019
and that represents in real time
the value of the voltage at any time

17
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:15,619
at the terminals of an element;
we will be able to transform

18
00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:22,019
this variable in another variable
completely conceptual

19
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:26,659
that we will indicate by the u (vector),
underlined means that

20
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,919
we have a vector,

21
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:33,679
of an element in the complex plane,

22
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:36,279
that then takes the following form:

23
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:44,293
First of all, a real part and an
imaginary part.

24
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:54,833
This can also be written in
another form according to Euler.

25
00:01:55,559 --> 00:02:00,289
Thus, we can work in this
plan said complex,

26
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:03,329
with real parts and
imaginary parts.

27
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,869
This element underlined represents then
the voltage with real numbers

28
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,149
and when we finish the calculations
with complex numbers,

29
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:18,309
we can then come back to real
numbers by taking the real part

30
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:23,559
of this element underlined,
of this complex voltage.

31
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:29,415
By taking the real part,
we come back to Û cos (ωt + α)

32
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:34,505
that matches with the real value
of the searched voltage.

33
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,039
We can of course,
it is just a suggestion

34
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,309
to take the cosine,
if we are more comfortable, 

35
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:45,209
we can also do it
with sinusoidal variables

36
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,769
and the the transit between complex
numbers and imaginary numbers will be done,

37
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,259
not by taking the real part,
but the imaginary part

38
00:02:53,259 --> 00:02:54,899
of this complex number.

39
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:02,546
I suggest a small simple
exercise to now

40
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:07,656
give the working method and
the different approaches

41
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:12,016
to use the complex calculations
during the resolution of a simple circuit

42
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:14,746
like here with an RC circuit.

43
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:18,746
We then have a voltage u
that will have the following form:

44
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:26,245
at the terminals of our R and our C
and therefore a current will be established

45
00:03:26,245 --> 00:03:30,245
in the circuit, this current
will also have a

46
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:36,405
sinusoidal form, or co-sinusoidal, 
with simply another phase shift

47
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:44,305
and we are looking here the value
of the current that flows in the circuit

48
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:50,905
and we are looking for an angle φ,
that is to say a phase shift between α and β.

49
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,375
How do we do?

50
00:03:52,375 --> 00:04:00,445
In every circuit to analyse there is
often three first very simple steps

51
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:04,445
 to take, that seem
sometimes to easy

52
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:07,305
and that we don't do,
but I suggest you to do them

53
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:12,875
systematically to help you
to understand the method right.

54
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:17,021
The first step, is
to redraw the sketch.

55
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,857
Of course here the sketch is very simple,
we will not draw it again,

56
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:27,727
but sometime, redrawing makes
the comprehension of the sketch

57
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:31,037
much better for the person
who draws it his way,

58
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:35,487
with the connections at the right places,
therefore it is often a step

59
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:38,737
that we avoid, but i recommend
you to do it each time.

60
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:47,063
The second important step,
is to establish the direction of the voltages

61
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:48,473
and the currents.

62
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:52,353
So if I already have the arrow for u,
the arrow for i,

63
00:04:52,353 --> 00:04:55,723
We can also say that here
there is a voltage at the terminals of R

64
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:58,773
and here a voltage at the terminals
of the capacitance

65
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:03,843
and finally we can generally
apply Kirchhoff's law 

66
00:05:03,843 --> 00:05:09,133
to allow us to better understand the
circuit that establishes the equations

67
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:09,993
of the circuit.

68
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,353
For this last step,
we can then write

69
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:18,153
that u at the terminals of our circuit
is equal to U at the terminals of the resistor

70
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:21,023
plus U at the terminals of the capacitance.

71
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:26,793
We can also indicate what is equal
U of R, it will be equal to R times i,

72
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:32,513
and U and C, 1/C integral of i dt.

73
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,516
We can therefore,
to sum up these three steps,

74
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:44,666
write that the voltage u is
equal to Ri + (1/C) integral of i dt.

75
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:47,347
As we see , we have a
differential equation here.

76
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,847
Since we have an integral inside,
we come back to the same problems

77
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:56,017
that we have already met during
the first part of this topic

78
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:59,567
on the single phased state,
with a differential equation

79
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,717
and the complications linked
to the resolution of the equations

80
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:06,717
if we remain in the time mode
like here.

81
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:12,415
Then we now transit to complex numbers,
it is the step number four,

82
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:16,415
we transit to complex calculations.

83
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,579
What does it involve? 

84
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:26,036
I remind you that u is
equal to Û cos (ωt + α)

85
00:06:26,036 --> 00:06:37,086
will therefore become another u (vector)
that is equal to Ûe^j (ωt + α).

86
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:44,908
All of my equation found at the third step
with Kirchhoff's law transforms itself 

87
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:48,908
into three elements that are now
all complex.

88
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:54,184
u (vector), complex voltage, is
equal to R * i (vector), complex current,

89
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:59,304
+ (1/C) integral of i (vector),
complex, dt.

90
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:03,829
The fifth step now is to
derive or to integrate.

91
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,879
It is this part here, of the integral

92
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,059
or in the case of the inductance,
we would have a derivative.

93
00:07:10,059 --> 00:07:15,639
So let's work a little bit
on this derivative

94
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,839
and integrate to see what happens
when we have complex numbers.

95
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,869
What do we note?

96
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:25,819
We note that when we have
a derivative,

97
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,509
for example the derivative of a
complex number like this one,

98
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:36,719
if one has something of the form
Îe^j (ωt + β, by deriving

99
00:07:36,719 --> 00:07:41,959
as the derivative of an exponential
always gives an exponential 

100
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:54,009
but with the internal derivative,
we get jω Î e^j (ωt + β)

101
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:57,549
by taking the equation of the
current that we wrote before.

102
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:03,368
We notice that if it is
truly our i (vector),

103
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:06,558
we simply have jωi (vector) here.

104
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,110
So deriving a complex number
comes back to multiplying it by jω.

105
00:08:13,421 --> 00:08:16,481
We can do the same for
the integral.

106
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:22,411
So now by integrating  a complex number
like here the integral of i dt,

107
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,781
we will have the integral
of an exponential

108
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:29,821
that is always an exponential
and by considering the integral calculation

109
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:40,781
we get (1/jω) Î e^j (ωt + β)
and we notice, again,

110
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:45,271
that here, if this is also
our i (vector),

111
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:50,191
integrating a complex number comes
back to dividing this complex number

112
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,281
by jω.

113
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:57,889
And now you see why it becomes easy
to transform our equations

114
00:08:57,889 --> 00:09:02,219
in complex form, because
the integral that you see here,

115
00:09:02,219 --> 00:09:08,849
in the complete Kirchhoff equation,
this integral solves itself very

116
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:14,859
easily by dividing i (vector)
by jω.

117
00:09:15,534 --> 00:09:22,354
We therefore have our equation that becomes:
u (vector) = R * i (vector)

118
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:29,374
and we have (1/jωC) i (vector).

119
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:31,554
And you see as things
get easier. 

120
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:39,264
We will now replace the different
suspected elements u and i, therefore unknown.

121
00:09:39,264 --> 00:09:46,624
First Û e^j (ωt + α) is the voltage
of the beginning, 

122
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:49,444
it is what is given,
it is equal to,

123
00:09:49,444 --> 00:10:04,794
we highlight the i, we then
have [R + (1/jωC)] Î e^j (ωt + β).

124
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:08,061
We will here separate things to
understand better.

125
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:11,481
In the e^j (ωt + α),
here as elsewhere in the β,

126
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:16,081
we have a part that depends on the time
and a part that is a fixed angle.

127
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:26,421
When we have a sum here,
we can replace it by e^jωt . e^jα,

128
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:28,491
the rest doesn't change.

129
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:35,194
And we have the same thing for the current,
one part fluctuates with time

130
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:38,214
and another part is fixed.

131
00:10:38,248 --> 00:10:42,648
Then we see that there is here
a left part and a right part

132
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:46,248
that is identical, it is this part that
fluctuates with time.

133
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:54,742
So we can simplify this equation
and solve an equation 

134
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:56,762
that doesn't depend on time.

135
00:10:57,647 --> 00:11:00,297
We may also be interested
for a moment

136
00:11:00,297 --> 00:11:06,417
at this part R + (1/jωC),
that I will call Z,

137
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,577
it's a complex number,
we will then see what it represents.  

138
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:14,877
And if we draw this element in
the complex plane,

139
00:11:14,877 --> 00:11:21,457
so here imaginary and real
we see that we have a real part,

140
00:11:21,457 --> 00:11:30,247
it's R, the resistance that is here,
and we have an imaginary part, (1/jωC).

141
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:37,481
Maybe to make things more precise,
when we have 1/jωC,

142
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:41,481
we can multiply by j and j
at the top and at the bottom

143
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:46,291
and we get j/ωC
and j times j makes -1,

144
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:54,101
so -j/ωC is something negative,
we will therefore have here a part

145
00:11:54,101 --> 00:12:03,341
that depends on ωC but that will be negative
and finally, we have here this vector

146
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:07,341
that i will call note Z,
represented here.

147
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:12,501
The angle that is called here phi, φ.

148
00:12:12,501 --> 00:12:17,791
Phi is therefore the tangent arc of
this imaginary part

149
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:23,531
on the real part, therefore -1/RωC.

150
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:30,456
and the norm of Z, it's the square root
of the real part squared

151
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:40,796
plus the imaginary part squared,
√R^2 + (1/ωC)^2.

152
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:45,243
That is, we have all the elements now
to solve and find

153
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:48,403
what we are looking for,
that is to say the phase shift

154
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:52,003
between voltage and current,
and the value of this current

155
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,543
that flows through the circuit.

156
00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:58,340
We get to the sixth step
of our method,

157
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,750
that is to say solve and identify.

158
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:16,473
We have our Û cos α + j Û sin α on one side,

159
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:20,240
that is equal to our Z e^jφ,

160
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,990
I write this Z that I just
mentioned like this,

161
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,110
multiplied by the vector Î e^jβ.

162
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:35,473
So this, it is also what we
wrote Û e^jα.

163
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:39,523
So there is our equation
and we can now

164
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:43,523
determinate very simply the
solution first complex,

165
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,003
then the real solution,

166
00:13:45,122 --> 00:13:50,772
Then the complex solution is real.

167
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,034
But first complex.

168
00:13:53,152 --> 00:13:59,012
We are looking for the i here,
therefore this small i (vector)

169
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:19,992
that is equal to Î e^j (ωt + β)
is equal to (Û/Z) e^j (ωt + α - φ).

170
00:14:20,772 --> 00:14:25,742
The final solution that we
are looking for

171
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:29,589
is of course the real i, this i here.

172
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:35,489
we know that to find the real i we
must take the real part

173
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:40,389
of my complex i and therefore
we will get:

174
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:49,099
(Û/Z) cos (ωt + α - φ).

175
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:54,948
It is the final answer to this problem
and you know the different steps,

176
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:58,478
that you will do faster once
you will be used to it,

177
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:01,458
and that allows you to finally
solve very easily

178
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:07,268
an electrotechnical problem with R,L
or C, or the three at the same time.

179
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:12,068
Now let's see by definition
what is the instantaneous complex value 

180
00:15:12,068 --> 00:15:14,678
and what are complex phasors. 

181
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:18,488
We saw previously in 
our small example,

182
00:15:18,488 --> 00:15:26,718
a u (vector) Û e^j (ωt + α),
is by definition

183
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,718
the instantaneous complex value.

184
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,060
Instantaneous because it depends on time. 

185
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,530
We also saw that it
wasn't very important

186
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,340
because we can eliminate
this temporal component.

187
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,120
We will therefore come up with a new element
that we will call a phasor 

188
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,530
and that doesn't depend on time anymore.

189
00:15:49,621 --> 00:15:52,961
This phasor that we will
write note by U capital.

190
00:15:52,961 --> 00:15:56,961
Then there are two phasors:
the peak phasor,

191
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:04,087
with the peak value
as modulus of this vector,

192
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:09,577
or simply, the phasor
by taking its effective value

193
00:16:09,577 --> 00:16:11,017
of this variable.

194
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,364
We will therefore work with
these three variables,

195
00:16:15,364 --> 00:16:19,364
primarily the last two, or
even the last one, of these phasors.

196
00:16:19,758 --> 00:16:24,188
We saw before, this instantaneous complex
value vector is a vector 

197
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:28,188
that will rotate in the complex plane
because of the ωt.

198
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:29,238
How fast will it rotate ?

199
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,618
Well, it's the ω that determinates
how fast this vector rotates.

200
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:40,183
Then, we will decide to eliminate the e^jωt
on both sides of the equations,

201
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:43,513
since we have something
that doesn't depend on time.

202
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:47,384
By doing this, it's like if we
had photographed at an instant t

203
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:51,494
and we just look at the angle
of the voltage at this moment

204
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:53,194
in the complex plane.

205
00:16:53,194 --> 00:16:56,254
And just, we stopped the current
and what interest us

206
00:16:56,254 --> 00:17:00,734
is the angle difference between
this voltage or this current,

207
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:04,254
that allows us to determinate
different elements

208
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,124
that we are looking for
and that we would like to know

209
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:07,534
in the circuit.

210
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,189
This is what we can show
in the complex plane.

211
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,189
This current phasor here,
you have two of them that are marked here-

212
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:18,415
We did this photograph or
this snapshot.

213
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,410
Our voltage and our current
don't depend on time,

214
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:30,300
we don't need ωt + α or ωt + β anymore,
we just have α or β,

215
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,400
and therefore we have a snapshot,
a vector at on given moment,

216
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,240
same for U
with an angle β,

217
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,240
that we recover here,
another angle, α, here.

218
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,300
So we have a voltage and a current
and what we notice is

219
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,770
that this angle difference,
between voltage and current,

220
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,640
is what we are generally looking for,
that will depend on the elements R, L, C

221
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,410
in the circuit and that are equal to α - β,
therefore φ = α - β,

222
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,840
we have this angle difference.

223
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,700
Now, we can have
not only a voltage

224
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,070
but several voltages, we
also made earlier

225
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,940
a sum of voltages.

226
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,400
So we must be very careful
compared to what we saw

227
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,290
in the steady state where the voltages

228
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,110
and the currents are constant,
we can do the arithmetical sum

229
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,110
of voltages and currents.

230
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:29,463
When we work with
phasors,

231
00:18:29,463 --> 00:18:32,803
when we work with
complex calculations,

232
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:34,623
we work with vectors.

233
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,513
The sum of two vectors is not
just an arithmetical addition.

234
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:43,323
So, if this vector U represents,
let's say 50 volts,

235
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:48,953
and that there is another U at another moment,
50 volts plus 50 volts do not

236
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,683
necessarily make 100 volts
when we add them,

237
00:18:51,683 --> 00:18:55,683
unless these two vectors are
collinear.

238
00:18:55,846 --> 00:18:59,226
Here's an example where
you can see different voltages

239
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:04,076
that we have, for example here, added,
U1 and U2 that will give us U3.

240
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,386
Therefore you have the first U1 that is here
with a certain angle,

241
00:19:07,386 --> 00:19:10,646
a U2 that is here with
another angle.

242
00:19:10,646 --> 00:19:13,706
And you see that
when we do U1 + U2,

243
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:17,276
we do a vector sum to
get U3

244
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:21,276
that is not equal to the
sum of U2 and U1

245
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:24,766
but that must be calculated by
the geometrical elements.

246
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:29,942
We will then see that it's pretty simple
in the case where it's orthogonal

247
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:33,942
because we can use the
well known Pythagorean relation,  

248
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:37,832
but here it is not orthogonal,
we must calculate very precisely

249
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:43,182
in complex numbers, the sum of U1 and U2,
which will add a little bit of additional work

250
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,762
but  not to forget to be very careful.

251
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:50,816
So you see here on this image,
or on this animation,

252
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:55,416
on the right the imaginary part of the voltage

253
00:19:55,416 --> 00:20:00,336
and on the left at the bottom, the real part
of this same voltage,

254
00:20:00,336 --> 00:20:05,086
and on the top left, well, this vector
that changes as function of time.

255
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:09,217
You can see the equation
at the bottom right,

256
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:16,797
this vector representation of the voltage,
Û1 cos ωt + jÛ1 sin ωt.

257
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:21,267
So, at the top right, the sine,
at the bottom left, the cosine.

258
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,399
Then we can choose one or another
of these representations. 

259
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,874
What will interest us is now
to always talk about

260
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:30,524
a cosine, it's the part
on the bottom left,

261
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:33,874
but that will be written in the
complex plane by a vector,

262
00:20:33,874 --> 00:20:36,554
a vector that rotate as
you can see up here.

263
00:20:36,721 --> 00:20:40,081
We can also decide to stop it,
this is what we do

264
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,381
when we talk about phasors.

265
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:46,206
Now we will see a second video
that will allow us to see 

266
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:50,206
what is happening when
i put another signal.

267
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:53,515
So on this video,
we put three voltages

268
00:20:53,515 --> 00:20:56,255
that are slightly phase shifted
one another.

269
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,655
You see in the real world,
that is to say always the drawing

270
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:01,905
at the bottom left,
these are cosines,

271
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,805
three cosines slightly phase shifted
of 20 degrees.

272
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,509
It is what gives us in the complex domain
these three vectors that rotate,

273
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:13,939
U1, U2, U3, at the same speed
but slightly shifted

274
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,269
and that follow each other.

275
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,110
If we prefer the sine representation,
that is to say the imganinary part,

276
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:24,110
we then take the top right
representation

277
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,760
and then we will always work with
the imaginary part of the vector.

278
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:33,230
Then on this last video I will
show here three vectors

279
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,140
phased shifted by 120 degrees from each other.
Why?

280
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,090
Well, because the single phased
sinusoidal steady state will follow after

281
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,060
in the three phase to allow us to
transmit energy.

282
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,790
And so, we will have these kind of signals
very well known and frequent

283
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,000
since it's the power supply of
most countries throughout the world

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,770
to use a network and a symmetrical
three-phase system.

285
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:03,160
You can now see the three vectors,
U1, U2, U3, that spin at the same speed

286
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,440
in a symmetrical way and
whose sum is always zero.

287
00:22:06,513 --> 00:22:11,133
We call this representation of sines,
cosines and vectors,

288
00:22:11,133 --> 00:22:15,713
Fresnel's representation and
is what we are going to talk about

289
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:19,263
when we also want to say
in the complex plane,

290
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:22,043
we can talk of Fresnel's
representation.

291
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:27,269
We will now see what
are the impedance and the admittance;

292
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,899
impedance and admittance  are
foundations of electrotechnics

293
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:33,439
that allows us to model the
different elements R, L, C

294
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:37,439
and also that leads us to
the famous Ohm's law equation

295
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,429
but here with complex numbers
as we have seen before

296
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:43,389
when we talked about constant
current and voltage.

297
00:22:44,678 --> 00:22:50,988
This Z underlined, therefore the impedance by
definition, is equal to the instantaneous voltage 

298
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:54,438
divided by the instantaneous current,
but what is also great about it, 

299
00:22:54,438 --> 00:22:58,438
is that it's also the voltage phasor
divided by the current phasor,

300
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:02,968
or the peak voltage phasor divided
by the peak current phasor.

301
00:23:03,057 --> 00:23:07,057
These three relations are strictly
identical.

302
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:11,567
in the same way we define
an admittance

303
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:15,077
that we will define as the
inverse of the impedance

304
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:17,937
and that also has some
particular properties 

305
00:23:17,937 --> 00:23:22,387
that can sometime be used
easier than the impedance, 

306
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:25,667
it's the reason for which we
will also define it here.

307
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:29,491
The properties of this impedance are
the following:

308
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:35,231
first, when we write our Z, that
is equal to the voltage phasor

309
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:42,131
divided by the current phasor,
we therefore have U e^jα

310
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:49,301
for the voltage phasor, I e^jβ
for the current phasor

311
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:55,081
and we have, by using the mathematical
property of exponential, 

312
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:58,741
a new exponential that is
equal to α - β.

313
00:23:58,824 --> 00:24:04,014
And we define this as being
the angle phi, φ.

314
00:24:05,161 --> 00:24:09,161
Phi is therefore equal to α - β
as we saw before.

315
00:24:09,321 --> 00:24:15,911
By identification, we have the
norm of this vector Z

316
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:18,741
that is here, is simply equal to
U over I.

317
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:22,371
We are not surprised because
it's the already known Ohms law

318
00:24:22,371 --> 00:24:26,371
and this angle φ is α - β.

319
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:31,132
We can write the same way for
the admittance this time,

320
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:41,022
since it's the inverse of Z,
that it's a current over a voltage

321
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:49,982
and that it's equal to (1/Z) e^-jφ
or then Y e^-jφ.

322
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:53,632
Now let's see what happens inside
of this Z.

323
00:24:53,632 --> 00:25:09,212
We say that this impedance Z is equal to Z e^jφ
therefore Z cos φ + j Z sin φ.

324
00:25:09,212 --> 00:25:12,602
It's a complex number but
we can also write it,

325
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:18,272
as we see here a + j b.

326
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:22,702
We therefore have a real part, it's
this Z cos φ,

327
00:25:22,702 --> 00:25:25,512
an imaginary part,
it's this Z sin φ.

328
00:25:25,512 --> 00:25:29,782
We will call the part "a",
the resistance,

329
00:25:31,546 --> 00:25:35,806
and we will call the "b" part,
the reactance. 

330
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:40,422
The resistance is well known by
everybody,

331
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:47,032
therefore this Z cos φ is necessarily real,
there is just one element

332
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:53,042
that can represent this reality it's
the resistor R,

333
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:56,092
it is therefore the real part of Z.

334
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:04,538
We have this Z sin φ that can be represented
either by a capacitance or an inductance.

335
00:26:04,627 --> 00:26:10,487
We will give it the symbol X and call
this the reactance

336
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:16,717
and this reactance would be equal to
the imaginary part of the impedance.

337
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:22,401
We symbolize this X,
or this imaginary part,

338
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:28,211
by, you have it here on the symbol,
a black square

339
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:32,851
that represents the fact that this
element here is imaginary

340
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:35,741
or has an imaginary component.

341
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:41,404
We therefore have, our impedance
that will always be written

342
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:48,464
as R + jX, with the norm of
this vector

343
00:26:48,464 --> 00:26:55,484
that will be equal to √R^2 + X^2
with a φ angle

344
00:26:55,484 --> 00:27:01,104
that will be equal to the tangent arc
of X over R.

345
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:06,780
We have a very clear
representation,

346
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,860
so you have the impedance Z,
its real part R,

347
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,460
here, drawn, a part of a positive
reactance,

348
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,680
this also means that finally
this reactance behaves 

349
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,170
as an inductance, since
I remind you

350
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,410
that the inductance will have
a positive part,

351
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,230
it's the jωL.

352
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,700
So we will have ωL and we will have -1/ωC
for a capacitance.

353
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:36,769
Let's now take case-by-case
R, L and C do determinate

354
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,759
how they behave as function of
the impedance and the admittance

355
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,519
and that it will give us Ohms law
for each element.

356
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,554
The first case, very simple,
the resistor.

357
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:54,834
Let's admit that we know that
U = Z I, is Ohms law

358
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:57,164
but here with the complex case.

359
00:27:57,164 --> 00:28:03,784
Our impedance for a resistor,
is simply R,

360
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:08,154
and is equal to U (vector) divided by I
(vector) written as previously,

361
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:10,024
or U divided by I.
Why?

362
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:15,284
because U and I are in phase
and that this phi of the resistor, 

363
00:28:15,284 --> 00:28:19,894
namely α - β, the phase shift
between voltage and current,

364
00:28:19,894 --> 00:28:22,564
are equal to zero for the resistance.

365
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:28,344
And in the case of the admittance,
the Y of R that is equal to 1/R,

366
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:32,344
we sometimes call it G uppercase,
or conductance. 

367
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,232
There is now the case of the inductance.

368
00:28:36,342 --> 00:28:40,452
In the case of the inductance,
we have an equation U

369
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:46,232
that links the current I with a relation
that we have already seen before

370
00:28:46,232 --> 00:28:49,512
and that is equal to jωL.

371
00:28:49,642 --> 00:28:53,212
We therefore have U = jωL * I.

372
00:28:53,212 --> 00:28:56,632
We can maybe explain for
a reminder,

373
00:28:56,632 --> 00:29:02,422
the equation in time
is U = L (di/dt).

374
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:09,212
If written in vector,
U = L (di(vector) /dt).

375
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:13,672
We saw that to derive
it was simply

376
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:15,592
the current times jω.

377
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:19,592
So we have jω and the L that stays
and finally the small i.

378
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:23,351
We therefore have this U equal to jω L i.

379
00:29:23,351 --> 00:29:26,761
And now if we remove,
or if these are two vectors

380
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:32,151
that spin as function of time, of ωt,
if we divide by ωt

381
00:29:32,151 --> 00:29:34,421
on both sides, so if we do as I said
before

382
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:37,171
a photograph, well
we get phasors again,

383
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:39,121
it's the equation that I wrote here.

384
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:45,255
My impedance ZL is equal to U (vector)
divided by I (vector)

385
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,495
and therefore is equal to jωL.

386
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:51,585
It's the impedance of an inductance.

387
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:59,426
We therefore have ZL, the norm,
that is simply equal to ωL.

388
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:06,151
We have the angle φL, as it is
equal to the tangent arc of ωL/R,

389
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,511
this is just in the RL case,
but here in this case

390
00:30:09,511 --> 00:30:13,731
of the inductance we have a j,
therefore one is perfectly vertical,

391
00:30:13,731 --> 00:30:15,721
this angle is equal to π/2.

392
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:21,664
And for the impedance,
the resistor is zero.

393
00:30:21,723 --> 00:30:24,053
Finally the case of the capacitor.

394
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:32,536
We have in the temporal case
i = C (du/dt).

395
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:38,846
We have the i (vector) that is then
equal to j ωC x u (vector).

396
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:42,917
Or then, I (vector),
we are now in phasors,

397
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:46,577
equal to j ωC x U((vector))

398
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:51,368
Said otherwise, the impedance Zc,
that is by definition,

399
00:30:51,368 --> 00:30:54,518
equal to U/I for phasors,

400
00:30:54,518 --> 00:31:02,248
will be equal to 1/jωC or -j (1/ωC).

401
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:07,947
We can write that the norm of the Z
of the capacitor

402
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:13,397
is 1/ωC, that the reactance of
the capacitor

403
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:18,807
is -1/ωC, the angle φc,

404
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:23,247
is negative, so it will be equal to -π/2,
and again

405
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,250
 the resistance of C is zero.

406
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:31,278
To sum up, we sketched a graph 
in the complex plane

407
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
of the three impedances R, L and C
that we just wrote.

408
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:39,252
You have here, in the first column
of this table,

409
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:42,052
the real part of Z and
the imaginary part.

410
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:46,052
In other words, the resistance
and the reactance.

411
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:48,902
Then the norm, the angle and finally,

412
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:51,612
the impedance written under the complex form.

413
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:56,332
We therefore have our first vector R
that is on the real part.

414
00:31:56,332 --> 00:32:00,332
If you take a second element L
with a jωL,

415
00:32:00,332 --> 00:32:03,342
there is a vertical vector,
the angle is equal to π/2.

416
00:32:03,342 --> 00:32:06,482
And finally, with the capacitance
we saw that it was negative

417
00:32:06,482 --> 00:32:11,412
because of 1/jωC or -j (1/ωC).

418
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:15,412
We have a perfectly vertical vector
but negative

419
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:17,522
so -π/2 for the angle.

420
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:19,639
The last thing we have yet to see
are the power supplies.

421
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,449
When we have a voltage supply

422
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:27,469
that works in alternative, in a
sinusoidal single phased steady state

423
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:31,739
we must ask what is happening,

424
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:34,669
 as for the steady state or the DC voltage.

425
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,749
So in the same way as the DC
steady state,

426
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,419
an ideal supply doesn't work.

427
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,459
Therefore we always have a voltage supply
or a current supply

428
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:47,579
that must be associated
to an internal impedance

429
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:50,415
that is put in parallel of serial.

430
00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:56,355
Therefore for the voltage supply,
we have here this element here

431
00:32:56,355 --> 00:33:00,035
that is an internal impedance
of the supply.

432
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:04,157
This Zs is the internal impedance.

433
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,869
It is put in series with the supply
allowing us to have, this time,

434
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:14,529
a voltage supply said real.

435
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:17,969
In the same way for the current,
we must put a real impedance

436
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:22,909
in order to have a real current supply,

437
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,439
this impedance is said to
be internal to the supply,

438
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:31,759
and will allow us to define this
real current supply

439
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,519
and not ideal as before.

440
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,989
Therefore this Zp here is also
the internal impedance.

441
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,677
To finish, I suggest you
this small example

442
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:48,157
to picture what we just saw with
the supplies

443
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:50,517
and the calculations of impedances. 

444
00:33:50,794 --> 00:33:56,874
We have here a voltage of 500 volts,
a resistance of 2 ohms

445
00:33:56,874 --> 00:34:01,544
and a reactance of also 2 ohms,
that I write here j2,

446
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:06,554
and our load Zch that would take
three different values,

447
00:34:06,554 --> 00:34:11,194
either a resistance of 48 ohms,
or an inductance of 48 ohms,

448
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:13,814
or either a capacitance of 48 ohms
and you will see each time

449
00:34:13,814 --> 00:34:15,204
that the impedance is different.

450
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:19,804
The first case, the case
where the resistance by itself.

451
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:23,404
We therefore have Zch that is only
equal to 48.

452
00:34:24,727 --> 00:34:27,757
What is the total impedance?

453
00:34:27,757 --> 00:34:31,757
Well here, these three impedances are in
series, we will then add

454
00:34:31,757 --> 00:34:36,257
the internal impedance plus
the impedance load

455
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:43,027
therefore 2 + j2 + 48, be careful
to not add

456
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:45,767
apples and oranges, we have a
real part,

457
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:47,247
an imaginary part.

458
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:52,917
Therefore the real part is equal to 50
and the imaginary is always 2.

459
00:34:52,917 --> 00:35:05,807
So my Z total, or the norm
is √(50^2 + 2^2)

460
00:35:05,807 --> 00:35:08,987
which is about 50 ohms.

461
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:11,549
We can also calculate here the current.

462
00:35:11,549 --> 00:35:20,379
So the current I is U/Ztot and is
worth 10 amps.

463
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:24,849
At the terminals of the load of
my resistor,

464
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,029
well, it's the Z of the load resistance
times the current

465
00:35:29,029 --> 00:35:33,029
and we get 480 volts.

466
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:39,614
Let's get to the b case.

467
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:47,755
For the b case, we now have our Zch
that is equal to j48, it's different,

468
00:35:47,755 --> 00:35:52,495
our Z total will then be added
with the rest,

469
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:55,105
but in the real part it's
2 only

470
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:57,105
and the imaginary part is 50.

471
00:35:57,105 --> 00:36:02,995
So Z total but normed,
the norm of this vector,

472
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:06,995
square root of 2 squared plus
50 squared,

473
00:36:06,995 --> 00:36:10,995
will also give the same number
as before, roughly 50.

474
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:13,665
And with the current,
we find the same numbers.

475
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:20,135
The U at the terminals of this
inductance is also 480 volts.

476
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:25,692
Last case is, the c, with this time
a capacitance, a capacitor.

477
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:33,372
Our Zch is -48 ohms,
our Z total will now slightly

478
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:41,432
 change compared to before, because
we will have 2 + j2 - j48

479
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:49,502
and we get 2 - j46 and our norm
will be different

480
00:36:49,502 --> 00:36:54,292
from the two previous cases,
about 46 ohms,

481
00:36:54,292 --> 00:37:00,152
with a current that is then
equal to 10.87 A

482
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:03,322
and a voltage at the terminals
of this capacitance

483
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:07,322
that is 521,7 volts.

484
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:11,916
To sum up, we now saw all
the chapter

485
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,936
on sinusoidal
single phased state.

486
00:37:13,936 --> 00:37:17,936
You saw the advantages of the
transit to complex calculations,

487
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:21,496
and finally the paradox of
easier calculations 

488
00:37:21,496 --> 00:37:24,616
when we write the elements
with vectors

489
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:27,976
where the different values,
as the voltage, current or impedances,

490
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:31,196
with vectors and this
Fresnel representation

491
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:35,616
that allows us to represent
these vectors in the complex plane,

492
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,616
that these vectors are fixed
or move as function of time,

493
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:44,146
allowing us to have a picture of
what is happening in the complex world,

494
00:37:44,146 --> 00:37:48,146
but showing conceptually the reality.
Thank you.
