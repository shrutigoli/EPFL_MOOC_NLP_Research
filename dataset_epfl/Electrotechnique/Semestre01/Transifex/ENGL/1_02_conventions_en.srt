00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,479
Hello and welcome to this
second lesson of Electrotechnics 1

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:09,399
in this lesson we will
after the introduction

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:12,295
see how to, together, agree with

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:16,661
a notation for all the MOOC
Electrotechnics 1 and 2 course

5
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:20,008
we shall also see the way
to do graphical notations

6
00:00:20,008 --> 00:00:24,940
that will enable a universal language
or at least a common one

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,766
for all the different lessons
of this MOOC course

8
00:00:28,766 --> 00:00:32,432
The utility of a clear and universal
terminology

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,081
,of a normalization of
the reference systems,

10
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:38,167
of mathematical symbolism,
of graphics,

11
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:41,573
is evident in all domains of
technical sciences.

12
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,820
The necessity of such an effort
of normalization has been recognized

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,206
very, very early in electrical engineering.

14
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:49,392
In order to present a coherent concept,

15
00:00:49,392 --> 00:00:53,960
the authors of this MOOC course have
decided to follow as much as possible

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,316
the recommendations developed
by the international electrotechnical

17
00:00:57,316 --> 00:00:59,552
commission, IEC,

18
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:04,724
regarding the terminology, 
the graphical and literary symbols ;

19
00:01:04,724 --> 00:01:08,802
the system that will be used is the
International System SI,

20
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:13,340
adopted by the General Conference
 on Weights and Measures in 1960.

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,850
The mathematical symbols
are those recommended

22
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:19,220
the International Organization
 for Standardization ISO.

23
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,980
Here is the convention on
the direction of current

24
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,639
and on the reference direction of the
voltage that will be used in this course ;

25
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,629
we know that physically,

26
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:32,875
the electric current corresponds
to a movement of electric charges,

27
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:38,089
we have here a noted electric current,

28
00:01:38,089 --> 00:01:40,785
we arbitrarily admit that
the direction of the current

29
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:43,079
is the direction of movement
of the positive charges

30
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,368
and thus the reverse of the
movement of negative charges,

31
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:49,797
electrons, for example ;

32
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:52,339
in the establishing of an
electric circuit calculation 

33
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:56,082
this physical direction of the current
is generally unknown at first

34
00:01:56,082 --> 00:02:01,415
and very often we have, for example, an 
alternating current, that periodically reverses itself,

35
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:04,579
thus, the electrical engineer must
attribute to every current

36
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:11,619
of interest a conventional direction,
mathematical and completely arbitrary.

37
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:14,848
In direct current, if the calculations lead
to a positive numerical value

38
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,628
the conventional direction coincides 
with the physical direction

39
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:19,178
and in the case of a negative value

40
00:02:19,178 --> 00:02:23,998
the conventional and physical direction
of current are in opposition ;

41
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:26,229
It is almost of universal use

42
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,842
to indicate in a diagram the mathematical
direction of a current with an arrow

43
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:37,257
generally positioned on the line connecting
different elements, as indicated here.

44
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,760
Thus, the most positive
point of the voltage

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,713
appearing at the terminals of a resistor
crossed by a positive current

46
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:46,768
is located at the current entrance terminal ;

47
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:50,409
so we have, like in the diagram
mentionned here

48
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:56,219
a voltage that is in the same
direction as the current

49
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,259
and then the current comes out
from the resistor, from this side.

50
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:02,309
Similar to electric currents, voltages

51
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:05,849
between terminal pairs in a circuit
are not known at first,

52
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,590
thus they must receive an 
arbitrary mathematical direction ;

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,102
the manner in which the positive
voltage direction is graphically indicated

54
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:16,614
is unfortunately not yet unanimous
amongst electricians

55
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:20,128
despite the efforts of the International
Electrotechnical Commission,

56
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:24,458
this positive direction is generally 
indicated on a circuit diagram

57
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:30,768
either with a pointing arrow,
placed along the element,

58
00:03:30,768 --> 00:03:35,488
as you can see in this drawing,
under " International "

59
00:03:35,488 --> 00:03:41,558
or, by using + and - signs 
like in the central diagram here.

60
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:45,248
The three most frequently encountered
ways in technical litterature 

61
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:48,498
are represented in these three figures
on this diagram,

62
00:03:48,498 --> 00:03:53,289
solutions 1 and 2, I will call
International or Belgium/USA

63
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:56,179
are recommended by the International
Electrotechnical Commission,

64
00:03:56,179 --> 00:04:00,158
the International solution in which
the direction of reference of the voltage

65
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,784
is indicated by a pointing arrow

66
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:06,050
from the point of highest potential
towards the lowest potential

67
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,788
is of customary usage in Switzerland

68
00:04:07,788 --> 00:04:13,679
and will be adopted for the entirety
of this Electrotechnics 1 and 2 MOOC

69
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:16,978
It presents the advantage of guiding
the current and voltage arrows

70
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,749
in the same direction when these values
are of the same sign ;

71
00:04:20,749 --> 00:04:24,305
The middle solution is currently
recommended by the Americans,

72
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,945
and also used in Belgium,

73
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:30,569
and the solution on the right,
essentially used in France,

74
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:37,740
in which the lowest potential points
towards the highest potential

75
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,929
is still frequently used in France,
as I've mentioned,

76
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,429
or in all the countries born from

77
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:49,269
French tradition 
in education.

78
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,439
The authors that use this
kind of reference

79
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,240
must explicitly specify it.

80
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,349
In our case, we shall focus
on the first way of writing

81
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,658
by always writing the current,
as you can see here,

82
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,828
from the highest point
to the lowest point

83
00:05:05,828 --> 00:05:10,390
with the voltage in the same element
following the same direction.

84
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,099
The manner of writing is fundamental

85
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:16,088
to the electric engineer
or electrician,

86
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:21,178
indeed, the manner of writing
conveys information

87
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,472
it is thus a certain form of language.

88
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:27,051
I will give you an example here
especially with the currents,

89
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:30,630
the symbol of the current is i,
We shall also see it later on,

90
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,370
but this letter i can be written
in quite a few ways.

91
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,969
I shall show you several of them here,

92
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:43,729
first of all, a lower-case i such as here
an underlined lower-case i,

93
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:47,809
an upper-case I,
an upper-case I with a hat,

94
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:49,889
an upper-case I with a line,

95
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,960
or also an underlined upper-case I,

96
00:05:53,959 --> 00:06:00,269
we can add one more
another i with a 1.

97
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:05,438
You can see all these ways of writing
an i that, in the end, indicate a current,

98
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:09,899
will have very different meanings ;

99
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:13,349
let's take the first :

100
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:16,949
if we write an i like this,
lower-case,

101
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,499
well, it will mean that the
value is instantaneous,

102
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:26,939
so, an instantaneous current.

103
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:32,900
an underlined current means that
we are using complex number notations,

104
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:40,088
so we have here,
an instantaneous complex current ;

105
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:46,360
an upper-case I will mean
an R.M.S. (Root-Mean-Square) current

106
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,829
or a continuous current ;

107
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:54,459
an i with a hat on top will mean
a peak current or a peak value

108
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:55,988
so, the maximum value,

109
00:06:55,988 --> 00:07:01,459
we will see all of this when we study
single phase AC systems

110
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:09,639
an upper-case I with a line on top
will indicated an average value ;

111
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:17,839
an underlined upper-case I will tell us
that it's an effective value phaser

112
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:18,899
and finally

113
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,758
the last symbol that I've written here
an i with a small 1,

114
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:29,229
means that we have here the the first
harmonic of the current.

115
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:33,778
As you can see, all these conventions
these different ways of writing, convey

116
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:35,999
a different meaning,

117
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,149
it is thus very important,
fundamental even,

118
00:07:39,149 --> 00:07:41,598
that the engineer who is writing,

119
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,418
who's writing the analytical
calculations absolutely follows

120
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:50,899
a way of writing, a convention
allowing others

121
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:56,228
who will continue his work to be able to
follow and understand the steps of the first

122
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:58,210
and understand the writings of the first.

123
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,490
Graphical representation is
also very important

124
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,712
since it will also convey
a certain form of meaning,

125
00:08:05,712 --> 00:08:09,057
through the notations.

126
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:12,232
The first graphical representation
that I would like to show you

127
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:16,458
is a simple conductor that will
like the elements,

128
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:22,379
we will thus draw here a line,

129
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,709
this is a perfect conductor.

130
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:28,869
Why is it perfect ?

131
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:31,559
because we will decide

132
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:39,878
that if we draw a line, like here,
the resistance of this line is null.

133
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:43,709
Thus we make the hypothesis that
it is a null resistance,

134
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:44,946
we make the hypothesis

135
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:49,023
that every time we've drawn
a line to link the components

136
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,980
these lines are all perfect

137
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,940
or convey a current or voltage
in a perfect manner.

138
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:02,410
Through this perfect conductor, a current I,
for example will be able to flow

139
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,769
that I'm drawing here ;

140
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:07,909
another possibility : we have the
possibility of having switchs, 

141
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,079
so for example here,

142
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,580
an open switch

143
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,449
the open switch will mean that
current is no longer flowing,

144
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:25,470
thus in this open switch

145
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:31,320
we are telling the person looking,
interpreting the diagram,

146
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,590
that the resistances is infinite,
no current can flow through.

147
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:42,800
Similarly
the closed switch,

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,490
that will be drawn
in the following manner

149
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,600
and will mean that our resistance
is once again null

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,279
and that all the current is
flowing through the switch

151
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,949
without any problem ;

152
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:01,269
finally, we will be able to draw the elements

153
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,580
we will detail them later

154
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,240
these elements that, for example

155
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,600
are formed by drawing a small
box, a small rectangle,

156
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,570
or two parallel plates,
and so on, 

157
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,659
we will have here some elements

158
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:30,046
and these elements, 
in the end, also represent

159
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:34,093
but we shall see later on that the
empty square represents a resistor,

160
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:38,758
that the two vertical plates
represent a capacitor,

161
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:43,363
and thus convey, behind, the entire physical
aspects linked to these different elements

162
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:49,629
and finally we shall see a way
of having a certain power

163
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:51,692
it's what we will call a supply,

164
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,375
we will define theses supplies
together, later on,

165
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:58,369
but I will already give here the two
fundamental elements of this supply,

166
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,789
supplies are symbolised by a
line with a circle

167
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,409
and we will have here a voltage, for example
for the voltage supply

168
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:15,159
or a circle with a
horizontal line 

169
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,569
for the current supply.

170
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,530
I arrive now at the convention for
supplies that I just told you about

171
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,369
and I've been very careful not
to talk about, at that time

172
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:32,369
at the time when I've defined the voltage,
the voltage supply and the current supply,

173
00:11:32,369 --> 00:11:36,149
not to tell you in which
direction the current flows

174
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:38,442
of course we have the choice
as mentioned earlier,

175
00:11:38,442 --> 00:11:40,035
these are only conventions,

176
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,199
we can decide on either one or the other,

177
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,173
what is very important

178
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:46,309
it's to be constant in the manner of
solving a problem from start to finish

179
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:50,079
and to use the same convention
from start to finish.

180
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,070
We've seen it previously

181
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,300
for an element such as the resistor,

182
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,979
the flowing current will be
written in the following way

183
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:07,990
it enters the resistor R

184
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,170
and the voltage at the terminals
follows the same way direction

185
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,580
as the current in this element.

186
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,159
We can see it here in the 
diagram drawn on your left,

187
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,359
we have a voltage supply
connected to a resistor,

188
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,919
but in this case, in the voltage supply,

189
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:34,839
the current is flowing in the opposite
way, in the direction of the voltage

190
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,149
and this way of doing
and in general,

191
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,079
it is recommended to choose a convention
for the direction known as motor type.

192
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:46,329
systematically
as shown in this diagram ;

193
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:49,830
the motor convention implies
automatically a positive power

194
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,400
when it is consumed,
negative when it is supplied,

195
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:57,070
It's a random choice
of the direction for the voltage and current

196
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,400
but we will settle it
once and for all for this course

197
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,259
because if we change
while solving a problem,

198
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,079
this does not allow a proper
interpretation of the powers.

199
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,380
In this case,

200
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:18,539
we will have in the resistor a voltage
 in the same direction as the current

201
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:23,369
but in the supply, the current is
flowing in the opposite direction ;

202
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:29,260
thus we write P of R
the power in the resistance,

203
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,679
is equal to u0,

204
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,429
in other words, the voltage between the terminals
of R, multiplied by the current I

205
00:13:36,429 --> 00:13:41,929
which will be equal to R times I squared ;

206
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:47,249
for the supply, we will write

207
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:51,149
P of the supply is u0

208
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,409
and here we will have a current
flowing in the opposite direction

209
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,569
or, minus u0 times I

210
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,750
we can see that Ps is equal to minus PR

211
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,213
and as we can see here,

212
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,228
the motor convention implies 
a positive power

213
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:12,523
when it is consumed,

214
00:14:12,523 --> 00:14:14,679
it is what we want
in the resistor,

215
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,559
negative when it is supplied,
it's what we want in the supply ;

216
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,890
thus, from now on and for the entire
Electrotechnics 1 and 2 course

217
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,519
we will use this motor convention
for the supplies

218
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,100
and the international convention for
all passive elements

219
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,860
that we will discover.

220
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,940
In conclusion, we've discovered the 
importance of the units of notations

221
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,519
to be absolutely clear from the 
beginning to the end of a problem

222
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:50,259
and this international manner
of agreeing on a language,

223
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:53,590
a language in its own right,
a universal language,

224
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,373
but to be universal,

225
00:14:55,373 --> 00:15:00,626
it implies being based on a certain
form of international agreement

226
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,810
and we will thus follow the
international conventions of the IEC

227
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,200
for all the conventions of this course.
