00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,090
Hello.

2
00:00:05,301 --> 00:00:07,531
In this course up to now,

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:13,091
we have seen the three linear elements
that are the resistance, the inductance

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:16,964
and the capacitance,
as well as voltage supplies,

5
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:19,537
ideal current supplies.

6
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:22,761
We have also seen various methods
to combine these elements,

7
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:25,281
in series, in parallel,

8
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:28,551
and we saw a few simple circuits.

9
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,811
In today's lesson,

10
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:34,851
we will see resolution methods
for a complete circuit.

11
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:38,311
Today we will initially see the methods to

12
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:43,531
analyse a circuit, which is a sequel of
a series of steps

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:47,301
that let us arrive to the desired result.

14
00:00:47,301 --> 00:00:48,677
In a second part,

15
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:52,243
we will see real voltage and current supplies

16
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:57,481
and finally, we will see the equivalence
between these two supply types.

17
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:04,431
So, the different steps to resolve a
circuit are, firstly,

18
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:10,571
to schematically represent the circuit, 
whether it is given,

19
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:15,961
or transcribed from a wording.

20
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:22,071
We then represent here and example
of a diagram with resistances,

21
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:24,367
and voltage supplies.

22
00:01:24,387 --> 00:01:27,803
[Silence]

23
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:44,019
So, we represent all the circuit's elements: resistors,

24
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:47,229
current supplies, voltage supplies,

25
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:50,329
and eventually other contact points.

26
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,394
We also give a name to these points,

27
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:03,517
for example the circuit's terminals
b and  a,

28
00:02:03,517 --> 00:02:07,321
and once all the elements are represented,

29
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:13,137
we give them a name: the resistor R1,

30
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:18,953
the resistor R2, the resistor
R3 and R4,

31
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:24,771
and here, for example, a resistor RL,
which is a load resistor.

32
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:30,741
We now define the currents and voltages:

33
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:35,024
current I, for example, here,

34
00:02:35,024 --> 00:02:37,287
and then in each branch,

35
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:45,101
we will also give a name to the current
that is going through it: I2, I3,

36
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:50,311
and in the last branch, current IL.

37
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:56,721
In principle, before resolving the problem, 
we do not know in which direction

38
00:02:56,721 --> 00:03:07,151
the current, here: the currents I3, I2 and IL,
will go through the circuit's branch.

39
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,711
So in principle, we choose a direction
for the current.

40
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,611
If the current is chosen a priori, I would say,
as going the wrong way,

41
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:21,151
well we will get a negative numerical value.

42
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:23,601
That is not a problem. However, what is
important,

43
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:28,031
is to define in a coherent way the
voltage drops

44
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:32,881
at the terminals of each elements,
for example here, on the resistance R3,

45
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,161
we will have a voltage drop in the
same direction as the current I3,

46
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:41,221
so, we are obligated to define here a
tension that we will call UR3

47
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,191
in the positive direction like this.

48
00:03:44,548 --> 00:03:47,988
Likewise for the voltage UR4.

49
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:54,961
The voltage UR2 is defined as positive
in the direction of the current,

50
00:03:58,827 --> 00:04:04,187
and the voltage UR1 is also positive
in the current's direction.

51
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:10,071
The last voltage, it is the voltage at the 
terminals of the load,

52
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:15,797
which is going from bottom to top,
from terminal a towards terminal a.

53
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:25,148
We are still missing what the wording
has given us: the voltage supply U,

54
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:31,278
which imposes a voltage in that direction. So,
that is a given problem.

55
00:04:32,612 --> 00:04:37,752
Once all the values have been defined
with a given direction,

56
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:42,122
we can start reducing the diagram.
For example here,

57
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:51,592
we see that we can but the two resistors
R4 and R3 in series

58
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,962
with an equivalent resistors that
we can call R34,

59
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:58,962
which is equal to R3 + R4,

60
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:06,126
and that would replace the two
resistors R3 and R4.

61
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,979
As a reminder, two resistors or
two element are in series

62
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:21,223
when the same current is going through them,

63
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:31,587
[Writes on the blackboard]

64
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:37,959
and two elements are in parallel when they
are connected on the same terminals.

65
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:47,191
[Writes on the blackboard]

66
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:51,924
We can see in our example that 
R3 and R4 are in series

67
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:59,014
since the same current is going through them,
and for example, R2 is not in parallel

68
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:05,704
with R1 because this terminal is the same,
but this one isn't.

69
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:14,452
On the other hand, the equivalent resistor R34
is in parallel with the resistor RL

70
00:06:14,452 --> 00:06:17,782
since they share the same terminals.

71
00:06:17,782 --> 00:06:24,502
We talked today about two types of
simplifications: in series or in parallel,

72
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:28,502
thereafter we will see other simplification methods.

73
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:32,502
We will now analyse the case of a real
voltage supply.

74
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:42,394
It is composed of an ideal voltage
supply, like this,

75
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:49,224
with a value U0, but an ideal voltage
supply never exists alone.

76
00:06:49,224 --> 00:06:51,084
Why? Because we see

77
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:53,924
that if we bypass these voltage supplies,

78
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:58,104
there will be an infinite current
in this bypass

79
00:06:58,104 --> 00:07:02,784
and so the power provided by the supply
would be of U0 times infinity,

80
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:06,664
which has no more physical sense,
and moreover,

81
00:07:06,664 --> 00:07:11,554
we know that there is a zero voltage
at the terminals of a short circuit,

82
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:16,554
we bypass a voltage U0, and a zero voltage,
that makes no sense,

83
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:18,834
neither mathematical, nor physical.

84
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:23,214
So this real voltage supply is always
combined with a resistance

85
00:07:23,214 --> 00:07:26,774
that we call here internal resistor.

86
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:36,262
This internal resistor, we place it in series
with the voltage supply.

87
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,322
Placing it in parallel would again make no sense because

88
00:07:40,322 --> 00:07:46,712
if we bypass the voltage supply, and then

89
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:51,842
the resistor in parallel, we have the same
problematic of infinite power,

90
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:55,842
so we place an internal resistor in series.

91
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:05,297
So this is the ideal supply,

92
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:12,563
this is the internal resistance in series,

93
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:17,691
and the whole makes a real voltage supply.

94
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:33,683
We can define two terminals to this
real voltage supply,

95
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:35,953
boundary a and boundary b.

96
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:41,553
The voltage supply will also be used to
supply a load.

97
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:48,673
We will place here a load resistor
that we will call Re,

98
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:52,673
the subscript e being used for external,
which means that it is an element

99
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:56,673
that is external to the supply,

100
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:04,902
this resistor can be variable,
it can go from zero to infinity,

101
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:09,062
and we show with this arrow here
that it is variable.

102
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:13,953
To follow on, there will be a current that 
settles in the circuit

103
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,593
and that we will call ie.

104
00:09:15,593 --> 00:09:19,013
We can now define all the voltages

105
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,793
at the terminals of our circuit.

106
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:25,983
We have the supply voltage U0,
we have a voltage drop here,

107
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:31,953
on the internal resistor
that we call URi,

108
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:37,263
a voltage that appears at the terminals
of the dipole Uab

109
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:42,003
which is equal to the voltage drop,
the voltage that appears on the boundaries

110
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:45,473
of the external resistor URe.

111
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:54,173
Lets define a positive direction for
the voltage in this loop.

112
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:59,073
We will now characterise this dipole,
this real voltage supply.

113
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:01,393
By Kirchhoff, we can write that:

114
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:07,523
the sum of voltages in a loop is equal to zero.

115
00:10:13,895 --> 00:10:21,025
We apply this to our circuit and we see 
that the real voltage supply

116
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:26,765
minus the voltage drop on our internal
resistor is equal to

117
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:30,765
the external voltage of the circuit
or the dipole.

118
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:40,089
By developing these terms URi and Ue
we get that the voltage supply

119
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:50,219
minus Ri times the current going through it
is equal to the external resistor

120
00:10:50,219 --> 00:10:53,269
times the current.

121
00:10:56,246 --> 00:11:03,836
By developing this equation,
we get that the voltage

122
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:13,856
is equal to ie, which multiplies Re plus Ri,
and this lets us determine the operating

123
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:18,916
point of the circuit, meaning that
the current ie,

124
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:24,826
the current passing through the circuit, 
is equal to the no-load voltage,

125
00:11:24,826 --> 00:11:31,546
or the voltage of the ideal supply,
divided by Re plus Ri.

126
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:38,381
More still, the voltage at the terminals
of the dipole Ue,

127
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:48,291
is equal to U0, the ideal voltage supply,
multiplied by Re over Re + Ri.

128
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:59,291
This equation is simply Re  times
the current ie.

129
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:06,346
ie and Ue give us the operating point.

130
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:10,226
Lets look for the operating limits of this supply,

131
00:12:10,226 --> 00:12:14,766
namely, the extreme cases when the
internal resistor is infinite,

132
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:20,136
which is the case when we have an open circuit.

133
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:27,811
So if Re is equal to infinity,
open circuit,

134
00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:40,169
well the voltage Ue that appears at
the supply's terminals is equal to U0,

135
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:43,359
there is no current in the circuit,
so there is no voltage drop

136
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:47,229
at the terminals of the resistance Ri
and so we find the voltage U0

137
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:53,999
at the terminals of the dipole,
we take about no-load operation,

138
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:58,538
the external current is equal to zero.

139
00:12:58,538 --> 00:13:05,938
Another extreme case, this time if
the internal resistor is equal to zero,

140
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:15,248
we take of a closed circuit,
well  Ue,

141
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:20,538
since the terminals are short-circuited,
is equal to zero.

142
00:13:22,932 --> 00:13:33,462
We are in a short-circuit state in which
the external current is equal to

143
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:36,382
the short-circuit current,
which is the maximum current that can

144
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:40,782
be provided by the supply, and
that is equal to U0 over Ri.

145
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:45,953
If we observe these equations in a plane

146
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:51,543
or in a current-voltage diagram,
we get the following thing:

147
00:13:55,754 --> 00:14:02,004
on the abscissa, we have the current
circulating through the circuit,

148
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:07,994
on the ordinate, we have the voltage that
appears at the terminals of the dipole Ue,

149
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:11,774
at if we take the extreme points,

150
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:15,764
when the external resistor is equal to zero;
we are in an open circuit,

151
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:25,744
we have a voltage that appears of value U0,
which is the no-load operation.

152
00:14:27,988 --> 00:14:32,388
The other extreme case,
when the resistor is zero,

153
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:37,458
we have this point here,
the resistor is null

154
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,128
so the voltage at the terminals
of the circuit is null

155
00:14:40,128 --> 00:14:47,658
and we have here a maximum current,
which is the current icc,

156
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,308
it is the short-circuit operating mode.

157
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:58,789
All the elements of the circuit being linear,

158
00:14:58,789 --> 00:15:04,609
we can trace a line between these two points,

159
00:15:04,609 --> 00:15:08,399
which will give us the characteristics
of the circuit.

160
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:17,500
The operating point will be on this line,

161
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,133
corresponding to a value of ie,

162
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:24,986
and a voltage at the terminals of the circuit

163
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,731
that is equal to Ue.

164
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:35,148
This intersection is the result of the
intersection of two lines,

165
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:40,728
the supply characteristic 

166
00:15:43,418 --> 00:15:51,338
is a line corresponding to the external resistor.

167
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:59,504
This first line corresponds to this equation

168
00:15:59,504 --> 00:16:06,044
and the second line to this equation.

169
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:23,037
We see that the blue curve corresponds to
a no-load voltage

170
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:29,017
from which we subtract Ri times ie,

171
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:41,540
so the slope is equal to minus Ri.

172
00:16:43,806 --> 00:16:50,986
The slope of the second line is equal to Re.

173
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:59,622
The curve 1 is called
characteristic of Ui

174
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:07,162
and the curve 2 is called load line.

175
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:23,102
If we observe here the current-voltage
characteristic of a given

176
00:17:23,102 --> 00:17:27,522
real voltage supply, we see that it
is characterised by

177
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:30,552
a no-load voltage U0,
here of 15 volts,

178
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:32,628
and a slope,

179
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:38,384
having a characteristic whose
slope is given by

180
00:17:38,384 --> 00:17:42,302
the internal resistorRi,
of a given value.

181
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:45,882
If we improve this supply and we
diminish the internal resistor,

182
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:51,892
we get a smaller slope,
a smaller internal resistor.

183
00:17:51,892 --> 00:17:56,062
If we continue to improve this internal resistor,

184
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:02,082
we see that the characteristic slope of
Ui continues to decrease,

185
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,362
we remark that the maximal current

186
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:08,422
provided by the supply is increasing.

187
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:14,212
If we represent, for this last voltage supply,
the load line

188
00:18:14,212 --> 00:18:19,112
that corresponds to the external resistor
that we apply to the dipole,

189
00:18:19,112 --> 00:18:22,902
we see that the operating point is given by
the intersection

190
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:28,772
of the characteristic Ui and
the load line,

191
00:18:28,772 --> 00:18:35,282
the operating point is here,
we observe the output voltage

192
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,382
of the dipole and the current
passing through this dipole.

193
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:47,394
If we change the load, and so the
circuit's resistance, 

194
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:55,094
in this example we increase the load, 
and so we diminish the resistance,

195
00:18:55,094 --> 00:19:01,914
we see that the voltage at the terminals of the
dipole falls and that the current increases.

196
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:06,194
If we continue to increase the load, 
so we continue tu decrease the resistance,

197
00:19:06,194 --> 00:19:09,914
well the voltage at the terminals of
the dipole will continue to fall

198
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:13,754
and the current will continue to increase.

199
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:18,343
We note here the voltage drop on
the internal resistor.

200
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:22,103
Lets now look at the case of a real current supply.

201
00:19:22,103 --> 00:19:28,803
So the real current supply is composed
of an ideal current supply

202
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:36,323
in parallel, this time, with an internal resistor,

203
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:38,223
that we call Rp.

204
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:44,053
The value of this current supply is icc.

205
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,390
This constitutes a dipole that has
two poles a and b,

206
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,890
and that we call real current supply.

207
00:20:06,024 --> 00:20:09,204
We note this time that the resistor
is in parallel; why?

208
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:14,614
Because if we had put it in series, the
current supply imposing

209
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:19,524
a current icc, well, in the case of
a short-circuit, for example,

210
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:22,834
on the supply, would lead to
a physical impossibility of having

211
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:29,064
an infinite power, so we put this
resistor Rp in parallel.

212
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:33,124
We can do the same steps as for the 
real voltage supply,

213
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:40,284
we will just do it a little bit faster by 
using this time

214
00:20:40,284 --> 00:20:46,324
Kirchhoff's current law in one point,
this point,

215
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:53,854
where we can write that the current ip
going through this branch

216
00:20:53,854 --> 00:21:01,484
when we supply an external resistor 
Re being passed by 

217
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:10,174
a current ie, which creates
a voltage drop URe

218
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:15,194
on the external resistor,
voltage that we will also find

219
00:21:15,194 --> 00:21:18,524
between these points and these points.

220
00:21:23,002 --> 00:21:35,022
On this knot n here, we can say that icc
is equal to ip plus ie.

221
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:47,256
We can put the resistors Rp and
Re, in parallel,

222
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:54,683
which gives us a resistance, that
we call Req for equivalent,

223
00:21:54,683 --> 00:22:09,233
which is the product of the sum,
and which make the voltage at the terminals

224
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:20,443
of the circuit, the voltage Ue, equal to
the current icc

225
00:22:20,443 --> 00:22:28,653
that passes through the resistorReq,
which is then equal to Req multiplied by icc.

226
00:22:31,656 --> 00:22:38,676
We can also write that ie is equal
to Ue over Re.

227
00:22:38,676 --> 00:22:42,676
Once again, to characterise this supply,
if we take the extreme cases,

228
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:49,626
namely if the load resistor is equal to zero,

229
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:56,276
we have a current ie which 
is equal to the current icc,

230
00:22:56,276 --> 00:23:03,276
we are in the case of a maximal current

231
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:09,006
that the supply can provide,
we are once again in short-circuit.

232
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:18,648
The other extreme case, if the external
resistor is equal to infinity,

233
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:24,528
well we have an external current equal to zero

234
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:39,028
and a voltage at the terminals of the dipole ab,
where Ue which is equal to Re multiplied by icc,

235
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:45,538
is also the maximum voltage that can appear
at the terminals of the dipole,

236
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:49,222
and we are in the case of an open circuit.

237
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:57,512
Lets graphically represent the 
characteristic Ui of this supply.

238
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:06,458
Of we represent Ue on the abscissa
and ie on the ordinate,

239
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:12,548
we have a maximum current,
equal to icc,

240
00:24:12,548 --> 00:24:20,918
a maximal voltage which is given here
and is equal to Rp times icc,

241
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:29,981
we have the no-load mode 
and here the short-circuit mode.

242
00:24:32,697 --> 00:24:37,017
Once again, everything being linear,
we can connect these two points

243
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,047
to get the current-voltage characteristic

244
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:47,727
with an intersection point with the external
resistor which is given by

245
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:53,847
the intersection of the two curves,
the characteristic and the load line,

246
00:24:53,847 --> 00:25:00,567
for the operating points
Ue and ie.

247
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:04,229
We will now see what we can do to make

248
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:07,459
these two types of supplies equivalent.

249
00:25:07,459 --> 00:25:11,619
I redraw the diagram of the real voltage
supply here,

250
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:19,069
with a no-load voltage U0,
and an internal resistance Ri,

251
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:24,389
a voltage at the terminals of the circuit
equal to Ue,

252
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:32,529
and a load Re which means that a
current ie is passing through the circuit.

253
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:41,142
For the current supply, we have here
a current supply equal to icc,

254
00:25:41,142 --> 00:25:47,132
an internal resistor in parallel,

255
00:25:47,132 --> 00:25:54,922
which form the supply's dipole,
at which appears a voltage

256
00:25:54,922 --> 00:26:00,842
at the terminals when we connect an
internal resistor Re

257
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:02,752
and a current ie passing through.

258
00:26:02,752 --> 00:26:07,742
If we look at the short-circuit current

259
00:26:07,742 --> 00:26:11,462
in both cases,
well the short-circuit current,

260
00:26:11,462 --> 00:26:15,842
that we call ie0 for the voltage supply,

261
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:24,252
this current ie is equal to U0 divided by
the internal resistor,

262
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:32,832
when this resistor Re is equal to zero.

263
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:39,832
In the case of the current supply, when
the resistor Re  is equal to zero,

264
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:47,372
well the short-circuit current
is equal to icc,

265
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:51,102
all the current passes through the external resistor.

266
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,883
When looking at the no-load voltages,

267
00:26:54,883 --> 00:26:59,066
so when the external resistor is infinite,

268
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:06,040
well the no-load voltage that
we call infinite Ue,

269
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,040
is equal to U0 in the case of a real
voltage supply. Why?

270
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,210
Because the current ie being null,
there is no voltage drop

271
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,400
at the terminals of Ri and we will
find again the voltage U0

272
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,530
at the terminals of the circuit Ue.

273
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:31,145
In the case of the current supply, the
no-load voltage is equal to Rp times icc,

274
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:36,695
it is the voltage that appears at the
circuit terminals

275
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:38,025
when the resistor is infinite,

276
00:27:38,025 --> 00:27:39,665
namely when there is no current here,

277
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:42,095
all the current passes through the resistor Rp

278
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:46,625
and so the no-load voltage at the terminals
 of Rp is equal to icc times Rp.

279
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:51,895
So for these two supplies to be equivalent,
the two short-circuit

280
00:27:51,895 --> 00:27:55,725
current must be equal,
first condition,

281
00:27:55,725 --> 00:28:04,975
so U0 over Ri must be equal to icc,
second condition,

282
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:09,085
the two no-load voltages must also be equal,

283
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:14,725
so U0 must be equal to Rp to icc.

284
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:27,900
In summary, we get the equivalence if
Ri is equal to Rp.

285
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:37,546
This means that when we have an ideal
voltage supply,

286
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:42,202
with an internal resistor Ri,

287
00:28:42,202 --> 00:28:49,050
ideal voltage supply U0,
that form a real voltage supply,

288
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,940
well we can transform in,
and conversely,

289
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:01,893
with an ideal current supply of value icc

290
00:29:03,043 --> 00:29:07,326
with an internal resistor Ri

291
00:29:09,846 --> 00:29:17,800
by applying the following relation:
icc is equal to U0 over Ri.

292
00:29:19,475 --> 00:29:23,621
Inversely, if we have a real current supply,

293
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:26,557
we can transform it into a real voltage supply

294
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:30,065
by placing a resistor in parallel
and a resistance in series

295
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:32,085
and by transforming this current supply

296
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:37,605
in a voltage supply of value
Ri times ic.

297
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:42,195
There, after having seen all the
simple elements individually,

298
00:29:42,195 --> 00:29:46,305
we have the tools to master a complete circuit.

299
00:29:46,305 --> 00:29:49,885
We have seen the method to
process a circuit

300
00:29:49,885 --> 00:29:52,115
and the analysis that are possible to do.

301
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:57,615
Thereafter, we will see new circuit
transformation methods.
