00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:07,505
Hello and welcome to this lesson
dedicated to the main elements of a circuit

2
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:11,233
and in particular, dedicated to
voltage and current supplies

3
00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:14,115
which will be the primordial
elements to supply energy

4
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:16,576
to our different
circuit elements.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,292
We will, after the introduction,
see the notations of circuit models,

6
00:00:20,292 --> 00:00:23,984
see how these voltage and current
supplies can be defined.

7
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:27,826
We will then study the different
basic components and, finally,

8
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:31,600
in this lesson, how we can
model a complete circuit.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,483
First of all, we will define a
relatively simple notion :

10
00:00:35,483 --> 00:00:36,921
the "dipole" ;

11
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:39,535
respectively "tripole"
and "quadripole".

12
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:42,165
What is a dipole ?
It's a component

13
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:44,489
which will have two terminals.

14
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,134
Hence, we can model
or draw it easily.

15
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,850
It's a "bloc", like this,

16
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,656
on which there are two terminals.

17
00:00:53,656 --> 00:00:56,462
This can be an element
such as a resistor,

18
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:59,126
a capacitance, an inductance...

19
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:01,675
It can also be a supply.

20
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,080
The tripole, by evidence related
to the definition of the dipole,

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,587
is an element which
will have 3 terminals.

22
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:13,173
We can mainly find it
in three-phase circuits

23
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:17,409
when the components linked
to the three-phase system

24
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,920
will include three impedances.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,563
So, for example, a circuit

26
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:27,943
which we will observe
in the later lessons,

27
00:01:27,943 --> 00:01:29,567
with three terminals.

28
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:32,228
So here, for example, is a tripole.

29
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:35,040
And finally, a quadrupole, which will have

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,870
- this is a little more complicated -

31
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,409
four terminals that enter
the quadrupole,

32
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,370
rarer, but also possible

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,520
with a "two entrances/
two exits" circuit

34
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,008
or vice versa,

35
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:52,288
that we will write or
define as a quadrupole.

36
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:54,658
The first element
that we will define,

37
00:01:54,658 --> 00:01:56,930
fundamental when defining

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:00,948
an equivalent model
of an electric circuit :

39
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:02,864
the voltage supply.

40
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:07,631
The voltage supply is,
by convention,

41
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:10,770
drawn in the following
way, in other words a circle

42
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:15,613
crossed by two vertical lines
and two terminals.

43
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:18,291
So we typically have here a dipole,

44
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,170
drawn with an arrow from
up to down : the voltage.

45
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,261
We then have, here at this terminal,

46
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:28,142
the ground or neutral

47
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:32,794
or the lowest part in the
difference of potential.

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,786
We will then write :
the lowest end.

49
00:02:37,385 --> 00:02:40,711
And on the other hand, at the top,

50
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:43,771
the part with the highest potential,

51
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,938
and by definition, in the supply,

52
00:02:47,938 --> 00:02:51,644
with the conventions that we've seen
during the first lessons of this MOOC,

53
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:55,453
when the voltages goes from
the highest to lowest point,

54
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:59,932
the current flows from bottom
to top as shown in this diagram.

55
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:02,817
We then have here
a load circuit,

56
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:05,695
in other words, we connect
to this voltage course a resistor,

57
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,760
capacitor, or any other element,

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,010
or a combination
of these different elements,

59
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,552
and on your right,
you have a graph

60
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:16,616
which allows you
to notice the current

61
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:20,305
that this supply is outputting

62
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:23,023
as a function of the voltage.

63
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:25,570
We discover then a phenomenon,

64
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,200
or, let us say, the strange
characteristics of this supply,

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,400
which is that this supply
produces the same voltage

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,000
- it is constant - no matter the
amount of current it outputs.

67
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,714
It is obvious that such a thing
does not exist in nature.

68
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:43,010
It is impossible, no matter the
current outputted by this supply,

69
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:49,019
to, in the end, be able to have
a strictly constant voltage.

70
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,683
Hence, this is a supply
which we will call ideal.

71
00:03:55,927 --> 00:04:00,686
It does not exist, we could say,
quote, "in real life".

72
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:05,540
Thus, it does not represent a
proper model of the voltage supply

73
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,272
that we can find in the art,

74
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:13,011
like a battery, battery cells,
or a normal power supply.

75
00:04:13,011 --> 00:04:16,560
This supply will, in
fact, have its voltage

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,680
change with the
outputted current.

77
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,350
So we will define this
ideal voltage supply,

78
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,360
in the following way,

79
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,120
We have a voltage 
with two terminals.

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,580
We know that this supply is ideal.

81
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:40,864
[dictates] "It does not exist
in real life"

82
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,339
But it will be
immensely helpful

83
00:04:45,339 --> 00:04:48,360
for the modelling
of the real one,

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,367
or we shall call it
real voltage supply,

85
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,856
when we will talk about it soon.

86
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,557
An important element is,
in fact, the short-circuit.

87
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,705
A special, or
particular, case :

88
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,135
[dictates] the short-circuit

89
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:07,185
What is a short-circuit ?

90
00:05:07,185 --> 00:05:08,978
Well, let us take a supply,

91
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:14,626
a voltage, U, an outputted current as such

92
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:19,684
and we will connect this supply to a wire

93
00:05:19,684 --> 00:05:23,382
and thus, we short-circuit
our supply.

94
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:29,532
Well in this case, the current 
- since I'm using the previous graph -

95
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,233
I have a nondescript voltage
no matter the current,

96
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,302
and this current is supposedly
always identical to U.

97
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:42,387
But, this is impossible since,
if I make a short-circuit

98
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:46,121
the voltage that I have here is zero volts.

99
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,740
And we can already see
here a first problem

100
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:55,002
and thus we see the impossibility

101
00:05:57,058 --> 00:06:01,062
of having this type
of supply in real life.

102
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,354
We can do the same 
with the current supply.

103
00:06:03,354 --> 00:06:05,345
It's even more difficult to imagine

104
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:10,789
since the current supply is not
a usual element in practice,

105
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,189
in the usage of electricity,
we often mention voltage supplies

106
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,735
but rarely current supplies. 

107
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:19,561
We shall see later on, while studying
the theorems of Thevenin and of Norton

108
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:24,484
that, in the end, it's two way
to model the same thing. 

109
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,250
But the idea of the current supply
is to have an object defined as

110
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,100
once again, as a circle,

111
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,496
but this time not with a vertical
line but with a horizontal one

112
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:37,122
and a current flow,
defined by the supply itself

113
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:41,195
and at the terminals, then,
will appear a voltage.

114
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:44,337
To this current supply we
will also be able to

115
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:47,320
define - or connect, sorry -
a load circuit.

116
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,599
and you have here, once
again on your right,

117
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,830
a voltage - current graph.

118
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,698
The current is defined by the supply

119
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:58,377
and we can see that no matter
the current drawn from the load,

120
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,088
once again, the voltage
will adapt here.

121
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,539
It's once again,
like previously,

122
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,570
an element impossible
to have in real life.

123
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,480
So we shall call this
current supply

124
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:10,901
an ideal supply :

125
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,240
that does not
exist in real life.

126
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,940
So, to redo the
same diagram,

127
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,760
we have here a current supply
with a current i,

128
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,491
I have this dipole

129
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:26,793
and let's imagine
that I connect...

130
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:30,095
Better, I do not connect this
supply to anything at all.

131
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:32,947
By definition, it not possible
to have any current flowing.

132
00:07:32,947 --> 00:07:36,277
However, we just saw in
the previous diagram

133
00:07:37,696 --> 00:07:40,629
that the current is
drawn, no matter what

134
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:43,505
I connect here to the terminals of the supply.

135
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,726
Thus, an open circuit,

136
00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:51,891
or in other words, we don't connect anything :

137
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:59,872
[dictates] The current should be null.

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,910
But it is impossible, here,

139
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,354
using our definition of
this current supply.

140
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:12,644
Thus, we once again have,
here this impossibility

141
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:19,002
and we will need to model 
differently the real current supply

142
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:20,508
that we will encounter.

143
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,087
So, in the end, how to change
this ideal voltage supply

144
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,581
into a real voltage supply

145
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:28,221
that corresponds to what
we have in the art ?

146
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,520
Well, easily,

147
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,736
by adding a resistor following
the ideal voltage supply.

148
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:37,656
I will show you
the result.

149
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:39,048
So we have, first of all,

150
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:43,583
our supply of voltage U

151
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:48,990
followed by a resistor
that we will call Ri.

152
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,532
Why Ri ?

153
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:54,040
Because it's the internal Resistance  of the supply.

154
00:08:54,873 --> 00:09:01,026
Here is our new dipole 
which characterizes here,

155
00:09:01,712 --> 00:09:03,060
in all,

156
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:08,962
this will be
my real supply.

157
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:12,223
So we will try to convince
ourselves of it

158
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:14,760
to be sure that we've
made the right choice.

159
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,104
So first of all we will write,
here, a Uo at the supply

160
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:24,649
to properly say that this supply Uo
is the ideal voltage supply.

161
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,953
While using this supply,
we will never have

162
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:33,093
this Uo voltage at
the terminals of the U circuit,

163
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,240
and this U supply

164
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,498
which will be the real voltage that
the user we will see from the supply.

165
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,442
So we define :

166
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,010
first of all Uo will be

167
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:48,366
[dictates] the value of the ideal supply

168
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:53,453
Ri will be, as we've mentioned
previously, by definition

169
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:56,425
[dictates] the internal resistance

170
00:09:58,247 --> 00:10:00,406
of the ideal supply.

171
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:06,051
And finally, U will be
[dictates] the value

172
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:11,987
of the voltage of the real supply.

173
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:19,365
Thus, if we apply Kirchhoff to this
small simple element by using U,

174
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:24,065
Uo and the voltage drop
at the terminals of the resistor Ri,

175
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:28,902
we can write, knowing that the
sum of voltages will be null,

176
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,280
by going around clockwise,

177
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,844
we have -Uo + Ri x I.

178
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:40,424
I will write I upper-case by using
the convention that, here,

179
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,090
we have a continuous, or direct, current

180
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,045
and with an I that is like this.

181
00:10:46,737 --> 00:10:52,669
Thus - Uo + Ri x I + U = O.

182
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:58,724
If we put all of this back together,
we have that the real voltage supply U

183
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:03,515
is equal to Uo - Ri x I

184
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:10,163
This, by definition, is
the real voltage supply.

185
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:14,470
So I mentioned earlier that
there was an impossibility in 

186
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,033
the ideal voltage supply.

187
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,840
Let's try to see, now, if we
managed to properly model it,

188
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,281
we should no longer
find any impossibility.

189
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,872
So we will make a small graph
of this voltage supply

190
00:11:25,872 --> 00:11:29,794
with here, again, U and I.

191
00:11:29,794 --> 00:11:34,640
First of all, we can notice that
when I is null, U equals Uo.

192
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,219
So at first, we will find
ourselves, for example, here.

193
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,962
At the end, in other words when U
equals zero in a short circuit

194
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:50,394
we have that U equals zero.

195
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:56,603
Thus, we have Uo - Ri x I

196
00:11:57,421 --> 00:11:58,692
equal to zero.

197
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:04,341
and thus Uo = Ri x I

198
00:12:04,814 --> 00:12:08,902
and finally, this short-circuit current,

199
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,456
I will add CC in subscript,

200
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:14,906
is equal to Uo / Ri.

201
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:20,080
This Uo / Ri can be,
for example here,

202
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,845
Uo / Ri is my particular
short-circuit current

203
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:29,715
and between the two
I have a line

204
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:33,176
which allows me

205
00:12:34,161 --> 00:12:40,028
to define the characteristics
of the ideal voltage supply. 

206
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:42,279
And you can see that it corresponds,

207
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,520
relatively differently, since 
instead of having a horizontal line

208
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,472
with a permanent voltage
no matter the current,

209
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:50,454
I have a voltage that diminishes

210
00:12:50,454 --> 00:12:52,816
as a function of the current rise

211
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,618
until, finally, a value,

212
00:12:55,618 --> 00:13:00,560
where this voltage at the terminals
of the real voltage is equal to zero.

213
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,323
In this case, the supply is
completely short circuited.

214
00:13:03,323 --> 00:13:06,082
and the short-circuit current,
in other words, the maximum current

215
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:07,800
that this supply can output

216
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,552
is Uo / Ri.

217
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:13,353
Thus we've defined here
a model that corresponds

218
00:13:13,353 --> 00:13:16,444
rather correctly and faithfully

219
00:13:16,444 --> 00:13:19,024
to what we can
find in reality.

220
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,503
This real voltage supply
that we have just defined,

221
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:23,640
we can do the same thing
with the current supply

222
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,924
which will then become
a real current supply

223
00:13:25,924 --> 00:13:28,116
and by definition

224
00:13:29,204 --> 00:13:31,417
this real current supply,

225
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:35,114
will be, similarly, a current I,

226
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:41,810
transformed by the addition
in parallel of an internal resistance. 

227
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,604
Here again, this element, or this bloc,

228
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:49,330
becomes a real current supply.

229
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:55,280
Here also, the impossibility that was there,

230
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,520
earlier, in open circuit,

231
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,788
allows us to perfectly, correctly
model this phenomenon

232
00:14:01,788 --> 00:14:04,800
since by not having anything
connected here to this supply

233
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,268
the current outputted 
by the supply I

234
00:14:08,268 --> 00:14:11,012
will simply flow through
the internal resistor.

235
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:13,975
It's the way to properly model

236
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,850
this real current supply.

237
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,354
We will also see in
in the later chapters,

238
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:22,115
that this real voltage supply
and this real current supply

239
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:25,036
have an equivalence,
can be equal,

240
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,510
and this equivalence,

241
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,764
we will discover
that it is present

242
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:33,604
if this internal resistor is
the same for the voltage supply

243
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:35,892
and the current supply.

244
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:40,980
Thus, this model describes reality.

245
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,300
This brings me to
the last element

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,171
that I wanted to talk
to you about in this lesson,

247
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:48,914
it's how to model a complete circuit,

248
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:50,992
with the elements of this circuit

249
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:54,382
and with a voltage
supply like Uo here.

250
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:58,490
Once again, I will remind you of
the notations and definitions

251
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,402
linked to what we have agreed
upon as a convention of signs.

252
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,706
We've agreed that with the supply

253
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:07,694
that goes from the highest
to lowest potential,

254
00:15:07,694 --> 00:15:10,051
the current flows
in the opposite direction.

255
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:15,255
And in the elements, the voltage for example,
at the terminals of this resistor

256
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,761
is in the same direction as the current.

257
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:21,049
Similarly here, the voltage at
the terminals of the inductor.

258
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,696
We have here the current, so the voltage
at the terminals of this inductor

259
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,267
will, again -we will write
in subscript L1, L2 -

260
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:31,714
here we have again Ur,
but we will write " 2 ".

261
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,022
We have here the U of a capacitor.

262
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:40,280
And finally, the voltage here
for the third inductor, L3.

263
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,237
This finally allows us,

264
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:46,008
with the help of simple conventions
and with proper writing,

265
00:15:46,008 --> 00:15:48,271
to apply Kirchhoff's equations.

266
00:15:48,271 --> 00:15:52,715
But it is fundamental for that
to have a unified convention

267
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,040
which allows us to not reverse
things from one mesh to another,

268
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,918
which would absolutely falsify

269
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,640
the resulting equations, when we are
using Kirchhoff's equations.

270
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,633
To finish and to conclude,
I would like to remind you

271
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,982
that the models for the ideal
voltage and current supplies

272
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:12,718
must, in the end, be
completed, as we've seen,

273
00:16:12,718 --> 00:16:16,476
with an internal resistance
to render it real.

274
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:20,706
So either by putting a serial
resistor for the voltage supply

275
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:23,288
or by placing a parallel one
for current supplies.

276
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:27,330
Then, the direction of currents
and voltages in a complete diagram

277
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,131
as we've seen just here, at the end,

278
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:31,945
must follow a predefined direction.

279
00:16:31,945 --> 00:16:34,301
You can also define this direction yourself.

280
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:38,309
There isn't a right or wrong 
direction, what is needed is to

281
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:42,757
have a single way of doing things from
start to finish when analysing your circuit.

282
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:44,053
Thank you.
