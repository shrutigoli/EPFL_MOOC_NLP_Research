1
00:00:04,043 --> 00:00:05,230
Hello.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:07,717
During this lesson, we will
present a method

3
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:10,574
that lets us handle tripoles.

4
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:14,400
We will consider partial circuits
composed of three elements.

5
00:00:15,164 --> 00:00:17,536
We will first see particular circuits

6
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:22,728
whose element are difficult to combine
or to simplify two by two.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,058
We will then consider three elements

8
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:28,267
that can be connected

9
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,648
either in "pi"

10
00:00:30,648 --> 00:00:32,535
or in "T".

11
00:00:32,535 --> 00:00:37,401
Then, we will see the equivalence between
these two types of circuits

12
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,564
in order to easily pass from one
to the other

13
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:44,418
and to then simplify the rest
of the circuit.

14
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:48,851
We will treat an example

15
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:51,598
and then formulate a conclusion.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,600
If we consider these two
circuit examples,

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,714
we can see that they are
difficult to simplify.

18
00:00:56,714 --> 00:00:57,829
Why? Because

19
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,226
if we consider this first circuit,

20
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:07,940
we see that the elements
are not in series

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,860
for R31 and R32.
Why?

22
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,579
Because there is an additional current
coming here, and so

23
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:16,527
it is more difficult to simplify the circuit. 

24
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:19,172
Ideally, for this circuit,

25
00:01:22,488 --> 00:01:25,419
that presents about the same topology.

26
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,839
We will see a method

27
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,703
letting us transform these circuits

28
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:32,051
for simplification later on.

29
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,505
We can evidently resolve these circuits

30
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:38,320
by applying Kirchoff's law at the
knots and loops,

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,611
but we will see a much simpler method.

32
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,726
Three elements can be connected between
them in two ways.

33
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:45,386
First way,

34
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:47,811
is a "π" connection

35
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,610
such as represented in the first figure.

36
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:54,349
We understand this notation
because the circuit

37
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:57,455
looks like a capital π.

38
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,187
If we represent this same connection,

39
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,818
drawn a little differently,

40
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,520
we see that it resembles a triangle,

41
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,947
which is why we also talk of "delta" connection.

42
00:02:08,947 --> 00:02:12,190
We also use this notation,

43
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:15,057
the greek delta Δ

44
00:02:15,057 --> 00:02:19,501
and in French literature, we rather talk
of a connexion en triangle.

45
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:22,806
The second method to connect
three elements between them

46
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:24,959
is the "T" connection. 

47
00:02:26,034 --> 00:02:31,204
On this drawing, we easily understand
why we give it such a name,

48
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,011
because the connection resembles
the letter T.

49
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:37,163
We also call it a "Y" connection

50
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:38,283
or a "star" connection.

51
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:42,543
On this drawing, we see that
the same equivalent drawing

52
00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:45,308
resembles a Y shape.

53
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,996
In French, we talk about "connexion en étoile".

54
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,442
On this drawing, we represent the
two connections:

55
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,410
either in "T", or in "π".

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,258
We see that they are tripoles

57
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,871
with a first pole here,

58
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:01,880
a second pole and a third pole.

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,923
On the second representation,
we find these same poles.

60
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:08,437
Between these tripoles,

61
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:12,291
we connect the three elements,
three resistors in this example as it happens.

62
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:18,497
In T, we have a resistor R1
connected to the terminal 1;

63
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,199
a resistor R2 connected
to the terminal 2;

64
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,011
a resistor R3 connected
to the terminal 3.

65
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,930
In delta or in π,

66
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,085
we once again have
three elements:

67
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:32,873
R1-2 which is connected
at the terminals 1 and 2,

68
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:36,873
and so forth, the resistor 2-3 is
connected at the terminals 2 and 3

69
00:03:36,873 --> 00:03:41,686
and the resistor 31 is connected
at the terminals 3 and 1.

70
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:45,161
What we would like to do here,
is find an equivalence

71
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,810
between the resistors R1, R2, R3

72
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,674
and the resistors R12, R23, R31

73
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:54,024
so that both circuits are identical.

74
00:03:54,438 --> 00:03:57,850
To do so, we will proceed
in the following manner:

75
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,603
lets first consider that this terminal 3
doesn't exist,

76
00:04:04,923 --> 00:04:10,863
and we will write the equation of the resistance
seen at the terminals 1 and 2

77
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:13,487
so that they are equivalent.

78
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:18,017
We can write that, here,  the
equivalent resistance,

79
00:04:18,017 --> 00:04:21,097
they are in series since we deleted
the terminal number 3,

80
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:26,351
R1 + R2

81
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:28,320
must be equal to

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,254
this equivalent resistance

83
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:35,668
in the π connection at
the terminals 1 and 2.

84
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:39,138
And we see that these two resistors are in series,

85
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,851
since this terminal is cancelled out,

86
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:47,269
this equivalent resistance is in
parallel with the resistor R12.

87
00:04:47,269 --> 00:04:50,395
So we can write that the
equivalent resistance is:

88
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:54,387
the product of this resistor over
the sum of these two

89
00:04:54,387 --> 00:04:57,593
divided by the sum of this resistor
over the sum of these ones.

90
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:01,104
We then write that R12

91
00:05:01,104 --> 00:05:05,573
multiplied by R23 + R31

92
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:09,705
divided by the sum of these
three resistors

93
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,757
needs to be equal to R1 + R2.

94
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,993
We repeat, here, the
result obtained

95
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,948
for the first equation

96
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:24,748
and if we proceed in an identical way

97
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,914
for the boundary pairs 2 and 3,

98
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:30,563
and 3 and 1, we get two
extra equations.

99
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,247
We are not making the development,
but the method is the same.

100
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,909
Two supplementary equations,

101
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,335
that give a system of three independent
equations with three unknowns,

102
00:05:40,335 --> 00:05:42,998
from which we easily extract the
equivalence relationships

103
00:05:42,998 --> 00:05:45,259
that let us replace a circuit in π

104
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,348
with a circuit in T.

105
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:51,998
We just need to do the sum 
of these three equations.

106
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:57,673
So, lets take 0.5 times the first equation,

107
00:05:57,673 --> 00:06:00,131
minus equation 2,

108
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:03,393
plus equation 3.

109
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,211
Having done all calculations, we
fall on this system of three equations

110
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:12,086
letting us pass from one circuit
to the other.

111
00:06:13,134 --> 00:06:16,361
The resistor linked to the
terminal 1

112
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,833
of the circuit in T

113
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,044
is the product of two resistors linked
to the terminal 1 of the circuit in π,

114
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,518
so R12 and R31 here,

115
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,177
divided by the sum of
the three resistors.

116
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:35,546
And so forth for the resistors R2 and R3.

117
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:39,775
By doing a similar calculation at
the terminals pair

118
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,531
when the third one is
disconnected,

119
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:44,004
we get the equivalence relationships

120
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:48,312
that let us replace the elements
of a circuit in T

121
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:50,540
by a circuit in π.

122
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,345
These equations written in a slightly
different manner

123
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:58,157
give the ratio of

124
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:04,233
T double vector product of two
resistors taken two by two

125
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:09,533
R1 x R3 + R2 x R3

126
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:12,364
+ R1 x R2

127
00:07:13,075 --> 00:07:17,292
divided by the resistor R3.

128
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,972
Let take the example that
we mentioned

129
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,501
at the very beginning of the lesson.

130
00:07:22,501 --> 00:07:24,980
If we consider this circuit,

131
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:32,262
with this tripole composed
of three resistors,

132
00:07:32,262 --> 00:07:37,801
well we can favourably replace it
by this equivalent

133
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,170
circuit

134
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:47,722
from which we can calculate
the resistors R1, R2 and R3,

135
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:50,531
by using the equations that we
developed, 

136
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,453
namely the transformation from T to π.

137
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:58,769
It then becomes easy to calculate
the equivalent resistors

138
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:03,043
since the resistor R3 and the
resistor R4 are in series.

139
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:06,599
The resistor R2 and the
resistor R4 too, 

140
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:09,986
that are in parallel,

141
00:08:09,986 --> 00:08:12,745
and that we can put in series with R1.

142
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:15,787
We obtain the result for the
equivalent resistance

143
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,245
of the whole circuit

144
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:18,600
that is equal to

145
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:24,375
R = R1 + 

146
00:08:27,187 --> 00:08:29,107
these two equivalent resistances

147
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:30,225
in parallel,

148
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:32,155
so their product over their sum.

149
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,447
The product of these two resistors
in series

150
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:39,752
gives R2 + R24

151
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:46,828
multiplied by R3 + R34

152
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:51,660
divided by the sum of these two
equivalent resistances,

153
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,169
namely 

154
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,298
R2 + R4

155
00:08:57,298 --> 00:09:02,274
+ R3 + R34.

156
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:05,212
This is the final result.

157
00:09:05,707 --> 00:09:09,977
Lets also note that we could have
seen the problem differently

158
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,647
by considering this time

159
00:09:11,647 --> 00:09:14,580
these three elements, here,

160
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,120
which are three resistors connected in T

161
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,041
and that we could have
transformed in π

162
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:25,913
and also easily simplify the circuit.

163
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:28,133
We won't do the calculation here.

164
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:32,492
There, we have considered the case
of three elements

165
00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:37,869
that are connected either in π,
either in T at its three boundaries.

166
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,918
We have the equivalence
letting us pass

167
00:09:40,918 --> 00:09:44,548
from a π connection to 
a T connection.

168
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:50,142
All this in the aim of simplifying this
circuit and continuing to reduce it.

169
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:53,194
We will see that this method
is very important

170
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:55,310
for three-phase systems

171
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,675
that we will cover in the next semester.
