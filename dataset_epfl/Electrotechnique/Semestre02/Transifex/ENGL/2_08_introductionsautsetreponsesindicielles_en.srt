00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,900
Hello, to this point, we have only dealt with

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,270
steady state power supply in this electrotechnology class,
 which means

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,200
that the excitations of the circuit , whether 
currents or voltage, are supposed

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,920
to be established since an infinite time

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,300
 whether it is continuous rating which generates continuous currents

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,770
and voltages, or sinusoidal steady state, which generates

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:27,199
sinusoidal currents and voltages.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,929
Is defined as transient state every
 state change in a system 

9
00:00:31,929 --> 00:00:33,470
which the corresponding disturbance

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,160
is a length similar or inferior to the

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,729
biggest

12
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:40,410
time constant of the system.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,630
The most frequent case matches
 with the interlock or the triggering

14
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,389
of the RLC circuit

15
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,570
on its power supply.

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,500
But it could also be a breakdown, a dysfunction or

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
a particular functionning as those used in

18
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,160
many common electronic devices.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,800
Calculation methods developed 
until today are not valid anymore

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,260
because it is not a continuous rating

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,240
nor an alternatif rating with only one frequency.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,030
New calculation methods will be established.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,720
Mathematically speaking, the interlock

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,630
is transcribed by a function called 

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,820
"Out-of-Step".

26
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,950
that we will name ε(t) which can take for value 1 or 0.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,440
We will see how does a resistor, a capacitor

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,130
or an inductance behaves, if we send in a jump.

29
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,300
We will now calculate their step response.

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,800
We will set 2 rules to govern those
 phenomenons.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,329
Finally, we will present you 

32
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,910
a method to solve a given problem.

33
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:50,910
The out of step is defined as a time function.

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,550
This function is called ε(t).

35
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,300
Its value is zero for a time between
 minus infinity and 0.

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,590
It goes instantly 

37
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,459
to the value 1 at the time t=0, 
and is equal to 1

38
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,029
for a time 

39
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,949
between 0 and infinity.

40
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,669
The state 0

41
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:20,099
corresponds to

42
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,219
a circuit triggered, and 
the 1 state corresponds to

43
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,109
an interlocked cicuit.

44
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:32,359
We can write the mathmatical
 relation of ε(t).

45
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,779
It is equal to 0

46
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:38,899
for a time between minus infinite to 0.

47
00:02:38,899 --> 00:02:45,049
and it is equal to 1 for a time
between 0 and infinite.

48
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:46,519
A voltage jump.

49
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,479
will be defined by the following relation

50
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,559
the voltage as function of time is equal to

51
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,989
the  continuous 

52
00:02:57,989 --> 00:02:59,500
voltage that we

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,409
switch to the circuit

54
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:10,079
multiplied by this function ε(t).

55
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,139
We call step response , the response
of a voltage jump

56
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:14,950
or a current

57
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,859
of the circuit

58
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:18,049
Practically

59
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,779
this jump will be made by 
a two position switch

60
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:27,389
that we will represented this way.

61
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,859
A switch is open,

62
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:33,009
before the switching moment

63
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:36,039
where t is equal

64
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,639
to zero

65
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:40,959
just before the switching.

66
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,399
Lets look at the step response of linear elements

67
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:48,029
known as R,L and C.

68
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:51,400
Now, let's calculate the step response 
of a resistor

69
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,469
that is switched on a voltage supply.

70
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:56,069
Let the following sketch

71
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,869
be a voltage supply 

72
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:01,459
whith a value U

73
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,039
A resistor R

74
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,300
that is initially

75
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,839
short-circuited on itself

76
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,719
at a time t=0, we will

77
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,019
switch it

78
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,079
to the voltage supply U.

79
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,329
Those are the following values
inside the circuit 

80
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,389
the current

81
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,439
that goes through the resistor

82
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,229
i(t), and

83
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:33,229
the voltage measured on the terminals
of the resistor called u(t).

84
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,699
In the time domain

85
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,090
this representation of u(t)

86
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,110
is given by the following graph.

87
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,990
u(t)

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,300
as function of time

89
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,199
before the switching,
the voltage is 0

90
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,819
it goes immediately to the value

91
00:04:54,819 --> 00:04:58,100
U, at t=0

92
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,860
and keeps this value

93
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,219
U

94
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,069
infinitely.

95
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,429
The characteristic equation 
that describes the behavior

96
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,069
of the resistor is given

97
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:17,900
by i = u/R.

98
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,900
We have determinated with the out-of-step

99
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,009
the expression of u, that is equal to 

100
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,080
ε(t)

101
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,710
mutliplied by U/R

102
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,610
and this

103
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,599
is simply equal to, 

104
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:39,200
ε(t)*I.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,379
This is

106
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,779
the expression

107
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:45,430
of the step response, i

108
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,849
caused by the voltage jump of the resistor

109
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,000
that we can also represent in the time domain

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,439
the following way.

111
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,990
i(t)

112
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,119
as a function of t

113
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,550
is equal to 0

114
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,139
before the interlock

115
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:02,930
goes instantely

116
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,229
to the value

117
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,770
I

118
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,200
and stays to this value after the interlock.

119
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,610
So we can see that the step

120
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,130
response of a resistor to a current jump

121
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,749
is also

122
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:19,200
a current jump.

123
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,300
We can use the following reasoning
for a current jump

124
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,029
we can represent

125
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:29,020
the following sketch, a current source

126
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,979
for value 

127
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,330
I

128
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,869
that we switch to a resistor R.

129
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:38,999
Initially

130
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,569
the resistor is short-circuited on itself,
so there is no current

131
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,009
at t=0

132
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,300
we switch the resistor to the current source.

133
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,339
The values

134
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,759
inside the circuit, are again

135
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,919
the current

136
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,779
as function of time that goes through
the resistor

137
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:05,830
and the voltage drop doesn't appear
on the resistor, u(t)

138
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,210
Again, if we express

139
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,749
the current

140
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:13,300
as function of time, so in a time domain

141
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,100
we get the following sketch

142
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,879
as function of time

143
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,119
i(t).

144
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,770
We have no current

145
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,319
before the interlock

146
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,919
and a current that goes instantly

147
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,219
to the value i

148
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:32,110
when t=0 and

149
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,800
stays at the value i.

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,849
The characteristic equation

151
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:41,819
is given by u

152
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,139
what we are looking for

153
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,149
is equal to R * i

154
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,319
i is expressed with this concept of out-of-step

155
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,809
ε(t)

156
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,309
multiplied by i

157
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:02,339
multiplied by R, and this is also

158
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,659
ε(t)

159
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:06,059
multiplied by U

160
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,740
that we can picture again

161
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,830
in the 

162
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,830
time domain

163
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:15,869
the time axis of t

164
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,300
is equal to 0

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,589
before the interlock and 

166
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,149
instantly

167
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:22,719
takes the value u

168
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,589
at the time t=0

169
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,759
and keeps this value.

170
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,000
What we see now, is that the current

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,270
is the image of the voltage, and vice-versa.

172
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,450
Now let's calculate the step response of an
inductance to a voltage jump.

173
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,190
We consider

174
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,250
the following sketch: a voltage source

175
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,310
for value U

176
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,650
an inductance L

177
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,140
that is short-circuited on itself

178
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,030
initially

179
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,900
a switch allowing the switching of the

180
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,210
inductance on the voltage source at the time t=0.

181
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,370
The characteristic equation

182
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,800
of the voltage

183
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,240
u(l)

184
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,790
as function of the current i

185
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,170
that goes through it

186
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:24,500
is given by u = L *(di/dt).

187
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,339
By integrating this equation

188
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,480
we get that

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,840
the current is equal to

190
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,000
1/L

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,970
multiplied by the integral, from -infinity to t,

192
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,500
of u(t)dt.

193
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,430
In this case a voltage jump

194
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,940
the voltage 

195
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,710
of the inductance as function of time,
is equal to

196
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,010
ε(t) * u.

197
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,470
We consider the initial condition, which means,
that the current

198
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,400
that goes through

199
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,150
the inductance at the time t=0

200
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,600
i(t=0) = I_0

201
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,800
This is a general case.

202
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,840
So the characteristic equation becomes

203
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,220
i and is equal to

204
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,430
1/L, multiplied by the integral

205
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,390
taken

206
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,200
from 0 to t.

207
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,500
Which means that starting

208
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,130
to the interlock of U

209
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:23,100
multiplied by

210
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,900
ε(t)

211
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,120
multiplied by dt

212
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,030
plus the initial

213
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,550
current in the inductance, I_0.

214
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,420
The resolution

215
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,510
of this equation for

216
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,740
t bigger than 0

217
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,570
gives us that

218
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,600
i(t)

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,160
is equal to I_0

220
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,350
plus

221
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,700
(U*t) / L.

222
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,420
We can see a linear growth

223
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,060
of the current

224
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,110
as function of time.

225
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,220
Represented in the time domain

226
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,170
we get

227
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,690
for the voltage

228
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,280
as function of time

229
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,970
a zero voltage

230
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,630
before the interlock

231
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,910
an instant voltage jump

232
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,290
at the time t=0, and

233
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,050
a value

234
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,590
that is equal to

235
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,140
the value u(t)

236
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,980
which is constant after the interlock.

237
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,800
For the current

238
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
the temporal representation

239
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,520
starts

240
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,030
at a value

241
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,130
I_0, which is the initial condition, then

242
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,440
a linear growth of the current

243
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,610
according to the time

244
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,610
whose slope is equal to U / L.

245
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,720
Now lets perform

246
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,210
a current jump through an inductance.

247
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,279
We consider

248
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,230
the following electric circuit

249
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,540
a current supply

250
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,830
for value I

251
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,290
an inductance

252
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,780
for value L

253
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,890
and a switch allowing the switching

254
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,580
at a time t=0

255
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,410
of the current supply on the inductance

256
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,220
The characteristic equation

257
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:31,600
is given by u(t) = L*(di/dt).

258
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,610
Warning

259
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,300
u(t) is

260
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,810
the current that goes through the inductance

261
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,500
i(t).

262
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,530
We can represent in this time domain

263
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,030
the variation of t as function of time

264
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,000
zero

265
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,520
before the switching

266
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,810
and instantly 

267
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,860
the current

268
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,430
will get to the value i

269
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,510
at the time t=0.

270
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,980
We can see that the expression of u

271
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,380
is equal to 0

272
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,890
when there is no current fluctuation.

273
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,480
Which means that

274
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,200
before the interlock, there is no current
fluctuation, and

275
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,500
after the interlock, there is no current fluctuation 

276
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,140
Which means that

277
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,510
 this expression is equal to

278
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,170
zero

279
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:26,100
for t < 0 or t > 0

280
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,180
that we can represent

281
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,230
as function of time

282
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,700
like this

283
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,170
of t.

284
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,690
Zero voltage

285
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,620
before the interlock

286
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,500
and a zero voltage after the interlock,
because there is no current fluctuations.

287
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,990
On the otherside

288
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,790
this equation

289
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,900
this voltage is infinite a the time t = 0

290
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,650
Why? Well, because the current fluctuation
is infinite

291
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,580
and so

292
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,680
the voltage

293
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,690
given by the current supply should be infinite.

294
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,680
This function that we call "Dirac function"

295
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,189
is not physically reachable

296
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,579
in physics, the notion of infinity doesn't make sense,
because infinity can never be

297
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:14,300
reached.

298
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,490
In math, there is no way to describe it

299
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,560
easily.

300
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,020
we come to 

301
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,800
a first rule

302
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,800
which tells us that a current jump
in an inductance is impossible

303
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,190
Now, lets do a voltage jump

304
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,839
u(t) = ε(t)*U

305
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,610
on the terminals

306
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,769
of a capacitor. 


307
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,940
We considerate the following circuit,
made of a voltage supply for value U

308
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,060
a capacitor

309
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,510
that is initially

310
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,350
short-circuited on itself, and

311
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,470
that we will switch

312
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,690
thanks to a switch

313
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,989
on the voltage supply  U at a time 

314
00:14:56,989 --> 00:14:59,210
t = 0.

315
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,100
The values inside the circuit are the current
 that goes through the capacitor

316
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,300
i(t)

317
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,150
and the voltage at the terminals of the capacitor

318
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,640
u(t).

319
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,970
The characteristic equation

320
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,430
of the capacitor is given by

321
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,000
u = 1/C

322
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,830
times the integral of i*dt.

323
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,940
If we integrate this equation

324
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:33,600
we get that i = C*(du/dt).

325
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,420
This current

326
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,000
takes the value 0

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,090
for t < 0

328
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,960
and also 0 for t > 0

329
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,109
because the voltage fluctuation

330
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:49,640
is zero.

331
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,270
The voltage

332
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,449
is zero before the interlock and goes instantly

333
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:55,940
to the value u

334
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,770
at the time t = 0.

335
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,590
If we draw a step response

336
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,550
i, as function of time

337
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,760
we have values

338
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,360
that are zero

339
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,300
before the interlock because there are
no voltage fluctuation

340
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,890
and also

341
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,070
a zero value

342
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,060
after the interlock because there is no voltage fluctuation.

343
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,540
So the current

344
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,780
is equal to 0

345
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,810
before the interlock

346
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,950
and equal to 0

347
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,900
after the interlock.

348
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,110
On the otherside

349
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,660
during the transition, when we do a

350
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,180
voltage jump

351
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,660
on the capacitor

352
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,200
this expression tends towards infinity

353
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,540
and so

354
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,200
the current tends towards

355
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,830
infinity

356
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:49,340
during the switching

357
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,870
This means again that the

358
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,110
voltage supply should

359
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,310
give us an infinite current

360
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,210
to do an instant  

361
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:01,840
voltage jump on the terminals of a capacitor.

362
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,680
We get to a second rule which tells us that

363
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,980
a voltage jump on the terminals of a
capacitor is impossible.

364
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,089
Now lets considerate a forth case 
which consists of calculating

365
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,690
the step response of a capacitor 
subjected to a current jump.

366
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,589
We consider again

367
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,670
the following electronic sketch, made of

368
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,690
a current supply

369
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,860
equal to I

370
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,790
a capacitor C

371
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,940
and a switch that allows the switching of the capacitor

372
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,920
on the current supply at a time

373
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,970
t = 0.

374
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,960
The characteristic equation

375
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,880
of the voltage

376
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,800
on the terminals of the capacitor

377
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,670
as function of the current

378
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,760
given by the expression

379
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,450
U =

380
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,850
1/C

381
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,800
times the integral to -infinity to t

382
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,220
of i*dt.

383
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,760
Knowing that

384
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,950
i = ε(t) * I

385
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,570
that we picture here, in a 

386
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,920
timing diagramm.

387
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,700
A zero value

388
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,110
before the switching,

389
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,440
and a value i

390
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,840
after the switching.

391
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,290
Again, the initial condition

392
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,690
is the volatge

393
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,350
which

394
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,900
exist on the terminals of the capacitor before the switching of the switch

395
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,990
at the time t=0, and is equal to

396
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,390
U_0.

397
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,100
So we can now rewrite the equation

398
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,430
 with the integral by splitting this integral from

399
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,000
-infinity to 0

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,620
and from 0 to infinity.

401
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,100
So it comes that

402
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,580
u is equal to

403
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,160
U_0

404
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,560
which is the part of

405
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,380
the integral before the switching

406
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,890
plus

407
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,440
1/C times the integral from 0 to t

408
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,000
of i*ε(t)dt.

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,860
By solving this equation

410
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,530
we get that the voltage is equal to U_0 plus (I/C)*t
and this for

411
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,000
t>0.

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,470
If we picture 

413
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,540
this equation in the timing diagramm

414
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,780
we get

415
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,270
the following curve, as function of time

416
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,020
at an initial value

417
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,930
before the switching, and

418
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,760
after the switching

419
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,410
we see that we have a straight line

420
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,220
a linear growth of the voltage

421
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,840
with the current

422
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,870
which the slope is equal to

423
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,060
I/C.

424
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,360
After studying

425
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,210
all theses cases of step response

426
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,210
we can draw the following conclusions

427
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,620
which tell us that, a current jump

428
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,140
in an inductance is impossible, and that a voltage jump at the terminals of

429
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,730
a capacitor is also

430
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,080
impossible.

431
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,260
These propreties allows us to establish the

432
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,280
integration constants

433
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,020
in the case of a real circuit.
