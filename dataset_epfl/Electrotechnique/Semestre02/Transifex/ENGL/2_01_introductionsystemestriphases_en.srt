00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,480
Hello Ladies and Gentlemen.  Welcome to the 
electrotechnique 2 course.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,679
Throughout these different lessons

3
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,300
we will study three-phase sinusoidal rating circuits

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,570
as well as all the theory that will allow the understanding of transitional effects

5
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,189
in electrical networks

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,289
In this first lesson

7
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,779
we shall give a general
introduction on networks

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,010
how, with a few examples,

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,200
we can produce electrical energy

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,260
in particular here with

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,030
a synchronous generator, motor or
anything else

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,800
linked to some form of electromechanical conversion.

13
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
I will start here with an example.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,630
An example where you can see the stator of a turbine.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,900
This turbine can be rotated due to several effects.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:59,649
Heat and steam, essentially, a steam engine

17
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,230
Or a hydraulic turbine, where we

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,780
rotate the turbine using
water pressure or we can also use

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,200
a wind turbine, or a nuclear power plant.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,980
You can see here the size of such a stator

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,900
that shows you that to currently
generate Europe's electrical grid

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:24,100
it is necessary to have
increasingly bigger generators.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:28,990
Here you can see the the generator of
the MarÃ¨ges Dam in France.

24
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,810
Another example of
gigantism

25
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:35,310
is shown in this photo,
you can see in one of the

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,400
hydroelectric power plants of Itaipu, Bresil

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,890
one of the biggest hydroelectric
power plants in the world.

28
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,200
The rotor of this machine, with

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,700
around the stator, the staff that
allowed the construction of

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,840
this power plant.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,230
We can see here the size

32
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,200
of the workers compared to the
 size of the rotor that you can see here

33
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,910
being placed by 

34
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,300
an overhead crane.

35
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,240
This is quite exceptionnal

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,819
for the Itaipu Dam

37
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:09,450
This allows the supply of electricity
to a large quantity of households

38
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,779
and thus a large part of the country.

39
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,629
Let's go back to Switzerland

40
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,000
We have here two typical examples of a grid

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,909
or grids, in the case of Switzerland.

42
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:24,409
On the left you have the
Grande Dixence Dam, in Valais

43
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:27,000
famous for the length of its lake

44
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:29,760
but also for the hight of its wall, one of

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,109
the tallest in world

46
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,829
and on the right you have the Emosson
Dam in Valais which is an arch dam.

47
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,069
These two dams

48
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:40,299
have the particularity of producing,
both, electrical energy

49
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:40,990
by

50
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,720
accumulating water and finally by using
the waterfall, pressure

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,749
and water flow

52
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,500
to rotate the generator downstream

53
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,729
but these two dams

54
00:02:51,729 --> 00:02:54,709
do not supply electrical
energy at the same frequency.

55
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:56,379
We will see

56
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,469
that the Grande Dixence Dam

57
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,589
helps provide the grid 

58
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,479
that can be called "urban"

59
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,939
available for everybody, in other words

60
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,219
at a frequency of 50 hertz

61
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,859
while the Emosson Dam on the
right only supplies

62
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:16,719
16 2/3 hertz, a second parallel
grid in Switzerland, used for

63
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,129
the Swiss Federal Railways, 
the SBB's, grid.

64
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:22,119
So we have, in Switzerland, different

65
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:25,900
dams that are dedicated to either

66
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,739
the urban grid at 50 hertz, or

67
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,349
the SBB grid

68
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:36,009
for transports at 
16 2/3 hertz.

69
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:40,200
How does a hydroelectric power plant work ?

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,699
You have here a sectional view
of a standard power plant

71
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:48,900
On the left, there is the accumulated water

72
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,899
the wall that retains this water
mass

73
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,599
and finally

74
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,889
a water collum 

75
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:56,409
or penstock

76
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:58,759
that brings water, in this case, pressurized  

77
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,330
at very very high pressures

78
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,369
which allows us

79
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:05,869
to have a very high flow rates
 and rotate a propeller

80
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:09,219
a turbine, we shall see later
different types of turbines

81
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,039
connected here to an alternator,
generally a synchronous machine

82
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,010
which enables

83
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:19,269
the conversion of the mechanical power given by 

84
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,600
the water flow into electric power

85
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,059
and the rotation speed of the rotor here

86
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:28,240
enables a very precise control of the frequency

87
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,259
injected in the grid.

88
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,099
Afterwards, a distribution system
must be organised to bring

89
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:39,020
this energy to the end user.

90
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,090
Here are several examples of turbines
in particular

91
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,720
for the first, the Pelton wheel, 
these turbines function in the following

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,240
way, they are logically

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,200
realised using small cups

94
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,830
wherein in fact, the injector
with pressurised water arrives

95
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,220
hits the cup and
rotates the turbine.

96
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,389
You have here different shapes
of cups

97
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,770
which more or less allow
 to control the wear that there is here

98
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,440
which can be relatively high

99
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,259
if the water is not perfectly

100
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,099
free of impurities

101
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,289
or here also, another Pelton wheel type
turbine

102
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,849
There are also other types of
turbines, we won't go into

103
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:19,789
the details here

104
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:23,930
but, on the left you have a Francis turbine,
 on the right a Kaplan turbine

105
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,810
that are used for different
types of power plants

106
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:28,270
Run-of-the-river power plants

107
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,930
or other types of power plants

108
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,630
where the water flow

109
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,210
can be variable or for example
control of the tides to also

110
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,720
produce electricity using the
back and forth

111
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,419
of the tides.

112
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:44,930
A relatively new factor in the
past ten year in our countries

113
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,460
is the usage of wind with wind turbines

114
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,030
and therefore more and more wind
turbines are now placed in Europe

115
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,800
with a peculiarity compared
to dams.

116
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,199
Dams enable us

117
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,860
to debit water on demand

118
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,850
and thus, produce energy on demand

119
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,610
whereas in the case of wind turbines

120
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,199
the electricity producer is always
tributary to the local wind where

121
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,610
the wind turbine is placed.

122
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,839
Therefore behind all this

123
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,199
is an analysis for the energy storage
for when the wind occurs

124
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,999
to enable it to be distributed
at the time of usage

125
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,719
at the right time, at the right place.

126
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,579
In the Nordic countries, Denmark in
particular, there is a high

127
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:34,329
sensitivity to now use
wind farms.

128
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:36,180
You have here offshore wind farms

129
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,020
in the North Sea. Another farm here,
the London Array

130
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:45,600
where you can see the sea being
literally covered by 

131
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,280
wind turbines and you can also
see the size of the turbines with

132
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,990
the small boat that is present here
on the sea

133
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:54,819
and you can see that the diameters can
reach several tens of meters

134
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,480
to generate, to

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,719
produce this energy.

136
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:00,230
Of course, we must

137
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,770
connect all of these wind turbines

138
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,080
on dry land

139
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,740
to be able to tap into this energy and
afterwards redistribute it to the end user

140
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,300
you have here another photo of the
North Sea that shows you better

141
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,550
the dimensions of a wind turbine
compared to a boat

142
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,800
and in the

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,009
most recent improvements

144
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:21,850
made on wind turbines

145
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,960
there are direct drives that
were implemented

146
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,400
where the synchronous machine, 
in other words the generator, is

147
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,500
directly incorporated inside
the wind turbine itself.

148
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:36,029
Therefore, we greatly save

149
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,360
energy

150
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,849
by eliminating a gear train that

151
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:43,719
would be placed between a generator

152
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,299
placed at the bottom of the wind
turbine and the propeller at the top


153
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:48,620
Thus, wind turbines are

154
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,089
increasingly produced in the following way

155
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:53,830
with a direct drive

156
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,169
therefore, the generator is
directly

157
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,149
connected to the propeller.

158
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:02,809
Let's not forget nuclear power plants,
even if

159
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:07,800
two thirds of the energy in Switzerland
is produced by hydroelectricity

160
00:08:07,869 --> 00:08:11,939
we still have nuclear power plant which
also allow the production

161
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:14,279
of electric energy using the same
system.

162
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,339
A nuclear power plant,
using nuclear fission,

163
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:19,219
heats

164
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,270
water

165
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,270
and it is then used just like a
steam engine to rotate

166
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,050
a generator of the same kind

167
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,749
that you could find

168
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:30,080
in a hydroelectric power plant.

169
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,979
With, however, a major disadvantage
compared to a hydroelectric power

170
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,579
plant, the regulation of the energy.
The regulation in a

171
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,529
nuclear power plant can only 

172
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,060
be done

173
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,280
very slowly.

174
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,420
The fission reaction being

175
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,890
implemented over several days and
thus cannot be

176
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,610
changed or modified
significantly

177
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,170
in a few minutes.

178
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,050
In the case for hydroelectric
installations

179
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,160
it is possible to start, or stop them

180
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,360
extremely fast

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,360
since we have control over the water

182
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,930
falling directly on the Pelton wheel
and thus the alternator.

183
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,230
In conclusion

184
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,850
we can see that there are several
ways of generating electric

185
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,840
energy in a grid by using a
synchronous motor. The first way

186
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,620
that we saw is the hydraulic force
through a dam

187
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,100
the accumulation of water, a turbine

188
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,760
is then directly connected to the grid

189
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,210
wind power which enables the
conversion of energy from wind

190
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,170
the wind's mechanical energy

191
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,010
Steam engines whose heat
can be produced either by

192
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,079
coal plants

193
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:37,860
or gas or nuclear plants

194
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,899
and yet a number of other elements

195
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:42,160
for which we do not want

196
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,950
to go into details here.
