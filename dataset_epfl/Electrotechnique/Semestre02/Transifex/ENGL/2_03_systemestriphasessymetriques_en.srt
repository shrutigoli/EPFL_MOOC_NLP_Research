00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,190
Hello

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,169
After a general view of polyphase
systems

3
00:00:09,169 --> 00:00:13,279
we will now focus and more
particularly study

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:15,709
symmetrical three-phase systems.

5
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:16,900
In this lesson

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,490
after a short introduction
we will define

7
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,070
what is a symmetrical

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,390
three-phase system

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,710
define what a line voltage is
a phase-to-phase voltage, and

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,369
similarly for currents, and

11
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,119
compute the relationship between
these different values.

12
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,090
And finishing

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,560
on a conclusion

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,550
We have here a

15
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,240
classical case of a three-phase

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,890
symmetrical system that we have
carried over on a phasor diagram

17
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,040
with

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,870
over here

19
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,400
the U1 voltage

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,450
U2

21
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,900
U3, in a forward system

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,080
with U1, U2 and U3 in the reverse
system that we 

23
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,800
have seen

24
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,120
in the previous lesson.

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,400
So we clearly have here

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,470
for the order of succession of the phases,
a k equal to 1.

27
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,480
The number of phases equal to 3

28
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,980
and a symmetrical system because

29
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,640
the three values U1, U2, and U3

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,970
are equal

31
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,710
We can particularly see that

32
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,840
the order of succession of the phases
or phase-shift between the

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,250
different phases, is 120 degrees,
or 2π/3. We will now

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:26,960
be able to

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,190
characterise these 3 phasors and
write the equation 

36
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,509
for the 3 phasors

37
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,500
in this symmetrical three-phase system.
First of all, the first phasor

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,160
U1

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,170
is equal to Ue^(jα).

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,690
I'm leaving the angle α on purpose
to allows us

41
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,460
complete freedom later

42
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,280
on

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,350
the position of U1 in the complex
plane. While on the drawing that

44
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,300
we have here, in both drawings

45
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,270
for the forward or reverse system

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,980
we have U1 with a null angle.

47
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,420
But let's leave, in a general manner,
α

48
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,289
thus

49
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:06,069
the other two phasors
U2 and U3

50
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:11,119
become

51
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:12,479
for the former

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,319
Ue^j(α - 2π/3), we have a
phase shift of 2π/3

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:16,939
and the

54
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:19,059
lastr one as well

55
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:24,839
also

56
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:29,059
also of 120 degrees. So here are
the three phasors that will be the basis

57
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:30,019
of our

58
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,050
symmetrical

59
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,139
three-phase system

60
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:36,809
Now if we observe

61
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,839
in a temporal manner 

62
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:40,679
what these 3 values are worth

63
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,729
we will notice one thing.
Already on this phasor diagram

64
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:45,199
you can see it here

65
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,079
if I combine

66
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,029
these three vectors

67
00:02:48,029 --> 00:02:50,600
I will return to zero.

68
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,819
This means that, at every
instant, every moment

69
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,449
these three vectors

70
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,890
are equal to zero when combined.

71
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,989
In other words, we can write

72
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,079
at all times

73
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:04,279
phasor 1

74
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:09,299
of the voltage, plus the second voltage,
and the third voltage

75
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:13,319
are always equal to zero.

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,559
Even more surprising

77
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,180
we can also do this

78
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,889
for the temporal part, 
at all times

79
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,159
the three instantaneous voltages

80
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,389
are also equal to zero.
And this we shall now see

81
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,089
in the following graph

82
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:34,939
where we have represented the three
voltages U1, U2 and U3

83
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,849
in a temporal manner

84
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,959
What do we see?
We can see that

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,500
at any point of

86
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:43,459
time 

87
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,489
that I choose, here, for example

88
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,920
on this curve, if I add

89
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,029
at the instant

90
00:03:53,029 --> 00:03:55,739
I've marked with the red line

91
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,199
if I add U2 and U3

92
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,969
we can see that the 2 values are
exactly equal to

93
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,809
the value of U1.

94
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:07,859
The sum of these three voltages
is zero, as expected.

95
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,949
Let's take another instant

96
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,139
and once again, here, the sum of
these three

97
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,600
voltages of 

98
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,849
U1, U2 and U3

99
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,150
we find zero.
We can again do

100
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,189
a last one, by really taking a
random line

101
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,970
the sum of this voltage

102
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,370
this voltage and this voltage will
give us exactly zero.

103
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,550
This system thus has an undeniable

104
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,870
advantage

105
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,099
being symmetrical

106
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:43,110
we will have some form of

107
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,439
equalization of the energy due to
the fact that the sum of these voltages

108
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,770
is always equal to zero.

109
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,759
We must now model

110
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,740
this source

111
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,360
and we will define some
number of values that are

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,759
linked

113
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,629
to a symmetrical three-phase source

114
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:02,740
that I present to you first of all
according to a model

115
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,400
that we give here in a wye setup

116
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,559
We can see that

117
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:10,069
our three voltages presented 
previously, are represented by

118
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,180
sources, here, U1

119
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,030
U2

120
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,610
and U3

121
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,360
that they are all connected to
each other through a common point

122
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,389
and that we have three

123
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,349
outputs, so we can see, of the 
voltages that we call lines.

124
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,449
We will define, on these lines

125
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,000
different values.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,159
First of all, we name
these lines by letters

127
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,449
that allow us

128
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,100
to navigate later on with
a three-phase symmetrical source.

129
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,529
First of all, here

130
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,039
the R line

131
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,029
the S line, and the T line.

132
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,069
with the common point that we name
N, and that symbolizes the

133
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:53,460
neutral point.

134
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,780
About these different

135
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,180
values

136
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,500
we can say one thing, firstly,
U1, U2, U3 will have the same

137
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,759
effective value (RMS value)

138
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,450
will have the same frequency, and the three
will be phase-shifted

139
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,559
by 2π/3.

140
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:09,200
We can still characterize a certain
number of elements.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,050
First of all, we can see 

142
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,309
that there is a

143
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:15,789
voltage between the R line

144
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,580
and the neutral, the S and the neutral,
the T and the neutral

145
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,509
and that we can compute or measure
the voltages between R and S

146
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:25,089
directly, S and T or T and R

147
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:27,869
Well, with all these different values

148
00:06:27,869 --> 00:06:30,610
we will need to name them in order
to navigate

149
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,319
and characterize these different
elements.

150
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,759
The first elements that we will give
are

151
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,710
the voltages between

152
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,469
the lines and the neutral.

153
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,839
We will have here

154
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,430
a voltage that we will call U_rn

155
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,689
and then we will have

156
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:50,889
U_sn

157
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,399
and finally U_tn

158
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,630
These are complex values

159
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,770
thus, we underline the values.

160
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,360
Another possibility, as I have mentioned
it earlier, is to take values

161
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,969
directly here.
We will thus have U_rs

162
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,039
we will have here

163
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,439
U_st

164
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,199
and finally

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,500
the value U_tr.

166
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:25,500
We will name the voltages that are
directly taken between the lines

167
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,139
composed voltages

168
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:40,849
By extension, we shall also call
them line voltages.

169
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,800
And for the voltages between
R, S, T and the neutral

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,699
We will call these
voltages

171
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:53,509
simple voltages.

172
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,800
Also by extension, we will call
these voltages

173
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,700
either simple voltages,

174
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,939
or phase voltages.

175
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:01,789
Three elements must still

176
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:03,460
be mentioned

177
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,639
once the voltages are defined

178
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,389
we can still define the currents that
flow

179
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,069
in the different lines.

180
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,599
First of all, we will define the three
currents

181
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,800
that are really flowing in the
lines

182
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,600
Ir, Is and It

183
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,659
and a fourth element can
still be mentioned

184
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,000
it's the return of current on the neutral
that we will name In

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,180
but we will quickly see

186
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,000
that this current In is often null if
the entire system is balanced and

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,250
symmetrical

188
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,250
the current will always be null

189
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,649
sometimes even, the neutral

190
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:42,970
will not be connected.

191
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,090
We will once again mention here what the
simple voltage is

192
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,750
or what the line voltage is

193
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,390
according to the diagram

194
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,870
that we've just seen about the three-phase

195
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,629
source.

196
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:57,200
First of all, the simple voltage

197
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,850
that we define as being

198
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,200
the measure of the voltage

199
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,300
or the definition of the voltage

200
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,520
between the R line and the neutral,
likewise for every

201
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
line.

202
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,300
In the same manner, the composed voltage

203
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,420
is defined this time directly between 
the lines

204
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,760
namely

205
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,920
U_rs

206
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,200
U_st

207
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,210
and U_tr

208
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,980
Now, if we can calculate the relationship
between the simple voltage and

209
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,340
the composed voltage

210
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,870
We will simply apply Kirchhoff
on the previous diagram. 

211
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,980
We then find

212
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,390
3 relatively simple

213
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,800
loop equations that are

214
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,089
U_rs = U_rn - U_sn

215
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:11,280
and similarly for the other two equations.

216
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,530
We will take this first
equation

217
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,250
and write, for this first equation

218
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,280
what is the result

219
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,960
of the subtraction of these two vectors
or these two phasors

220
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,270
By definition, we have,

221
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,000
U_rn

222
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,710
equal to Ue^(jα).

223
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,620
and we have U_sn

224
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,300
equal to

225
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,480
Ue^j(α - 2π/3).

226
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,450
We can then write

227
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,880
and bring out

228
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,070
Ue^(jα) for both

229
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,450
elements and finally write U_rs =...

230
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,470
We bring out Ue^(jα)

231
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,430
firstly, we have U_rn, from where
the 1 is issued

232
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,590
minus

233
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,000
and then the second part

234
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,820
so, e^j

235
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,360
and simply

236
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,680
-2π/3.

237
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,890
This being said

238
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,269
we can transform this

239
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,000
equation, now,

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,460
into a a+bj relationship, that will
gives us the following result

241
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,560
U_rs will be equal to Ue^(jα)

242
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,830
and that multiplies 3/2

243
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,620
plus

244
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,730
j * (√3/2).

245
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,139
By reconverting everything

246
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,700
in the form of a Euler type phasor

247
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,000
we then have

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,920
finally, U_rs equal to

249
00:11:48,920 --> 00:12:00,200
√3U * e^j(α + π/6).

250
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,880
We recongnize here

251
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,379
Ue^(jα) which is the

252
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,369
simple voltage, and thus

253
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,510
the composed voltage

254
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,160
is actually √3 times

255
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,330
the simple voltage U_rn

256
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,650
that underlines it

257
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:18,009
with a phase-shift of

258
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:21,700
π/6.

259
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,780
We shall see that for the other three,

260
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,870
for other two line voltages,
it's exactly the same, thus

261
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,820
everytime

262
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,129
all of these values

263
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,580
are simply

264
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,660
raised by a √3 factor
compared to the simple voltage and

265
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,240
phase-shifted by a factor of π/6.

266
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,300
Essentially

267
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,150
we can write in a completely
general manner

268
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:48,090
that the line voltage

269
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,060
is equal to √3 times

270
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,940
the effective (RMS) value of

271
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,420
the simple voltage

272
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,700
By taking now
a diagram

273
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,270
in which we have

274
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,279
put all of these different
phasors

275
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,290
one after

276
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,910
the other in a complex
diagram

277
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,829
we will observe a certain number
of elements

278
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,129
first of all, we can recover

279
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:11,800
our three simple voltages

280
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,830
U_rn

281
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,810
U_tn and U_sn

282
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,580
We've aligned here the simple voltage
U_rn with zero.

283
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,700
You have here a circle

284
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,960
that defines the value of the RMS of the U grid.

285
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,640
If we apply, in this case in a
completely graphical manner

286
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,790
what we have done
earlier, meaning

287
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:41,400
U_rn - U_sn

288
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,930
we can observe and obtain here

289
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,200
a new phasor that is the
composed voltage U_rs

290
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,300
that we have just calculated.

291
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,000
We discover that
this value is

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,680
√3 times bigger than the effective (RMS) value of the grid.

293
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,110
or than the previous voltage, the simple voltage

294
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,959
and that

295
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,750
it is phase-shifted by π/6.

296
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,940
Similarly 

297
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,050
the three composed

298
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,850
voltages will now form
a new symmetrical three-phase

299
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,870
system

300
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:11,940
where the amplitude is √3 times
greater than the simple voltages

301
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:16,460
and all of them phase-shifted by π/6.
It is the foundation of

302
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,890
every sinusoidal

303
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,390
three-phase symmetrical
system to have this relationship between

304
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,200
simple voltages and composed voltages.

305
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,840
I remind here the extremely important
expression that the line voltage

306
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,540
will always be √3 times

307
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,220
the simple voltage

308
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,970
In the most common type of domestic
power supply grid in Europe, 

309
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,490
the modulus of the simple voltages is
generally normalized to

310
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,450
220 volts.

311
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,510
So, simple voltage

312
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,110
at 220 volts

313
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,260
generally, this 220 volts is more
often included between 220 and 240 volts

314
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,100
and can oscillate throughout

315
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,280
the year generally

316
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,820
Thus if we compute now
the composed voltages linked to

317
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,540
these simple voltages

318
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,230
we can observe that if we multiply the composed

319
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,770
voltage by √3

320
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,139
it is now at 380 volts

321
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:21,130
since it is 220 multiplied by √3

322
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,080
since we can have 220 volts version
and a 240 volts version

323
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,420
the composed tensions will oscillate

324
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,000
between 380 and 420 volts

325
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,330
Thus, in a three-phase system, we always
have available either a simple voltage

326
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,109
around 220 volts

327
00:15:39,109 --> 00:15:41,120
or a composed voltage of

328
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,480
380 volts.

329
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,690
There is another way

330
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,340
of showing or modelling

331
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,680
a symmetrical three-phase source

332
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,660
Instead of using a wye circuit
like we've done previously

333
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,080
it is posisbly to show that

334
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,940
by connecting the source, here
U1, U2 and U3 in a delta

335
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,149
we also get R, S and T at whose
terminals we find

336
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,300
our three line voltages

337
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,470
and the line currents that
are flowing in an indentical manner

338
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,420
compared to our presentation
in a wye circuit.

339
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,020
The big difference compared to a

340
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,790
wye connection

341
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,800
is that here, in this schema there
is no common point, thus no neutral

342
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,020
and to bring up the neutral, it is
necessary to

343
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,129
construct

344
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:33,069
a system built using three very
high impedance resistors connected in

345
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:37,420
a mid-point that recreates
an artificial neutral.

346
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,100
In the end, the only important
element

347
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,750
is to create three

348
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,350
lines : R, S, T that will be
useful later for connecting loads

349
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,050
and thus, in the end, that our source

350
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,089
is connected either in a wye connection
or in a delta connection

351
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:57,610
this will make

352
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,700
or will have only little difference.

353
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,200
Thus, I advise you

354
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,089
for the comprehension of
the next part of this class

355
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:09,909
to keep a mental picture of this
wye connection that allows us to

356
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:14,110
more simply bring up
the common point of the neutral.

357
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,319
We still need to

358
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,420
mention a word about the current of the neutral

359
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,510
that is this connector that
recieves

360
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,600
the three lines so as to

361
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,810
recover the energy coming

362
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,910
from the load connected on R, S and T.

363
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,180
I will re-draw here, for a better understanding

364
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,300
the three lines R, S, and T

365
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,680
that exit our symmetrical

366
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,000
three-phase grid.

367
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,399
We have R, we have S,
we have T

368
00:17:43,399 --> 00:17:45,870
we also know that there is a return

369
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,320
the neutral

370
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,400
that will allow us us to bring back
this energy

371
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,850
If now

372
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,559
we write here

373
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,600
the line current Ir

374
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,080
the line current Is

375
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,350
and the line current It

376
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,450
we can write that

377
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:11,310
once we have connected a R, S, T load
and a neutral current

378
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,500
using Kirchoff, it is possible
to write

379
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,240
this relatively simple equation

380
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,660
it's that the sum of the currents

381
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,800
Ir, Is and It

382
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
is equal to this neutral current

383
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,300
We will see

384
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,010
and we will demonstrate thereafter

385
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,310
that when these currents are
perfectly symmetrical, thus phase-shifted

386
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,090
by 120 degrees and of equal amplitude

387
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:39,110
the neutral current, as we've mentioned
it previously, will be null

388
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,570
To conclude

389
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,970
we have seen in this lesson

390
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,510
that a symmetrical three-phase system
is relatively simple

391
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,020
to study since

392
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,340
we only need to concern ourselves with
a single element everytime

393
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,080
and the others are simply
phase-shifted by 2π/3

394
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,290
we have defined the phase voltage,
the composed voltage

395
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,310
we have seen what the line current is,

396
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,290
that the sum of these line currents

397
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,169
gives us

398
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:05,980
the neutral current

399
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,800
and that the ratio between the composed voltage and simple voltage

400
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,000
is √3.

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,149
We will thus, in the next lessons

402
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,930
study the loads connected to this

403
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,720
symmetrical three-phase source
