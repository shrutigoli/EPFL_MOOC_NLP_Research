00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,230
Hello, welcome to the 6th lesson,
dedicated to conversions between

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,200
wye and delta systems in a three-phase state,

3
00:00:10,269 --> 00:00:15,549
We will see how to adapt a network to a charge 
that we will be able to change to wye or delta, and adapt

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:18,500
to a network having a different voltage or how to convert 
a wye set up into a delta set up.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,400
In practice, if the sources are
generally connected in a wye set up

6
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,320
the user has two different choices for 
the charge's coupling mechanism.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,420
Either wye, or delta, and the switch between
the two lets for

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,130
a brief power reduction or an 
adjustement to an electrical circuit

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:41,940
√3 times higher.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,710
Thus, we can say that in practice

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,020
we have a wye connection

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,360
and that this wye connection can be
transformed 

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,670
 into a delta connection.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,600
But, we can also have the opposite case and
switch from delta to wye.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,700
We will now see three different cases

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,800
that will show us this possible adjustement from
one way to the other.

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,830
Here is the first case that we will study:
the power decrease

18
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,880
absorbed without changing the line voltage

19
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,400
nor the phase impedances.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,400
We will see how the power will change during
 the wye to delta circuit transformation 

21
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,430
and we will see that the factor change
 is equal to 3. 

22
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,600
I have prepared a table here, 
with on the left

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,800
all the values that we will analyse in the
wye

24
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,100
as well as these same values in a delta.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,000
We will then start with the phase voltage,
which is equal to 

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the line voltage divide by √3 in a wye,

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,639
as we have already seen in the previous lessons.

28
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,069
In the same way,

29
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,499
this same voltage phase,
but this time in a delta setup

30
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:20,119
will be equal and confused with
the line voltage.

31
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:30,879
What is it with the phase currents ?
The phase current, by definition, the voltage phase
 divided by the impedance Z

32
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,659
We can now replace the phase voltage by the line voltage

33
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,029
that we have just calculated,

34
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:42,500
this gives us U_l/(√3*Z).

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,279
For the delta setup,

36
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:47,000
lets calculate the phase current and

37
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:54,800
the phase current is equal to the phase voltage
 divided by Z, simply in our delta

38
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,079
the phase voltage is equal to 
the line voltage, and so

39
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,549
we get

40
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,290
the following result : the phase current
is simply the line voltage

41
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,600
divided by the norm of the
impedance Z.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,029
Lets calculate now the ligne current.
The line current, I_I

43
00:03:12,029 --> 00:03:15,520
is equal to the phase current.
It is a property of

44
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,800
wye systems, so by replacing this, since
we just found the value, it is the same

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,949
result as before:

46
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:24,159
line voltage divided by √3*Z

47
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,739
for this line current.

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,400
However, the line current in a delta system,
as we know,

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,300
is √3 times the phase current.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,999
By replacing this, we get √3
times the line voltage

51
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:41,309
divided by the norm

52
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:48,300
of the impedance Z.

53
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,300
We want to analyse this impedance
and compare it between the two setups.

54
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,520
First of all, we will have 

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,300
S that is, by definition, equal to √3 times
the line voltage, line current

56
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,990
that is equal to, by replacing the
line current

57
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,179
with the previous calculation,

58
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,249
simply

59
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:15,200
U_l^2/Z for a wye setup.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,769
We do the exact same thing for the delta

61
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,269
by replacing, in the same way,

62
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,100
by definition, √3*U_l*I_l.

63
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,970
When we replace this, the √3*√3

64
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,930
is at the numerator and we find

65
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,400
3*U_l^2 divided by Z.

66
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,740
These two values, are then

67
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,289
three times

68
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,710
bigger.

69
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:50,300
So, without changing neither the line voltage
nor the charge

70
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,440
that we connect

71
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,990
when passing from one setup
to the other

72
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,780
the absorbed power

73
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,980
of a factor 3

74
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,949
which gives the user all sorts
of possiblities

75
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,000
to adapt the power or, for example,

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,509
to start a machine at a lower power

77
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:12,379
than that of its nominal rate.

78
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:19,379
We will now do a small example
of a charge that we take

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,659
symmetric with an impedance norm equal to 18 Ohm.

80
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,039
We decide that the electrical circuit's line
voltage is equal to 380 V in 

81
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,050
this example with 

82
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,400
cos(φ) = 0.8.

83
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,449
The active power, in delta, is
equal to

84
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:52,200
20 kW.

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,900
The question is now to know,

86
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,539
if we connect this charge in delta instead
of wye,

87
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:06,119
do we have a reduction by a factor 3
on the absorbed power ?

88
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:08,979
First of all, we calculate the line

89
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:10,039
current

90
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:12,219
in delta

91
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:15,879
and this line current is equal to √3 times

92
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:18,200
the phase current.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,830
The phase current

94
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,979
is then

95
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,849
the phase voltage

96
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:30,000
divided by Z, which gives
√3*(U_ph/Z)

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,809
and the phase voltage

98
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,800
in delta is the line voltage

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,100
which is equal to √3*(U_l/Z).

100
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,270
The line voltage, just as the impedance norm, 
are given in the example

101
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,339
so we can do the numerical calculation
and we get 36.6 A.

102
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:53,059
On the contrary, if we now want to calculate

103
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:58,700
this for a wye conversion, that we
often symbolise with Y

104
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:06,400
since it sounds like the letter Y,

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,050
which is equal to the phase current in this setup.
The phase current is equal to

106
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:19,050
U_ph/Z and the phase voltage in
a wye

107
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:27,789
is: U_l/(√3*Z).

108
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,939
We get 12,2 A. We can already see here

109
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:36,189
that the consumed current is 
decreased by a factor 3.

110
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:40,610
We can then calculate the power in a wye

111
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,500
set up.

112
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,200
This calculation is relatively simple,
we use the definition

113
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,700
of the active power, namely √3

114
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,860
line voltage, line current

115
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,389
times cos(φ).

116
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,369
By replacing these

117
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:02,200
three elements that we have now,
either from the data

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,909
or from the calculations that we have just made,

119
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,200
we get 6.6 kW.

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,900
This is

121
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:17,200
equal to three times the
active power that

122
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
we had in a delta.

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,270
This can be written

124
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:29,270
in another way. This is equal
to the power

125
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,690
divided by 3, and shows the
adaptation possiblity

126
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,270
between a wye and delta setup.

127
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,560
The second case that we will
now study is the adaptation

128
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,380
to a higher network, without changing
neither the powers

129
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,470
nor the impedances.

130
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:53,000
This can happen when a machine has been designed

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,540
or calculated for a given network, and that by
changing continent or country,

132
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,770
we have a different network voltage 
that we wish to adapt

133
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,520
to the machine of this new network.

134
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,690
Then, in the same way, I have created a 
table that lets us compare

135
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,400
a wye or delta setup, and then we will take

136
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,410
the netwrok we have in Europe,
the classical network,

137
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,000
in a wye or delta setup, with a line
voltage of 380 V.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,990
Lets imagine

139
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,950
our

140
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:28,900
phase voltage, that is equal to the line voltage
divided by √3 in a wye setup,

141
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,300
will be equal to 380 V divided by √3

142
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,160
namely

143
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,000
the 220 V that we usually see.

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Lets admit that we want to connect our
machine on a

145
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:49,680
phase voltage, once again at 220 V, 
but that will then be

146
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,740
our line voltage since we connect

147
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,170
the same charge in a delta setup. In such a setup,

148
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,040
as a reminder, the phase voltage is
equal to the line tension.

149
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,000
Our phase current, in the wye setup, 
will be equal to

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,150
the phase voltage divided by the
norm of the impedance.

151
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,240
The phase voltage being equal to 220 V,

152
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,570
it is simply

153
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,900
220 divided by the norme of Z.
What about the phase current in a delta setup ?

154
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,540
Well, in the same way, it is
the phase voltage

155
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,190
divided by the norm of the impedance Z, and
we realise that it is exactely

156
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,460
the same thing.

157
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,000
This is what we hope for.
We hope, as said beforehand,

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,450
not to change the absorbed power
with the charge.

159
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,290
We can also be convinced by
calculating the apparent power that will

160
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,459
be equal to,

161
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,710
by definition,

162
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,000
three times the phase voltage,
times the phase current

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,410
and in both cases,
we will get three times

164
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,960
220^2 divided by Z, and if we look at 
a delta setup, we will get

165
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,820
exactely the same thing:

166
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,060
three times

167
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:06,060
the phase voltage times the phase current,
which gives us  3*(220^2)/Z

168
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,000
Then, we see that the devices that work on
an old network

169
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,800
for example 220 V in a delta setup,

170
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,740
will be able to be used

171
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,740
on a modern network with 380 V line voltage,
providing that we pass in a wye setup.

172
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,000
The last case that we will study
is the replacement of the three-phase

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,630
charge to get, this time, the same power

174
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,600
when the line voltage does not change.

175
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,329
This time, we will change the impedance to

176
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,300
keep the power absorbed by the system.

177
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,160
In the same way, in the table

178
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,410
we will have on one side

179
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,180
all the values of a wye setup, and on the other
all the values 

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,360
of a delta setup.

181
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,060
The calculation of the line voltage
is still done in the same way

182
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,309
but this time we start with the apparent power,
that I remind you

183
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:12,300
needs to be constant in our small example, S

184
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,200
and then we have a relation between the line current,
the apparent power and

185
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,000
the line voltage, in this way.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,200
This ratio, or this equation, is strictly identical
in a delta setup.

187
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:33,200
We can then write that I_I is also equal,
in a delta setup,  to S/√3

188
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,120
times the line voltage.

189
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,570
For the phase current, now, we are starting to
have a certain habit

190
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,020
is equal to the line current in the
wye

191
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,070
setup

192
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,000
However, for this same phase current in 
a delta setup

193
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,960
we have a ratio of √3

194
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,200
between the line current and 
the phase current.

195
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,500
It is exactely the opposite for the
phase voltage, so here

196
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,650
the phase voltage

197
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,460
is equal to the line voltage divided by √3.

198
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,970
Whereas in the delta 

199
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,750
setup

200
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,460
the phase voltage is equal to

201
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,360
the line voltage.

202
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,380
All this now lets us, by reassembling
these three element,

203
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,470
to write that

204
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,900
the impedance that we wish to get to

205
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,200
maintain and garantee a constant

206
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,420
absorbed power.

207
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,050
We will then write here that

208
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,000
Z

209
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,500
in a wye setup

210
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,600
that is equal to the phase voltage,
by definition on the phase

211
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,280
current

212
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,190
will be equal to the line voltage

213
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,360
divided by √3

214
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,810
times the line current.

215
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,230
We calculate exactely the same value,


216
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,040
Z

217
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,330
but this time for a delta setup.

218
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,000
We can write, by definition, that
it is the phase voltage

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,300
divided by the phase current,
and by replacing with

220
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,150
the elements that we have calculated,

221
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,900
(U_l*√3) / I_l.

222
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,670
What do we see ?

223
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,850
We see that

224
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,900
the ratio between Z in a delta setup

225
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,750
is equal to three times

226
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,470
Z in a wye setup.

227
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,590
The ratio can be seen here,
you have a

228
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,370
ratio of √3 in the

229
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,700
numerator

230
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,940
of the impedance in a delta setup.

231
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,310
It is at the

232
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,160
denominator for

233
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,920
the impedance in a wye setup. 
The ratio between the two gives exactely

234
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,279
a ratio of 3

235
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,500
between these 2 impedances to get
the same power

236
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,620
when the voltage does not fluctuate.

237
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,200
We can even go further and
write that the norm

238
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,880
that we wrote before, as being

239
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,300
the norm in a delta setup equal
to three times the norm in a wye setup.

240
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,020
We can 

241
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,300
show that this is also valid
for the complex value

242
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,450
which means that the complex impedance Z

243
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,050
the vector, is equal to three times

244
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,450
the complex

245
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,860
impedance Z in a wye setup.

246
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,440
And then, of for example, we have

247
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,910
a battery of capacitors,

248
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,780
this battery of capacitors has

249
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,740
a

250
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,010
reactance equal to 1/(cω).

251
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,120
We can write

252
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,330
that at this moment, by multiplying

253
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,130
by three

254
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,650
to get a battery of capacitors this
time in a 

255
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,520
delta setup, times ω.

256
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,050
Then,

257
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,410
we can say that

258
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,460
the capacitance that needs
to be chosen

259
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,780
in a delta connexion mode

260
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,879
will be equal to the capacitance

261
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,710
of a wye mode, divided by 3.

262
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,330
The ratio 3

263
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,600
exists in this case.

264
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
We will now do an example,
to show you how this

265
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,070
can be done in a complete way

266
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,060
with a

267
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,290
complex

268
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,110
impedance and we will observe this ratio 3.

269
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,400
For this example, we will then take a

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,070
symetrical three-phase consumer, whose active power

271
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,220
is equal to 20 kW

272
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,800
and whose apparent power is equal to 30 kVa.

273
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,040
The supply voltage

274
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,690
of a line is equal to 500

275
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,570
volts.

276
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,199
We ask to calculate the

277
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:58,199
unknown impedance Z in a wye and delta setup.

278
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,550
Knowing that 

279
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,180
we have this inductive system.

280
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,080
We then start with a wye coupling.

281
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:13,000
In a wye coupling, we can calculate
the apparent power.

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,770
We start by calculating S.

283
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:20,270
S is equal to √3 times the line voltage,
times 

284
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,410
the line current.

285
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,439
We can then extract the line current

286
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,589
from this equation, which is equal to

287
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,310
S_l / (√3*U_l).

288
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,660
And that because, I remind you,
we are in a wye coupling.

289
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,730
It is also

290
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,810
the phase current.

291
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,230
So if we have a line current that is
equal to,

292
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,890
by definition,

293
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,620
500 V,

294
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,890
the phase current is equal to, numerically
in our case,

295
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,800
34.6 A.

296
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,510
We know that,

297
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,190
by definition, the impedance Z is R

298
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,180
plus j*x, and

299
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:12,900
we also have P, the active power, 
that is equal to 3*R*I^2.

300
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,250
From there we extract

301
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,390
the calculation of the resistance that we
are looking for since we want to

302
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,870
discover R and x to completely
determine the impedance

303
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,940
Z

304
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,210
and we have

305
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:25,200
the active power consumed by
the circuit.

306
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,150
R is therefore equal to, by extracting
it from the previous equation,

307
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,890
R is equal P

308
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,779
divided by

309
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:32,929
three times

310
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,000
the phase current squared.

311
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,300
We have all the elements needed to calculate
this resistance, which is equal to 5,55 Ohm.

312
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,100
We can do, in the same way, 

313
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,200
the calculation

314
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,190
of the reactive, and so of the reactance x.

315
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:54,170
Firstly, the reactive is calculated starting from

316
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:59,020
the fact that it is √(S^2-P^2),
which gives

317
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,300
the reactive Q

318
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,580
and we get

319
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:10,600
+22,36 kVAR.

320
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,640
I say +22

321
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,240
because we have

322
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,560
said previously, and it is given,

323
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,890
that the system is inductive, so the
reactive must be positive.

324
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,900
Then,

325
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,900
we also know that Q = 3*x*I_ph^2.

326
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,610
We can therefore determine x

327
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,200
by writing, in the same way, Q
divided by three times

328
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
the phase current squared,

329
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,260
namely

330
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,900
6,21 Ohm.

331
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,130
We then have Z,

332
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,590
to finish,

333
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,000
by substitution,

334
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,440
is equal to 5,55 Ohm

335
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,000
+ j*6,21, namely

336
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
8,33*e^j(48,2°).

337
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,300
To finish, our impedance

338
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,470
has been determined

339
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,880
thanks to this wye coupling.

340
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,240
Now in a delta coupling,

341
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,020
in a delta coupling, a certain number of
values will change.

342
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,960
We still have by definition that

343
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,980
the apparent power is equal to √3 times

344
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,100
the line tension, times the line current.
However, this time,

345
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,380
the phase current has a ratio of √3
with the line current.

346
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,240
We can then determine a certain number of
values from this starting point.

347
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,490
The active power is always calculated

348
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,080
from the Joules losses,

349
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,360
namely three times

350
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,910
R, times the phase current squared.
And then

351
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,590
3 times R

352
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,910
times the line current

353
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,500
squared, divided by √3*√3

354
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,250
that is 3

355
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,660
so finally R*I_l^2.

356
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,430
We can then say that

357
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,850
R, if we now want to choose and
calculate R, is equal to P

358
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,920
divided by I_l^2.

359
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,950
What is I_I worth?
We wrote it just on top here

360
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,500
S is equal to √3*U_l*I_l. S squared 

361
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,010
is 3 times

362
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,950
U_l^2, times

363
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,240
I_l^2.

364
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,520
And we can then replace this here

365
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:38,100
which gives us 3*P*U_l^2 / S^2.

366
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,300
We have all the elements to calculate

367
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,580
and we get

368
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,500
16,7 Ohm.

369
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,270
We directly see that it is equal to 
3 times the resistance

370
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,519
that we had previously

371
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:53,700
with the wye coupling.

372
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,800
We can of course do exactely the same
thing, by calculating with

373
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,910
the reactive x

374
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:07,800
that is 3*x*I_ph^2

375
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,090
et we will get x = Q/(I_l^2).

376
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,980
Finally, we will discover that this is
also equal to 

377
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,500
18,6 Ohm.

378
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,240
We obtain our new impedance Z,
this time in 

379
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,950
a delta setup and coupling,

380
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,600
which is equal to

381
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:35,800
16,7 + 18,6j,

382
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,210
namely

383
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,900
25*e^j(48,2°).

384
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,380
We see that 

385
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,220
this

386
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,650
impedance in 

387
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,590
delta is equal to 

388
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,590
3 times the impedance Z that we have
just calculated

389
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,610
preivously in a wye setup.

390
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:58,020
We also remark that these two vectors are
collinear, the angle is

391
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,200
exactely identical,

392
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,770
the norm is just multiplied by three, 
as we have seen here with the change

393
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,960
between R

394
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,850
and x

395
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,639
that generally have a ratio of 3

396
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:10,580
between the wye and delta setups.

397
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,440
To conclude, we have seen three
different modes that show you the

398
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,490
possibility when changing from a

399
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,400
wye or delta coupling, to either adapt

400
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,630
the charge to a different network

401
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,750
or to modify the power, or even

402
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,850
to adapt the charge in a change of mode
from wye to delta

403
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,730
all the while keeping

404
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,430
exactely the same absorbed power

405
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,850
with an identical network.
