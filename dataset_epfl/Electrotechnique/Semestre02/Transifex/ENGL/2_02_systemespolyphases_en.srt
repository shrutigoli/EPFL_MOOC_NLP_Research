00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Hello

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,570
In this second lesson

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,300
we will focus on the 
generation of a polyphase system

4
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:14,379
and define the different elements
that charecterise 

5
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:18,320
the idea of having a polyphase system

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,140
We will then after a

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,659
brief introduction

8
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,740
describe these polyphase systems,
define what a polyphase

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,749
system is

10
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:29,710
and show several examples and

11
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:31,460
end on a conclusion.

12
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,890
Polyphase systems are
in fact a set

13
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,780
of a certain number of values

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,640
Thus, we can define a polyphase system
as the set of m values

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,630
of voltage or current.

16
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:49,330
Further more, the definition of a
polyphase system of these m values

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,379
is that they

18
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:53,000
all have the same frequency

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
Naturelly 

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,250
in a sinusoidal manner

21
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,620
Further more, if we now wish
to characterise this system and

22
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,200
give more descriptors, we can
say that a polyphase system

23
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,530
will be symetrical or

24
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,660
balanced

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:12,380
if the effective value (RMS) of the values are equal.

26
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,620
We will now also define the order
 of succession of the phases

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,510
this order, we shall call it "k"

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,530
this order of succession of the phases

29
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,000
will also allow us to get 
the corresponding

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,920
phase shift angle

31
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,230
between the different voltages or values
of the polyphase system.

32
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,390
In order words, this phase shift

33
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,520
will be equal

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,940
to this order, k, multiplied by 2π/m

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,750
m being the number of values
of the polyphase

36
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,670
system.

37
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,650
Will shall see further on that generally

38
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,900
we will focus

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,179
on a three-phase
system

40
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:51,729
but that it is possible to have 
networks of polyphase systems of

41
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,730
2, 4, 5, or even more phases.

42
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,440
Another interesting element is to
define

43
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,159
the order of succession of the phases

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,720
or in which direction

45
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,490
this succession happens.

46
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,459
Thus, the phase change

47
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,209
will allow us to define the
forward system or the

48
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,749
reverse system.

49
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:16,939
First of all, the forward system will
be defined

50
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:20,320
as the succession of phases

51
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,569
in the negative trigonometric
order

52
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,969
Logically, the reverse system
will then be in the

53
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,299
forward trigonometric order.

54
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,689
We shall now see an example

55
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,599
that allows us to show

56
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,409
different polyphase systems

57
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:39,260
and what is

58
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,629
their succession order at this moment.

59
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,639
Before that, I will show you
a simple diagram

60
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,239
that illustrates two

61
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:48,929
voltages, you have here

62
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:52,309
U2 in a temporal manner

63
00:02:52,309 --> 00:02:53,799
and, another voltage

64
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,949
U1

65
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:57,309
phase shifted compared to U2.

66
00:02:57,309 --> 00:02:59,850
I remind you that this temporal
diagram

67
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,609
can be represented in the
complex plan by vectors

68
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,289
called phasors

69
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,769
and thus the U1 vector

70
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:09,149
aligned here

71
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:12,199
with the origin 0 of the omega(t)

72
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,419
find themselves

73
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,189
with this vector on on the real part

74
00:03:16,189 --> 00:03:18,090
and U2 phase shifted

75
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,239
by π/2

76
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,609
finds itself here.

77
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,889
We can clearly see the order of
succession of the phases that goes from U1

78
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,389
to U2, first of all m is equal to 2
we only have 2 values

79
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:29,139
here

80
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:33,119
the order is equal to 1 since we have forward succession

81
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,129
order.

82
00:03:34,129 --> 00:03:35,649
So here is an example

83
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,589
of a two-phase system, we can
call it two-phase because we have 

84
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:42,000
only two phases and here
for example

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,200
2 currents associated

86
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,739
with a circuit to which this polyphase system
could be connected to.

87
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,000
We will also study a particular case

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,650
before showing two
more examples.

89
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,869
It's when the order of succession, k, 

90
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,399
is equal to zero.

91
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:02,879
A system with an order k

92
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,789
equal to zero

93
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,619
means that

94
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:10,669
all the values are aligned on themselves
from the perspective of the phase.

95
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,559
In other words, all the phasors are
confounded with each other.

96
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:18,569
For this particular case

97
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:19,530
we will say

98
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,769
that the system

99
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,330
of order 0 is

100
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,259
homopolar.

101
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:28,219
You have here two examples of

102
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:30,349
polyphase system networks.

103
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:35,430
The first: you can see here that
we have 5 values, all

104
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,800
of equal RMS amplitudes.

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,000
So 5 values mean that we have
m = 5 phases.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,620
the order of succession is 2, so
k = 2 in this

107
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,090
particular case since we have

108
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,900
first of all, U1 followed by U2

109
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,520
then U3, U4, and finally U5.

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,469
Thus for this system

111
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,099
k = 2.

112
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:07,300
You have here a classical example of what
I've mentioned earlier, the very

113
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,389
particular case

114
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,169
where all the values U1, U2, U3 are confounded on the same

115
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:14,249
phasor.

116
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:16,050
We shall thus call

117
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,909
this polyphase system "homopolar" and the order of succession

118
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,349
of the phases k = 0.

119
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:26,699
The generation of energy transmission

120
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,069
is more effective in polyphase
systems, it is

121
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:33,589
the reason why in the 
majority of countries

122
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,670
a polyphase system

123
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:38,620
is used to transmit electric energy.

124
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,469
There is also another reason

125
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:45,599
that a polyphase system is used:
it is the fact that we can generate

126
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,849
a rotating field, thus generate

127
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:52,249
a electromechanical conversion by
using a polyphase system.

128
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,870
We can explain, demonstrate

129
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,090
that the generation of a polyphase system offers

130
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,630
the possibility of creating a magnetic
wave rotating inside

131
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,620
an electric motor.

132
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,930
Which is the beginning or basis

133
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,159
of mechanical generation in a system.

134
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,309
Another very important
element in polyphase systems

135
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:15,020
for those that are symmetrical,
in particular three-phase systems

136
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,010
is that the instantanous power in
these systems

137
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,919
is constant

138
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,619
Everything being symmetrical

139
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:25,389
the power being constant, we
can negate all vibrations linked

140
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,669
to a possible

141
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:29,430
mechanical alteration or mechanical

142
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,979
pulsation linked to a torque that
is created

143
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:33,540
in a manner

144
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,129
in a manner

145
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,229
where there is a dissymmetry.

146
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,009
It is clear that in Europe

147
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,689
we have the necessity
of having a polyphase system, in

148
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,900
particular three-phase, that allows

149
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,770
an easy electrical, mechanical

150
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,029
transformation

151
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,049
for all objects requiring
the placing of an electric

152
00:06:55,049 --> 00:06:56,259
motor

153
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,110
In conclusion

154
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,089
the system is polyphase if
we have m values of same frequency

155
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:06,449
we will say that a system is
symmetrical

156
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,939
is all the values and the phase
shift between these values

157
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:10,830
is equal.

158
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,680
And finally, we will call k

159
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,219
the order of succession of the phases

160
00:07:15,219 --> 00:07:18,300
and in particular when it is equal to zero

161
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,810
we will say that the system is homopolar
