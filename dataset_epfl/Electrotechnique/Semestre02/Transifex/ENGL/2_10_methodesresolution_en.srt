1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,560
Hello, during the previous lessons, we saw what transient states

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,419
are and how they are mathematically defined

3
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,169
We have also seen the fundamental physique principles that governs 

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,279
the ideal components R,L

5
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,449
and C.

6
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:24,789
A few applications showed the importance of those transient states.

7
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,609
In reality the elements L and C can't

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:29,800
exist alone, they are always combined 

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,920
by a parasite resistor

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,740
a resistor also has a parasite capacitor and inductance.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,490
During this lesson, we will elaborate a resolution method

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,490
to find the step response

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,239
of a circuit including elements R,L

14
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:48,999
or C

15
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,810
subject to a jump.

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,020
We will see, first of all, the mathematical fundamentals to solve

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,550
differential equations

18
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,010
derived from this method.

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,000
The resolution method that we propose, conist in three main blocks

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,500
First of all, the processing of the circuit sketch.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,200
Lets start by sketching.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,050
Then we define all the values that

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,770
are on the drawing.

24
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,080
Then reduce it, if necessary

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,530
write down the voltage and current

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,050
 equations

27
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,750
that is to say, the characteristic equation of each element

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,720
R, L, C.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,790
And finally

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,080
apply the Kirchhoff laws, that is to say, the laws of the bounds between

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,940
each element

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,200
derived from the formatting of the equations as the sum of 

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,930
derivatives.

34
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,429
The resolution of the differential equations

35
00:01:40,429 --> 00:01:41,650
is done by

36
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,040
the search of the solution of the homogeneous  equation

37
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,930
the search of the particular solution

38
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,060
in steady state, a settled state

39
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,600
and the sum of both

40
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,790
which leads us to the general solution.

41
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,300
The third block consists in defining the integration constants

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,170
that is to say, the expression of the impossibilities

43
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,849
either a current jump in an inductance, or a voltage jump of a capacitor terminal.

44
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:13,320
Finaly, we solve the whole system

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,399
to lead to the final expression of the solution.

46
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,849
The differential equations that we will deal with, are 

47
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,969
linear differential equations

48
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:26,699
until the second order, and with constant coefficient.

49
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,279
The differential equation is chararcterized by the sum of

50
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,300
the derivatives of an unknown function x

51
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:34,100
with constant coefficient.

52
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:40,800
We can write a such equation, wher

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,749
the coefficients

54
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:44,549
a_j

55
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,339
are constant coefficients

56
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:51,349
and the function f(t)

57
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,579
is as function of time

58
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,779
which is known.

59
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,939
The solution is

60
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,500
the sum of two partial solution.

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,309
The homogeounous solution

62
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,969
that is given by

63
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,199
a_0*x

64
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,949
plus a_1

65
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,689
dx/dt

66
00:03:17,689 --> 00:03:20,400
plus a_2

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,979
d^2x divided

68
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:24,099
by dt^2

69
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:26,969
is equal to 0.

70
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,199
And the particular

71
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,719
solution that satisfies

72
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:38,719
the equation (1).

73
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,449
The solution of the homogeneous equation is a sum of exponential functions

74
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:49,609
of the form

75
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,049
x_s(t)

76
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,209
is equal to A times

77
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,769
the exponential

78
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,379
of λt.

79
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:00,899
By replacing

80
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:04,729
this expression, this homogeneous solution

81
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:10,400
whose sum of derivatives of first order is equal to 2, it comes that

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,059
after simplification

83
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:17,069
by e^(λt)

84
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:21,840
a such equation has n solutions, here, n is equal to 2

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,379
n solutions λ_j

86
00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:29,669
real or complex. The final solution of the homogeneous equation is therefore

87
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:35,990
given by:

88
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,310
For the particular solution, its form is

89
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,449
directly linked to the function

90
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,580
f(t).

91
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,580
We will deal with two particular cases that are

92
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,560
specially useful in this application and that are

93
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,700
easy to solve.

94
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,550
It is

95
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,360
first of all

96
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,919
a constant function

97
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:01,960
f(t) = K.

98
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,000
It is here

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,839
a constant continuous voltage of a power supply.

100
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,819
A second kind of 

101
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,849
time function.

102
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,939
For a constant function the particular solution is

103
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:21,909
constant

104
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:24,479
and given by

105
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,539
x_p

106
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,490
where the p stands for particular and is equal 

107
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,900
to K

108
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,050
on a_0.

109
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:39,129
For a sinusoidal  or cosinusoidal function, the solution is

110
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,860
a function of the same kind.

111
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,789
The resulting solution is the sum of the homogeneous 

112
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:49,430
solution

113
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,719
and the particular solution.

114
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:57,029
Which gives us:

115
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,069
The integration constants

116
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,960
a_j and λ_j

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,229
that are given by the initial conditions that are linked

118
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,849
to physical impossibilities

119
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:11,330
depending on inductances and capacitors, which mean

120
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,180
that we can not do a current jump in an inductance

121
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,770
and that we can not perform voltages jumps of the capacitor

122
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,900
terminals.

123
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,690
Applying these conditions lead to a linear system

124
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,749
of equations allowing to define the coefficients a_j.

125
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:32,469
We will now see a few properties of the exponential.

126
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,119
An exponential with a negative exponent

127
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:39,529
has one of the two following forms:

128
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,900
f_1(t)

129
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,119
is equal to A times

130
00:06:45,119 --> 00:06:48,449
e^(-λt)

131
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,300
or

132
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,899
f_2(t) is equal

133
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,939
to A times 1 minus

134
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,110
e^(-λt).

135
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,189
If we consider the first function f_1(t)

136
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,289
and that we define its initial

137
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,009
slope it is equal to

138
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,839
th derivative of f_1(t) as function of time

139
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,740
at the time t=0

140
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,740
and this is equal to -Aλ.

141
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,330
The intersection point

142
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,080
between the asymptotic value, which mean the intersection of the time axis

143
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,069
and its tangents, is given by the following equation.

144
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:43,900
0 = 1 - λ*t_asy

145
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,289
or

146
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:47,350
t_asy = τ = 1/λ.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:59,039
And this, is the time constant, that we call τ (tau).

148
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,979
The graphical representation, gives us

149
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,050
the following curve

150
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,409
as function of time

151
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:11,740
the function f_1(t), which is

152
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,929
an exponantial

153
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:19,259
but if we consider the slope origin

154
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,169
its intersection with the asymptotic value

155
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,059
which is the time axis

156
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:26,949
is done

157
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,000
at the time τ.

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,759
For the second function

159
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,480
that we have considered

160
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,160
in the time domain

161
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,820
here, the equation is very simple,

162
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,740
the equation of the tangent is very simple because it goes through the origin.

163
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,130
It's simply the slope

164
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,420
the intersection with the asymptotic value, which is, the stabilized and permanent

165
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:52,800
value of the

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,850
system

167
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,410
is done at the time

168
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,930
t = τ.

169
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,950
If we picture a such equation

170
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,200
like, for example,

171
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,820
u(t) = A*(1-e^(λt)) and we vary the first

172
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,330
parameter A

173
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,940
we can see that

174
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,370
the parameter A

175
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,350
influences the amplitude

176
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,310
of the signal.

177
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,530
We vary A, we see that the amplitude of the signal

178
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:31,530

decreases, increases with A.

179
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,660
Using the same equation

180
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,759
and this time

181
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,390
by varying the parameter A

182
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,520
we see that

183
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,650
the influence of this  λ  parameter doesn't effect the amplitude anymore

184
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,869
but the

185
00:09:45,869 --> 00:09:48,160
speed of the rising of the curve

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,400
till the asymptotic

187
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,930
value.

188
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,920
And it's for this reason that the λ is associated

189
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,190
with the time constant.

190
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,900
During this lesson, we have seen the method to describe

191
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,110
mathematically

192
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,510
a circuit, and how to put it under an equation form, in this calculation purpose and the evolution of

193
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,440
the current or the voltage at a particular spot of the circuit.

194
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,500
Once the solution found, we have analyzed this solution and brought out 

195
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,420
some noteworthy elements

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,490
as the slopes at the origin

197
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,060
the asymptotic values, or particular points.

198
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,160
During the following lessons, we will apply those methods on

199
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,830
circuits of the type RL or RC.
