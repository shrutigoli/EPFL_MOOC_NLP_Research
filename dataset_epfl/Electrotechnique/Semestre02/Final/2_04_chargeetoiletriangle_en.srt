00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,169
Hello

2
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:08,259
and welcome to this lesson
dedicated to symmetrical three-phase

3
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,699
systems, and in particular to the
definition

4
00:00:10,699 --> 00:00:15,079
of the load in a wye or delta circuit.

5
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:18,029
In this lesson, after a short 
introduction

6
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,849
we will define what the symmetrical

7
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,810
three-phase load is

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,159
and then study the different 
wye or delta assemblies

9
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,529
and finally, end on a conclusion.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,130
By definition, a balanced load

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,580
is a set of three impedances

12
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,600
strictly identical
that we have named here Z

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,710
Three identical impedances
through which three currents flow

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,370
I_ux, I_vy, I_wz

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,300
three defined voltages
U_ux, U_vy et U_wz.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,999
The impedance Z

17
00:00:54,999 --> 00:01:00,900
common to the three branches is
defined as ze^(jφ)

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,629
and is commonly called

19
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:07,140
the phase of the user

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,700
We can then define in this diagram

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,500
what we call the phase voltage
and what we call the phase current.

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,820
First of all, the phase voltage,

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,920
well, this phase voltage is the
voltage across each of the

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,000
branches of the Z impedance,
we have three branches

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,450
so we have

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,190
U_ux

27
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,160
U_vy

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,050
and U_wz.

29
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,040
Similarly, we can define a
phase current

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,140
and these phase currents are the
currents flowing through these impedances.

31
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,440
namely :

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,470
I_ux

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,470
I_vy

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,850
and I_wz

35
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,660
Since all three

36
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,540
Z impedances are strictly
equal

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,240
the effective (RMS) value

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,190
of the three phase voltages, as well as that of
the three phase currents, will always be equal.

39
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,020
Only

40
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,360
the phase shift between these values
can be different

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,420
thus defining which branch
we are talking about.

42
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,789
For a symmetrical system

43
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:15,200
we can then define what is known
as the phase current

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,429
in effective (RMS) value

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:21,809
which is worth the phase voltage divided by

46
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:26,249
the norm of the Z impedance.

47
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:27,809
The wye connection

48
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:33,349
is a way to connect this balanced
load, these three strictly identical

49
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:35,049
Z impedances

50
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:36,900
in such a way as to form

51
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,150
a Y, or wye

52
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,669
as shown in the drawing, here, that you
have on the left.

53
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,489
the three impedances are connected here

54
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:48,019
in a common point X, Y, Z

55
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,939
often called the neutral.

56
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,369
it is possible to connect
this neutral to an additional

57
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,390
terminal

58
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,700
generally, when the load is

59
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
perfectly symmetrical

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,530
the three currents that flow in
the common knot

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,300
here at the centre, is null.

62
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,739
It is thus unnecessary to
connect this neutral.

63
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,430
Another way to draw this
wye schema

64
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,480
is shown on the right figure

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,539
it is strictly identical, it's
simply another way to 

66
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:23,309
draw this wye connection.

67
00:03:23,309 --> 00:03:25,049
A few remarks now

68
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,500
concerning the power supply

69
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
R, S and T

70
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,200
that define

71
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,619
the symmetrical

72
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:38,780
three-phase power supply on which
we connect our balanced

73
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,819
symmetrical load

74
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:43,200
What we can say is that
we have

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,119
by definition

76
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,939
three phase

77
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:52,200
voltages, just like we have
defined previously, so here

78
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,679
U_ux

79
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,089
for example

80
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:57,929
This U_ux

81
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:02,500
corresponds to the voltage U

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,570
between

83
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,600
the R terminal of the line

84
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,399
and the neutral point.

85
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,059
We can write for the three other
voltages

86
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:16,200
namely U_wz

87
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,639
and this U_wz

88
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,650
is equal to U between T and the neutral.

89
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,680
And finally

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,060
for the third

91
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,600
namely U_vy

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,100
and this U_vy is equal
to the voltage between S and N.

93
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,300
In other words

94
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,590
the phase voltages of our three
impedances presented here, are

95
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,770
in fact equal to

96
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,669
simply U.

97
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:49,810
in effect

98
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,000
the effective (RMS) value that we 
find on the grid.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,499
Three other important elements :

100
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:59,479
the currents.

101
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:02,500
We have here

102
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,500
the current flowing through the phase

103
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,500
and this phase, we can also
specify :

104
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,210
the current between U

105
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,069
and Y.

106
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:20,249
If we compare this current to
the one defined previously in

107
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:22,120
other lessons

108
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,000
with the current

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,400
that we have called "line current" R

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,800
we can note that

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,000
this line current I_r

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,449
is equal to the phase

113
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,749
current U_y, why?

114
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:40,559
Because at this knot, here

115
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:44,849
There is no possibility for the
disappearance of part of the current, thus

116
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,589
all the current that enters 
the line, I_r

117
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,809
must go through

118
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:52,379
the phase, present here, Z.

119
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,400
And we will find the exact same
configuration for the two

120
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,689
other

121
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,789
line currents.

122
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,819
We can then write for these three
line currents

123
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,229
firstly

124
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,300
that I_ux

125
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,529
the first branch and U_ux

126
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,280
the phase voltage

127
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,819
divided by

128
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,809
Z, the impedance.

129
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:18,429
We've just written that this U_ux,
the voltage between U and X is

130
00:06:18,429 --> 00:06:19,809
the voltage between

131
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,680
R and the neutral

132
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,300
always divided by
the impedance Z.

133
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,460
We can write that this is
simply U

134
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,960
divided by Z

135
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,430
effective (RMS) value and the norm of Z

136
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,100
multiplied by e^j(α-φ).

137
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,460
This for the first current

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,729
the current

139
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:44,560
that we will also
call line current

140
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,580
since it is equal to

141
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,000
we've said before, to I_r

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,899
We can write the exact same
thing

143
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:57,139
for the two other currents
First, I_vy

144
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:01,180
We immediately simplify, we
write the final result : U/Z

145
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,199
e^j

146
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,210
and we have here (α - φ)

147
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,509
and this is phase-shifted by 2π/3.

148
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:11,129
And the same result for the third
current

149
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:12,969
I_wz =

150
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,949
U/Z

151
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,879
(α - φ - 4π/3).

152
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,400
We can also write that this
is equal to

153
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,059
I_s, and that this is equal to I_t
namely the three line currents.

154
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,379
We can thus see that in
a wye setup

155
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,250
our line currents

156
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,599
correspond

157
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,400
to the phase currents

158
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,500
and that the line

159
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,499
voltages are not equal to
the phase voltages.

160
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,889
This can be seen

161
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,080
in this diagram where
we have represented

162
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,689
the three phase

163
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:54,679
voltages

164
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:55,749
U_rn

165
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:57,679
U_tn, U_sn

166
00:07:57,679 --> 00:07:59,360
and we discover here

167
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,589
the current vectors

168
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,270
that are generally bigger than the
voltage vectors

169
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,810
since these currents correspond to
the line

170
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,860
currents.

171
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,969
We can thus write

172
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,770
that I_ux, as mentioned
previously

173
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,600
is the line current, I_r

174
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
I_vy

175
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,360
is the line current I_s

176
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,449
and I_wz

177
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,899
is the current I_t.

178
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,309
In short

179
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,719
the line

180
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,300
current, in effective (RMS) value

181
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,580
is equal to the current flowing

182
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,170
through the phase

183
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,840
in effective (RMS) value, and that is
equal

184
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,019
to the voltage

185
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:42,899
divided

186
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:46,480
by the impedance Z.

187
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,700
What about the neutral ? An important
question about this common point that

188
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,730
we have

189
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:55,070
noticed between the X, Y and Z
connection.

190
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,390
To find out, we just need to add
together the three currents

191
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,809
that converge at this common point

192
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,210
at this knot

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,230
and, using Kirchhof, we can very
obviously write

194
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,420
that it is the sum of the

195
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,010
three line currents listed.

196
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,369
We know and we have defined
what were, or are, 

197
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:18,579
these line currents.
We can then simply add them up

198
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,180
in a vectorial manner

199
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,800
and we have

200
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
for the first I_r

201
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,200
e^j(α-φ)

202
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,240
another vector phase-shifted

203
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,230
by 2π/3

204
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,230
and the third phasor, a vector
phase-shifted by 4π/3.

205
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,640
and this gives us 3 vectors

206
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,340
perfectly phase-shifted by 2π/3

207
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,480
and the total is equal to 0.

208
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,870
And thus, as I was saying
previously

209
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,160
does not necessitate the
connection to the neutral, since

210
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,900
anyway, in this

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,640
neutral, or common point,
there normally

212
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,470
isn't any current flowing.

213
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,470
This is then true

214
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,200
only if

215
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,699
the load is a balanced load
and if the grid is

216
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,930
symmetrical

217
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,960
Let's move on to another form of
connection. It is possible to connect

218
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,449
this balanced charge, not in

219
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:20,869
a wye setup, but in a delta. We can
clearly see the difference

220
00:10:20,869 --> 00:10:24,190
the connection mode looks like a

221
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,320
triangle, or delta, a triangular shape,
drawn like this

222
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,410
that can, in several cases, be drawn
according to this figure on the right

223
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,720
with a slightly more complex way
of drawing, but that often

224
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,660
when we have only straight lines, either

225
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,550
vertical or horizontal

226
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,170
allows us to solve these
drawing problems.

227
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,400
So sometimes we can see this drawing
in this shape

228
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,300
and in a slightly clearer manner

229
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,360
in the shape

230
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,690
on the left.

231
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,150
By studying now more in
detail this

232
00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,100
new diagram, or this new way
of connecting, we can observe

233
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,440
a certain number of elements
The first

234
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,890
concerning the currents.

235
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,140
The line currents, which is here

236
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,290
can no longer simply cross the current of the first phase

237
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,200
U_x

238
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
it will share itself here between

239
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,470
I_ux

240
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,840
and the other current I_wz. In effect,
we have here a knot

241
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,180
that makes it so that the current is
not equal but is split.

242
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,400
We will have, similarly

243
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,879
the current here

244
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,380
I_vy

245
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,410
and the current, the third

246
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,620
I_wz.

247
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,550
On the other hand, for the voltages

248
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,080
we will notice a surprising

249
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,810
thing compared to a
wye connection.

250
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,600
Here is the voltage

251
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,460
U_ux

252
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,400
we can see that this voltage is measured
between the terminals R and S

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,860
and thus

254
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,800
we notice that

255
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,720
this voltage U_ux is actually
the same voltage as

256
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,200
U_rs.

257
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,070
And this

258
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,750
in an identical manner for all
three phases

259
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,330
We can then write

260
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,070
that the phase

261
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,060
voltages

262
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,960
are confused

263
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,190
with the line voltages.

264
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,500
In a more strict

265
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,490
manner, we can say that U_ux
as mentioned previously

266
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,139
is U between the

267
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,070
R and S terminals, namely the line voltage

268
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,400
similarly, for the other two,
U_vy is equal to U_st

269
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,200
and for the third

270
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,070
U_wz

271
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,900
to U_tr

272
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,340
In other words

273
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,000
this phase voltage in
effective (RMS) value,

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,160
is equal to the line voltage of grid,
and thus

275
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,620
√3*U.

276
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,970
For the currents

277
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,300
using Kirchhof by writing

278
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,610
the different equations of the 

279
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,700
three line currents and

280
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,960
of the three phase

281
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,670
currents, we can write

282
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,870
in a general manner

283
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,340
that the line current is equal to √3 times

284
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,510
the phase

285
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,090
current.

286
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,870
Furthermore, these line currents form a
symmetrical system that will be

287
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,510
delayed by π/6 compared
to the phase currents.

288
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,280
We have here the final diagram that
shows the line currents

289
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,490
in a delta setup

290
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,140
I_r

291
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,720
I_s

292
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,150
and you have I_t, here, in the
diagram

293
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:46,270
and you have, in a vectorial manner
this demonstration with I_wz

294
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,750
minus I_wy, namely,
in effect

295
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,470
the manner of doing, using Kirchhof,
by adding on the knot

296
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,810
of the three lines, the currents
that meet there.

297
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,550
We can thus demonstrate that the line
current is equal to √3 times

298
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,350
the phase current.
In other words

299
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,010
for example for I_r

300
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,770
and the difference with I_ux,
thus the phase

301
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,500
the first phase Z, I_ux

302
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,319
we can clearly see a ratio of √3 between

303
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,070
the lengths of these two vectors.

304
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,600
And all of this phase shifted, as mentioned
previously, by π/6

305
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,910
creating a new symmetrical
phase-sifted system.

306
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,710
We can, to sum up

307
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,460
give

308
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,820
a table

309
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,010
of the setups, in wye or in delta

310
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,530
and what this gives for the phase
voltage and the phase current.

311
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,790
We will thus write in this table
the setup

312
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,890
namely, is the setup in a wye
configuration

313
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,850
often written as Y

314
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,830
to look like the letter Y
or a delta

315
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,000
that we often write

316
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,130
as a delta triangle like this.

317
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,600
Thus we work, here, a table, that
will allow us

318
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,630
to give

319
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,100
this configuration for

320
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,890
the two values that we've seen
previously, either the phase voltage

321
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:15,020
or the phase current. 

322
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,420
first, in the case of a wye, we
have noticed that

323
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,540
the phase current is equal to
the line current

324
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,020
in a wye setup. However,
the phase voltage

325
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,100
has a √3 ratio, namely

326
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,320
the line voltage

327
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,030
divided by √3 for the phase voltage

328
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,700
It is in fact the exact opposite
for a delta setup, we have

329
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,350
a phase voltage

330
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,730
equal to the line voltage, in this delta

331
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,880
setup and for the current

332
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,990
a ratio of √3.

333
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,770
To finish

334
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:58,980
here is a little conclusion to say that
we have defined a symmetrical

335
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,350
balanced load.

336
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,590
We have seen

337
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,590
the wye setup, the delta setup
to define the phase voltages

338
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,640
, phase currents and their relationship
with

339
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,600
line currents and line voltages.

340
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,690
And finally, that these relationships
are often crossed

341
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,700
thus we often have

342
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,500
one of the currents equal to the
 other, or with a ratio of √3

343
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
and in an identical manner
for the voltage.

344
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,160
Thank you and until next time.
