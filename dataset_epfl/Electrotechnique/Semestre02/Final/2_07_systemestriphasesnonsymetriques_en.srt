00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello, welcome to the 7th lesson,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,670
dedicated to non-symmetrical 

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,390
three-phase systems.

4
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:10,200
In this lesson, we will define what
a non-symmetrical three-phase

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,979
charge is

6
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:15,639
and we will see how, by connecting
it in a wye or delta setup on a 

7
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:16,340
grid

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,760
we will be able to calculate

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,740
the current

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,659
or the voltage in each of the charge's branches,

11
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:24,589
letting us define the different values

12
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,499
of a three-phase grid, such as

13
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:30,109
the active power, the reactive power
or the apparent

14
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:31,949
power.

15
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:34,440
The non-balanced charge, or

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,950
non-symmetrical,

17
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,500
is easy to define:

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,850
it is actually a

19
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,780
three-phase charge whose three impedances
are not strictly

20
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,150
identical.

21
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,900
We will then have

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,960
Z_1

23
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,129
different than

24
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,089
maybe Z_2 which is different

25
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:55,440
than Z_3

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,179
in a setup

27
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:59,579
for example, in which,

28
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,240
in delta,

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,280
we have the

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,470
three impedances,

31
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,140
here with R,

32
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,840
S and T,

33
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,850
Z_1,

34
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,400
Z_2

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,130
and Z_3.

36
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,670
When can this happen ?
This can firstly happen

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,800
with a defect in a machine,

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,600
a machine or a charge

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,100
on which one of the impedances

40
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,270
has been voluntarily changed

41
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,910
or either a default,

42
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,070
for example,

43
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,049
when one of the charges has a 
defective connection

44
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,090
and one of the impedances is suddenly

45
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:39,270
disconnected.

46
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,310
This implies that Z_2 and Z_3
should be identical, Z_1

47
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,560
is then disconnected and switches to 0.
We then face

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,600
the case of a non-symmetrical charge
or non-balanced charge.

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,430
The first study case will be that of this
non-symmetrical charge

50
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,270
that will be connected using a delta setup.
We will see that it is the easiest study

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,130
that we can make, which can seem
paradoxical,

52
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,890
but we will see that

53
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,020
this way

54
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,810
of connecting in delta

55
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,849
is actually quite easy to resolve,
even for a non-symmetrical case.

56
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,119
We remind

57
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:18,189
the elementary values that we have
seen previously,

58
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:19,649
that is to say

59
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:21,179
we have here

60
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,419
the line

61
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:23,529
voltage,

62
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:25,359
the U_rs

63
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,749
which will be equal to this phase voltage

64
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,809
so I will write it U_ph1.

65
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:34,699
However,

66
00:02:34,699 --> 00:02:38,559
as we have seen when studying the delta mode,

67
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,959
the line current

68
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,569
I_R

69
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:44,789
will be equal,

70
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,319
by Kirchhoff,

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,759
to the subtraction between I_1 and I_3

72
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,029
since we have this knot

73
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:54,959
here.

74
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,900
So the Kirchhof equations will greatly help
us to resolve such

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,940
a problem

76
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,349
of a non-symmetrical charge

77
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,119
since, finally,

78
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:06,159
knowing that

79
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,529
Z_1, Z_2 and Z_3 are different,

80
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:10,389
we just need to apply,

81
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,699
in a relatively simple way, Kirchhoff.

82
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,729
Then,

83
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:15,720
we remind you 

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,200
what the three line voltage
U_rs, U_st and U_tr are equal to

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,529
in a symmetrical grid.

86
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:25,640
Thus,

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,469
U_rs

88
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:34,900
is equal to √3*U*e^j(π/6).

89
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,800
We then have a shift of 120 degrees
for U_st

90
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:47,100
with √3*U*e^j(-π/2)

91
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,089
and the third

92
00:03:49,089 --> 00:03:51,959
U_tr

93
00:03:51,959 --> 00:04:00,400
√3*U*e^j(5π/6).

94
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,300
This being said, and knowing that the
phase voltage on the terminals of each

95
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,999
impedance Z

96
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,049
is equal to the line voltage,

97
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,709
we can calculate, each time, for the
three values,

98
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,309
this time in an individual

99
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:18,059
manner, since we have a 
non-symmetrical system,

100
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,989
we can calculate I_1

101
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,700
which is equal to the phase voltage U_ph1

102
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:25,900
divided by

103
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,279
Z_1

104
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,919
but this phase voltage U_ph1, as shown
on the drawing, is also

105
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,069
U_rs

106
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,150
divided by Z_1.

107
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,300
This gives me the phase current I_1

108
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,219
and in the same way, will be 
able to calculate I_2:

109
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,659
U_st divided by

110
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:52,590
Z_2, and I_3:

111
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,270
U_tr

112
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,449
divided by Z_3.

113
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,400
Now that we have I_1, I_2, I_3,

114
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,280
we can, on each knot,

115
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,360
calculate the line currents I_r,

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,349
I_s

117
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,300
and I_t.

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,520
The three line current are calculated

119
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,930
by applying once again Kirchhoff
on the knot, as shown

120
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,180
previously

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,080
and then I_r is equal to

122
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,360
I_1

123
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,479
minus

124
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,599
I_3.

125
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,699
I remind you

126
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,200
that it is a vectorial

127
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,180
subtraction.

128
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,779
I_s

129
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:29,699
is equal to

130
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,300
I_2 minus

131
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,749
I_1 and

132
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:37,159
I_t

133
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:40,089
is equal to I_3

134
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:44,379
minus I_2.

135
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,919
The calculations are then quite long,
but

136
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,680
relatively simple

137
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
and need the calculation for each

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,089
branch

139
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,300
considered

140
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,800
separately, since it is non-symmetrical.
It is evident that,

141
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,979
in a symmetrical case,

142
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,629
we only look at one branche and all
the other branches

143
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:08,389
are simply shifted by 120 degrees.
It is not the case here

144
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:10,510
and each branch must be calculated

145
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,379
individually.

146
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,719
Now in the case of a charge which is,
this time, connected with

147
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:18,639
a wye setup.

148
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,300
In a wye setup, you have here

149
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,960
the presented diagram, with shows

150
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,620
a non-symmetrical impedance
connected in a wye manner,

151
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,560
with classically,

152
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,369
a neutral point that appears

153
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:38,039
and that be connected or not

154
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,939
to the network's neutral.

155
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:44,270
Thus, we will have two cases,
two solutions, if you want to 

156
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,279
starting off with this diagram here

157
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,889
and we need to define now which
of these cases we are handling.

158
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,369
So two possibilities.

159
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,879
The first

160
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,050
is that we have this wye charge

161
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,960
whose neutral is not connected.
Often, the neural is not

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,919
connected

163
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,029
to the network, so it is possible
to have a case like ours

164
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:11,680
if the neutral is not connected. This will
be our case a)

165
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,289
non-connected neutral, so

166
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,499
the easiest way to resolve such a problem
is to

167
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,439
take

168
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,969
the circuit

169
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:24,710
that is in a wye setup, and

170
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,200
convert the charge as for a 

171
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,129
delta setup.

172
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,000
When it is for a delta setup, we

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,080
can apply

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,830
the previous technique,

175
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,919
namely

176
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,550
the application of Kirchhoff's rules

177
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,870
on the circuit,

178
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,779
this time, a delta system.

179
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:51,270
Then, the conversion from wye to delta
is done as seen

180
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,160
in the previous lessons

181
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,520
using the rules

182
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,160
for the calculations of the impedances 
Z_1, Z_2 and Z_3 which pass

183
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,619
in a wye setup, or a delta setup.

184
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:04,250
That is the easiest. Once we have

185
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:10,020
a non-connected neutral, it is enough
to convert this circuit or this

186
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,809
charge for a wye setup, and to pass it

187
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,080
in a delta

188
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,600
setup, before applying Kirchhoff's technique.

189
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,219
In the second case b), where the neutral is connected.

190
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:25,700
Here things obviously change as we have an

191
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,419
impedance Z_n, which is the impedance 
through which the neutral

192
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:32,189
current will pass, to go back

193
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:33,320
to the source,

194
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,460
that needs to be taken into account.

195
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,000
We then need to calculate a certain number
of values

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,460
that will depend on the neutral voltage.
In particular,

197
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,540
we have a line current that can be
calculated,

198
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,570
still using Kirchhoff,

199
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,300
by taking the U_rn

200
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,800
minus U_n

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,680
and this divided by the impedance Z_1.

202
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,370
We can say, in the same way,

203
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,270
for I_s

204
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,010
U_sn

205
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,840
minus

206
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,600
U_n

207
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,930
divided by Z_2, and finally the third

208
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,510
current in the branche t, or in 
the line t,

209
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,310
is U_tn

210
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,090
so the phase voltage, minus U_n

211
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,270
divided by

212
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,330
Z_3.

213
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,710
We can also say that

214
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,680
the neutral current, in the neutral

215
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,700
which is normally zero in a symmetrical
charge, but which

216
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,800
will be non zero in the non-symmetrical case it

217
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,450
is then equal to this voltage U_n divided by

218
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,810
the impedance

219
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,700
coming back from the neutral Z_n.

220
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,420
We can also say 

221
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,090
that, and we know it,

222
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,060
this neutral current, by Kirchhoff,
is the sum

223
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,570
of the three line current, that

224
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,850
meet up.

225
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,670
From there, we can then replace a certain
number of elements

226
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,840
that come from what we indicated previously,

227
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,740
namely

228
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,209
I_n = I_r + I_s + I_t

229
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:14,750
and so, we replace with the three

230
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:20,600
elements that we have calculated
here I_r, I_s and I_t.

231
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,970
What does this give us?
This gives us

232
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,000
the following equation.
I_n

233
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,170
I put on one side the phase voltages
and on the other the neutral

234
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,300
voltages, so we have

235
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,700
U_rn divided by Z_1

236
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
plus

237
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,750
U_sn divided by Z_2

238
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,950
plus

239
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,470
U_tn

240
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,620
divided by Z_3

241
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,150
minus

242
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,519
and we have the neutral voltage that
come here, evidently, and that

243
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,700
multiplies 1 divided by Z_1

244
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,860
plus 1 divided by Z_2

245
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,770
plus 1 divided by

246
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,390
Z_3.

247
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,290
This is equal to,

248
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,420
I repeat it, the neutral voltage
divided by Z_n.

249
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,220
We will then eliminate the current

250
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,620
I_n in this equation

251
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,000
and make the top

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,550
equation, here

253
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,779
and the bottom equation equal.
In this way, we eliminate

254
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,200
the neutral current

255
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,440
and we can set down

256
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,510
the equation by writing

257
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,429
U_n equal

258
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,660
and then, by extracting the neutral voltage.

259
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,040
We find

260
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,700
U_n equal

261
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,210
firstly

262
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,790
to 1 divided by Z_1, plus
1 divided by Z_2

263
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,900
plus 1 divided by Z_3

264
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,800
plus 1 divided by Z_n

265
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,600
and all this at the power -1

266
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,750
that multiplies

267
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:58,730
U_rn divided by Z_1

268
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,790
plus

269
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,379
U_sn

270
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,800
divided by Z_2, plus

271
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
U_tn

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,730
divided by Z_3.

273
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,400
To be clearer, I eliminate what I
put here to get the whole equation

274
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,540
and

275
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,720
then

276
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,600
what do we still need to do?
The whole work is now to calculate

277
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,920
U_rn by taking, each time,

278
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,550
the voltage U_rs

279
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,750
that we have here

280
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,280
and by subtracting this voltage

281
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,060
U_n of the neutral that we have just calculated,
of course in a vectorial

282
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,510
way.

283
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,040
But this lets us

284
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,100
calculate the voltage U_n,

285
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,200
so

286
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,350
on the neutral impedance, to determine
completely the

287
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:50,510
different values of a non-symmetrical
charge that was connected

288
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,630
in wye, and whose neutral

289
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,020
is connected.

290
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,590
In conclusion, we saw the
non-symmetrical charge, we saw

291
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,400
how, in a delta setup,

292
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,900
we can in a relatively simple way
determine these different values

293
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,660
and by

294
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,750
applying the Kirchhoff equations

295
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,100
for the wye setup

296
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,619
two cases presented themselves, either the
neutral is connected

297
00:13:15,619 --> 00:13:18,849
and then we need to calculate everything,
in particulat the neutral

298
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:19,540
voltage

299
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,840
and to a relatively complex vectorial 
calculation on each of these

300
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,750
values.

301
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,180
Or else, the neutral is not connected

302
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,410
and it is enough to switch

303
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:32,680
from a wye to a delta setup
and to repeat what we have seen

304
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,030
for the delta setup.
