00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,980
Hello and welcome to this lesson 
dedicated to three-phase

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,269
electric power.

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,349
We will define what the 
instantaneous three-phase power is

4
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,000
in a symmetric system and will 
study using two examples

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,460
the power with a balanced 
charge, or rather, the powers

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,150
in

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,210
a balanced charge.

8
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,359
To define the instantaneous power within a symmetric

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,710
three-phase system,

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,540
I would like to start with a short reminder

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,620
of the different types of power that exist.

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,660
We can count

13
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,900
four types of powers,

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,370
starting with

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,420
the first

16
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,150
type, if one may say, of power.
The instantaneous power, which is the

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,950
power depending on time.

18
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:57,870
We have then defined the active power
by the letter P.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,870
This active power, we have seen that,
by definition, it is the average

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,730
of the instantaneous power

21
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,010
and it is also equal to

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,380
U*I*cos(φ)

23
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,500
and all this is measures in watts.

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,850
Then, we defined another type of power

25
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,600
that defines the round trip of the 
target non-convertible

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
power called reactive power, and

27
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,300
is by definition equal to

28
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:34,600
U*I*sin(φ), written in reactive volt-amperes.

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,800
Last but not least,

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,210
the power called apparent power

31
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,060
is equal to U*I and is

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,860
written 

33
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,240
in volt-amperes.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,800
Now, how do we solve the

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,630
power problems in a three-phase 
system ? We have seen that

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,090
by symmetry,

37
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,560
all these values are equal in each branch.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,340
We also know that the total power
in a system

39
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,740
is simply the sum

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,720
of these powers.
We can then say

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,629
that by symmetry

42
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,949
we can write the total power

43
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:17,739
as equal to the sum

44
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,169
of all three

45
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:23,169
powers in each phase.

46
00:02:23,169 --> 00:02:26,849
We will be able to write for
each of these types, or each

47
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,189
of these powers

48
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,439
Firstly, for the instantaneous power,
we can write

49
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,680
that it is U_ux which multiplies I_ux,
which are here

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,099
instantaneous values depending on time.

51
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:44,489
We then have the second phase U_vy

52
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:49,169
which multiplies I_vy, and the
third phase

53
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,289
U_wz which multiplies I_wz.

54
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:55,259
We will see later 

55
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,479
how this instantaneous power is
finally defined and what

56
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,169
conclusion we can draw

57
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:03,839
in the end.

58
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,599
For the active power,

59
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,389
as mentioned earlier, it is three times the
active power in each branch.

60
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:13,169
Therefore, we will write U_ux

61
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,679
and I_ux which multiply cos(φ),
and we have the same

62
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,569
for the other two branches U_vy

63
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,659
times cos(φ)  and

64
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,809
U_wz

65
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,539
times cos(φ).

66
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:31,309
Three times this

67
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:33,900
which will give us, since these three values

68
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,819
by being symmetrical, are equal

69
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,189
to three times

70
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:43,300
the phase voltage times the phase current times cos(φ).

71
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,290
You will probably remark

72
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,699
"yes, but if

73
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,599
one of these assemblies is a wye or delta,

74
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,950
will that change the result?"
Well no, since each time either the

75
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,179
line voltage is equal to

76
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,519
the phase voltage, or the line current
is equal to the phase current.

77
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,180
This is always true

78
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,580
and can even be replaced by

79
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,710
the line voltage and current voltage

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,409
by writing with the relation √3

81
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:07,389
U_I

82
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:09,939
I_l, cos(φ).

83
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,330
Therefore, for the active power in a 
three-phase system, we have

84
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,059
a simple relation

85
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:18,549
letting us focus on one phase only

86
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,779
and not on the more complicated system
since it is simply three

87
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,229
times each phase.

88
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:27,520
We can now write, in the exact 
same way, the reactive

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,009
power that we have

90
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,120
three times

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,889
the phase voltage:

92
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,270
phase current times the sine of the angle

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,490
and in the same way

94
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,949
write this depending on the line voltage
and line current.

95
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,340
We will then have, for the
apparent power,

96
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,460
three times

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,900
the voltage phase times the
current phase

98
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,300
or √3 times

99
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,520
the line voltage times

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,389
the line current.
All this

101
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,389
we can say

102
00:04:58,389 --> 00:04:59,689
is valid

103
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:02,610
whatever the setup, so

104
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,229
wye or

105
00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:09,740
delta.

106
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,069
We wil now find interest

107
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:18,300
in the instantaneous power, as described
previously, that I will rewrite here.

108
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,000
Each of these values U, I
and in each phase

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,159
corresponds to an equation that describes,

110
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:28,650
depending on time, 

111
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,949
the voltage and the current.

112
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,749
We will concentrate on the first
term U_ux and I_ux

113
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:39,509
and describe in a faster way the
two other terms that are

114
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,349
simply out of phase

115
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:42,900
by 2π/3

116
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,699
and 4π/3 respectively.

117
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:49,360
For the first voltage U_ux,

118
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,330
by definition, we know that
it is a sine or cosine.

119
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,110
I will describe here

120
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,870
√2 times the phase voltage, which
gives the peak voltage, and for example

121
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,050
lets take

122
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,000
the sine of ωt

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,960
with an additional random phase shift
which will define

124
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,260
the zero

125
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,449
of the voltage.

126
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,539
We have for the current

127
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,409
in the same way, √2 times 
the phase current

128
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:17,830
times a sine

129
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,639
that will by shifted by another angle

130
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:27,210
which will be either β, either (α - φ).

131
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,400
We can describe the other two
values U_vy

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,660
and U_vz and the other two values
of current

133
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
I_vy, I_vz

134
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,660
in the following way.

135
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,129
The instantaneous power is the sum
of the product of these two

136
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,180
functions

137
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,740
of these two functions

138
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,110
and these two functions. All this seems

139
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,599
very complicated here and we will apply
a relatively simple

140
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,839
general trigonometry formula that
I will show you here.

141
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:23,070
We know that the sine

142
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,129
of a

143
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:26,069
the multiplies the sine

144
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:27,349
of b

145
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:29,999
is really equal to a sum

146
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:35,199
of cosines. It is the cosine of the 
difference of arguments

147
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,589
minus the cosine of the sum

148
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:40,000
of arguments.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,839
This can seem more complicated than
before, but you will see that

150
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,289
it will make everthing easier.

151
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,139
By adding up all the terms of

152
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,649
previous U,I

153
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:56,809
that we have seen, we get:

154
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,319
First of all, we do

155
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,639
the difference of the arguments.
By doing this,

156
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,009
we have the term ωt + α that
disappears each time.

157
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:06,900
In each

158
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,820
element,

159
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,400
we always do (a-b) and the ωt + α

160
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,460
is found in each of them,
so it disappears.

161
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,449
Thus,

162
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:19,559
this instantaneous power that is finally

163
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,310
equal to three times

164
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,399
the phase voltage

165
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:25,700
times the current phase

166
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,629
and, 
since the ωt

167
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:30,460
plus α disappears each time,

168
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,559
there is

169
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,660
only

170
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,000
the cosine of φ left.

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,610
We then have a minus sign

172
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,600
that appears here

173
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,450
and this minus will

174
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,370
also be interesting
since we have here

175
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,860
a phase voltage, a phase current
that multiply this time

176
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,440
the sum

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,250
of arguments (a+b), and we have this three times.
I will write them down for you.

178
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,210
We have the cosine of

179
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,510
2ωt plus

180
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,320
2α

181
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,720
minus φ

182
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,970
then

183
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,220
another cosine of 2ωt

184
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,710
plus 2α

185
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,540
minus φ, minus 4π/3

186
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,880
and then

187
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,530
one more cosine of 2ωt

188
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,500
plus 2α, minus φ

189
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,410
that is out of phase of -2π/3.

190
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,500
All this,

191
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,250
this sum of 3 cosine perfectly out of
phase of 2π/3 each,

192
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,960
simply gives zero.

193
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,300
In conclusion,

194
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,190
we see that this instantaneous

195
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,350
power, so the power

196
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,880
as function of time

197
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,009
comes down to

198
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,440
because we have here in the first term,
three times the phase voltage

199
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,120
phase current, cos(φ), and this is
none other than the active power

200
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,510
that is also, and that is only
an observation

201
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,970
of

202
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,140
this lesson

203
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,520
that it is a constant.

204
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,680
In other words, the power depending
on time

205
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,990
is always a constant

206
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,260
and equal

207
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,090
to the active power.

208
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,460
This being so,

209
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,800
if we imagine

210
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,100
a future use of a three-phase network
of a charge for an

211
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,460
electromecanical conversion, this
means that

212
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,560
by converting this electromechanical
energy,

213
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,640
we can make a system that 
transfers and transforms a

214
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
perfectly

215
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,700
constant

216
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,470
power, so without torque undulation
or without a pulsing torque on

217
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,060
the machine.

218
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,380
I would now like to give you two
examples that will show you how

219
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,980
we can calculate

220
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,120
in a

221
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,820
practical exercise

222
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,750
the different powers that we have
just described.

223
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,530
We will then

224
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,990
start with

225
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,090
a first example

226
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,460
described in the following way:
we will connect

227
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,370
on

228
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:18,600
the lines R, S and T

229
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,520
three

230
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,690
completely identical and
symmetrical charges.

231
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,280
First of all,

232
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,950
this charge will be

233
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,670
made of three resistors
having a value of 10 Ohm

234
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,680
followed by

235
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,500
a capacitance

236
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,400
having a value of 185 μF.

237
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,590
We will connect this at

238
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,649
a symmetrical

239
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,840
three-phase electrical system.

240
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,700
We will now give different elements.
First of all, we know that the line

241
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,690
voltage is equal to 380 V.

242
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,170
If the line voltage is equal to 380 V,

243
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,080
I remind you that the phase voltage
is then equal, in a wye circuit

244
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,780
as here,

245
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,570
to √3 times less

246
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:13,500
so U_I divided by √3, namely 220 V.

247
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,240
We imagine having a frequency of 50 Hz
and we ask you to calculate

248
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,819
the different powers that we have

249
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:22,500
in this system.

250
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,490
First of all, we can define the
phase current

251
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,300
that circulates in

252
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,500
each branche with a different 
phasor or a different angle,

253
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,860
this phase current will be equal to
the phase voltage divided by

254
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,080
the impedance Z. 
We can then write

255
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,200
220*e^j(α).

256
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,080
We will define α as zero and
the reference

257
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,690
on Z

258
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,160
as the phase impedance. 
We see here that

259
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,630
we first need to define this
phase impedance.

260
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,820
Lets define

261
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,230
Z_ph

262
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,180
as known, since we know that it is
a resistor and a capacitor.

263
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,350
namely 10 - j

264
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,070
(1/ω) multiplied by 185*10^(-6).

265
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:15,410
This is also equal to 10 - 17.2j

266
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,590
or 

267
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,000
with Euler's formula

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,600
19,9*e^j(-60°).

269
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,980
It is a negative value

270
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,730
and is then a good control

271
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,910
since the system being capacitive, 
we must get a negative

272
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,320
phase.

273
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,600
The phase current is then equal to

274
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,080
220 V divided by 19.9

275
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,400
and this, e^j times 60° or π/3.

276
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,250
What is the power then equal to ?

277
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,370
We can define the

278
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,889
three types

279
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:58,050
of power : active, reactive and apparent.

280
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,530
Thus, the

281
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,170
active power in one of the phases
is equal to R*I^2

282
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:05,540
namely

283
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,630
10*121

284
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,930
which gives 1.21 kW.

285
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,680
We have the reactive in a phase that
is equal to

286
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,559
x, 

287
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,870
the reactance, times I^2.

288
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,400
This reactance, defined by the
capacitance, so  (-1/ωc)

289
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,410
that multiplies I^2

290
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,190
and that is equal to, with
the values 

291
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,000
in this example, 17.2*121

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,790
is negative, and that is normal
since we have

293
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,400
a capacitance, the reactive is

294
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,360
negative.

295
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,590
We now need to

296
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,820
determine the total power in the whole
system and not only in one of the

297
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,890
phases.

298
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,160
The total power

299
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,340
is equal to three times the phase power

300
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,370
namely 3.63 kW.

301
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,170
The total reactive

302
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,980
is simply three time the reactive

303
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,240
of a single phase

304
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,290
namely

305
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,600
-6,24 kVAR.

306
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,100
Finally,

307
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,850
the total apparent power

308
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,040
which, as we know it, is equal to
the active power squared plus

309
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,900
the reactive power squared, gives us

310
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,600
7,21 VA.

311
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,840
We can then see

312
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,920
that we just need

313
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,899
 to calculate

314
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,420
the powers on a single phase and to
multiply by 3

315
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,350
to get the values of the whole circuit.

316
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,030
A second example,

317
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,720
this time on a delta system, 

318
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,150
will be suggested.

319
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,510
We have here

320
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,740
our

321
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,000
three-phase electrical circuit

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,670
on which we will connect

323
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,730
a symmetrical charge,
composed this time of

324
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:58,040
an inductance

325
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,850
and a resistor

326
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:03,800
that are evidently perfectly symmetrical.

327
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,720
R will be equal to

328
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,280
15 Ohm and L

329
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,020
will be equal to 32 mH.

330
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,840
Here too, we ask you to calculate the
power given by this system on

331
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,330
this charge. Lets write here R, S and T,
and lets note that the 

332
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,200
line voltage is equal to 380 V.

333
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,210
We can then define the impedance Z
as a starting point, which is equal to 

334
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,630
R+jx, namely R+jωL

335
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,720
and with the numbers of this problem,

336
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,820
it gives us

337
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,280
the value of 15

338
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,220
plus

339
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,210
10j.

340
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,630
The norm of Z

341
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,000
is equal to√(15^2 + 10^2), namely

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,410
about

343
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,760
18 Ohm.

344
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,720
The cosine of the impedance, cos(φ)

345
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,040
being the real part divided by

346
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,150
the total impedance

347
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,700
is equal to 15/18

348
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,900
namely

349
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,410
0,83.

350
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:22,770
We know that the active power,
which is what is asked in this

351
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,700
exercise, is √3

352
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,810
times the line voltage, the line current
and cos(φ).

353
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:33,440
We now have the cosine of the angle, the √3

354
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,600
and the line voltage, only
the line current is missing.

355
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,350
I remind you that the line current
is the current circulating for example

356
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,320
here

357
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,880
in this line, and we are searching for
the effective value, that is identical in 

358
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,540
R, in S or in T.

359
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,330
We know that

360
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,960
it is the ratio between the line voltage
and the phase voltage

361
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,870
here

362
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,000
in the phase, it is √3.

363
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,610
We can then write that

364
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,870
the line current

365
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,140
is equal to, in effective value,
the phase current

366
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,720
times √3.

367
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,000
What is the phase current equal to ?

368
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,350
It is the phase voltage

369
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,260
divided by Z

370
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,510
(the norm)

371
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:17,300
and like always, multiplied by √3. This phase voltage, since we are in
a delta system,

372
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,480
is equal to the line √3

373
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,900
divided by Z

374
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,620
times √3.

375
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,300
We have here all the elements

376
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,440
and this is equal to

377
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,270
36,6 A.

378
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,750
Finally, 

379
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,950
we can say

380
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,900
that our power is equal to exactely
20 kW and this

381
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,800
finishes

382
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,690
the exercise, where you can see,

383
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,160
once again, that by looking at

384
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,820
only one impedance of the balanced charge

385
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,410
we resolve the

386
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,730
whole system.

387
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,420
To conclude,

388
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,800
we can describe two important elements.
The first one is

389
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,460
that in every symmetrical three-phase system
connected to a balanced charge,

390
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,310
the instantaneous charge is always constant.

391
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,830
The second point is that, to resolve
a power exercise on a

392
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,150
three-phase system,

393
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,230
we concentrate on one of the branches and we simply

394
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,700
multiply by three

395
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,050
the result that we found to get
the power of the whole system.

396
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,660
See you soon.
