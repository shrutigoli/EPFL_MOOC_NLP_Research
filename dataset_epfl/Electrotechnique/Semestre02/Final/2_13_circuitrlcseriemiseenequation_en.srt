00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,460
Hello, in the previous lectures,
we have treated the case of RC or RL

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,790
circuits that
lead to some differential

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,069
equations of the 1st order, and then
to homogenous solutions

4
00:00:15,069 --> 00:00:18,249
of exponential type.
During today's lecture

5
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:24,500
we will see the case of a voltage jump,
continuous voltage, in an RLC circuit in series.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,640
For the equation layout of the circuit, the
methodology stays the same, but the

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,529
solutions that we will find will be very
different because the differential

8
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,050
equation resulting from the circuit
proposed, is of the 2nd order.

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,300
Let's consider the following circuit, 
made of a continuous voltage supply,

10
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,979
of a switch

11
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:47,070
and of three elements R, L, and C
in series.

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,950
We start with

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,620
the values

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,050
of the circuit.

15
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,900
i(t)

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,780
the voltage drop across the
resistor

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,800
U_r(t)

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,580
the voltage drop

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,540
at the inductance terminals 

20
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,810
U_l(t)

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,900
and, the voltage drop at the terminals of 
the capacitor

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,970
U_c(t)

23
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:19,970
the voltage at the terminals of the three elements,
that we call U(t).

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,360
For a time t >= 0, we could
write the following equation 

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,240
U is equal to

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:44,200
R*i + L*(di/dt), the voltage drop
at the terminals

27
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:57,000
of the inductance, plus the voltage drop at the 
terminals of the capacitor : 1/C * ∫[-∞, t] i(t)*dt.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
By deriving this equation, we get 
the following equation

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:20,000
L * (d^2*i/dt) + R*(di/dt) + 1/C * i = 0,
the derivative of U.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,849
At this 2nd order differential equation

31
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,659
we can associate the following
characteristic equation

32
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:37,900
λ^2 * L + λ*R + 1/C = 0.

33
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,819
It is a 2nd degree equation

34
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:47,800
we will then determine the solutions λ_1 and λ_2.
This equation of second

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,800
degree, present two solutions

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,839
λ_1

37
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,339
et λ_2

38
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:56,549
that are given by the

39
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,700
constant terms of
the characteristic equation

40
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,219
with a difference

41
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:08,000
a + for the first solution,
and a - for the second solution.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,899
For visibility matters,
we will substitute the square root

43
00:03:12,899 --> 00:03:19,899
with the term ω, and we then get
λ is equal to

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:27,700
-R/2L ± ω.
Supposing these two equations

45
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,000
we can rewrite the current equation 

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,479
i(t) is equal to

47
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:54,100
A_1*e^(λ_1*t) + A_2*e^(λ_2*t)

48
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:04,000
The constant A_1 and A_2 have to be defined.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,100
In order to determine the integration constants
A_1 and A_2, we position at time

50
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,569
t = 0

51
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:13,889
knowing that at that instant there is
no current jump in the

52
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,200
circuit, because of the inductance in series.

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,449
Writing the equation of the current at
time t=0, we get the following equation

54
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:25,900
this equation, allows us to determine

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,889
a first relation between A_1 and A_2,
that we substitute

56
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:38,800
in the temporal equation of the current, that
leads us to the following relation:

57
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,400
We can develop this equation
knowing that

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,460
the constant λ_1

59
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,080
is equal to

60
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,500
-R/2L + ω.

61
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,500
the same for λ_2, if we substitute in the previous
equation, we get the exponential term

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,900
-R/2L 

63
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:15,000
times (e^(ωt) - e^(-ωt)).

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,449
For this case, we put the conditions
at time t=0

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,460
but we know that the current at time
t=0 is equal to 0.

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,500
The voltage at the terminals of the capacitor at time t=0, is equal to 0

67
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,000
the capacitor is initially empty.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,150
This gives us, the voltage
across the resistor

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,339
at time t = 0

70
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,449
is equal to R times

71
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,719
i(0) is equal to 0

72
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:47,000
and, the voltage at the terminals of the capacitor
at time t=0, is equal to 0.

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,090
we therefore still have

74
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,349
for the binding

75
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,520
equation at time t=0

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,520
U, the supply voltage which is equal to
L*(di/dt), the two other terms

77
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,800
disappear.
At this instant of the development

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,949
three cases have to be considered 

79
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,839
as function of the value of the discriminant 
under the scare root 

80
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,700
this discriminant Δ is equal to

81
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,100
(R^2/4L^2) - 1/LC.

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:35,860
the three cases are the followings:
Either the discriminant is bigger than 0

83
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,070
in that case

84
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,119
we get two real solutions.

85
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:49,119
That solution is called 'over-damped'.
In the second case

86
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,369
the discriminant is smaller than 0

87
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:03,300
we will find two complex solutions,
we are dealing with a "damped oscillation"

88
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,400
solution

89
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,919
And in the third case , when the 
discriminant is equal to 0

90
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,919
we have an unique and real solution,
we are dealing in this cas with a

91
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,500
"critical damping" solution.

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:28,500
We started dealing 
the case of an RLC circuit in series 

93
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,719
switched under a
continuous supply voltage

94
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:36,149
The used methodology remains the same 
The nature of the current leads 

95
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,460
to a differential
equation of the 2nd order.

96
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,270
The solutions for

97
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,279
the current i(t) will be dependent
of the discriminant.

98
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,700
The link between the values R, L and C
will determine the nature of the 

99
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,309
solution, and of the current.

100
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:56,429
During next lecture, we
will deal with the three cases of the discriminant

101
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:59,000
will lead us to three
different solutions.
