00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,109
Hello, in today's lecture, we will 
study the RL circuit in series.

2
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:13,279
This is an important subject as
the circuit is omnipresent in the field

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:18,179
of motors, transformers or power electronics.

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,359
As for RC circuit, we will first

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,310
deal with the case

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,699
where we apply a continuous voltage jump
to a circuit

7
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,029
then, we will apply to a circuit
a voltage jump

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,809
sinusoidal

9
00:00:31,809 --> 00:00:35,300
Let's start with a continuous source

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,860
We consider the following circuit, composed of a resistor in series

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:43,200
and an inductance, in series, 
switched at time t=0

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,180
under a supply voltage U.

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,150
We write

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,000
all the values according to the circuit

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,080
First of all

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,510
the current in the circuit

17
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,670
unique loop i(t)

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:02,250
the voltage across the resistor
that is equal to U_r

19
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,480
the voltage across the inductance
equal to

20
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,340
U_I

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,160
and the total voltage

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,960
across both elements which is
equal to u(t)

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,540
To deal with a general case, at time t=0

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,900
We will consider that

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,330
the current in the inductance is already equal to I_0

26
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,890
at t=0

27
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,160
i

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,350
is equal to I_0

29
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,909
We then write all the characteristic
equations of each

30
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,020
element, which means that for U_r

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,740
this is equal to R*i

32
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,310
and for U_I

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,300
the voltage across the U_l is equal to 
L * (di/dt).

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,480
These are the characteristic 
equations.

35
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
Then we consider

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,600
the loop and write the binding
equations

37
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,530
Which means that

38
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,440
u

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,750
is equal to

40
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,800
U_r + U_l

41
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
is equal to U

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,600
At time t = 0 and after (t>0).

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,300
Therefore, this binding equation

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,000
is written here

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,909
as R*i plus L

46
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,059
di/dt

47
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,139
is equal to U

48
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:28,189
We've seen that such equation

49
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,389
has

50
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:36,289
an homogenous solution, of
 exponential type

51
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:40,499
and permanent solution I_p, equal to

52
00:02:40,499 --> 00:02:42,579
for the settled state

53
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,109
U/R, the inductance

54
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:48,800
doesn't see any current fluctuation,
the voltage

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,799
across the inductance is equal 0,
and therefore, the current

56
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,499
in the loop, is equal to U/R.

57
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,000
This leads to

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,400
the general solution that is equal to I_s + I_p,
meaning that i

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,800
is equal to A

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,500
times e^(λt)

61
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,900
plus

62
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,239
U/R

63
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:15,239
that is, after derivation,

64
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,500
equal to λ, the internal derivative of the exponential, times

65
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,739
the same exponential

66
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,209
times the constant A.

67
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:27,559
If we substitute these equations of i

68
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,339
and di/dt, we obtain in the 

69
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,900
binding equation

70
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,499
to find the constant λ,

71
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:41,309
that R_i + L *(di/dt) is equal to

72
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,800
U

73
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:43,900
substituting

74
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,569
i(t) and di/dt

75
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:48,519
in this binding

76
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,289
equation, we have

77
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:58,000
R times i,
meaning A

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,699
e^(λt)

79
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,419
plus

80
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,989
U/R

81
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,239
times R

82
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,159
plus L times di/dt, meaning that, L times

83
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,419
λ

84
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,289
times A

85
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,829
e^(λt)

86
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,939
is equal to U.

87
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:24,370
We can simplify

88
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,870
these two termes, as well as

89
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,069
these ones

90
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:31,800
divided

91
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,330
in both sides of the equation by

92
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,169
this term

93
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,300
and therefore, R

94
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,659
is equal to -L

95
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:46,639
times λ, or

96
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,460
expressed differently

97
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,599
λ is equal to

98
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,300
-R/L, which is equal to

99
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,389
-1/τ.

100
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,909
τ being time constant

101
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,949
which is equal to 

102
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,449
L/R for a circuit

103
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,069
RL in series.

104
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,050
We should now define the
integration

105
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,300
constant A

106
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,139
and to do so, we move to t=0

107
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,589
at the interlock where there is no
current fluctuation

108
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:29,500
then, at t=τ, the exponential is equal to 1,
and we can write to following equation :

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:36,400
I_0 = U/R + A,  therefore A

110
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,659
is equal to I_0

111
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:44,039
moins U/R.

112
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,460
we finaly rewrite the equation

113
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,120
of the current which is equal to

114
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,089
i(t)

115
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:56,629
which is equal at the permanente solution
U/R, plus

116
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:57,900
the current expression

117
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,119
already determined.

118
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,300
Graphically represented

119
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,809
in the time domain, we get

120
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:09,629
the following curve

121
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:11,479
i(t)

122
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:13,610
as function of time

123
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,580
the curve start from

124
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,139
I_0

125
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,039
an unknown value, that we can choose to be negative

126
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,010
and will tend

127
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,069
to the asymptotic value

128
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,330
and reach

129
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:31,199
U/R, which is the permanente value

130
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,119
that we call B for the computations

131
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:39,520
that will follow.

132
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,629
The intersection

133
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:44,309
between the slope at the origin

134
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:46,289
and the asymptotic value

135
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,490
is at time

136
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,200
t=τ, which is equal

137
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,809
to L/R.

138
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,740
Now let's compute the slope

139
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:02,899
at the origin.

140
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:09,800
We repeat current equation
i(t)=U/R

141
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,800
that we have substituted by B,
I_0

142
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,700
minus B,times e^(-λt)

143
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,479
and its derivative

144
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,569
di/dt, that is equal to

145
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:32,129
-λ

146
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,300
I_0

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,719
minus B

148
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:39,379
times e^(-λt).

149
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:48,900
At t=0, this slope is equal to -λ(I_0 - B)

150
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,889
the right hand side is therefore

151
00:07:51,889 --> 00:08:00,000
given by the expression
-λ plus the absciss

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,599
Now, we can compute the
intersection

153
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,229
between this slope at the origin and the asymptotic value.

154
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,400
Meaning

155
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:16,379
that we should solve
the following equation : i' = B

156
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:21,340
B is therefore equal to

157
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,919
-λ(I_0 - B)

158
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,460
plus I_0.

159
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,000
Then, B - I_0

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,400
is equal to -λ(I_0 - B)*t.

161
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,430
The intersection occurs at time
t = 1/λ = τ.

162
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,430
L/R being the time constant.

163
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,920
Finally, we will calculate 

164
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,530
the value of i

165
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,520
for t = τ

166
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,740
which is the time constant

167
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,880
if we substitute in the current

168
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,320
equation, the time t by τ, we obtain

169
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,000
the following equation

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:16,900
i = B + (I_0 - B)e^(-1).

171
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,700
and this is equal to t/τ.

172
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,700
If I_0 is equal to 0, then the current
i is equal to

173
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,140
B times (1 - e^(-1))

174
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,700
or written under this form,
B(1 - 1/e) is equal

175
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,700
to 0.632 times the asymptotic value.

176
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,019
Now, let's compute

177
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,239
the case of an interlock, not under a continuous voltage supply, but

178
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,160
under a sinusoidal voltage supply.

179
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
For such interlock

180
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,200
we will consider initial conditions.
Only the permanent 

181
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,370
component changes  

182
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,290
and is given

183
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,980
by the complex calculation associated to the circuit.

184
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,210
We rewrite the binding equation

185
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,040
the supply voltage written under a
complex form is

186
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
U and is equal to

187
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,840
the effective value times e^(jα).

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,350
If we rewrite the binding equation

189
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,000
considering the supply voltage,
we have

190
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,250
 U = R * I

191
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,340
complex

192
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,600
+ jωLI.

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,330
It is also equal to

194
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:48,500
(R + jwL)*I

195
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,580
this is equal to Z*I.

196
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,450
expressed differently

197
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:01,450
The impedance Z, which is equal to R + JωL

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,200
Z times e^(jφ)

199
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,390
with

200
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,340
Z equal to

201
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:19,400
√(R^2 +ω^2*L^2)

202
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,470
and the angle phi, given by the arctan

203
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:28,880
of the reactance over the resistor.

204
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,690
And finally, the current is given by 

205
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,200
U/Z

206
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,100
can be expressed as

207
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,650
U*e^(jα)

208
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:47,690
divided by Z*e^(jφ)

209
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,000
which is equal to U/Z

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,200
times e^j(α - φ).

211
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,900
If we go back to time domain, we can rewrite this equation

212
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,130
which is the inhomogeneous 
solution of the current

213
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:22,000
I_p = √2*(U/Z)*sin(ωt + α - φ).

214
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,100
As I have already mentioned before
only the particular value changes

215
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,180
Therefore, the solution

216
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,500
of the second membre stays,
we can then write the equation of

217
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,430
the current

218
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,400
which is the particular solution

219
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,809
plus the permanent

220
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,810
solution

221
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,950
Again, we should calculate

222
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,239
the integration

223
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,690
constant A

224
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,170
and to do so, we should move to time

225
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,100
t=0, at the interlock, 

226
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,640
assuming i=0

227
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,290
We have A

228
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,249
equal to

229
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:09,100
-√2*(U/Z)*sin(α - φ)

230
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,369
And finally,

231
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,900
the solution is given by

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,670
the current which is equal to

233
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:22,800
This is the final expression,
we notice that

234
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,120
the moment

235
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,330
of the switching

236
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,980
with respect to the sinusoidal voltage
is very high

237
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,300
we will see that in the graph of
the following page.

238
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,280
The temporal graphical representation
of the solution, for the current, is

239
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,850
given by that figure.
We see 

240
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,310
a sinusoid 

241
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,530
this term 

242
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:52,530
which is added to an exponential function.

243
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,170
The sinusoid corresponds

244
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,230
to the sinusoidal power supply, and the exponential corresponds

245
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,270
to the interlock.

246
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,100
It is the transient state

247
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,100
with its time constant.

248
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,080
We notice the overcurrent

249
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,390
due to the interlock, here

250
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,230
that we also notice in case of
triggering, and that depend

251
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,990
on the switching moment α, here

252
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,160
and here

253
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,520
with respect to the supply voltage.

254
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,840
We will look in details at the effect
of the parameter α.

255
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,700
We see in this figure, in blue, the sinusoidal supply voltage, with an angle

256
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,180
α = 0.

257
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,300
Below, in red

258
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,249
is plotted the permanent 

259
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,989
current in the circuit
if the system was stabilized.

260
00:14:45,989 --> 00:14:49,919
we put it as reference for
the understanding of these explanations.

261
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,380
We note that the phase shift φ

262
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,590
the phase shift φ

263
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,340
which is introduced by the impedance 

264
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,150
RL, φ is a circuit constant.

265
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,100
If we switch the circuit

266
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,000
at the represented instant here,

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,820
at the axis t=0

268
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,260
we obtain, in orange, the previously
described curve, meaning that

269
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,420
no current

270
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,060
here, before the switching, then

271
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,990
an equation, which

272
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,250
have a sinusoidal term,
and an exponential term.

273
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,899
Once the transient state is finished,
the system is stabilized

274
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,270
we still only have the permanent

275
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,820
solution and therefore

276
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,320
the solution, here that we found,
is confused with the

277
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,989
permanent

278
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:38,640
solution

279
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,120
we note that there is no
current jump at the switching, here

280
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,660
because the circuit is composed of
an inductance in series.

281
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:54,080
We note, here again, the over-current due
to the exponential. 

282
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,000
If we switch, not at a=0, 
but at a bigger

283
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,299
value, therefore later

284
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,010
on the voltage sinusoid, here

285
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:10,900
we see, we note that the over-current
decrease slightly, which is normal because the term

286
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,240
α - φ, in absolute value, becomes 
smaller.

287
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,090
If we switch the circuit further

288
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,600
in time, here

289
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,839
we see that

290
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:25,230
the exponential term decrease again. 

291
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,400
An overcurrent

292
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,200
decreases.

293
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,120
If we switch even further, until 
we finally arrive at a particular

294
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,830
value, α = φ

295
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,670
in this case, the term sin(α - φ) = 0

296
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,630
we notice that

297
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,690
the term next to the exponential 

298
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,770
becomes equal to zero et therefore the transient
state

299
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,980
doesn't appear.

300
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,310
We see

301
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,300
in the curve, here

302
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,800
that the solution that we have found,
is confused with the particular solution, there is

303
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,700
no transient state.

304
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,110
This is obvious, because

305
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,300
we actually

306
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,839
switch at the passage of the current
by 0, and then, there is no current

307
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,270
jump.

308
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,110
This is called cross 
switching 0.

309
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:16,790
This approach is very important
in the power electronics

310
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,800
where the switchings occur at many

311
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,600
kilohertz, even dozens of kilohertz, because they

312
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,279
allow to

313
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:26,599
handle the components, avoiding
the overload, either of the current,

314
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,970
or the voltage.

315
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:31,880
If we switch even further, with respect
to the sinusoid, the transient

316
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,710
always reappears, but this time

317
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,920
in negative.

318
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,100
And, again a little bit latter

319
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,710
the overload 

320
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,740
here, is more important.

321
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,360
In conclusion, we see that a term
corresponds to the sinusoidal power supply

322
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,080
of the circuit, it is the
permanent solution

323
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,910
A second term corresponds to
the switching, it is the exponential

324
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,420
part of the solution.
The general solution corresponds to the cumulation of

325
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,340
these two effects.

326
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,169
Moreover, we have seen the importance of the switching
instant with respect to

327
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,640
the sinusoidal voltage, that could, more or less,
stress out the electronic 

328
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,240
components, because of

329
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,750
an overload.
