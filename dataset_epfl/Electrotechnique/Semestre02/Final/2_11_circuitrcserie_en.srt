00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,330
Hello, during the first lesson, we have laid the theoretical bases of the

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,899
resolution of a problem in transient state

3
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:14,500
we will move to a concrete example with several components.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,189
We have seen how a resistor, capacitor or an inductance

5
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:23,789
behaved alone, subject to a voltage or a current jump.

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,580
In reality the elements

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,900
L and C can't exist alone, they are always combined with a parasite resistor

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,800
and even a resistor always has a parasite capacity  or inductance.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,820
We will see a method that deals with these combined elements.

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,120
The example that we will see, during this lesson, is a

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,090
circuit with a resistor in series with a capacitor.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,820
It's the classical and widespread charge or discharge of a

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,630
capacitor. In other words, stocking electrical energy

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,590
in a capacitor, or an accumulator or even a

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,530
supercapacitor.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,570
Let the following circuit, made of a resistor in series with a capacitor, that we will

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,580
switch on a constant voltage supply U.

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,300
We begin by writing down all the values in the circuit, which are

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,390
the voltage

20
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,690
at the terminals of the resistor U_r, the voltage

21
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,760
at the terminals of the capacitor

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,400
U_c

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,080
knowing that the loop is traveled by a current I

24
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,270
in this direction.
First a condition is placed,

25
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,990
at the time t = 0

26
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,380
there is a residual voltage in the capacitor U_c, that is equal to

27
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,670
U_0, it is the initial condition of the circuit.

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,450
We then write the characteristic equations of each element

29
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,659
which means that U_r

30
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,900
is equal to

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,210
R*I

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,259
and U_c is equal to

33
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,050
1/C

34
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,659
times the integrale to -infinity to t

35
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,889
of i(t)dt

36
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:19,889
that we can express by seperating the integral from -infinity to 0 and from 0 to t.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,059
Knowing that the part from -infinity to 0 is in reality, the initial condition of the capacitor, that we can write U_0.

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,439
So this is equal to U_0 plus 1/C, multiplied by the integral from 0 to t

39
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,200
of i(t)dt.

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,159
We can now write the binding equation, which means that, on the single loop

41
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:56,949
of the circuit, we apply Kirchoff's theorem, and we have therfore that u(t)

42
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:59,989
which is here

43
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:01,279
u(t)

44
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:05,320
is equal to U_r + U_c.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,369
And, this is equal to U

46
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:13,719
for t > 0, which means, after the interlock.

47
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,679
We can develop this,

48
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:17,269
in the form

49
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,059
U is equal to R*i plus

50
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:24,450
1/C multiplied by

51
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,909
the integral of i*dt.

52
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,249
We derive in this equation

53
00:03:33,249 --> 00:03:35,299
and we get that

54
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,889
0 is equal to R multiplied

55
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:42,129
by di/dt

56
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,909
+

57
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:47,299
1/C times i.

58
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,000
We see that this is a first order differential equation

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:58,089
whose solution is given by i(t) is equal to

60
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:01,800
A*e^(λt).

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,800
With A and λ being integration constants.

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,400
Once this general solution is found, we have to define the integration constants.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,199
We rewrite the equation

64
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,859
which is the general solution, i(t)

65
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,700
is equal to Ae^(λt)

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,749
and its derivative

67
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,690
that stays an exponential

68
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,080
and that is equal to

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,000
λ, the internal derivative, multiplied by the equation

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,600
itself, the exponential itslef.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,809
A, λ, 
remaining to define.

72
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:51,820
We proceed the following way, we replace i and  (di/dt) in the binding equation

73
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,180
which gives us

74
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,779
R times (di/dt)

75
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:02,610
plus 1/C times i is equal to 0

76
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,069
and this becomes

77
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:07,849
R multiplied by λ times

78
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,379
Ae^(λt)

79
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:23,300
plus 1/C that multiplies i(t), it is Ae^(λt).
This is equal to 0.

80
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:30,300
By dividing by this term, we get

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,089
Rλ

82
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:36,080
is equal to -1

83
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,710
divided by C

84
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,700
or, express differently

85
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,889
λ is equal to (-1/RC)

86
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,660
and this is equal to 1/τ

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,180
the time constant.

88
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,520
To define the constant A

89
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,520
we proceed the following way, we solve the equation at the time t=0.

90
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,240
U_c is equal to U_0.

91
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,000
The initial condition for t=0.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,600
By rewriting the equation at the time t=0,
we get U_c

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,020
is equal to U

94
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:37,020
minus R_i, and this is equal to the interlock, at U minus 

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,460
R*A, exponential of

96
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,430
-t/RC

97
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,189
this term

98
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:51,939
is equal to 1 at the time t=0

99
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:53,569
so it comes that

100
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:54,879
U

101
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:57,409
minus R*A

102
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,169
is equal to U_0

103
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,280
or, the term A

104
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,389
that is equal to U

105
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,909
minus U_0 divided by R.

106
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,200
We have defined the two integration constants

107
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,229
and can therefore, now, write the equation for the current that is equal

108
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,889
to i which is equal to

109
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,069
A, which means U-U_0

110
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,080
divided by R

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,710
multiplied by the exponential of

112
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,700
-t/λ, which means -t/RC.
We will notice that the permenant solution

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,100
is equal to 0

114
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:43,119
simply because the current in the capacitor in DC is equal to 0.

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,129
i is equal to U

116
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,600
minus U_0, divided by R, multiplied by

117
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,830
e^(-t/RC).

118
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,210
We see that, for

119
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,080
t=τ

120
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,069
well, there is a a current depreciation
in a ratio

121
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,710
1/e

122
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,679
Why? Because i

123
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,909
at the time t, is equal to τ

124
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,409
this is equal

125
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,990
to (U-U_0)/R

126
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,270
multiplied by

127
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,200
e^(-1).

128
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,139
This current equation is pictured

129
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,710
in the time domain

130
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:34,150
by this slope here

131
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,650
a zero  current before

132
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,460
the interlock

133
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,330
and a current that does an instant

134
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,910
jump

135
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,330
like this

136
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,800
this is i_c(t).

137
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,160
We can calculate the tangent at
 the origine

138
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,500
and calculate what is its its intersection with the stabilized value

139
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,100
which means, in our case, the axis t.

140
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,610
This intersection is done at the time t=τ

141
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,120
indeed, we can write that the derivative

142
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,140
of the current at the time t=0

143
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,920
di/dt

144
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,840
is equal to (U-U_0)/R

145
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,300
that multiplies (1/-RC)

146
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,540
multiplied by e^(-t/τ).

147
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,770
At t = 0,

148
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,970
What do we have?

149
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,620
We have that the derivative, di/dt

150
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:44,000
is equal to -(U - U_0)/R^2*C

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,010
The equation of this tangent

152
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,310
is given by

153
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,890
i'

154
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,949
which is equal to U

155
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:58,720
minus

156
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,570
U_0 divide by R

157
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,830
it's the value

158
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,890
at the time t=0

159
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:09,450
minus the slope, time t.

160
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,680
Let's calculate, now, the evolution

161
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,730
of the voltage on the terminals of the capacitor.

162
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,529
We have the equation at the terminals 
of the capacitor that is given

163
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,390
U_C that is equal

164
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,350
to the initial condition

165
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,720
U_0

166
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,879
plus 1/C

167
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,030
multiplied by the integral from 0 to t

168
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,930
of i*dt.

169
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,370
By replacing the value of i, by the found solution

170
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,260
we get the following equation, U

171
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,040
minus U_0

172
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,220
divided by R

173
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,630
multiplied by the integral from 0 to t

174
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:56,720
of e^(-t/RC)*dt

175
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,399
By solving this

176
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,450
we get U_0

177
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,890
plus

178
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,490
U - U_0

179
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,450
divide by RC.

180
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,000
We calculate its antiderivative

181
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,480
that is the same value with
the internal derivative

182
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,570
taken from 0 to t.

183
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,740
And this

184
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:29,700
all calculations done, gives us, U_0 minus

185
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,290
plus U minus U_0

186
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,900
that multiplies

187
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,420
e^(-t/τ)

188
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,410
which means that RC, minus 1.

189
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,160
Written in another way, which gives us

190
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,920
U_0

191
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,140
plus U minus

192
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,210
U_0

193
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,680
that multiplies

194
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,080
1 minus e^(-t/RC).

195
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,550
If we picture this slope in the time domain

196
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,760
we get the following thing

197
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,200
U_C(t), as function of time

198
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,620
we start with an initial value

199
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,800
U_0

200
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,670
no matter what happened before,
 the moment of the interlock

201
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:21,660
the value of the capacitor is at U_0, and this curve

202
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,770
this exponantial, has this appearance.

203
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,400
A jump that is equal to an asymptotic value

204
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,000
U-U_0, and a tangent

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,580
that cuts the asymptotic value

206
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,800
at the time t=τ

207
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,000
is equal to RC.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,200
That's it, we have followed all the steps
to calculate the evolution of the current I_c(t)

209
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
and the voltage U_c(t)  for a RC circuit in series.

210
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,000
We have seen the noticeable elements as the slope,

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,800
the asymptotic values and particular ponts.

212
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,180
We note that we didn't calculate the voltage
drop at the terminals of the resistor

213
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,650
because it is very easy to calculate, it is simply R multiplied

214
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,900
by the current I that we have calculated.
