00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:08,019
Hello, during the last lecture
we have treated  the most complete

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:11,059
case of an RLC circuit in series.

3
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,859
We have defined the equations that
would allow us to find the solutions

4
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,419
for current expression.

5
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:21,409
According to the discriminant sign, the solutions
of the characteristic equation,

6
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,900
of the 2nd degree

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,390
are three different solutions 

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,880
During this lecture, we will
develop these three solutions

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,379
We will start with a recall of
the essentiel results that we got

10
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:34,630
at the previous lecture

11
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,030
and then, we will develop the
three solutions for the current

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,020
expression 

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,540
that are solutions, called, ''Over-damped''

14
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,990
"damped oscillatory" and "critical damping".

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,240
The current expressions that we 
have

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,430
obtained 

17
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,600
were under the form

18
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,900
i(t) is equal to a constant

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,270
times a sum of exponentials.

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,650
Where λ_1 and λ_2 are

21
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,500
the solutions

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,990
of the characteristic of 
2nd degree

23
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:15,040
that we can write, for 
simplifications

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,000
-R/2L ± ω.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,140
The expression of λ_1 and λ_2

26
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,000
being a sum of two terms that
will be here, in the exponential.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,700
And knowing that the exponential of a
sum is the product of the exponential,

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,870
we can rewrite the equation

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,320
of the current, in the following way

30
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,450
i(t) equal to

31
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,290
the constant times the exponential

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,610
of (-R/2L) * t

33
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,870
times

34
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:54,440
the sum of the two exponentials.

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,260
We recall again that the initial 
conditions at time t = 0 were

36
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,069
the current at time t = 0

37
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:03,450
is equal to 0

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,260
and the voltage

39
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,279
at the capacitor's terminals, at time t = 0,

40
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:13,389
is equal to 0, and the capacitor is
initially empty.

41
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:17,459
For t=0, we had

42
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,500
U = L * (di/dt).

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,359
If we consider the first case where the
discriminant

44
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:27,689
is bigger than 0

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,349
we get two real solutions

46
00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:31,900
And in that case, the current

47
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:32,989
equation

48
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:36,059
can be written, slightly modified,
as

49
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,819
i(t)

50
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,069
which is equal 

51
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:40,449
to a constant

52
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:41,729
times

53
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,809
a first exponential

54
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:47,049
times the sum of the 
exponentials

55
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,300
e^ωt - e^(-ωt)

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,199
divided by two,

57
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,289
and we recognize 

58
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:57,630
this expression being the expression

59
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,599
of a hyperbolic

60
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,119
sine.

61
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,669
We can therefore write

62
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,039
this equation in a light

63
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,439
way

64
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,029
and we have that A'

65
00:03:08,029 --> 00:03:13,300
multiplied by e^((-R/2L) * t)

66
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,449
multiplied by hyperbolic sine of ωt.

67
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,939
The initial condition that we have described 
before

68
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,500
and that gave us the following equation: 

69
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,100
U = L*(di/dt)

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,069
allows us to rewrite 

71
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,579
with the derivative of the current,
the following expression 

72
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,959
knowing

73
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,459
 that the current expression is composed
of a product

74
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,239
of two functions,
a first function f

75
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,349
and a second fonction g

76
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,359
and knowing that

77
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:54,849
the derivative

78
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,200
of a product function

79
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,160
is equal to the sum

80
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:05,100
f ' * g + f * g'

81
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,509
we get

82
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,849
an expression

83
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,319
a little bit

84
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,969
heavier, but that

85
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:13,719
is written as: L*A_1'

86
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,840
times

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,120
the derivative of the function f, it is 
the function itself 

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,590
times the intern derivative

89
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,469
minus R

90
00:04:27,469 --> 00:04:28,949
divided by 2L

91
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:31,100
times the exponential 

92
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,319
-R/2L * t

93
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,240
times the function g

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,830
meaning, the hyperbolic sine

95
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,009
of ωt

96
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,729
plus the function f

97
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:49,599
exponential of -R/2L * t

98
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,180
times the

99
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,849
derivative of the function

100
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:59,500
hyperbolic sine that
is a hyperbolic cosine

101
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,819
of ωt

102
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:03,830
times the intern derivative 

103
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,490
if we apply this condition at
time t = 0

104
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,520
this term

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,960
turns 1

106
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,120
this term becomes 1 as well

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,449
this one

108
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,080
0

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,939
and this one 1

110
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:22,379
We therefore get a relatively 

111
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,689
simple expression

112
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,350
that allows us to say that

113
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:34,700
A_1' = U/ωL.

114
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,689
We can finally write that
the current expression

115
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:39,680
as function of time

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,229
being

117
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:44,039
the product

118
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,169
of a constant, the constant that we
just computed 

119
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,650
U/ωL, times an exponential 

120
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,400
of exponent -R/2L * t

121
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,900
times the hyperbolic
sine of ωt.

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,569
It is then, the product

123
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,309
of two functions.

124
00:06:06,309 --> 00:06:08,449
If i represent them separately 

125
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:10,259
in a graphic,

126
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,089
we first have

127
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,020
a decreasing 

128
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,740
exponential

129
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,200
two time constant

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,100
2L/R

131
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,610
therefore, something as a

132
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,430
decreasing exponential 

133
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,240
times a hyperbolic sine of ωt

134
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,740
with that appearance.

135
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,629
The hyperbolic sine as function of time

136
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:41,300
can be complex in terms of
mathematics, we can verify that

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,460
the solution is still bounded when

138
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,949
t tends to infinity.

139
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,710
And the product of the two

140
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,300
gives the function of the current.
Thus, if we have

141
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,800
an RLC circuit with R, L and C
 such as the discriminant under

142
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
square root 

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,960
of the solution of 

144
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,029
the equation of second degree
is bigger than 0

145
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,560
we then obtain a temporal
evolution of the current, which is the product 

146
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,149
of these two functions

147
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,729
that we will see in the video that will follow.

148
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:13,789
We see first
an increase of the current, and then

149
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,539
a decrease.

150
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,800
In the case where the discriminate
is smaller than 0

151
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,599
we get two imaginary 

152
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,819
solutions.

153
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,330
If we write 

154
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,610
the following expression

155
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,400
ω = j*ω'

156
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,499
we can write the equation

157
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:39,659
of the current which is transformed as follows.

158
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,439
i(t) is equal

159
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:48,100
to a second constant A_1''

160
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,089
multiplied by the exponential of -R/2L

161
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:55,059
times t

162
00:07:55,059 --> 00:08:00,700
multiplied by the sum of 
the two exponentials  

163
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,309
divided by 2j

164
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:05,639
where we recognize 

165
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,789
here, the expression 

166
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,899
of a sine 

167
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,860
of ω't.

168
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,600
Thus, we can write this equation

169
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,599
in a lighter manner,
such as A_1''

170
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:25,500
multiplied by the exponential of -R/2L* t

171
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,529
multiplied by a sinus

172
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,580
ω't.

173
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,030
Once again, at time t=0

174
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,779
the same initial conditions

175
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,820
as the previous case

176
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,990
allow us 

177
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,890
to obtain the integration contant 

178
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,460
such as A_1'' is equal to U

179
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,730
divided by ω'L.

180
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,280
Therefore, once again, we can write
the temporal expression of

181
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,300
the current as

182
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,030
the product of the constant that
we have just determined 

183
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,070
ω'L

184
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,500
multiplied by an exponential 
function where the exponent is equal to

185
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,870
-R/2L * t

186
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,380
and, this time, multiplied
by a sinusoidal function

187
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,800
sin(ω't).

188
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,600
If we represent these two functions

189
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,510
separately 

190
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,340
in a temporal graphic

191
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,850
we have

192
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,220
first of all

193
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,380
a sinusoid 

194
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,890
of a certain amplitude

195
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,310
multiplied by

196
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,270
an exponential decreasing function,

197
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,200
where this is of type

198
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,160
sinusoidal 

199
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,870
this

200
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,730
of type exponential

201
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,590
decreasing exponent 

202
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,830
with its time constant equal to

203
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,370
2L/R

204
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,980
and, again, if we deal

205
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,869
with this RLC circuit where R,L and C
are defined such as

206
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:06,120
the discriminant under the square root of the solution of
the 2nd degree equation is smaller than 0

207
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,920
then, the current

208
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,870
in the circuit

209
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,249
evolves in the following way, as

210
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:14,000
shown in the video.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,060
We have a sinus

212
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,780
that the amplitude decreases

213
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,590
exponentially. 

214
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,070
The last case, is
the case where

215
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,480
the discriminant under the square root is
equal to 0.

216
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,010
In that case, we have only one
real solution for ω.

217
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,340
In this critical case, the solution is obtained from

218
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,300
either solution.

219
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,940
We will consider the 1st one that we found.

220
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,080
i(t) is equal to U over

221
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,770
ωL, multiplied by the exponential 

222
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,550
multiplied by the hyperbolic

223
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,780
sine

224
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,430
of ωt.

225
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,650
And when moving

226
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,940
to the limit, meaning

227
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,800
ω tends to 0, we can substitute 

228
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,850
the hyperbolic 

229
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,860
sine

230
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,120
function

231
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,860
with the first term of the 
taylor series

232
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,100
that we won't demonstrate here, but

233
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,700
for

234
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
ωt

235
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,550
that tends to zero

236
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,750
we have that the hyperbolic sine of ωt
tends to

237
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,480
ωt.

238
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,830
The solution of critical dumping 
could be written under the form

239
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,940
i(t) which is equal to

240
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,160
the constant

241
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,450
U/ωL

242
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,800
multiplied by the exponential of -R/2L * t

243
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,330
multiplied by

244
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,350
ωt.

245
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,260
And this, we can simplify it

246
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,610
into U/L multiplied by the exponential 

247
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,980
of -R/2L * t

248
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,730
times t.

249
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,779
They are

250
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,820
two temporal functions

251
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,130
where one is a decreasing exponential

252
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,180
again

253
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,520
with a time constant equal to 2L/R

254
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,400
multiplied by

255
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,600
(this is the exponential
with a negative exponent)

256
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,200
multiplied by a function t

257
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,100
which is a simple straight. 

258
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,240
Once again, if we deal with an RLC circuit in series
where 

259
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,460
R,L and C are defined such as
the discriminant 

260
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,060
under the square root of the solution of
the 2nd degree equation is equal to 0, then

261
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,760
we get the following current evolution.

262
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,050
It looks similar

263
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,560
to the first solution, but of
different nature.

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,560
Here we are, we have treated the cases RC and RL, where the 

265
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,430
differential equation of 1st order,
leads to exponential solutions.

266
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,350
We have treated the RLC case, the most complete,
that gives de differential

267
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,369
equations

268
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:07,420
of 2nd order, and therefore
three different solutions.

269
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,070
For the most complex circuit, you should know that it is the combinations 

270
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,310
of these cases, and are therefore
treated in the same way.
