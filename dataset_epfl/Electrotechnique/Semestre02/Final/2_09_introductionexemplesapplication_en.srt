00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,800
Hello, during the first lesson, we have laid
the theoretical bases of 

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,049
the behavior of three linear elements
R,L and C with 

3
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,759
abrupt state fluctuations, that is to say
transient states.

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,100
During this lesson, we will see a few examples
of applications  that will 

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,640
give you an idea of the importance of
transient states.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,550
We will see a few examples of applications

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,179
while keeping in mind that those are
basic fundamentals that are relatively

8
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:32,200
simplified for the clearness of the
explanations.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,150
I hope that these examples will help you and
will arouse your curiosity.

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,300
Lets see a first application example.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,360
It is an engine spark plug.

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,250
We consider the following circuit that is
made of a matrix, the 

13
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,000
12V battery

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,030
of the vehicle

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,580
an inductance

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,660
that we call ignition coil, and

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,290
a switch, that allows a current to go through

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,480
the inductance, or to shut it off.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,770
We connect on the terminals

20
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:07,550
of the inductance a spark plug.

21
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,230
This spark plug, with 

22
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,880
its electrode, here.

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,200
This spark plug can be represented, here,
by this electronic symbol.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,840
During the current

25
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,710
cut in the inductance, we saw during the
previous lessons, that an abrupt current cut

26
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,110
in an inductance could cause

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,870
an infinite voltage.

28
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,800
Here, the voltage will not be infinite, but

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,140
it will reach the breakdown voltage of
the medium in which

30
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,000
the spark plug is.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,880
and cause a spark.
All the energy stored

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,300
in the inductance will be found, here

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,490
on the terminals

34
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,580
of the electrodes

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,290
of the spark plug.

36
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,090
This spark will occur on the terminals of the spark plug.

37
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,470
Lets considerate an second application case,
it is the spot

38
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,250
welding.

39
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:04,790
This process is used a lot in the
industry and consists

40
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,550
in assambling metal sheets together.

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,899
The principle is relatively simple, we start with

42
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,089
a charged

43
00:02:13,089 --> 00:02:14,979
capacitor

44
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:17,739
that will be in this cabinet, and

45
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:19,449
through

46
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:21,359
two electrodes

47
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,669
we will short-cut

48
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,329
the capacitor

49
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,419
through the plates.

50
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,279
We saw that short-circuiting a capacitor
is forbidden, and

51
00:02:32,279 --> 00:02:34,490
causes high or almost infinite currents

52
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,699
here the electric resistance is not
perfectly at zero, we will

53
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:42,209
get a current that is extremely

54
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:43,069
high

55
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:47,619
of the order of a few kilo-amps, and

56
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:48,859
by Joule effect

57
00:02:48,859 --> 00:02:52,459
so by the heating of the material, we will

58
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:53,630
merge

59
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,159
the material, and therefore realise

60
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,200
this welding.

61
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,500
We see, here, an example of achievement

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,579
with weldings of

63
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,279
automotive sheet

64
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,789
on those spots.

65
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:14,810
Another application example is SMPS
(witching-mode power supply).

66
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:17,179
Here, the goal is to avoid using

67
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:19,209
a transformer like the one we use for

68
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,079
electrical networks

69
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,669
by replacing it by a chopper circuit.

70
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,130
This means that the execution

71
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,169
will only be in transient state

72
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,519
and we will see that we will have a high weight

73
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,959
gain

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,979
and an increase of the efficiency.

75
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:39,009
We see on this circuit

76
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,469
that as function of the voltage , which is
constant, given by the 

77
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:45,300
voltage supply, here

78
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,059
is a sequence

79
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:49,179
of power cuts and interlocks

80
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,230
of the circuit

81
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,299
so we get, at the output

82
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:56,249
of our circuit, a voltage than can be
lowered down

83
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,039
to a certain level

84
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,309
or, eventually, lowered to a different

85
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,429
 level

86
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:05,229
as function of the time ratio

87
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:06,609
of the interlocks 

88
00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,109
and the triggering of the circuit.

89
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,469
This kind of SMPS, also called

90
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:17,689
a switcher

91
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:18,760
is very well known

92
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,500
in demotic, for example

93
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,379
we all know

94
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,669
lightbulb

95
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:25,620
dimmers

96
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,300
that allows to reduce the brightness of
a lightbulb.

97
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,740
Another example, the switched-mode
power supply, but this time

98
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,770
used as a voltage step-up.

99
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,189
As previously

100
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,189
we see

101
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:39,950
that starting at certain continuous voltage

102
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,999
which is the voltage supply of the circuit

103
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:47,569
and a sequence of interlocks and triggering

104
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,560
of the circuit on its power supply

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,499
we can have an output voltage

106
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:59,249
higher than the power supply.

107
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:03,960
An example of the use of an step-up SMPS

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,479
is the voltage regulator

109
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,259
for example the xenon headlamps

110
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,789
of a car that we can picture here

111
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:13,939
by this lightbulb

112
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,120
with gas 

113
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,509
in this enclosure

114
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:20,050
This gas is not

115
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,260
an electric conductor when it is stable

116
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,639
we must create an overvoltage to initiate an electrical arc

117
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,620
and therefore

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,520
causes the flow of the current into the lightbulb, and

119
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,229
by this same event

120
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:38,969
the lightning of the lightbulb.

121
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:42,009
This is now one last application example. It is

122
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,389
the energy distribution

123
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:46,630
on very long distances.
Here we talk about

124
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,300
inter-continent distances.

125
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,639
Increasingly,

126
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,759
the diversity of the energy supply

127
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:53,979
means that

128
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,289
electrical power plants are scattered

129
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:58,800
all throughout

130
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:01,600
Europe, Asia

131
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,599
an even Africa

132
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:07,429
and those distances are extremely long,
we are talking here of several thousands of 

133
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:10,580
kilometers.

134
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,969
If we look at

135
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:14,070
the electrical 

136
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,389
distribution line

137
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,520
we can see that

138
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,320
between

139
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,580
the source

140
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,069
which is the place where the

141
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:23,919
electricity is produced, and

142
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,249
the consumer, here

143
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:31,960
there is an electrical line that is characterized by

144
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,180
the following circuit.

145
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,309
A first model

146
00:06:38,309 --> 00:06:40,559
of a line in alternative state,

147
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:43,800
we can see that this example has

148
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,749
an inductance, here

149
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:49,189
that will be as high as the distance is long

150
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:53,200
and therefore the voltage drops of the
inductance terminals  will also

151
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,800
be high.

152
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,479
Capacitors

153
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,939
connected in parrallel, that

154
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,389
represent

155
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:00,580
the current leaks

156
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,919
in the electrical line.

157
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,710
Those capacitors

158
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,009
are as big as the line is long too,

159
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:09,319
and therefore

160
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,279
the impedance

161
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,049
the impedance, seen by the line of this
constructor, will be

162
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:15,650
as small 

163
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,499
as the current leaks are big (in this example).

164
00:07:19,499 --> 00:07:20,719
hence the interest

165
00:07:20,719 --> 00:07:22,080
to moove to

166
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,610
a DC

167
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,000
state.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,559
We have, here, the sketch

169
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,560
where the example of the DC line

170
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,600
where the inductances and capacitors

171
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,180
have disappeared because the frequency is zero.

172
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,839
So, there is only this resistor left.

173
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,210
Just like the energy distribution on long
distances using the alternative state

174
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,610
we need to rise the voltage

175
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,080
to

176
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,629
lower the current

177
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,169
for a given power

178
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,199
and therefore, we will, here

179
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,460
create

180
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,129
a step-up voltage, that allows

181
00:07:56,129 --> 00:08:00,009
the energy transport

182
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,360
at a high voltage and then a voltage reducer

183
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,589
that allows

184
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:07,689
to reuse this

185
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,589
voltage, in a lower form

186
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,400
directly

187
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,149
by the consummer.

188
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,779
Finaly

189
00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:18,260
we will compare the size of different power supplies.

190
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,159
We see here that the classic power supply

191
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:24,300
made with an alternative

192
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,289
50 Hz  transformer

193
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:33,210
and here a switched-mode power supply,
we see that this one is much more compact.

194
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,120
This seconde example

195
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,300
shows very well the difference

196
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,400
of two power-supplies

197
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,610
one, with

198
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,000
a transformer, and the other one with
a switch-mode

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,400
for a same given power, we can see that
the SMPS (switched-mode power supply) is much

200
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,440
more compact.

201
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,900
Those few examples show the diversity
and the importance of

202
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,700
these transient states in many devices.

203
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,670
During the following lessons, we will study
the details and learn

204
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,090
how to solve such transient states.
