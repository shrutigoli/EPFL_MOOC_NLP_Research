00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:16,501
Hello, my name is Yves Perriard,

2
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:19,449
I am a professor at the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology (EPFL)

3
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,319
where I give lectures in various subjects,
including electrotechnics.

4
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:25,255
Hello, my name is Paolo Germano,

5
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:29,020
and I teach the electrotechnics course
with professor Perriard.

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,061
We will both be your teachers for this course,

7
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,021
but first,

8
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:35,835
we would like to explain to you
what electrotechnic is.

9
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:39,671
Electrotechnics is the body of basis knowledge
and methods

10
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:42,694
needed to develop electrical applications.

11
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:44,830
Whether it is in the field of transports,

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,346
motors, sensors, haptic systems

13
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:49,907
or even energy transmission by induction,

14
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:52,407
electrotechnics are present everywhere.

15
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:55,813
This course is not only addressed to
our school's students,

16
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:59,057
but also to anyone who is interested by electricity

17
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:02,286
and would like to acquire sane and solid
basic notions.

18
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:04,020
The various lessons aim at

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,728
getting to know precepts of electricity

20
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:09,000
and giving you a better comprehension

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,979
of linear elements that constitute
an electrical circuit.

22
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,536
As you will have understood by now,

23
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,330
the course is meant as an approach
of the essentials in electricity.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,380
Through the electrotechnics I course,
we will first cover

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,490
the basics of electrical circuits
composed of linear elements

26
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,063
in a DC steady state	

27
00:01:25,063 --> 00:01:27,580
and a series of transformation methods.

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,540
Secondly, we will introduce the AC steady state.

29
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,591
The electrotechnics I course

30
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,191
will be followed up with the
electrotechnics II.

31
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:40,035
This last one handles the AC steady state,
the different types of power,

32
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,811
as well as alternative three-phase systems

33
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,211
and their load.

34
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:46,977
We will finally cover transient state,

35
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:49,468
founding principles of switch-mode power supplies.

36
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,634
Different concrete examples will be used,

37
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:53,768
which will help you link

38
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:57,811
the theory to everyday life applications.

39
00:01:57,811 --> 00:01:58,882
At the end of this course,

40
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:02,563
you will know the main elements that
compose an electrical circuit

41
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:05,771
and will be able to analyse and resolve
linear circuits

42
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:09,147
in DC, AC steady state or transient state.

43
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:13,825
Each of the fourteen weeks of this course
will be comprised of several lesson.

44
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:17,802
To test your knowledge,
some quizzes will be inserted,

45
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,463
in principle in each module.

46
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:21,205
This will help you make sure

47
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:23,774
that you have assimilated the
lesson's key points

48
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:26,572
and to check your progression.

49
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,917
At the end of each lesson,

50
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:30,296
we will give you a more complicated exercise

51
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,673
that you will have to solve
for the following week.

52
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:35,807
This exercise will be the same at that
given to the EPFL students

53
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:37,623
that follow the course in the classroom.

54
00:02:37,623 --> 00:02:38,572
We hope

55
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:42,092
that you will have a lot of pleasure
following our electrotechnics course,

56
00:02:42,092 --> 00:02:44,374
and we invite you to our MOOC.
