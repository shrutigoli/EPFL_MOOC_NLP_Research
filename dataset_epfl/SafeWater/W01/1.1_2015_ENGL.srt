00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,150
Hello, my name is Rich Johnston, 
and I started this course

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,523
when I was working 
in the Sandec Department at the Eawag.

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:13,522
Now I work for the 
World Health Organization

4
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:18,672
in the WHO Unisef Joint Monitoring Programme 
for Water Supply and Sanitation.

5
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:22,510
And I am Sara Marks, 
research scientist at Eawag

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,112
and a group leader of the Water Supply 
and Treatment group.

7
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:28,095
My team works in countries in Africa and Asia

8
00:00:28,095 --> 00:00:30,144
to improve drinking water quality

9
00:00:30,144 --> 00:00:33,327
through developing 
innovative treatment solutions.

10
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:36,457
And one way that people can improve 
drinking water quality themselves

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,000
is to treat it at the household level.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,861
And that's the topic of this course,

13
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,382
an Introduction to Household 
Water Treatment and Safe Storage.

14
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:47,320
(Sara) This course is the first 
and a serious e-learning initiative

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,930
jointly developed by Sandec and EPFL,

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,021
which will cover the full range 
of Sandec research activities,

17
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:58,279
Household Water Treatment, 
Sanitation Planning

18
00:00:58,279 --> 00:01:01,279
Solid Waste Management 
and Faecal Sludge Management.

19
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:02,997
This course will run for five weeks.

20
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:04,257
At the beginning of each week

21
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:06,637
We'll release approximately 
one hour of video lectures

22
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:09,011
divided into short modules.

23
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:11,720
(Rich) The first week, of course, 
is an Introduction.

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,791
We'll start by exploring 
why it could be useful

25
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:16,401
to treat drinking water 
at the household level.

26
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,361
We'll talk about 
the global burden of disease,

27
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:22,217
discuss how drinking water 
can be contaminated

28
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:24,645
and get a brief introduction 
to the technologies

29
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:27,482
used in household water treatment.

30
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:31,150
In the second and third week 
we'll go through these technologies

31
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,399
in more detail

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,253
with examples of actual applications 
from around the world.

33
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:38,659
But the course 
is not only about technologies.

34
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,421
We'll also look 
at Implementation Strategies,

35
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:44,452
which are successful or not,

36
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:46,178
we'll consider 
how household water treatment

37
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:49,403
can be targeted 
to particular vulnerable groups,

38
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:52,763
such as in emergencies 
or through schools.

39
00:01:52,763 --> 00:01:57,336
And in the final week we'll look 
at monitoring and evaluation

40
00:01:57,336 --> 00:02:00,650
both of the technologies 
and their implementation in the field.

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,290
You can find all relevant information 
about the course on the course website.

42
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,697
There is also an online discussion forum,

43
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:11,130
where you can add your comments 
about the course and the lectures,

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,441
form study groups,

45
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:16,272
even share your experiences 
about household water treatment.

46
00:02:16,272 --> 00:02:17,272
On Sandec Youtube webpage

47
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:19,739
you'll also find the lectures 
for each course

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,478
and our WASH in 
Developing Countries online series.

49
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,492
We're looking forward to the course

50
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,402
and hearing your contributions 
on the online forum.

51
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:30,242
So let's get started now

52
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:33,125
with the module about the diseases 
caused by unsafe water.
