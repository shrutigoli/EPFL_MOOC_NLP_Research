2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,088
In this module, we'll talk about diseases
caused by unsafe water,

3
00:00:08,088 --> 00:00:11,793
sanitation, and hygiene, and how they can
be classified, as well

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:15,238
as the burden of disease due to unsafe
water, sanitation, and

5
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:19,410
hygiene, both in terms of deaths or
mortality and disease or morbidity.

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,800
They say that three things in life are
certain, birth, taxes

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,610
and death, and somehow some people have
managed to avoid taxes.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,140
But deaths are inevitable.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,200
There are about 55 million people who die
every year.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,580
But there are even more people who have
babies every

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,710
year, about a 135 million new babies are
born each year.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,770
So that means that overall there's about a
1.1% increase in the global

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,400
population each year and the population
will

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,740
double every 60 years at current rates.

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,260
One useful way to classify diseases was
proposed by

16
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,570
the authors of the 1972 classic book
"Drawers of Water".

17
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:04,360
according to environmental transmission
pathways.

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,680
This so called Bradley Classification
includes four

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,400
types, water-borne, water-washed,
water-based, and water-related diseases.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,060
Now, some of those 55 million deaths per
year are

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,380
caused, at least in part, by unsafe water,
sanitation, and hygiene.

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:24,870
And we can think about different ways to
classify those diseases.

23
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,230
First we can talk about the water-borne
diseases, which are diseases

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,370
caused by actually drinking, ingesting
water that has some pathogens in it.

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,580
These include the diarrheal diseases
caused by

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,770
different pathogens: rotavirus, cholera,
shigella or cryptosporidium.

27
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,490
but also Hepatitis A and E, and even Polio
can be transmitted through drinking water.

28
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:49,310
For any of these water-borne diseases, an
intervention to

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,380
reduce the disease then, could involve
improving the water quality.

30
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,960
Next we have the water-washed diseases,

31
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,830
which are caused by poor hygiene due to

32
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,310
lack of water, rather than by direct
ingestion.

33
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:05,370
Most water-borne diseases are also water
washed, because they

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,490
can be transmitted through hands and
contact with other surfaces.

35
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,260
Trachoma is the leading cause of
preventable

36
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,280
blindness globally, and is transmitted by
flies,

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,110
which land on people's faces.

38
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,210
And acute respiratory infections are also
transmitted through

39
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,525
contact with pathogens on hands and other
surfaces.

40
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:28,700
Water-washed diseases can be reduced by
increasing the

41
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,345
amount of water that's available to
improve hygiene.

42
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:35,810
Water-based diseases are those caused by
parasites

43
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,650
which live part of their lifecycle in
water.

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,450
The most serious of these is
schistosomiasis or bilharzia

45
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,110
which affects 160 million people globally,
mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

46
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,930
Another serious water based disease is
guinea worm or

47
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,710
dracunculiasis, which is a horrible
disease, which used to

48
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,160
affect many people, 3.5 million people in
1986, but

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,160
cases are now down to only 542 in 2012.

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,560
And those are confined to about four
countries.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,800
Mainly in South Sudan.

52
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,390
For water-based diseases, control
mechanisms involved targeting the aquatic

53
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,610
organism host and protecting surface water
bodies from contamination.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,530
Finally, there are water related disease,
which are

55
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,340
caused by insects which breed in water,
especially mosquitoes.

56
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,100
The most important of these is malaria
which affects

57
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:38,090
about 250 million people each year,
causing about 589,000 deaths.

58
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,270
The great majority of those are in
sub-Saharan

59
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:42,960
Africa and affect children under the age
of five.

60
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,310
Another important mosquito disease is
Dengue fever which is growing

61
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,570
in numbers and can cause explosive
outbreaks especially in urban areas.

62
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,780
In both cases the mosquitoes breed in
certain types of

63
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,149
water and a control mechanism is to remove
their habitat.

64
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,180
So in summary,

65
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,240
there are many diseases which are caused,
at

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,770
least partially, by unsafe water,
sanitation and hygiene.

67
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:12,100
Water-borne diseases are those that are
caused

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,050
by directly drinking, or ingesting
contaminated water.

69
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,280
And those diseases can be controlled, at
least

70
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,460
partially, by treating the water at the
household.

71
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,810
Household water treatment though shouldn't
be expected to have an impact

72
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,260
on other diseases that are water washed,
water based, or water related.

73
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,240
Now let's take a little break.

74
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,985
You see on your screen five different
infectious diseases and I'd like you to

75
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,615
think for a minute about which of them
cause more or less deaths each year.

76
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,015
Arrange them in the order of numbers of

77
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:47,007
deaths per year and then click the next
slide.

78
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:54,038
[BLANK_AUDIO]

79
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:59,590
The most recent global mortality figures
were released by the WHO in 2013

80
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,568
and estimate deaths over the years 2000 to
2011.

81
00:05:04,568 --> 00:05:08,686
You can see that lower respiratory
infections such as pneumonia were

82
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:12,840
by far the largest cause of death among
these diseases in 2011.

83
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,680
Diarrheal disease caused about 1.9 million
deaths,

84
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,850
followed by tuberculosis, malaria, and
measles.

85
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,430
Now take a moment to click on the link

86
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,330
to the WHO website where these data are
available.

87
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:32,490
Download the Excel file called "Global
Summary"

88
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,050
Estimates, and look at the summary tab.

89
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,310
How have the numbers in this table changed
since 2000?

90
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,860
If you compare the numbers you will see
that measles, for

91
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:47,360
example, has declined tremendously to
about a quarter the level of 2000.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,330
Since diarrhea causes 1.9 million deaths
per year,

93
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,700
it is the most important of the

94
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:59,300
water sanitation and hygiene related
diseases.

95
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,220
It's also a water-borne disease, so water
quality is important in its transmission.

96
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,040
The burden disease from diarrhea is large.

97
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,820
It causes about 3.5% of
all deaths globally, and

98
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,957
if you look at children under age five,
the number rises to 9.3%.

99
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,730
Diarrheal disease is second only to acute

100
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,970
respiratory infections in terms of disease
burden.

101
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:27,178
There are important non-infectious
diseases; such as heart disease,

102
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:31,778
stroke and lung problems, which effect
many people also.

103
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:35,390
Now the 2011 figures have just been
released by

104
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,863
WHO and are not yet desegregated by risk
cause.

105
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,437
So we can't say how many of those 1.9

106
00:06:41,437 --> 00:06:45,717
million deaths are due to unsafe water
sanitation and hygiene.

107
00:06:45,717 --> 00:06:50,659
But in the previous round of estimates
from 2004, this analysis was made.

108
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:56,343
And WHO estimated that about 88% of the
then 2.2 million deaths

109
00:06:56,343 --> 00:07:02,134
per year were attributable to poor water,
sanitation and hygiene.

110
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:05,718
So it's clear then that poor water,
sanitation and hygiene have a

111
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:07,510
major impact on the global burden

112
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,470
of disease, especially through diarrheal
disease.

113
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:16,540
So far we've been talking about burden of
disease in terms of deaths or mortality.

114
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,080
But it's also important to consider
sicknesses which

115
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,270
can greatly reduce the quality of life, or
morbidity.

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,710
We can do this through a metric

117
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,085
that's called disability adjusted life
years, or DALYs.

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,200
What DALYs do is combine two aspects,
first, the years

119
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,240
of life lost in comparison to a standard
life expectancy

120
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,403
and second the years lost to disability
which are number of years you live

121
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:48,360
with a disability times a weight for how
serious that disability is.

122
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,220
Well, lets consider this with some
examples.

123
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,090
First consider a person who has a normal
life

124
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,799
expectancy of 80 years and has no
particular disabilities

125
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,810
and this person lives a fully healthy life
for 80 years

126
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,130
and has zero years of life lost, or years
lost to disability.

127
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,050
So they have no DALYs.

128
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,340
Second, let's consider an example, where
someone

129
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,050
also lives, has a life expectancy of 80

130
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,240
and lives a very normal life to begin
with, but then

131
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,250
has some kind of sudden accident at age
70, and dies prematurely.

132
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,350
Then they have years of life lost.

133
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,730
How many?

134
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,780
10 years of life lost.

135
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,990
There's no disability here, so then the
number DALYs is10.

136
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,650
Okay.

137
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:48,350
This time, let's consider a person who has
a normal healthy life until age 50 when

138
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,320
they have some kind of accident which
leads

139
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,780
to loss of a foot, amputation of the foot.

140
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,090
Now the disability weight for a foot
amputation is 0.3.

141
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,080
So it goes up to there but then that

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,940
person lives to the expected life
expectancy of 80.

143
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,460
So here we have years of life lost to
disability.

144
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:12,990
How many?

145
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:21,560
30 years from age 50 times a weight of 0.3
for foot amputation.

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,040
There's a total of 9.

147
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,010
So that's nine DALYs.

148
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,350
Finally, a more complicated example, is a
person who lives

149
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,540
a normal life until age 36, when they
contract HIV/AIDS.

150
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,420
Full blown AIDS without any medicine,
without

151
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,614
antiretroviral therapy, has a weight of
0.5.

152
00:09:46,614 --> 00:09:52,004
But after four years that person then is
able to get medication and

153
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:57,231
have a much better quality of life with a
weight of 0.167.

154
00:09:57,231 --> 00:10:03,221
Then that person lives until age 70, dying
prematurely.

155
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:07,391
46, 36, then 40.

156
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:11,605
So here we have years lost to disability 

157
00:10:11,605 --> 00:10:16,511
and here we have years of life lost.

158
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:17,320
How many?

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,790
Ten years of life lost.

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,750
How many years lived with disability.

161
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,520
We have four at that high rate.

162
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,140
That's a total of two, plus 30 at a lower
rate.

163
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,970
That's five.

164
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,140
For a total of seven.

165
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,043
So then the DALYs, plus ten plus seven,
for 17.

166
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,110
So you can imagine the diarrheal disease
then,

167
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,990
which impacts, very young children in many
cases will

168
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,320
also have a high contribution to DALYs
because

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,090
of the large number of years of life lost.

170
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,300
Now that we have a metric for morbidity,
the DALYs

171
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,920
we can examine the overall burden of
disease posed

172
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,740
by diarrhea, and compare it to other
diseases globally.

173
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,680
Now, that 2013 WHO report about deaths,

174
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,520
globally, hasn't yet been analyzed to
develop DALY

175
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:22,010
estimates, so we have to look at an older
WHO report from 2008 shown up here.

176
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:27,520
Where they reported that diarrheal disease
caused over 52 million DALYs per year,

177
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,670
which again the distribution was very
similar to

178
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,180
the mortality numbers we've seen, with a
little bit

179
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,217
more than 3% of the global total, and

180
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:40,020
about 9% of the burden of disease for
children.

181
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,940
This report also listed, country-wise,
DALYs.

182
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,810
And you could see that India was by far
the, the

183
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,370
largest country in terms of DALYs, in
terms of disease burden,

184
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,880
followed by other large countries, China,
Nigeria,

185
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,680
Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of
Congo,

186
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,660
which all had more than 3 million DALYs.

187
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,600
In fact, in DRC the contribution of diarrheal 
disease to the

188
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,490
overall disease burden was more than 10%
of all DALYs.

189
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,990
So

190
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,720
far we've been talking about numbers
generated by the WHO, either their

191
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,780
2000 report on mortality or earlier
reports for morbidity or risk factors.

192
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,410
But there is another large, important and
recent data set out there.

193
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,470
It's called the Global Burden of Disease
2010 Study and it was done

194
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,370
by the Institute for Health Metrics and

195
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,280
Evaluation, or IHME, based in Seattle,
Washington.

196
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,930
The GBD 2010 Study was a massive
undertaking involving hundreds

197
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,120
of scientists from all around the world
including many WHO researchers.

198
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,810
However even though it uses a similar
approach

199
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,250
to the WHO models, WHO hasn't endorsed the
findings,

200
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,130
in part because of some methodological
differences

201
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,010
and in part because they weren't given
access to

202
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,540
the data and the findings to validate them
before publication.

203
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,280
Some of the main differences between the two
studies are

204
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:13,410
that first IHME calculated new disability
weights for various health conditions.

205
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,110
This was done through a participatory
online process, as

206
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,790
well as through field surveys in a number
of countries.

207
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,940
Second, while WHO considered hygiene,
water and sanitation risks

208
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,370
IHME found that the data available

209
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,100
for, hygiene practices, nationally
representative data

210
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,040
sets, were too weak, so they decided not
to include this risk factor.

211
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,480
And then finally, in the IHME model,
people accessing

212
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,570
a basic level of water and sanitation,
such as

213
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,170
improved sources of water like a bore hole
or

214
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,770
protected spring, or improved sanitation,
the basic pit latrine.

215
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,600
They were considered to suffer no burden

216
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,790
of disease due to their water and
sanitation.

217
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,350
This was not the approach followed in the
WHO models.

218
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,600
Nonetheless, this was a massive and
important undertaking,

219
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,870
and we can learn a lot through its
findings.

220
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,530
Let's take a look at them.

221
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,960
Let's take a look at the GBD 2010 data
from the IHME website.

222
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,040
You can find it just by searching for
IHME.

223
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,540
And

224
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,820
then let's go straight to their data
visualization.

225
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,900
[SOUND]

226
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,450
They have many different visualization
tools, we'll look at GDB Compare.

227
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,970
Now in GBD Compare this is what's called a
Tree Map and if you hover

228
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,140
over different diseases you can see the
percent

229
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,040
of their contribution to the burden of
disease.

230
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,130
Here let's put a focus on diarrheal
disease.

231
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,740
Now that box will always have a square
around it

232
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,800
and we can change between DALYs and
deaths.

233
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,390
We can look at global or specific
countries or regions.

234
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,610
We can change years.

235
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,000
We can see that if we look at under

236
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
five children, the contribution of
diarrheal disease is much larger.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,930
So you can you can find out a lot of
things from this kind of map.

238
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,370
Down below, we have different options for
secondary visualizations.

239
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,850
We could look at a time plot for instance

240
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:33,280
and see the number of deaths decreasing
over time.

241
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,937
Here is shown as rates or as numbers

242
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:46,932
decreasing from 1.7 million under five
deaths in 1990, to about 666,000 in 2010.

243
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,507
We can also look at a map and see

244
00:15:49,507 --> 00:15:55,800
which countries have greater or lesser
burdens of disease.

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,860
Here we can see that India, with 150,000
child deaths,

246
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,220
is by far the largest contributor to the disease.

247
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,590
But, if we looked at rates, then we

248
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:13,030
would see higher rates in
Sub-Saharan Africa

249
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:15,220
and the same if we look at proportion of
DALYs.

250
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,920
If we compare the GBD 2010 numbers to the
WHO estimates,

251
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,670
there is some similarities and some
differences.

252
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,310
IHME predicts 1.5 million diarrheal deaths
per year which

253
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:30,940
is a little bit lower than WHO's 1.9
million.

254
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,705
However they predict a higher number of
DALY's.

255
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:36,620
WHO was at 52 million, though that was an
older figure.

256
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,048
The highest ranking countries remain
India, DRC, Nigeria, Pakistan, countries

257
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:50,816
with large populations and moderate or
poor water sanitation and hygiene.

258
00:16:50,816 --> 00:16:54,219
China in this model though has a
relatively lower

259
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:58,327
burden of disease compared to the earlier
WHO estimates.

260
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:02,674
One of the biggest differences, though, is
that in the IHME model,

261
00:17:02,674 --> 00:17:07,161
only 25% of the diarrheal deaths are
caused by poor water and sanitation.

262
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:11,062
So, water and sanitation, as a risk
factor, accounts

263
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:14,141
for less than 1% of the burden of disease.

264
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,346
And this is, in large part, because

265
00:17:16,346 --> 00:17:18,856
hygiene wasn't included in the IHME
models

266
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:22,411
and we'll see when the recent WHO figures
are updated

267
00:17:22,411 --> 00:17:26,690
to include DALYs and risk factors, how
those numbers compare.

268
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,580
So in summary, we have a couple
different data sets for burden of disease.

269
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,740
From WHO, we have the recent numbers about
mortality, which include data and maps

270
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,570
and you have earlier reports with
mortality,

271
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,530
as well as morbidity and risk factors.

272
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,540
From IHME, you have data and maps

273
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,450
and risk factors and really nice
visualization tools.

274
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,190
What both of these data sets tell us is
that the

275
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,530
burden of disease from unsafe water
sanitation and hygiene is high

276
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,370
and that diarrheal disease is the leading
contributor to

277
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,150
that disease burden both in terms of
morbidity and mortality.

278
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,233
You can now access these reports or
websites

279
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:11,324
to get more detailed information if you
need.

280
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,276
In our next module we'll be looking at

281
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:16,561
some of the specific pathogens that cause
diarrheal diseases

282
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,007
in drinking water.

283
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:19,600
