00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:07,194
Hello and welcome to the course about
Household

3
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:10,830
Water Treatment and Safe Storage An
Introduction to HWTS.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,520
Make yourself comfortable.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,450
Would you like something to drink?

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,060
Glass of water?

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't know where you are but I'm sure
you have

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,020
access to drinking water otherwise you
wouldn't be taking this course.

9
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,940
But is that water really safe to drink?

10
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,210
Is it safe when it comes out of the tap?

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,280
Or out of the well or the stream?

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,240
Is it safe after you've collected it and
stored it in your house for a while?

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,180
Well, unfortunately for many people around
the world

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,170
the water they drink is not always safe.

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,400
And this is true in poor countries like

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,280
Ethiopia and Nepal but also in transition
countries

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,930
like Uzbekistan or Bolivia and even in
parts

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,680
of rich countries like England or the USA.

19
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,880
My name is Rick Johnston and I study
drinking water in developing countries.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,950
How safe it is what makes it unsafe and
how it can be protected and improved.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,490
One way that people can improve their
drinking water

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,170
quality is to treat it themselves at the
household level.

23
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,640
And that's the subject of this online
course.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,990
An Introduction to Household Water
Treatment and Safe Storage.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,290
I started this course while I worked

26
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,220
at eawag the Swiss Federal Institute for
Aquatic

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,770
Science and Technology which is the WHO
collaborating

28
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,470
center for sanitation and water in
developing countries.

29
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,070
Within eawag I worked at Sandec The

30
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:39,640
Department of Water and Sanitation in
Developing Countries.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,200
And the aim of Sandec is to develop or

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,290
adapt concepts and technologies for
application in developing countries

33
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,040
with a range of research and
implementation partners to

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,169
improve sustainable access to good quality
water and sanitation services.

35
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,120
During the preparation of this course I
moved

36
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,540
from Sandec to the World Health
Organization in Geneva.

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,680
But this MOOC remains a product of Sandec
along

38
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,970
with EPFL the Swiss Institute of
Technology in Lausanne.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,373
This course is the first in a series of
eLearning initiatives jointly developed by

40
00:02:18,373 --> 00:02:24,439
Sandec and EPFL, which will cover the full
range of Sandec research activities.

41
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:27,200
This course will run for five weeks.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,930
And at the beginning of each week we'll
release approximately one hour of

43
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:36,540
video lectures divided into short modules
usually around 10 or 15 minutes long.

44
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,970
The videos contain quizzes where you can
test

45
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,010
your knowledge about the materials being
presented and you'll

46
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,030
also be able to get PDF copies of

47
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,170
the presentations and English
transcription and a French translation.

48
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,830
Each module will start with an
introduction slide like this one.

49
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,650
Here you can see that today I will show
you the course outline.

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,600
We'll talk about quizzes and homework and
the course forum.

51
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,630
Let's start with a look at the course
outline.

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,580
The first week of course is an
introduction.

53
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,450
We'll start by exploring why it could be

54
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,700
useful to treat drinking water at the
household level.

55
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,250
We'll talk about the global burden of

56
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,240
disease discuss how drinking water can
become

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,930
contaminated and get a brief introduction
to

58
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,455
the technologies used in household water
treatment.

59
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:29,090
In the second and third weeks we'll go
through these technologies

60
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,260
in more detail with examples of actual
applications from around the world.

61
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,070
But the course isn't only about
technologies.

62
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,290
We'll also look at implementation
strategies which are successful or not.

63
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,580
We'll consider how a household water
treatment can be targeted to

64
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,258
particular vulnerable groups such as in
the emergencies or through schools.

65
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,580
And in the final week we'll look at
monitoring and

66
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,360
evaluation both of technologies and their
implementation in the field.

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,490
Especially in this week we will draw on

68
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,900
some useful documents and programs
produced by the WHO.

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,210
Most of these lectures will be delivered
by me but we will have a few

70
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,269
special guests from experts in the United
Nations or leading research institutions.

71
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,450
This course is an introduction we won't
get

72
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,000
into much detail about these topics but we

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,740
will always try to point you towards
websites

74
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,440
or documents where you can get more
information.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,590
Quizzes and homework.

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,620
Many of the modules will include short
in-video quizzes which are not graded.

77
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,370
But at the end of each week there will

78
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,850
be an assignment which counts toward the
course grade.

79
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,790
At the ends of weeks one two and four

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,180
this will be a quiz which will be
automatically graded.

81
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,886
After week three you'll have a

82
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:51,370
peer-reviewed assignment in which you will
need

83
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:55,529
to apply the knowledge that you've learned
so far towards a realistic scenario.

84
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,720
And after week five you will take a final
exam.

85
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,890
I will even tell you one of the questions
right now.

86
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm a nice guy.

87
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,060
You will have to tell me what this thing

88
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,040
is and how it is used in household water
treatment.

89
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,470
If you complete the assignments and the
final exam successfully

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,680
by the deadline you will receive a
Statement of Accomplishment.

91
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,750
Let's first take our first in-video quiz
right now.

92
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,980
You can find all relevant information
about the course such as

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,615
grading policies and information about the

94
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,010
peer-review assignments on the course
site.

95
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,240
We've also developed a forum section where

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,130
you can comment and discuss about the
course.

97
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,070
There's a General Discussion Forum and

98
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,000
three further forums with content specific
purposes.

99
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,930
In the General Discussion Forum you can
share

100
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,510
your reactions to the course material as
it's presented

101
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,820
and if you have your own experiences about
household

102
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,220
water treatment this is the place to share
them.

103
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,980
Study Groups Forum is a platform where you
can find friends and arrange meet-ups and

104
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,020
please invite your friends to the course

105
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,450
to create learning groups and discuss the
topics.

106
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,580
The Lectures Forum is for specific
questions about the lectures.

107
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,560
And Exercise Forum is for specific
questions and clarifications

108
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,750
about the quizzes the peer-graded
assignments and the final exam.

109
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,830
Finally there are two course specific
forums where you

110
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,550
can communicate any course material errors
and technical issues.

111
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,300
At the end of each module there's a
summary slide like this one.

112
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,340
And at the end of each week there is also
a

113
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,120
short summary module to give a recap of
the week's modules.

114
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,820
I'm looking forward to the course and to
hearing your contributions in the forums.

115
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,400
Let's start the course now with a module
about

116
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,600
the diseases that are caused by unsafe
drinking water.
