00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:06,752
Hello, today we will talk 
about global monitoring

2
00:00:06,752 --> 00:00:08,692
of water supplies and sanitation

3
00:00:08,692 --> 00:00:10,728
and how these monitoring efforts relate

4
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:13,838
to household water treatment 
and safe storage.

5
00:00:13,838 --> 00:00:17,458
Maybe you've been wondering, 
what is meant by global monitoring

6
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:20,258
and why monitor access 
to basic services anyway.

7
00:00:20,428 --> 00:00:23,128
To answer this let's take a look 
at two policy frameworks,

8
00:00:23,128 --> 00:00:25,038
which shaped the priorities and actions

9
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,158
of the international 
development community,

10
00:00:27,158 --> 00:00:29,618
including the water 
and sanitation sectors.

11
00:00:29,787 --> 00:00:31,523
Many of you will be familiar

12
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:35,273
with the Millennium 
Development Goals, or MDGs

13
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:37,415
and eight international development goals.

14
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:41,625
Annual MDGs, which were established 
following the 2000 Millennium Summit

15
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:44,854
and adopted by all UN member states.

16
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:48,833
But perhaps fewer of you are aware 
that in the coming decades,

17
00:00:49,438 --> 00:00:52,598
what is called 
the post-2015 monitoring period,

18
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:55,048
a new development agenda 
is about to be launched,

19
00:00:55,048 --> 00:00:58,308
called the Sustainable 
Development Goals, or SDGs.

20
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,708
First of all let's look at the MDGs

21
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,038
Under this framework there 
are 8 Goals with 21 associated targets

22
00:01:05,038 --> 00:01:08,053
ranging from ending 
extreme poverty and hunger

23
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:12,993
to achieving universal primary education, 
to improving maternal health.

24
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:17,171
The aim of Target 7C under Goal 7 
for environmental sustainability

25
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:20,303
is to halve the proportion 
of the global population

26
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:21,983
without sustainable access

27
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:24,846
to safe drinking water 
and basic sanitation.

28
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,973
The latest round of reporting

29
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:30,429
by the WHO Joint Monitoring Program, or JMP,

30
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:32,569
shows that on a global level

31
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,443
the target for expanding access 
to improve water supplies

32
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:39,968
has been met several years ahead 
of the 2015 deadline.

33
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:43,358
This is really an incredible 
accomplishment for the water sector.

34
00:01:43,783 --> 00:01:47,493
Unfortunately the news for sanitation 
is not as positive.

35
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:50,860
We see that delivery 
of improved sanitation services

36
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,665
has not kept pace with population growth,

37
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:57,983
and thus we will miss the global target 
for sanitation in the year 2015

38
00:01:57,983 --> 00:02:00,443
by nearly 700 million people.

39
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,113
It's important to know

40
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,113
that for both water 
and sanitation targets of MDG

41
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:07,481
data are reported at the national level,

42
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:09,973
so there is not a specific objective

43
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:13,603
to encourage equitable distribution 
of services within each country.

44
00:02:14,193 --> 00:02:18,013
This is one critique of the MDGs, 
and we will revisit this later.

45
00:02:18,216 --> 00:02:22,366
But first let's define a few terms 
that you will hear throughout this module.

46
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:25,485
First, a goal is an ambitious commitment

47
00:02:25,485 --> 00:02:27,855
to address a single challenge,

48
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:29,887
typically global in scope.

49
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:34,707
Each goal can be broken down
in two specific targets.

50
00:02:35,478 --> 00:02:40,528
A target is defined as a specific 
measurable and time-bound outcome

51
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:42,936
that directly contributes 
to the achievement

52
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:44,625
of the stated goal.

53
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:46,595
And finally targets are monitored

54
00:02:46,595 --> 00:02:49,705
by periodically collecting data 
on various indicators,

55
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:53,037
which are clearly defined, 
metrics using,

56
00:02:53,037 --> 00:02:55,225
used to measure 
progress towards targets,

57
00:02:55,225 --> 00:02:57,505
generally based on available data.

58
00:02:57,774 --> 00:03:01,054
To use the earlier example, 
Goal 7 of the MDGs,

59
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:03,928
which relates generally 
to environmental sustainability,

60
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:07,380
includes Target 7C, 
which states that by 2015

61
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,380
we shall halve 
the share of people globally

62
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,940
without sustainable access

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,205
to safe drinking water 
and basic sanitation,

64
00:03:14,205 --> 00:03:16,395
as compared to 1990 levels.

65
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:20,875
So you can see that the target is 
an action-oriented objective

66
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,575
to be achieved 
over a specific time period.

67
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:26,527
But how can we monitor progress 
towards this target?

68
00:03:26,824 --> 00:03:30,614
For water supply the JMP
has defined an indicator

69
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:34,064
of use of an improved 
drinking water source

70
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:37,484
which is one that is protected 
from outside contamination,

71
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:40,197
especially faecal contamination.

72
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:42,753
When a household reports 
using a protected water point,

73
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:44,873
such as a household or yard tile,

74
00:03:44,873 --> 00:03:50,822
public standpipe, borehole or tube well, 
protected dug well, protected spring

75
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:52,914
and rainwater harvesting system,

76
00:03:52,914 --> 00:03:57,904
that household is counted 
as progress toward the MDG target.

77
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,924
So far we've discussed 
the Millennium Development Goals

78
00:04:00,924 --> 00:04:03,825
and how progress 
on this development agenda is monitored

79
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,174
using specific targets and indicators.

80
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,570
Let's examine now 
how global monitoring will look

81
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,100
in a decade following 
the conclusion of the MDGs

82
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,932
and a new policy framework

83
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,832
called the Sustainable 
Development Goals, or SDGs.

84
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:18,800
The concept of SDGs 
was formally proposed

85
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,344
on the 2012 UN conference 
on sustainable development

86
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:25,840
with UN member states agreeing to goals

87
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,213
which are action-oriented, concise, 
easy to communicate,

88
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:34,254
limited in number, aspirational, 
global in nature

89
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,364
and universally applicable 
to all countries,

90
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:39,735
while taking into account 
different national realities, capacities

91
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:41,125
and levels of development.

92
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:45,311
As of March 2015 there were 
17 proposed goals shown here

93
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:48,943
and 169 targets and hundreds 
of proposed indicators

94
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,023
to monitor compliance.

95
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:52,487
You can see here 
that there is a standalone goal

96
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:55,187
for water and sanitation, Goal 6,

97
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:57,587
which proposes to ensure availability

98
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,677
and sustainable management 
of water and sanitation for all.

99
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,847
This goal is underpinned 
by targets and indicators

100
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,957
that center around three key concepts.

101
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:09,150
First, safely manage 
drinking water services,

102
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,873
second, safely manage 
sanitation services

103
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:14,528
and, third, hand washing at home.

104
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:18,768
Let's take a closer look at Target 6.1, 
the water related target.

105
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:23,243
This proposed target is to achieve 
by 2030 universal and equitable access

106
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,485
to safe and affordable 
drinking water for all.

107
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:28,848
The proposed indicators 
and definitions are shown here,

108
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:31,738
organized around 
the drinking water service ladder.

109
00:05:31,938 --> 00:05:34,494
You can see, the indicator 
for safely managed water

110
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:36,952
is the percentage of the population

111
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:39,562
using safely managed 
drinking water services

112
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:41,415
and defined more specifically

113
00:05:41,415 --> 00:05:44,375
as the population 
using a basic drinking water source

114
00:05:44,397 --> 00:05:47,562
which is located on premises 
and available when needed

115
00:05:47,562 --> 00:05:49,372
free of faecal contamination,

116
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:54,252
as well as priority chemicals 
and/or regulated by a competent authority.

117
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,188
In this case 
a basic drinking water source

118
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:00,901
is similar to the MDG definition 
of an improved water source.

119
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,624
But now within a 30 minute round ship

120
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,734
from household including queuing time.

121
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:10,878
This information is already 
routinely collected in household surveyes.

122
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:13,312
The information on faecal 
or chemical contamination

123
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:16,582
can come directly 
from water quality testing

124
00:06:16,582 --> 00:06:18,568
and also from administrative offices

125
00:06:18,568 --> 00:06:21,858
which have data on regulation 
and management practices.

126
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:25,234
In addition to prioritizing 
the elimination of inequalities

127
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,383
SDGs will also try 
to improve an MDG framework

128
00:06:28,383 --> 00:06:32,490
by monitoring access to WASH 
in schools and health care facilities

129
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,400
ending open defecation 
and achieving universal basic access.

130
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:39,250
The SDG dialog is evolving as we speak,

131
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,178
and you can keep up with the conversation

132
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,948
by checking out the reports 
and links listed here.

133
00:06:43,956 --> 00:06:46,144
Take a minute to explore these resources

134
00:06:46,144 --> 00:06:48,622
and let us know what you think 
about the SDG agenda

135
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,150
on the discussion forum.

136
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,635
So, in summary, this module examined 
global monitoring of water supply access

137
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:57,625
to the use of goals, 
targets and indicators.

138
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,001
We also looked at how access to water

139
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,091
is defined and monitored through 
the Millennium Development Goals

140
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,788
and learned that MDG Target 7C

141
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:07,945
to halve the share 
of the global population

142
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:10,552
without access 
to improved water supplies,

143
00:07:10,552 --> 00:07:14,686
but fortunately achieved 
well ahead of schedule.

144
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,879
Next, we explored the upcoming 
sustainable development goals

145
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,969
and a new set of targets 
which aim to improve upon MDGs

146
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,742
through eliminating access inequalities,

147
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:29,051
monitoring WASH access 
in schools and health care facilities

148
00:07:29,051 --> 00:07:31,911
and eliminating open defecation worldwide.

149
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,889
There are several challenges 
and opportunities

150
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,569
that the new SDG framework presents.

151
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:40,188
One major challenge 
includes striking the right balance

152
00:07:40,188 --> 00:07:42,858
between granularity and simplicity

153
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,678
such that the indicators 
are both true to the ground reality,

154
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:47,561
but also universally relevant.

155
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:51,366
Opportunities include 
the chance to expand

156
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,748
the monitoring capacity 
of the national institutions

157
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:56,241
beyond household survey data collection

158
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,123
and also the chance to harmonize efforts

159
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:03,643
and institutions around a new set 
of development priorities.

160
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:06,704
And what about HWTS?

161
00:08:07,277 --> 00:08:09,103
SDGs did not specifically prioritized use

162
00:08:09,103 --> 00:08:11,883
of household water treatment 
and safe storage,

163
00:08:11,883 --> 00:08:16,493
but since drinking water quality is now 
a specific indicator on the Target 6.1,

164
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:20,459
there may be opportunities 
for water treatment and safe storage

165
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,625
to play a role, 
especially at the community level.

166
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,923
In any case, we are about to enter 
a new and exciting period

167
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:27,943
of global monitoring

168
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,225
and we look forward 
to hearing more on the forum

169
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:33,495
about how the SDGs might affect you.
