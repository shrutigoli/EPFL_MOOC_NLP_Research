1
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:06,810
Hello.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,660
Welcome to the module on the international

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,970
network on household water treatment and
safe storage.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,320
I am Michael Forson the co-host to the network.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,350
And I work with UNICEF.

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:25,480
In this module we are going to look at the
issue, what triggered the network?

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,320
Actually, the question is why the network?

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,260
Then, we will look at the network
strategy, the

9
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,790
core elements of the strategy, its
mission, objectives, targets.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,168
We will look at the hosting and then the
implementation arrangement.

11
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:41,360
And the membership, what are the benefits
when you

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,060
join the network and also some of the
achievements.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,048
Then the challenges.

14
00:00:46,048 --> 00:00:50,380
You know as every institution or every
organization have some challenges, what is

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,520
working, what worked and what didn't work,
and some of the relevant information.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,890
Okay, the question is, the issue, a large
part

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,370
of the world population is without access
to drinking water.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:08,870
You know, in 2010, when the joint
management program

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,860
for UNICEF and WHO announced that the
world has

20
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,679
met the target on drinking water, for the
millennium development goals

21
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:22,030
specifically target three of the MDG goal
seven.

22
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,000
It was a big joy, but however, looking at
it critically you

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,890
will see that there are still people
without access to safe drinking water.

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,580
Again, by definition of the MDG targets, I
mean the definition,

25
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,150
it indicates that it actually looks at the
type of water source by its construction.

26
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,690
So, that means we're not very much sure,

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,210
about the quality of the water as they
drink.

28
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,640
And I must emphasize here that clean water
or clear water is always not safe water.

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,330
We s, we can say that as of 2011, there

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,790
were still 768 million people without
access to safef drinking water.

31
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,690
And then more billions also are not having
access to the safe drinking water itself.

32
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,465
Again, millions are served by unreliable
pipe systems and are forced to store water

33
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:22,120
in drinking in certain continents, which
really

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,430
puts a risk to contaminate the water.

35
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,520
Millions are also affected by emergency
situations, which in directly

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,490
affect the water and sanitation systems,
broken down water systems.

37
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:39,690
Therefore a potential risk to the safety
of the drinking water.

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,480
Then we realize that diarrhea being the
major cause

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,730
of child mortality it's also dependent on
drinking water.

40
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,240
If we look at the equation for the
diarrhoea reduction,

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,590
safe drinking water actually takes about
30% of the variables.

42
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,568
So the question is why a network?

43
00:03:00,568 --> 00:03:06,280
In February 2003, WHO convened a
multi-stakeholder meeting,

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,400
to really think through, what is the best
platform that stakeholders should

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,930
come together, to address the issues that
I mentioned in the previous slide.

46
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,530
And after deliberations, they agreed that
a network

47
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,370
would be the best forum to be used.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,790
The advantages of a network is that a
network is a forum.

49
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,790
It's an information clearing house and
vehicle to move, to

50
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,570
promote collective, bilateral and
individual

51
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,540
action as part of the stakeholders.

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,550
That means, it's more like an
all-inclusive

53
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,390
clearing house so everybody have a say.

54
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,800
Again it co, it encourages communication
and cooperation.

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,761
So whenever you want to see South-South
corporation,

56
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:54,690
South-North cooperation, the network can
really do that.

57
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,695
And again as a network, we can really
monitor and

58
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:02,540
map the global efforts, to inform
advocacy, implementation and investment.

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,570
Then, we can also raise awareness about,
HWTS,

60
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,360
its rule and make the understanding how
one should

61
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,820
understand it, and the supports to
government in

62
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,950
making decisions regarding, household
water treatment and safe storage.

63
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,300
Then again, we are to, as, as a network,

64
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,700
we can conduct agreed targeted researches
which are coordinated

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,880
to really give us, I mean, evidence as to

66
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,024
how best we can win the health impact on
HWTS.

67
00:04:31,024 --> 00:04:36,500
On this slide, we see

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,948
I wanted to portray the timeline how the
network has really fed.

69
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:47,021
In Phase one, which was actually from 2003
to 2008, we saw

70
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:52,190
the time of planning, more of a thinking
through and so forth.

71
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,680
During that time, WHO was the sole host of
the network.

72
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,085
After 2008.

73
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,780
UNICEF and WHO released their
seven

74
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,447
point strategy for comprehensive diarrrhea
control and management.

75
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:08,270
And then the network adapted this as the

76
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,300
key or the basis to really move the
agenda.

77
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,050
There was a strategic meeting or
consultation

78
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,720
during the f the, the, the interface.

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
And it was a [INAUDIBLE] strategic
meeting.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,770
Now it was agreed that UNICEF and WHO
would co-host it.

81
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:31,206
So, that gave birth to the second phase in
2011 where WHO and UNICEF co-hosted

82
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:37,690
a platform and we've had a couple or a
number of original meetings.

83
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,550
So, we can now see, in 2014, where we are
now.

84
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:49,460
Now, that network every organization or
every, institutions, you have a vision.

85
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,420
So, to the network, our mission is to
contribute

86
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,815
to a significant reduction in water-borne
and related vector-borne

87
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:03,470
diseases, especially among vulnerable
populations, by promoting HWTS as

88
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,260
a key component of community targeted
environmental health programs.

89
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,810
Our focus is on vulnerable population,
people

90
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,100
affected by HIVs, people who are
disenfranchised.

91
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,900
People who are malnourished, people who
are, I mean, but,

92
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,340
but, just, I mean, in, inequality, being
affected by inequality.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,780
And again, we are trying to, our mission
is also

94
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,570
to look at, trying to, eh, make an
integrated effort.

95
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,760
To leverage other more environmental
health programs because we

96
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,960
talking about what, the equation of the
diarrhea reduction.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,370
It's not only safe water, but then there
are other elements in that.

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,459
The objectives of the network, the HWTS
network

99
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,400
has the following four objectives and
three targets.

100
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,175
The objectives and targets are shaped
around the

101
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:56,310
three core areas that the network derives
its strength.

102
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,740
Advocacy, communication, research and
implementation and scaling up.

103
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,070
The objectives is actually to HWTS, will
be

104
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,700
used as an evidence base of public health.

105
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,910
The evidence base of HWTS as a public
health intervention.

106
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,370
Will really be strengthened.

107
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,440
And it is our objective also that there
will be tangible reasons.

108
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,350
For scaling up HWTS activities globally.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,950
Then, we looking at national policies and
institutional frameworks

110
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,360
to be developed as part of the
environmental health interventions.

111
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,700
Then also to disseminate best practices in
HWTS across the group.

112
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,310
We have three key targets.

113
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,990
The first target is that by 2015

114
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,370
thirty countries should have established policies
on

115
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,130
household water treatment and safe
storage.

116
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,180
By 2015 we are expected that they will
strengthened, we

117
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,270
are expecting that they will be
strengthened evidence to guide effective

118
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,260
and replicable HWTS activities and
approaches which will give, which

119
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,220
will influence Long-term widespread and
use and its public health impact.

120
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,340
And also, by 2020, we are hoping that 50
countries

121
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,919
should have achieved a country-wide scale
up of project-based HWTS.

122
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,570
In terms of participation, we currently
have over 160 membership drawn from

123
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,600
various organizations, the academia, The
United

124
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,480
Nations agencies, governments and so
forth.

125
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,120
There are a number of benefits if you join
the network.

126
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,422
One is it connects you to a global network
of HWTS.

127
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:36,310
That's what we are, you meet with experts,
senior officials,

128
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,838
program implementers, researchers, and on
the ground implementers.

129
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:44,680
And again you will receive the
latest

130
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,990
news on the HWTS project as it evolve.

131
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,280
There are meetings and events through

132
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,320
which the Network really share
information.

133
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,060
We have a Network listserv and a

134
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,820
newsletter that really give you up-to-date
information.

135
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,210
Then again, you'll be able to know who is
active where, and

136
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,360
how to engage with other partners

137
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,130
if you're are planning for HWTS
interventions.

138
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,130
Then, you also benefit from having
your

139
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,160
work disseminated and highlighted in the
network communication material.

140
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,310
You will have also a voice in the annual
network

141
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,310
meeting and therefore have an input into
the annual work plan.

142
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,630
Then you have access to an online,
interactive webspace to

143
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:31,230
share files and discuss matters of
interest with Network participants.

144
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,719
We have this arrangement with the Network.

145
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,560
The secretariat is made up of WHO and
UNICEF with, the University of North

146
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,850
Carolina, the Water Institute at the
University

147
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,880
of North Carolina playing the
communications role.

148
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,170
Within the secretariat, we have an
advisory group.

149
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,370
Which is pulled from the various members

150
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,700
of the high ranking proven practitioners
and researchers.

151
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,670
The catch here is that if you are with a
UN

152
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,700
organization, you are excluded from being
on, on, on the advisory group.

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,000
Then we have a public private partnership
group.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,990
This group also works hand in hand with
the

155
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,630
advisory group and the secretariat because
the network prove, is

156
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,020
trying to provide a level platform for
their private

157
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,190
sector to really invest into what move on
the HWTS.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,550
We have the participating organizations
and members around the Secretariat then,

159
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:38,200
in the strategy we had working groups but
then it didn't really work well.

160
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,920
So, in terms of implementation the
WHO

161
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,238
and UNICEF both designated focal points as

162
00:10:45,238 --> 00:10:48,440
co-hosts, and the membership of the
Advisory

163
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,490
group were selected based on an agreed
criteria.

164
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,540
And the Secretariat organize and convene
network

165
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,650
and annual, and the Advisory group
meetings.

166
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,830
Again we develop and implement the
communication plan.

167
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,360
UNC performs the communication function
for the network.

168
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,610
Now, within the network, here are the
responsibilities.

169
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,460
There are four core areas.

170
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,190
WHO take care of two, knowledge

171
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,520
advancement and policy and
advocacy.

172
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,610
In terms of knowledge advancement, WHO

173
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,110
look at research, knowledge management,
technology assessment.

174
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,360
For the policy and advocacy, they look at
the global and national

175
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,210
level poli advocacy, and the policy

176
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,950
formulation and review of strategic
document.

177
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,470
UNICEF leads on the capacity development,
training

178
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,550
workshop, dissemination of best practices,
et cetera.

179
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,080
And also take care of monitoring, where we
talk about the global process, progress,

180
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:51,220
on HWTS, and then the mapping at, of
implementation at the country level.

181
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,710
UNC maintains regular and constant
communication

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,770
within the secretariat and outside the
secretariat.

183
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,080
Out, here are some of the key achievements
but not all.

184
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,950
We've hosted over a dozen, over half a
dozen regional workshops

185
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,582
leading to the formation of over 20
national HWTS action plans.

186
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:18,080
A tool kit of harmonized indicators to
strengthen

187
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,400
monitoring and implementation of HWTS has
also been developed.

188
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,440
And awareness have been raised on
integration.

189
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,680
The need for integration among key public
health efforts.

190
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,080
Such as HV, HIV AIDS, maternal and child
health, nutrition, et cetera.

191
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,610
And we rarely emphasize on the role of
HWTS.

192
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:42,250
Out of these abrife notes that we can lay
hands on.

193
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,030
Again, we are supporting a quality
assurance

194
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,830
of HWTS products through the HWTS
evaluations scheme.

195
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,850
Then there is a global capacity building
through strategic webinars.

196
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,950
What worked and what is or what is
working?

197
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,320
The co-hosting arrangement actually
harnessed the

198
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,740
strength of both UNICEF and WHO.

199
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,220
The original workshops has really been
great.

200
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,680
It's focus is controlled and it's really I
mean selected based

201
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,850
on the countries and this one really have
very strong output.

202
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:19,020
Integration is also great.

203
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,495
It has worked very well with other
environmental health

204
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,990
such as the indoor air
pollution et cetera.

205
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,890
We are however have a bit of challenges.

206
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,370
The first is the working groups.

207
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,149
It started well but then it died off.

208
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,480
I can li, link it like a community of
practice.

209
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,890
So what we intend doing is now when an
issue is hot,

210
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,710
then you will form a community of practice
to deal with that issue.

211
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,740
Again, the network has a very ambitious
target.

212
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,150
And as we go down implementation during
the review,

213
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,550
we will look at what needs to be done.

214
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,070
There need to be a clear alignment

215
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,280
and harmonization between water safety
plans and HWTS.

216
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,530
There's been a bit of confusion whether
HWTS is under the water safety

217
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,900
plans or not, but we realize that HWTS is
unique on it's own, but at the same time,

218
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,010
it's also one of the vital
or the vital

219
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,400
actions that will help water safety plans
at the community level.

220
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,160
The advisory group was also working great
but

221
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,880
however we are faced with challenges of
membership.

222
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,336
Here on this slide, we have the
information, the network home

223
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:34,920
page is hosted by WHO and the other one
hosted by UNC.

224
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,840
Then, if you want to subscribe to the
newsletter, you

225
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,610
can contact Ryan, the
communication at the email below.

226
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,210
And Ryan will comfortably and add you to
the network

227
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,450
and you will receive all the information
that is needed.

228
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,360
Thank you very much for participation.

229
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,770
Again, I'm Michael Forson, the co-host to the
network.

230
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:54,982
Thank you.

231
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:55,130
