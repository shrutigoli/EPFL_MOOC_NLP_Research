1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,220
In this module we'll talk about the
Millennium Development Goals.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,040
What they are?

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,750
Where safe water fits into them?

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,218
And how household water treatment and safe
storage is related to the MDGs.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,380
The Millennium Development Goals, or MDGs.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,130
Our set of eight, well goals, that were
established by

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,370
United Nations member states in the year
2000, the millenium.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,080
And set a development agenda for the next
15 years.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,440
In most cases they tried to set specific
targets for each of the goals.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,730
Which could be measured, and would be
ambitious, but still could be achieved.

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,670
Within the time frame.

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,570
Now these goals are, are very broad they
cover

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,160
poverty and hunger, primary education,
gender equality and women's empowerment.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,860
Child mortality, maternal health, severe
diseases, environmental

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,189
sustainability and a global partnership
for development.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,200
Now you might think, well what about water
and sanitation?

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,140
Where to they fit into the MDGs?

18
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,476
Well, where would you put safe water and
sanitation?

19
00:01:11,476 --> 00:01:17,051
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,067
Well, water and sanitation are found

21
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:22,980
under goal seven, ensure environmental
sustainability.

22
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,901
There's a target there.

23
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:24,680
7C.

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,160
Which is to have, by 2015, the proportion
of people

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,630
without sustainable access to safe
drinking water and basic sanitation.

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,870
Obviously, the main goal of HWTS is to

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,500
improve drinking water quality at the
household level.

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,600
This is most important when there are many

29
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,000
risks of fecal contamination along the
drinking water chain.

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,520
Many of those threats lie outside the
household, and in the long run

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,490
should be best addressed through source
protection

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,990
and development of high quality water
supply.

33
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,770
HWTS doesn't replace the obligation of
service providers

34
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,670
to provide sustainable access to safe
drinking water.

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,510
It's more of a stop gap measure for people
who don't

36
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,590
yet have access to high quality drinking
water in the home.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,980
For people who need to collect water from
public points.

38
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,950
Or who accessed piped water, which is not
fully reliable, for

39
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,990
example, due to intermittent operation and
contamination in the distribution system.

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,250
So HWTS can contribute to the safety of
drinking water but it

41
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,940
doesn't improve access, the quantities
available

42
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,130
or the sustainability of the water supply.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,790
So if people who rely on unimproved water
sources such as rivers or ponds are

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:48,400
able to use HWTS sustainably and
effectively to improve water quality

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,430
at home, it may be safe, but it still
wouldn't be the same

46
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,379
as sustainable access to safe drinking
water as in MDG target seven C.

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,040
This would in fact, transfer
responsibility

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,310
from the service providers to the
consumers.

49
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,090
Which wouldn't be fair.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,990
So, HWTS can contribute towards MDG 7, but
also towards the other MDGs.

51
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,529
Especially the health related ones.

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,280
Unsafe drinking water is a major risk
factor for under five mortality, MDG 4.

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,270
As well as people living with HIV/AIDS,
MDG 6.

54
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:30,040
Contaminated water is also linked with
malnutrition, so

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,270
HWTS can have an indirect impact on MDG 1.

56
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:38,950
And since children often miss school when
they're suffering from

57
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:44,346
diarrheal disease, HWTS can have an
indirect contribution towards MDG 2.

58
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,870
So in conclusion, HWTS contributes to the
MDG target on safe

59
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,210
drinking water, but also toward other

60
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,839
MDG targets, especially the health-related
ones.

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,060
However, HWTS alone doesn't guarantee
sustainable access to safe drinking water

62
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,890
and so it shouldn't be considered as an
indicator for target 7C.
