1
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:07,760
In this module, we'll talk about 
diseases caused by unsafe water,

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,917
sanitation and hygiene, 
and how they can be classified,

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:15,294
as well as the burden of disease due to
unsafe water, sanitation, hygiene,

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,716
both in terms of deaths or mortality

5
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:19,652
and disease or morbidity.

6
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:24,584
<i>They say that three things in life 
are certain: birth, taxes and death,</i>

7
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:28,441
<i>and somehow some people manage
to avoid taxes.</i>

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,002
<i>But deaths are inevitable.</i>

9
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:35,402
<i>There are about 55 million people 
who die every year</i>

10
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:39,199
<i>but there are even more people 
who have babies every year.</i>

11
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:43,269
<i>About 135 million new babies
are born each year.</i>

12
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:47,324
<i>So that means overall there 
is about a 1.1% increase</i>

13
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,277
<i>in the global population each year,</i>

14
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:53,165
<i>and the population will double 
every sixty years at current rates.</i>

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,817
<i>One useful way to classify diseases
was proposed by the authors</i>

16
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:01,196
<i>of the 1972 classic book 
“Drawers of Water”.</i>

17
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:04,152
<i>According to environmental 
transmission pathways</i>

18
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:09,266
<i>this so called “Bradley Classification” 
includes four types: water-borne,</i>

19
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:13,016
<i>water-washed, water-based
and water-related diseases.</i>

20
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:18,559
<i>Now some of those 55 million deaths 
per year are caused, at least in part</i>

21
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:21,110
<i>by unsafe water sanitation and hygiene.</i>

22
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:24,499
<i>And we can think about different ways
to classify those diseases.</i>

23
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,508
<i>First, we can talk about 
the water-borne diseases</i>

24
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:31,192
<i>which are diseases caused 
by actually drinking, ingesting water</i>

25
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,965
<i>that has some pathogens in it.</i>

26
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:36,808
<i>These include the diarrheal diseases 
caused by different pathogens:</i>

27
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,982
<i>Rotavirus, Cholera, 
Shigella or Cyptosporidium</i>

28
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,799
<i>but also Hepatitis A and E</i>

29
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,083
<i>and even Polio can be transmitted 
through drinking water.</i>

30
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,265
<i>For any of these water-borne diseases</i>

31
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:53,491
<i>an intervention to reduce the disease then
could involve improving the water quality.</i>

32
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,470
<i>Next we have the water-washed diseases
which are caused by poor hygiene</i>

33
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,830
<i>due to lack of water 
rather than by direct ingestion.</i>

34
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,757
<i>Most water-borne diseases 
are also water-washed</i>

35
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,840
<i>because they can be transmitted 
through hands</i>

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,026
<i>and contact with other surfaces.</i>

37
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:13,291
<i>Trachoma is the leading cause 
of preventable blindness globally</i>

38
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:17,313
<i>and is transmitted by flies 
which land on people's faces.</i>

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,635
<i>And Acute respiratory infections 
are also transmitted through contact</i>

40
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,558
<i>with pathogens on hands 
and other surfaces.</i>

41
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,898
<i>Water-washed diseases 
can be reduced</i>

42
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,868
<i>by increasing the amount of water 
that is available to improve hygiene.</i>

43
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,551
<i>Water-based diseases 
are those caused by parasites</i>

44
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,300
<i>which live part of their 
life cycle in water.</i>

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,513
<i>The most serious of this 
is the Schistosomiasis or Billharzia</i>

46
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:47,443
<i>which affects 160 million people 
globally, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.</i>

47
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,431
<i>Another serious water-based disease
is Guinea Worm, or Dracunculiasis,</i>

48
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,076
<i>which is a horrible disease 
which used to affect many people,</i>

49
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,953
<i>3.5 million people in 1986,</i>

50
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:04,686
<i>but cases are now down 
to only 542 in 2012</i>

51
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:09,361
<i>and those are confined to about 
four countries mainly in South Sudan.</i>

52
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,880
<i>For water-based diseases 
control-mechanisms</i>

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,748
<i>involve targeting 
the aquatic organism host</i>

54
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,996
<i>and protecting surface water bodies
from contamination.</i>

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,589
<i>Finally, there are water-related diseases
which are caused by insects</i>

56
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,512
<i>which breed in water, 
especially mosquitoes.</i>

57
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,624
<i>The most important of these is malaria,</i>

58
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:37,308
<i>which affects about 250 million people
each year, causing about 589,000 deaths.</i>

59
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,781
<i>The great majority of those 
are in Sub-Saharan Africa</i>

60
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,594
<i>and affect children 
under the age of five.</i>

61
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:48,412
<i>Another important mosquito disease
is Dengue fever,</i>

62
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:51,882
<i>which is growing in numbers 
and can cause explosive outbreaks</i>

63
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,870
<i>especially in urban areas.</i>

64
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,545
<i>In both cases, the mosquitoes breed 
in certain types of water,</i>

65
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:01,762
<i>and a control mechanism 
is to remove their habitat.</i>

66
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:06,077
So in summary, there are many diseases
which are caused at least partially,

67
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,374
by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.

68
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,333
Water-borne diseases are those 
that are caused by directly drinking

69
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,791
or ingesting contaminated water.

70
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,952
And those disease could be controlled

71
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,801
at least partially, by treating the water
at the household.

72
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:24,793
Household water treatment though
shouldn't be expected to have an impact

73
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:29,742
on other diseases that are water-washed,
water-based, or water-related.

74
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,111
<i>Now let's take a little break.</i>

75
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,709
<i>You see on your screen 
five different infectious diseases,</i>

76
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,327
<i>and I'd like you to think for a minute</i>

77
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:41,237
<i>about which of them cause 
more or less deaths each year.</i>

78
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,324
<i>Arrange them in the order 
of number of deaths per year.</i>

79
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:54,706
<i>The most recent global mortality figures
were release by the WHO in 2014</i>

80
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,612
<i>and estimate deaths 
over the years 2000 to 2012.</i>

81
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,227
<i>You can see that Lower 
Respiratory Infections such as pneumonia</i>

82
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:05,730
<i>were by far the largest cause of death
among these diseases.</i>

83
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,075
<i>Diarrheal disease cause about 
1.5 million deaths,</i>

84
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,923
<i>followed by Tuberculosis, 
Malaria and Measles.</i>

85
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,729
Diarrheal disease is the most important
of the water sanitation

86
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,434
and hygiene-related diseases,

87
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:20,099
and a major contributor 
to the global burden of disease.

88
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:24,153
Diarrhea is among the main causes
of child mortality globally,

89
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,872
second only to acute 
respiratory infections.

90
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,288
It's responsible for about one 
out of every ten deaths

91
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,187
among children under the age of five.

92
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,884
That's about 1000 child deaths per day.

93
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:39,754
The WHO estimates that 56% 
of deaths due to Diarrhea worldwide

94
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:43,087
are attributable to inadequate water,
sanitation and hygiene.

95
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,520
So it's clear that poor access 
to the basic services

96
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,627
have a major impact on global health,

97
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,018
especially through preventing 
the transmission

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,139
of water-related infectious diseases.

99
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,286
<i>So far we've been talking about 
burden of disease</i>

100
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,741
<i>in terms of deaths or mortality,</i>

101
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,117
<i>but it's also important 
to consider sicknesses</i>

102
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,867
<i>which can greatly reduce 
the quality of life or morbidity.</i>

103
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,173
<i>We can do this through a metric</i>

104
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,801
<i>that's called</i>Disability Adjusted 
Life Years<i>, or DALYs.</i>

105
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,268
<i>What DALYs do is combine two aspects.</i>

106
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,710
<i>First, the Years of Life Lost</i>

107
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,329
<i>in comparison to 
a Standard Life Expectancy</i>

108
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,819
<i>and second, the Years of Lost to Disability</i>

109
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,893
<i>which are the number of years
you live with the disability</i>

110
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:31,285
<i>times a weight for how serious 
that disability is.</i>

111
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:34,401
<i>Well, let's consider this 
with some examples.</i>

112
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:39,848
<i>First, consider a person who has 
a normal life expectancy of 80 years</i>

113
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,188
<i>and has no particular disabilities.</i>

114
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,476
<i>Then this person lives 
a fully healthy life for 80 years</i>

115
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,948
<i>and has zero years of life lost 
or years lost to disability</i>

116
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,253
<i>so they have no DALYs.</i>

117
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,315
<i>Second, let's consider the example 
where someone also</i>

118
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:06,262
<i>has a life expectancy of 80 
and lives a very normal life,</i>

119
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:07,292
<i>to begin with,</i>

120
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:12,944
<i>but then had some kind of sudden accident
at age 70 and dies prematurely.</i>

121
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,057
<i>Then they have years of life lost.</i>

122
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,555
<i>How many? 
Ten years of life lost.</i>

123
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:23,843
<i>There's no disability here 
so the number of DALYs is ten.</i>

124
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:29,190
<i>Okay, this time let's consider a person 
who lives a normal healthy life</i>

125
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,313
<i>until age 50, when they have 
some kind of accident</i>

126
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:38,476
<i>which leads to a loss of a foot, 
amputation of the foot.</i>

127
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:43,115
<i>Now the disability weight 
for the foot amputation is 0.3.</i>

128
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:44,804
<i>So it goes up to there.</i>

129
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,264
<i>But then that person lives 
to the expected life expectancy of 80 .</i>

130
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:55,854
<i>So here we have years of life lost 
to disability. How many?</i>

131
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:04,000
<i>Thirty years from age 50 times 
the weight of 0.3 for foot amputation</i>

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,254
<i>is a total of nine, so that's 9 DALYs.</i>

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,376
<i>Finally, a more complicated example
is a person who lives a normal life</i>

134
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:20,607
<i>until age 36, 
when they contract HIV AIDS.</i>

135
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:25,787
<i>Full-blown AIDS without any medicine,
without antiretroviral therapy</i>

136
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,000
<i>has a weight of 0.5.</i>

137
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:33,528
<i>But after four years, that person then 
is able to get medication</i>

138
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:38,321
<i>and have a much better quality of life
with the weight of 0.167.</i>

139
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:44,552
<i>Then that person lives until age 70,
dying prematurely.</i>

140
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,945
<i>Forty-six, thirty-six, not forty.</i>

141
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:54,064
<i>So here we have years lost 
to disability,</i>

142
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:57,085
<i>and here we have years of life lost.</i>

143
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:01,865
<i>How many? Ten years of life lost.</i>

144
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,894
<i>How many years lived with disability?</i>

145
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:09,894
<i>We have four at that high rate, 
that's a total of two,</i>

146
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:17,577
<i>plus thirty at a lower rate, 
that's five, for a total of seven.</i>

147
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:24,117
<i>So then the DALYs equals to ten 
plus seven for seventeen.</i>

148
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,605
<i>So you can imagine 
the diarrheal disease then,</i>

149
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:32,125
<i>which impacts a very young children
in many cases,</i>

150
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,345
<i>will also have a high contribution 
to DALYs</i>

151
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:37,977
<i>because of the large number 
of years of life lost.</i>

152
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:43,564
Now that we have a metric for morbidity,
the DALYs, we can examine

153
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:46,256
the overall burden of disease 
posed by diarrhea

154
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:49,166
and compare it to other diseases globally.

155
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,882
Now that 2013 WHO report 
about deaths globally

156
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:58,888
hasn't yet been analyzed 
to develop DALY estimates.

157
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:02,770
So we have to look at 
an older WHO report from 2008

158
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,081
shown up here, where they reported 
that diarrhea disease caused

159
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,671
over 52 million DALYs per year,

160
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,999
which again the distribution 
was very similar

161
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,736
to the mortality numbers we've seen
with a little bit more than 3%

162
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:23,016
of the global total and about 9% 
of the burden of disease for children.

163
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,165
This report also listed country-wise DALYs

164
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:32,357
and you could see that India was by far
the largest country in terms of DALYs,

165
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:35,649
in terms of disease burden 
followed by other large countries --

166
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,199
China, Nigeria, Pakistan,

167
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,831
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
which all had more than 3 million DALYs.

168
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:50,509
In fact, in DRC, the contribution of DALYs
to the overall disease burden

169
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,727
was more than 10% of all DALYs.

170
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:57,824
So far we've been talking about numbers 
generated by the WHO,

171
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,190
either their 2000 report on mortality

172
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,037
or earlier reports for morbidity
or risk factors.

173
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:07,764
But there is another large important
and recent data set out there,

174
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:11,187
it's called the Global Burden 
of Disease 2010 Study

175
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,900
and it was done by the Institute 
for Health Metrics and Evaluation

176
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,253
or IHME based in Seattle, Washington.

177
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:22,498
The GBD 2010 Study 
was a massive undertaking

178
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,516
involving hundreds of scientists 
from all around the world

179
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,574
including many WHO researchers.

180
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:32,817
However, even though it uses 
similar approach to the WHO models,

181
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,433
WHO hasn't endorsed the findings

182
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,345
in part because of some 
methodological differences

183
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,292
and in part because 
they weren't given access

184
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:45,230
to the data and the findings 
to validate them for publication.

185
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:50,622
Some of the main differences 
between the two studies are that, first,

186
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:55,948
IHME calculated new disability weights
for various health conditions.

187
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:00,346
This was done through 
a participatory online process,

188
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,939
as well as through field surveys 
in number of countries.

189
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:10,176
Second, while WHO considered hygiene,
water and sanitation risks,

190
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:15,186
IHME found that the data available 
for hygiene practices,

191
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:18,058
nationally representative data sets
were too weak,

192
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:20,422
so they decided not to include 
this risk factor.

193
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:24,923
And then finally, in the IHME model,

194
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:28,558
people accessing a basic level of 
water and sanitation,

195
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:33,746
such as improved sources of water
like a borehole or a protective spring,

196
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,976
or improved sanitation basic pit nutrim,

197
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:40,778
they were considered to suffer 
no burden of disease

198
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,663
due to their water and sanitation.

199
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,387
This was not the approach followed
in the WHO models.

200
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,994
Nonetheless, this was a massive 
and important undertaking

201
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:52,161
and we can learn a lot 
through its findings.

202
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,720
Let's take a look at them.

203
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,826
<i>Let's take a look at the GBD 2010 data
from the IHME website.</i>

204
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,916
<i>You can find it just by searching IHME.</i>

205
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,966
<i>Then let's go straight 
to their data visualization.</i>

206
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,425
<i>They have many different 
visualizations tools.</i>

207
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,237
<i>We'll look at GBD Compare.</i>

208
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,679
<i>Now in GBD compare, 
this is what's called a tree map</i>

209
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,760
and if you hover over different diseases

210
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,217
<i>you can see the percent 
of their contribution</i>

211
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,582
<i>to the burden of disease.</i>

212
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,495
<i>Here let's put a focus 
on diarrheal disease,</i>

213
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:38,614
<i>now that box will always have 
a square on it,</i>

214
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,771
<i>and we can change 
between DALYs and deaths,</i>

215
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:48,469
<i>we can look at global 
or specific countries or regions,</i>

216
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,550
<i>we can change years,</i>

217
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:54,680
<i>we can see that if we look at 
"Under five children"</i>

218
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,254
<i>the contribution of diarrheal disease
is much larger.</i>

219
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,783
<i>So you can find out a lot of things 
from this kind of map.</i>

220
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:08,574
<i>Down below, we have different options
for secondary visualizations.</i>

221
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,862
<i>We could look at Time Plot for instance,</i>

222
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:15,543
<i>and see the number of deaths
decreasing over time</i>

223
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,982
<i>here shown as Rates or as Numbers.</i>

224
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:24,332
<i>Decreasing from 1.7 million
under five deaths in 1990</i>

225
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:28,144
<i>to about 666,000 in 2010.</i>

226
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:35,694
<i>We can also look at the Map and see 
which countries have greater</i>

227
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:38,108
<i>or lesser burdens of disease.</i>

228
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:42,139
<i>Here we can see that India, 
who has a 150,000 child deaths</i>

229
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,325
<i>is by far the largest contributor 
to burden of disease,</i>

230
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,441
<i>but if we look at Rates,</i>

231
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,008
<i>then we would see more high rates
in Sub-Saharan Africa</i>

232
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,975
<i>and the same 
if we look at proportion of DALYs.</i>

233
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,254
What both of these data sets tells us
is that the burden of disease

234
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,767
from unsafe water, 
sanitation and hygiene is high

235
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,370
and that diarrheal disease

236
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,169
is the leading contributor 
to that disease burden

237
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,867
both in terms of morbidity 
and mortality.

238
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,170
You can now access these reports 
or websites

239
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,950
to get more detailed information 
if you need.

240
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:21,773
In our next module,
we will be looking at

241
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,466
some of the specific pathogens

242
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,934
that cause diarrheal disease 
in drinking water.
