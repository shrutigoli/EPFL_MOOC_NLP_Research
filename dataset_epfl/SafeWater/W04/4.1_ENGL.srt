1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,070
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,020
I hope you had a nice weekend.

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,710
Me, I went out and got a haircut.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,870
Last week, you were probably all saying I
needed one.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:13,780
Well, I got one.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,260
But anyway, this week, let's get down to
business.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,320
Now that we know all about the different

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,100
technologies for household water treatment
and how they work,

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,330
let's talk about how to get these
technologies into

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,980
the hands of people, of many people at
scale.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:35,520
In today's module, we'll look at different
implementation strategies which

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,340
are dependent on the main objective of
whoever is promoting HWTS.

13
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,485
And regardless of the objective, there are

14
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,760
three key ingredients that are required
for uptake.

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,030
Those are supply and demand, and
financing.

16
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,680
Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel prize winning
economist, is

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,499
one of the driving thinkers behind social
business models.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,010
He proposes a framework for considering
business

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,800
models depending on whether the principal
objective

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,760
is to maximize financial profits, or to

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,890
maximize some other social good like
public health.

22
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,985
Traditionally, businesses have aimed to
maximize profits of course while

23
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,990
not-for-profit organizations for example
charities,

24
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,090
have aimed to maximize social goods.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,690
Yunus proposes a middle way, a social
business

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,210
model in which the principal aim is still

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,930
to advance a social issue but while
covering

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:40,240
costs from its operations to repay any
invested capital.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,410
So social businesses are not charities and
they aim to be financially sustainable.

30
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:48,560
However, surpluses are not returned to
investors

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,960
as dividends, they're reinvested in the
business.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,410
And therefore, ultimately benefit the
target population

33
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,580
through lower prices, improved service, or
greater accessibility.

34
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,430
This framework applies nicely to HWTS.

35
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,900
And I'll give some example of these three
different approaches.

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,460
Of course these three classes are

37
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,830
theoretical, and real world organizations
usually

38
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,409
fall somewhere on the spectrum in between
two or three of the classes.

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,374
Well, applying this framework to HWTS, I'm
going to

40
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:27,400
restrict our discussion to the low and
middle income markets.

41
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,660
There's quite a market for household water
treatment in

42
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,580
rich countries, but that's not the focus
of this course.

43
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,090
In the last ten years or so, there's been
quite a lot

44
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:42,040
of excitement about the market potential
in low and middle income settings.

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,160
Even though these people don't have a lot
of money, there

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,488
are an awful lot of them and they do spend
money.

47
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:52,610
The economist C.K. Prahalad kicked off
this interest with his article called The

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,670
Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid and a
book of the same name a few years later.

49
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,090
Now it's more commonly called the base of
the pyramid.

50
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,440
I, I guess it sounds more respectable that
way.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,510
But the key insight here is that there
around 4 billion people who make less

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,990
than $2,000 per year, and that
conventional

53
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:16,080
markets are not reaching these people at
all.

54
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,860
Here, India is particularly important,
because while

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,770
there's an emerging middle class in Indian

56
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,650
cities, there are more people living in
poverty in India than in all of Africa.

57
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,830
And those 4 billion people spend a lot of
money on water.

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,100
This 2007 report

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,370
estimated that the BOP water market was at
$20 billion and growing rapidly.

60
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,490
Of course, that's not all spent on HWTS,
but these kinds of numbers

61
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,850
are large enough to generate interest
among

62
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,850
social businesses, and even conventional
profit-oriented organizations.

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,720
When a conventional business wants to
enter a new

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,479
market, there's a well-established path
which looks something like this.

65
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,940
Businesses start by trying to exist and
survive, making

66
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,000
investments, but not seeing much in the
way of returns.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,450
Hopefully, they then start to succeed and
scale up, and finally reach a

68
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,570
certain stage of maturity, especially when

69
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,650
producing something durable like a water
filter.

70
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,410
There are heavy investment costs for
things like plastic moldings, and large

71
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,410
economies of scale that can be

72
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,690
realized only after achieving some
commercial success.

73
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,700
Now this model doesn't work terribly well
for BOP markets.

74
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,190
Some of the basic assumptions and

75
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,310
rationales in conventional business
thinking don't apply.

76
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,830
Traditional innovation management is very
good

77
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,470
in creating needs in existing markets.

78
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,230
If there's a market, traditional
innovation management can

79
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,940
describe how to design new products and
services.

80
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,170
But with the BOP, there may be needs but
as yet no existing market.

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,530
The creation of markets requires the
business model to innovate.

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,200
A business model is a holistic picture of
the logic of a company that describes

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,280
the various pieces which build the company
and

84
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,720
collects them to the business and
institutional environment.

85
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,180
It also links the different business
elements to the customers and

86
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,970
enables thinking about different ways of

87
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,430
integrating customers into the value
proposition.

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,940
Well, if companies want to succeed in the
BOP market, they have to innovate not only

89
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,870
in products and services, but their entire
business

90
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,560
models at multiple stages along the, the
curve.

91
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,110
They have to be innovative in finding ways
to link their business to local

92
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,550
institutions and other businesses, and in
finding

93
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,840
ways of integrating customers in the value
creation.

94
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,890
This involves a lot of risk.

95
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,180
And business model innovations are much
more

96
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,360
likely to fail, than to be successful.

97
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,550
Whether the aim is to maximize profit or

98
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,890
some social good, to recover investment
costs or not.

99
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,000
Organizations that want to succeed in HWTS
need to have business models

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,060
that include three core elements: demand,
supply, and financing.

101
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,100
People have to want to use HWTS.

102
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:36,110
They have to be able access HWTS products,
and somebody needs to pay for

103
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,990
the product as well as for the expenses of
getting it to the eventual users.

104
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,560
If we draw some tips from the business
world, you'll

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,100
often hear about the four Ps, which are
product, having

106
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,400
the right product at the right price,
promoting it effectively,

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,610
and having a good place where people can
access the products.

108
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,605
This is another way of organizing those

109
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:03,890
three elements of demand, supply, and
financing.

110
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,500
UNICEF has taken this four P approach and
added two Ps in the context of HWTS.

111
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,820
These are population, finding the right

112
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,210
population, and program monitoring and
evaluation.

113
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,010
You can read more about it in this
document.

114
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,750
How does a profit-oriented business look
at HWTS?

115
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:33,640
So far, the focus has been on the demands
of those most able to pay high prices.

116
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,690
And these are upper class consumers,
typically in urban areas who tend to be

117
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,980
drawn to high end products and durable
goods more than to consumables.

118
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,440
There are many products that require
electricity and cost hundreds of dollars.

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,470
Using processes that we've looked at like

120
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,320
reverse osmosis or ultraviolet
disinfection, sometimes together.

121
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,240
And companies create demand for these
products

122
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,000
through commercial marketing, using highly
aspirational images.

123
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,900
They strive to create effective messages,
and locally relevant value propositions.

124
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:15,970
While these products are available through
well established supply

125
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,140
chains devices can be bought in
supermarkets or appliance stores

126
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,330
and specialty shops, and are primarily
sold at a retail price which

127
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,780
includes a margin for distribution
marketing and profit.

128
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,450
Durable goods tend to be expensive but
some companies cross-subsidize by charging

129
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,850
less for the initial hardware and relying
more on consumables for revenue.

130
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,850
This is sometimes called razors and blades

131
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,360
model like handheld razors where the
handle is

132
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,210
very cheap or even free but the

133
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,940
important revenue stream comes from the
consumable blades.

134
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,330
Most of the products sold with this model
are filters.

135
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,550
Typically, in combination with a
disinfection

136
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,940
step like chlorine or maybe UV radiation.

137
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,100
And these are a few of the main commercial
companies

138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,710
with, with products, but it's not at all a
comprehensive list.

139
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,580
Most of these products belong to larger
families of

140
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,180
businesses and started life as a corporate
social responsibility innovation.

141
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,770
Let's take a look at one of these in a bit
more detail.

142
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,820
Hindustan Unilever is part of the huge

143
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,540
Unilever Group worth over 40 billion
Euros.

144
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,740
Hindustan Unilever by itself is a big

145
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,090
business family with more than 35 brands,
mostly

146
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,440
in consumer non-durable products like
soaps, detergents,

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,390
and shampoos, but also tea and ice cream.

148
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,500
It's based in India and it has a huge
market.

149
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:59,790
Since the 1990s, Hindustan Unilever's
Corporate Social Responsibility program

150
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,060
has been working on a product to improve
drinking

151
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,980
water, recognizing that both in urban and
rural India,

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,970
people did not have access to safe
drinking water.

153
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,070
And importantly, there weren't any
effective

154
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,040
options available that were well accepted.

155
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,290
Boiling was the main option, but unlike in
other parts of the world, boiling was

156
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,900
perceived as a burden, expensive, time
consuming,

157
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,330
and giving treated water an unpleasant,
flat taste.

158
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,250
In 2000, the first product was launched.

159
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,640
The Purit Classic with a capacity of 23

160
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,030
liters and available in royal blue and
burgundy.

161
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,940
This cost 2,000 rupees, or about $44 at
the time.

162
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,940
Soon after, an autofill product was
launched for customers with access

163
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,490
to tap water, even if the tap water might
not be continuous.

164
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,220
And in 2010, the industrial giant, the
business giant Tata came

165
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,090
out with a household filter called Swatch
priced at a 1,000 rupees.

166
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,230
And Unilever, Unilever, immediately
followed suit

167
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,250
with its Compact model, shown here.

168
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,180
In the same year though, Unilever also
aimed at more affluent customers

169
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,360
with its Marvella unit, which looks

170
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,369
very fancy but also doesn't require
electricity.

171
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,070
The Purit product was sold through
existing stores where Unilever had

172
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,440
strong distribution channels, but also
through direct to home network sales.

173
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,550
Which required hiring a force of 10,000
demonstrators who

174
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,299
were paid through a combination of salary
and commission.

175
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,770
Marketing was aspirational but with a
health-based

176
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,880
dimension, using the slogan, as safe as
boiled

177
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,840
water.

178
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,340
By 2010, Unilever had sold nearly 4
million units, and over the next

179
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,050
several years, they further refined the
product

180
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,920
introducing new variants targeting
specific customer niches.

181
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,560
In 2014, this is what the Purit family
looks like.

182
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,670
You still have these Classic models.

183
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,360
Compact is now called Classic as well.

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,650
And there's a new lower cost model called
Intella.

185
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,570
There's also something a little bit higher
end, 3,100 rupees.

186
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,410
Marvella is still there, but there but
there are higher

187
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,780
end Marvella products that do require
electricity with UV or RO.

188
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,840
So the entire family spends quite a
spectrum of different types of consumers.

189
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:44,060
Most of Purit sales have probably been to
relatively well-off customers.

190
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,830
Next, let's look at social business
models.

191
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,500
Here the objective is a social good which
is to

192
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,950
improve health by reducing exposure to
pathogens and drinking water.

193
00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,900
To do this there need to be three elements
in place, people drinking unsafe water,

194
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:05,200
an effective HWTS product, and consistent
use of that product.

195
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,870
Social businesses working on HWTS may face
that problem of needs without markets

196
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,530
and have to find ways to create demand,
supply, and financing instruments.

197
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,390
For demand creation, social businesses

198
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,039
typically rely on social marketing
approaches.

199
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,270
Targeting particularly vulnerable
populations such as

200
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,015
rural areas in the base of the

201
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:36,870
pyramid who are more likely to face health
problems from unsafe drinking water.

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,110
Social marketing can be done through
multiple

203
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,030
channels, typically involving mass media,
but also

204
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,140
reinforced through visits to communities
and households

205
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,240
where demonstrations and trainings can
take place.

206
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:57,221
Products are typically branded and
advertised with aspirational messages and

207
00:13:57,221 --> 00:14:02,016
images, and done in line with theories of
behavior change communication.

208
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:07,252
Instead of focusing exclusively on health
outcomes and negative reinforcement

209
00:14:07,252 --> 00:14:10,731
like, you will get sick unless you use
this product.

210
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:15,879
Social marketing of HWTS products invests,
involves campaigns that focus on

211
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,297
aspirational messages on beauty and

212
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:22,440
cleanliness, overall health and aesthetic
improvements.

213
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,020
On the supply side, products are sometimes
produced in country.

214
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,330
For example, liquid chlorine solutions and
quality control is important.

215
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,720
Distribution channels often have to be
built

216
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,160
up and may make use of non-commercial

217
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,635
human resources like NGOs, health workers
or

218
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:46,849
community-based groups in addition to
local entrepreneurs.

219
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,540
For financing, social businesses aim to
recover costs,

220
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,940
at least the cost of the product
distributed.

221
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,410
Often other costs like promotion, training
and monitoring are subsidized, so

222
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,719
that prices don't rise beyond the reach of
the vulnerable target populations.

223
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,380
There have been a few attempts to tap

224
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,080
into Micro-credit especially for larger
expenses like filters.

225
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,230
In the module on ceramic filtration, we
looked at two Cambodian companies

226
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,190
RDIC and IDE which could be said to follow
a social business model.

227
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,220
Population Services International, or PSI,
is one of the

228
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,930
largest social marketing organizations in
the world and has

229
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,520
extensive experience with different HWTS
products including the Safe

230
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,770
Water System, Medentech's Aquatabs, and
the P&G Purifier of Water.

231
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,560
They've described some of their main
lessons and best practices in this nice

232
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,595
report, and let's now take a bit closer
look at the purifier of water.

233
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:59,710
Procter & Gamble, or P&G, is another huge,
multi-national company.

234
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:03,559
They manufacture and market over 300
different products around the world.

235
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:10,600
P&G spent millions of dollars developing
Pur, a combined coagulant flocculant

236
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,390
and disinfectant product in its corporate
social responsibility program, and then

237
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,790
tried to establish it as a commercial
product with testing, test

238
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,350
marketing for several years in Vietnam,

239
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,245
Guatemala, the Philippines, Morocco, and
Pakistan.

240
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:30,425
It cost P&G about $0.04 per sachet to
produce Pur which can treat ten liters of

241
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:36,035
water, and they tried to sell the product
for 0.08 to $0.10 cents per sachet.

242
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:41,630
P&G learned a lot from these experiments,
but after three years when sales

243
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,140
did not meet targets, they concluded that

244
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,879
the product wasn't likely to become
profitable.

245
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:54,150
So P&G reconsidered its business plan for
Pur and

246
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,710
in 2005, committed to a non-commercial
approach, where sachets would

247
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,010
be sold at production cost, to programs
targeting people

248
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,429
without safe drinking water, especially
children in low income countries.

249
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,390
This proved to be a more successful
approach and within a few years, they

250
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,440
had sold 57 million sachets compared to

251
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,860
only 3 million during the commercial
trials.

252
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,970
NGOs and social marketing groups like PSI
are key partners now.

253
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,420
And in addition to distribution through
social marketing

254
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,890
channels, Pur has been very popular for
emergency

255
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,460
response, in part because it can treat
highly

256
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,485
turbid waters which cause problems with
other products.

257
00:17:35,485 --> 00:17:40,710
P&G is also experimenting with sales to
campers in high income

258
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,590
settings with the aim of cross subsidizing
the main BOP market.

259
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:51,066
Pur has now been re-branded as the P&G
purifier of

260
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:56,130
water and sits firmly in P&G's CSR
portfolio.

261
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,290
Well, what about those charities or pure

262
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,330
not for profit groups described in UNICEFs
framework.

263
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,780
Well, there are not really many groups out
there today

264
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,870
who don't care at all about cost recovery
from consumers.

265
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,140
It's become conventional wisdom in large
part because of the

266
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,690
successes of social marketing initiatives
that when people pay something

267
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,720
for products, they become aware of the
value and in

268
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,759
turn are more motivated to use and
maintain them carefully.

269
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,450
So even purely charity driven
organizations

270
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,680
today will often expect a nominal

271
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,560
contribution from users either in cash or
in kind through labor and time.

272
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,580
Two examples of not for profit HWTS
initiatives are SODIS

273
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,790
and Biosand filters as promoted by the
NGO, Clear Cambodia.

274
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,880
With SODIS, the cost of products the
plastic bottles, is very small.

275
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,570
Though in some areas, purchasing plastic
bottles is a barrier to uptake.

276
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,080
But the main costs of the program are
training and social mobilization

277
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,480
typically through household visits, and
these

278
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,340
costs are subsidized through donor
support.

279
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,920
Similarly, Clear Cambodia is supported by
the

280
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,970
charity, Samaritan's Purse, in its Biosand
filter projects.

281
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,610
Clear Cambodia had distributed more than
60,000

282
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,700
Biosand filters in rural Cambodia, by
2010.

283
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,610
They received additional funding from
Samaritan's

284
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,870
Purse to implement another 15,600 new
filters.

285
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,750
So they created demand through social
mobilization visits to

286
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,420
schools and villages, with demonstrations
of the Biosand filter technology.

287
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,390
And they trained community health
promoters to solicit requests for

288
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,546
filters and were tremendously successful,
generating

289
00:19:47,546 --> 00:19:52,920
150,000 requests, almost ten times as much
demand as their supply plan.

290
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,180
Clear Cambodia then traveled from village
to

291
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,430
village and built concrete Biosand filters
on site.

292
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:06,290
And then after implementation filters were
monitored repeatedly

293
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,800
with four visits in the year after
installation.

294
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,830
The full cost of one Biosand filter in

295
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,380
this project is about $60, including all
of the

296
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,490
costs associated with distribution and
monitoring, and this price

297
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,140
is well out of reach of their target
population.

298
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,940
Clear Cambodia does sell filters at full
price to other

299
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,180
NGOs and government, but filters for the
poor are heavily subsidized.

300
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,290
Clear Cambodia does ask for user
contributions

301
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,192
including a nominal cash contribution of
about

302
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:45,510
$4 US, as well as in-kind contributions of
time and materials such as sand.

303
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:48,550
Also people have to arrange their own
transport to the

304
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,430
household level which is not trivial,
these are heavy things.

305
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,571
And they must also commit to joining
promotion meetings and follow-up visits.

306
00:20:57,571 --> 00:21:03,160
Unlike the profit-maximizing approaches of
other filters, the main cost

307
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,450
of a Biosand filter is the initial
construction and distribution.

308
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,340
There are no recurring expenses, and
operation

309
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,310
and maintenance are relatively easy and
free.

310
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,370
One of the biggest barriers to getting
HWTS technologies in the hands of BOP

311
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:25,840
consumers is the high capital costs,
especially for durable goods like filters.

312
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:32,000
Both for-profit companies and social
businesses are actively experimenting with

313
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,060
innovations in financing that could allow
this barrier to be reduced.

314
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,860
A few companies, including Unilever, have

315
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,950
tried micro-credit, with initial promising
results.

316
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,010
Others have looked at payments and
installments or group saving approaches.

317
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,190
And there's a lot of interest in mobile
payments, especially in

318
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,670
East Africa where the mobile payment

319
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,590
programs MPesa, has seen tremendous
success.

320
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,165
And finally, one original approach is to
attempt to

321
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:06,750
cross-subsidize the cost of HWTS through
carbon credit revenues.

322
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,570
The idea here is that a household
practicing HWTS doesn't

323
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,690
need to boil the water to make it safe to
drink.

324
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,590
So there are savings in terms of biomass
burning and carbon dioxide emissions.

325
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,380
However in 2012, the global price of
carbon

326
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,570
credits crashed and hasn't recovered to
its earlier highs.

327
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:32,270
So it's not clear if this strategy will,
will be productive in the future.

328
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,660
The largest example of carbon credit
financing in HWTS

329
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,610
is that of Vestergaard Frandsen's Carbon
for Water project,

330
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,200
in which nearly a million Lifestraw family
filters were

331
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:50,890
distributed for free throughout western
Kenya, in entire communities.

332
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,860
Distribution was accompanied by massive
social

333
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,630
mobilization and education and training
programs,

334
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:04,190
and the filters alone cost Vestergaard
Frandsen about $30 million US dollars.

335
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,607
Vestergaard Frandsen estimates the total
ten year lifetime

336
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:10,360
cost of the program at about $120 million.

337
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,080
In order to get carbon credit revenues,

338
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,090
there has to be a strict monitoring
program.

339
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,180
Twice a year teams visit ten to 15,000
randomly

340
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,642
selected households to see if filters are
actually being used.

341
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:30,094
Vestergaard Frandsen expects to receive
credits for reducing

342
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:35,150
about 2.6 million tons of carbon emissions
per year.

343
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,950
They've already received their first
carbon credits, but

344
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,780
are a long way from showing a profit.

345
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,250
In any case, profits would be channeled
back into

346
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,699
the project in line with their social
business orientation.

347
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,590
In this module, I've drawn a lot from an
HWTS

348
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,939
training package put together by WHO's
Western Pacific Regional Office.

349
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,330
They have nice materials both for the
trainers

350
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,930
and the participants, that you can
download here.

351
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,060
Regarding drinking water and BOP markets,
these are two very useful reports produced

352
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,599
by the IFC and the World Resources
Institute again available on the internet.

353
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,930
I've also used a number of journal
publications

354
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,030
about business models and bottom base of
pyramid markets.

355
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,010
Some of these are available for download
on the internet as well.

356
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,390
I can especially recommend my colleague at
Eawag, Dr. Heiko Gebauer, who

357
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,620
works on business model innovation in the
water sector in developing countries.

358
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,180
Check it out.

359
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,610
And finally if you're interested, piqued
by the topic,

360
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,650
you can learn a lot more about the
economic

361
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:49,580
side of water and sanitation in developing
countries by

362
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,879
signing up for another MOOC right after
this one finishes.

363
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,420
This one, on water supply and sanitation
policy

364
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,010
in developing countries is taught by a
Professor

365
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,800
Dale Whittington from the University of
North Carolina

366
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,340
at Chapel Hill, and it's going to be
great.

367
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,610
You should all sign up.

368
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,330
I already have.

369
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,320
We've only just scratched the surface on

370
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,560
the topic of implementation strategies,
but I've tried

371
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,610
to organize implementation approaches
along the lines

372
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,210
of the different business models suggested
by UNICEF.

373
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,437
And these are also developed further by my
colleague at Eawag,

374
00:25:24,437 --> 00:25:28,910
Dr. Heiko Gebauer in his article listed on
the last slide.

375
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,410
Check it out.

376
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,740
But, keeping things simple, whatever the
business model, you need to make sure that

377
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,580
demand, supply, and financing are all in
place for HWTS to succeed.

378
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,500
