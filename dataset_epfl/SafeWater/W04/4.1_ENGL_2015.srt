1
00:00:04,235 --> 00:00:06,351
Now we'll hear from Dr. Heiko Gebauer,

2
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:07,666
leader of the Business Innovation

3
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:11,177
for Sustainable Infrastructure 
Services Group at Eawag.

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,030
He'll be joined by Caroline Soule,

5
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,634
a researcher at Eawag's Department 
of Environmental Social Sciences

6
00:00:16,986 --> 00:00:20,005
and together they'll present 
their work on market-based approaches

7
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:23,105
for delivering sustainable water services
in low income countries.

8
00:00:23,158 --> 00:00:25,541
During these days
you might heard quite a lot

9
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,768
about the word <i>business model</i>
and <i>business model innovations,</i>

10
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:29,606
so it became quite popular.

11
00:00:30,207 --> 00:00:32,876
If you hear <i>business model</i>
you might already have

12
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:34,804
some association in mind
what it actually means.

13
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,754
Basically <i>business model</i>
more or less describes

14
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,377
the logic of organization,

15
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:42,018
how to create and capture value.

16
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,077
In the next couple of minutes 
we try to answer three questions.

17
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,169
First of all,
what are business model innovations

18
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,323
and how can they actually contribute

19
00:00:50,323 --> 00:00:52,366
to household water treatment systems?

20
00:00:52,366 --> 00:00:56,709
Finally, how can different elements
in the business model be altered?

21
00:00:56,709 --> 00:01:01,496
So business models, to be clear, 
refer to non-profit organizations,

22
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,590
but also the profit-oriented companies.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,566
And naturally in the household
water treatment systems

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,791
we somewhat 
quite often talk about non-profits.

25
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,251
But non-profit doesn't necessarily mean
that you don't charge your people,

26
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:15,749
so you also try to recover
some of your cost,

27
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:20,498
and organizations like OSHO, 
the Oromo Self-Help group in Ethiopia

28
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:24,069
are trying to give 
their water filter there for free

29
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,067
but then try to charge the [inaudible]

30
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:29,621
charge for the material to their customers.

31
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:34,026
And customers make a nominal contribution
to the water filter as well.

32
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:37,410
Profit-oriented companies
like Unilever, of course,

33
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,789
they try to make money
with the water filters.

34
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:44,533
The idea is to sell them above
the manufacturing cost

35
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,729
so you have sufficient 
revenues and profits

36
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:48,711
to finance your company.

37
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:53,229
And in between non-profit organizations
and profit-oriented companies

38
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,374
an interesting new type of business model
is actually emerging,

39
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,800
and this business model
are so called <i>social businesses.</i>

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,473
They're innovative in a way

41
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:05,309
because they try to combine economic 
but also social goals.

42
00:02:05,309 --> 00:02:08,236
An example would be Hydrologic 
from Cambodia

43
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:10,642
and the social goal is to make

44
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:15,274
household water filters affordable,
but also desirable

45
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,888
for rural families in Cambodia,

46
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:21,075
but, on the other hand,
also to recover their costs

47
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:25,694
and to finance the distribution channels
and the manufacturing of the filters.

48
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,014
If you work with business models,
the most common way is to do it

49
00:02:31,014 --> 00:02:32,963
with the business model canvases.

50
00:02:32,963 --> 00:02:34,899
For profit-oriented companies

51
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,430
these canvases normally 
have nine elements.

52
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,892
You start from the right to the left,

53
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:43,109
from the customer segments,
to customer relationship,

54
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:45,970
to distribution marketing,
and also the value proposition.

55
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:50,740
And then you take your key activities,
key resources, and key partners as well.

56
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,129
These elements are based on
the fundamental of every business

57
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:57,190
that's about revenues and costs.

58
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:59,010
And if you want to work with that

59
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,377
you basically have to answer 
three questions.

60
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:05,771
First of all, what value 
do I deliver to my customers?

61
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:10,191
What value do I offer to my customers?

62
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:13,519
And how do I capture value,
and how do I finance my business?

63
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:16,357
And for non-profit organizations

64
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:18,355
these canvases might look 
a little bit different.

65
00:03:18,355 --> 00:03:22,922
Here you decide or distinguish into
Donor model canvases,

66
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:24,591
Beneficiary model canvases.

67
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:27,856
For Donor models 
it's very much about

68
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:30,220
the value propositions 
for the donors,

69
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,523
and for the Beneficiaries
is about the impact metrics,

70
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:35,979
so what kind of social impact
you try to achieve,

71
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,338
and you try to combine 
these different business model canvases

72
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:44,505
in order to make your whole approach,

73
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:48,679
your whole implementation 
of business model financially sustainable.

74
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:54,056
As part of any of these business models
for social businesses,

75
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:57,076
non-profit organizations, 
or profit-oriented ones,

76
00:03:57,076 --> 00:04:00,595
it's important to understand
who is your actual customer,

77
00:04:00,595 --> 00:04:02,531
and what's your market environment.

78
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:06,504
And this market environment
is typically called the <i>BOP market.</i>

79
00:04:06,808 --> 00:04:09,979
BOP stands for the <i>Base of the Pyramid.</i>

80
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:14,621
The base of the pyramid describes
people living close to the poverty line

81
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,655
with a handful of dollars per day.

82
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,144
The question is,
how you can understand the benefits,

83
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:22,665
but also the needs 
and the preferences

84
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:24,579
these people actually have.

85
00:04:24,579 --> 00:04:27,066
And we don't want to go 
into any details here,

86
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,331
but there's a lot of literature
actually describing,

87
00:04:29,331 --> 00:04:31,408
based on the pyramid's strategies,

88
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:34,180
subsistence marketeers,
market places,

89
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,668
but also how you could get out
of poverty,

90
00:04:36,668 --> 00:04:39,670
or even how you make 
business solutions for poverty.

91
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,965
Here are just examples of books
and links, your guide for follow-ups

92
00:04:42,965 --> 00:04:44,527
in order to better understand

93
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:49,548
how you can really make 
your products and services affordable

94
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:53,024
for the BOP market, but also desirable.

95
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,611
So let's come to the next question.

96
00:04:55,611 --> 00:04:57,982
How can business model
innovation actually contribute

97
00:04:57,982 --> 00:05:00,339
to household water treatment systems?

98
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,003
If you look into how household 
water treatment systems

99
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:06,877
should go into the market,
how can we penetrate the market,

100
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:11,300
you typically start with a pilot phase
that hopefully you can prove

101
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,060
that the distribution and sales
of your household water treatment system

102
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,834
become financially sustainable.

103
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:19,129
And then when the pilot 
becomes successful,

104
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:23,228
you try to scale up to reach 
a higher market penetration

105
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:25,195
to sell more filters.

106
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:29,124
Then finally that you can scale up
in terms of social impact

107
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:32,831
but also in terms of 
your financial contributions

108
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:37,192
and the finances you need 
to get from a pilot to a scale.

109
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:40,562
Unilever started 
the CSR business model.

110
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:42,713
In the CSR projects,

111
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,895
for years they experimented,

112
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:49,357
they're finding new ways
in creating a mini water treatment plant

113
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:53,578
that can finally become
a basic household water filter.

114
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:57,465
They made a lot of design changes
and a lot of cost reductions

115
00:05:57,465 --> 00:06:00,765
in order to make this kind of 
household water filter,

116
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:05,700
the Compact 14 Liters filters;
desirable but also affordable.

117
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,640
By introducing it to the market

118
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:13,360
and by also looking into 
the first commercial successes,

119
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:15,299
but Unilever actually saw

120
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:19,051
that it becomes quite 
an interesting business for them.

121
00:06:19,051 --> 00:06:22,807
So they re-integrated it
into the normal business units.

122
00:06:22,807 --> 00:06:25,762
By seeing actually
the commercial success,

123
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,824
Unilever decided to change
the business model

124
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:30,583
to a commercial business model.

125
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,500
A key element 
of this business model was

126
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,743
going through different kinds
of sales channels,

127
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:39,355
like your <i>door-to-door</i>
but also traditional retail channels

128
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:42,393
to reach a high number of customers.

129
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:44,358
And if you talk about 
high number of customers,

130
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:48,134
until now about 57 million people benefit

131
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,509
from this kind of filter.

132
00:06:49,857 --> 00:06:52,376
But it also went 
for Portfolio extensions.

133
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:55,834
So instead of just going 
for one filter or maybe a couple of them

134
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:59,168
they really increased 
the product portfolio.

135
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,669
And this product portfolio 
no longer addresses only

136
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:03,048
the low income segment,

137
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,829
but also more into the middle income
but even higher income segments.

138
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:10,819
All these filters have an
aspirational design

139
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:13,828
so they look nice, 
people really want to desire it

140
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,250
and they're nevertheless 
also affordable.

141
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,238
And when it comes to affordability,

142
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:22,704
Unilever implemented an interesting
business model innovation.

143
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:25,667
This business model innovation
is actually quite close

144
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,292
to what I initially introduced
with the printer and the ink.

145
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,555
Unilever makes money 
with selling the filter

146
00:07:32,555 --> 00:07:37,256
but also selling consumables,
or what we call <i>Germ kill kits.</i>

147
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,151
So after an amount of time

148
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:42,671
we have to replace your Germ kit
in your filter,

149
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:46,126
and Unilever makes money
of selling these kits

150
00:07:46,126 --> 00:07:49,082
in order to finance distribution channels

151
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:52,535
and to have a blink
to the existing customers.

152
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,541
By Phase 2, as I said ,

153
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,995
Unilever business model 
became financially successful

154
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,944
and could scale up as well.

155
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:02,849
Now let's look at the last example.

156
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,175
This is from a Social business.

157
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:08,202
Social business Hydrologic
in Cambodia.

158
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,961
Hydrologic started initially
with the idea

159
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:14,709
"We want to make very cost-effective
household water filter."

160
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,595
And by making it very cost effective,
they went for a simple design

161
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,561
in order to make it very affordable
for the people.

162
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:25,776
And the idea was to sell
this kind of design to NGOs

163
00:08:25,776 --> 00:08:28,760
that, more or less, can give this filter
to the beneficiaries,

164
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,050
either by charging for it as well
or maybe even giving it away for free.

165
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:37,395
What they try to do was -- 
of course that is NGOs

166
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,942
if they don't sell it,
we have to subsidize the price.

167
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:42,393
So the NGOs also have to invest into it.

168
00:08:42,393 --> 00:08:45,497
And the whole set up was finally,
fortunately in a way,

169
00:08:45,497 --> 00:08:48,681
that the manufacturing cost
of the household water filter,

170
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,676
Hydrologic Hat, 
was above the sales price.

171
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:54,836
And above the sales price means,

172
00:08:54,836 --> 00:08:57,966
Hydrologic had needed donations
to finances its business,

173
00:08:57,966 --> 00:09:03,832
but also the NGOs needed donations
to subsidize the water filter prices.

174
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:07,367
And now it's the question: 
"How we can change this kind of thing?"

175
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,301
Can you, for example, 
make it more attractive

176
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:13,602
by adding financial services
like micro-credits to it

177
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:16,165
that people might not be able
to invest into it

178
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:19,539
but maybe micro-credits 
might solve the problem?

179
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:23,488
But interestingly, 
Hydrologic changed even more

180
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:25,222
than just like a financial service.

181
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:28,437
What they did is really going 
for aspirational design.

182
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,939
So instead of making the product
more cost effective, more affordable,

183
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:35,223
they changed the whole mindset,
saying: "No, we want to have something

184
00:09:35,223 --> 00:09:39,479
that is aspirational, and which is easy
to use for our customers."

185
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,329
And the making aspirational

186
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,491
it becomes attractive 
also for commercial channels.

187
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:48,260
So today you can buy these filters,
not from the NGO

188
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,513
but through traditional
retail channels in Cambodia.

189
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:56,504
And by selling more to people
Hydrologic experienced

190
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:59,514
that interestingly, 
the manufacturing cost went down

191
00:09:59,514 --> 00:10:01,374
because by producing more,

192
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,771
it means you have higher
economies of scale

193
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:06,125
and to reduce your manufacturing cost.

194
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,685
So Hydrologic was actually in the position

195
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,172
that the sales price was higher 
than the manufacturing cost finally.

196
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:13,998
And the making money with the filter,

197
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:17,618
the whole business model 
became financially sustainable.

198
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:22,312
In about two years,
about 100,000 filters could be sold.

199
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:26,456
So Heiko has spoken to you so far
about what are business models,

200
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,085
what are business model innovations

201
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,381
and how can they contribute
to household water treatment systems.

202
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,366
Now I'm going to discuss 
some of the trends we're seeing

203
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:39,016
in business model innovations
for water treatment systems.

204
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:41,493
We published a paper in 2014

205
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,361
which classifies implementation models
for water service provision

206
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:48,672
and identify some ways
organizations are innovating,

207
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:52,191
which include diversifying
their offerings, securing payments,

208
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:53,854
increasing cost recovery,

209
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,662
and extending their distribution channels.

210
00:10:56,192 --> 00:11:00,452
Diversification can mean 
adding additional water treatment products

211
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,712
targeted at different customers segments,

212
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:06,187
selling additional products
like shampoo and hygiene products.

213
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:09,944
and securing financing
via unconventional avenues

214
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:14,689
such as carbon credits, or green,
or social impact bonds.

215
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,818
Securing water payments can be achieved

216
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:21,333
by a partnering 
with mobile payments services

217
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,626
such as M-Pesa,

218
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:27,415
and allowing people to access 
treated water using prepaid cards

219
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:30,873
during times when water retailers
would usually be closed.

220
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,165
Cost recovery, an increase 
in cost transparency

221
00:11:34,287 --> 00:11:37,349
can be achieved through
local production of equipment

222
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:39,817
and training local staff for repairs.

223
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:44,337
Additionally, by increasing the density
of the distribution of units

224
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,918
repairs and replacements
can be attended too quickly

225
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:49,086
which reduces losses

226
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:51,943
which would be incurred
if there was down time.

227
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,334
Developing professionalized 
distribution approach

228
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:57,874
can involve multi-channel distribution,

229
00:11:57,874 --> 00:12:00,008
which means you can sell door-to-door

230
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:02,163
buy also in supermarkets.

231
00:12:02,163 --> 00:12:06,255
This would involve individual
distribution targets,

232
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,309
margins and sales volumes
for each channel.

233
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,632
Additionally, distribution centers
can become service centers

234
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,620
which also handle the marketing
of new products.

235
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:19,690
In summary, we've explored
what are business models,

236
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,577
business model innovations,

237
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,971
and what aspects of them
can be altered

238
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:30,410
in order for household 
water treatment systems to reach scale

239
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:34,411
by exploring the journey
of three different organizations

240
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:40,127
who have been producing successful
household water treatment systems.

241
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:43,709
I hope you enjoy 
the rest of the course and the week

242
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,182
and good luck on your exam.
