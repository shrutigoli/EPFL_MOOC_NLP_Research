1
00:00:04,629 --> 00:00:07,287
In the last module we talked
about different strategies

2
00:00:07,287 --> 00:00:09,672
for promotion of HWTS.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,164
If the objective
is purely to maximize profit,

4
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:17,332
any reductions in disease that result
are nice, but are secondary.

5
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,457
If, on the other hand, the goal
is to maximize a social good,

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:23,774
like reducing diarrheal disease,

7
00:00:23,937 --> 00:00:28,684
then interventions will often aim
to target the most vulnerable populations,

8
00:00:28,684 --> 00:00:31,507
those who are consuming unsafe water.

9
00:00:32,069 --> 00:00:37,542
And of course, the HWTS technology needs
to be effective, and applied consistently.

10
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,963
We've already looked
at the base of the pyramid

11
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:46,157
but a good strategy can be
to promote HWTS in special settings

12
00:00:46,524 --> 00:00:49,781
where either people
face particular health risks

13
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:52,008
or where they're more likely to take up

14
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,574
and consistently apply a new behavior.

15
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,695
Today we'll look at some
examples of this approach

16
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:01,045
in schools and integrated
with health interventions.

17
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,285
There's been a lot of interest

18
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:08,151
in improving water, sanitation
and hygiene in schools.

19
00:01:08,946 --> 00:01:11,955
One reason is that many children
suffer from diarrhea

20
00:01:11,955 --> 00:01:14,631
and other diseases related to poor wash.

21
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,647
Another argument is that
inadequate wash facilities

22
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:21,371
prevent students, especially girls,

23
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,726
from attending and completing school.

24
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:28,359
If there are no latrines and girls
can't urinate privately during the day,

25
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,662
they may simply not go at all.

26
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,757
School boys, on the other hand,

27
00:01:32,757 --> 00:01:35,430
often have no problems
urinating in the open.

28
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,795
It is somehow more acceptable
in many cultures for boys than girls.

29
00:01:40,804 --> 00:01:43,885
Finally, a third argument
for wash in schools

30
00:01:43,885 --> 00:01:47,625
is that by reaching children
when they are young and impressionable

31
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,799
good habits can be established
which will last a lifetime.

32
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:55,069
So there are many reasons
to work with wash in schools

33
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:56,805
and there are more and more examples

34
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:01,816
of combining and integrating
HWTS with school settings.

35
00:02:02,507 --> 00:02:06,356
Demand is generally created
through school level demonstrations

36
00:02:06,356 --> 00:02:09,240
which may involve water quality testing

37
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,071
to demonstrate
the effectiveness of treatment,

38
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,092
and in some cases, children are asked

39
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,962
to bring some messages
back to their homes,

40
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:21,160
or for example, to demonstrate
SODIS to their parents

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,564
in an effort to stimulate demand
within the broader community.

42
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,759
School interventions
tend to be supported technically

43
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,790
by a NGO or other development partner,

44
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,022
but in at least the initial phases,

45
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:39,927
but there's always close collaboration
with the relevant government partner,

46
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,935
such as the ministry of education.

47
00:02:42,926 --> 00:02:45,958
Costs are generally
not recovered from the students

48
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:49,789
and schools themselves
usually require financial support,

49
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:51,846
especially during the startup phase,

50
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,201
but even during routine implementation

51
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:58,463
when financial resources are needed
for operation and maintenance.

52
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,742
The SODIS reference center at Sandek

53
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:05,431
has developed
the Safe Water School Project

54
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:09,610
along with Antenna Technologies,
Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation,

55
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,879
and supported by the Swiss government.

56
00:03:12,128 --> 00:03:14,902
The project launched in 2011

57
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:19,547
and reached 143 schools
in Bolivia, Kenya, and Haiti.

58
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,132
In Bolivia, the project is headed
by the FundaciÃ³n SODIS

59
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,708
and covers all 40 primary schools

60
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:30,397
in Tiquipaya, a city of 50,000
near Cochabamba.

61
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:35,040
The project has recently expanded
into six secondary schools

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,504
and surrounding communities,
as well as a second municipality.

63
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:42,121
The intervention takes
an integrated approach,

64
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,918
covering water, sanitation and hygiene,

65
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:49,810
including different types of HWTS,
mainly SODIS and chlorination.

66
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:55,001
Each school develops a safe
water station for every classroom,

67
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,999
like the one shown here,

68
00:03:56,999 --> 00:04:02,236
and demonstrates both SODIS, you can see
some of the plastic bottles down here,

69
00:04:02,236 --> 00:04:07,219
and chlorination using
electrolytically generated chlorine

70
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:12,270
with a mini-WATA generator
developed by Antenna,

71
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,352
to produce a chlorine solution
from salt and water.

72
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:18,972
The project also trains people
to make their own soap,

73
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:22,120
which is apparently fun,
as well as good for hand-washing.

74
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,730
The safe water school project
is planned and implemented

75
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,156
with local authorities,
in this case, the municipality

76
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:33,307
and the district education
ministry of Tiquipaya.

77
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,844
The project is monitored
at the school level

78
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,861
by safe water committees

79
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,207
with two to three teachers
and ten students per school,

80
00:04:42,207 --> 00:04:45,795
and at the municipal level,
the Fundacion SODIS,

81
00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:48,461
the support NGO, monitors the project.

82
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,418
After the project is complete,
this is taken over

83
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,099
by the district education authorities.

84
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:58,171
A key part of the intervention
is water quality testing.

85
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:02,898
This serves to help monitor
use of HWTS at the schools

86
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,076
as well as to create
demand for safe water.

87
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:10,115
The schools mostly use piped water,
but the supply is intermittent

88
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:14,076
and there is almost always
some detectable <i>E. coli</i> in the water.

89
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:18,898
Here you see a student from one
of those safe water committees

90
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:21,504
testing for residual chlorine

91
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,918
with a safe storage container there,

92
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:29,217
and below, these are some of the <i>E. coli</i>
testing plates that are used.

93
00:05:30,128 --> 00:05:33,544
Students and teachers alike
enjoy the water quality testing,

94
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,933
and it has proven very effective
at convincing people

95
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:39,663
that the treatment
is important and works.

96
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,842
The safe water project provides

97
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,912
initial training
and support for monitoring,

98
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:49,136
but once the program
is well established,

99
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:53,511
the municipality will take over
with the NGO, Fundacion SODIS,

100
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,744
available for technical
support on request.

101
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:01,276
It's hard to measure the impact
of such interventions.

102
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,556
Conceptually, at kind of the top level,

103
00:06:03,556 --> 00:06:06,769
having safer water could lead
to improved enrollment,

104
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:11,287
attendance, and completion of school,
and perhaps better academic performance.

105
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:14,859
One might also expect
less diarrheal disease,

106
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:18,103
though there are many exposures
outside the school environment.

107
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,611
It's perhaps more realistic
to look for improved water

108
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:26,501
and sanitation conditions in the schools
and possibly in the homes of students

109
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,893
and at a minimum,
to have increased awareness

110
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,264
about drinking water quality and wash.

111
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,956
One of the most rigorous evaluations
of wash in schools to date

112
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:40,586
was done by Matt Freeman
at Emory University.

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,713
He and his co-authors
did a randomized trial

114
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,300
in 185 primary schools in Western Kenya.

115
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:52,492
This picture is from a different
wash in schools project, also in Kenya.

116
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:56,539
All of the schools, except for controls,

117
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:00,432
were provided with hygiene promotion
and an HWTS system

118
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:03,417
consisting of safe
water storage containers

119
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:07,339
and a year's supply of WaterGuard
liquid chlorine solution.

120
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,503
Half of the schools were also
provided with additional latrines.

121
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:17,426
If schools did not have a year-round
water source within one kilometer

122
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:20,623
and no improved water source
within two kilometers,

123
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:22,788
they were considered water scarce

124
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:27,549
and the project provide them
with a new water supply facility,

125
00:07:27,549 --> 00:07:30,730
either a bore hole
or a rain water harvesting tank.

126
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,618
At a follow-up visit six months
after the intervention,

127
00:07:35,618 --> 00:07:38,891
all of the schools,
including the control schools,

128
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:42,129
had better access to improved
sources of drinking water

129
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,510
and about two thirds of water samples
included residual chlorine,

130
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,420
indicating that water treatment
was ongoing.

131
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:54,492
Students reported much greater
availability of drinking water,

132
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:56,774
hand washing water, and soap,

133
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:59,829
which was also confirmed
by the evaluation teams.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,226
There was also a significant
reduction in diarrheal disease

135
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:09,404
by more than 50%, but this was found
only in the water scarce schools

136
00:08:09,404 --> 00:08:11,818
which received a new water source.

137
00:08:11,987 --> 00:08:14,407
So, at least in this one case,
we have evidence

138
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,685
of improved knowledge and behavior,

139
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:18,570
at least after six months,

140
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,156
which may not alone be sufficient
to reduce diarrheal disease burden.

141
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,967
It's a natural idea to link up
HWTS with health interventions.

142
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:33,039
HWTS is, after all,
a health intervention itself

143
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,107
to reduce diarrheal disease.

144
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:38,069
And some of the people
most vulnerable to diarrheal disease

145
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,497
might already be in contact
with the health care system

146
00:08:41,497 --> 00:08:44,814
so reaching them could be
easier and more cost effective

147
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:47,065
through an integrated approach.

148
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:52,348
HWTS promotion may be more credible
when it comes from a health worker

149
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,083
rather than a water engineer or an NGO,

150
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:59,097
and finally, there can be
mutual reinforcements

151
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:03,178
so that not only is HWTS
more effective when paired

152
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:05,053
with another health intervention,

153
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:07,673
but that other intervention
could also benefit.

154
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,537
Otherwise, there would be little reason

155
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:13,674
for them to take on
the additional messages of HWTS.

156
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:18,798
We'll look at two kinds of integration
with health care systems.

157
00:09:18,798 --> 00:09:21,393
First, around child and maternal health

158
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,227
taking the specific example
of antenatal care,

159
00:09:25,227 --> 00:09:29,455
and second, with the context
of HIV/AIDS management.

160
00:09:30,081 --> 00:09:35,018
There are other potential linkages,
for instance, diarrheal disease compounds

161
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:37,935
and is compounded by malnutrition,

162
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:41,706
so there's interest
in integrated interventions there

163
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:45,459
and there are even potential links
with water-related diseases

164
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,199
like dengue fever, since the mosquitoes
that carry the dengue virus

165
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:53,173
like to lay their eggs
in water containers.

166
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,234
A key intervention for vector control

167
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:59,241
is promotion of household
water storage containers

168
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:00,907
with tightly sealed covers.

169
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:03,409
But in the interest of time,

170
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:07,438
today we'll just look
at antenatal care and HIV/AIDS.

171
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:12,538
First, antenatal care, or ANC.

172
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:16,578
This example is from Malawi,
where Population Services International

173
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:19,861
had been marketing WaterGuard since 2002,

174
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,591
but several years on awareness was high,

175
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:25,141
but uptake was still low.

176
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:30,752
In 2007 the Ministry of Health
launched a project to promote HWTS

177
00:10:30,752 --> 00:10:33,930
alongside antenatal care visits.

178
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:38,875
15,000 pregnant women attending
their first antenatal care visits

179
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:42,484
were given hygiene promotion
and free hygiene kits

180
00:10:42,484 --> 00:10:45,050
which included
a plastic bucket with a tap

181
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,287
and samples of WaterGuard.

182
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:51,392
The women were then visited in their homes
afterwards by health workers.

183
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,240
And if they returned to the health clinic

184
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,233
for their second, third
or fourth ANC visits,

185
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:01,219
they were given free WaterGuard refills.

186
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:05,571
They also got refills if they delivered
their baby in a health care facility

187
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:08,138
or made post-natal care visits.

188
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,163
Now, the maternal and child health
care sector in Malawi was very concerned

189
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:16,684
since most women attend
one antenatal visit,

190
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:22,498
but only about 20% complete
the recommended round of four ANC visits

191
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:27,216
and less than three quarters of them
deliver in a health care facility,

192
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:30,611
and less than half make
a timely post-natal visit.

193
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:35,762
The US Center for Disease Control
evaluated the intervention

194
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:41,287
with follow ups one year and three years
after the intervention,

195
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:45,543
which included surprise visits,
testing for residual chlorine,

196
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:49,089
and visual confirmation
of WaterGuard bottles.

197
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,818
After one year there was a tremendous
increase in confirmed use of WaterGuard

198
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:59,030
from one percent to 62%
among the women in the program.

199
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,379
Use of the safe storage containers
was almost 100%,

200
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,989
and the evaluation also
looked at the practices

201
00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:09,184
of close friends and relatives
with young children

202
00:12:09,184 --> 00:12:15,038
and saw a large increase there as well,
up to 27% confirmed use.

203
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:20,889
It seems like pregnancy and childbirth
represent teachable moments

204
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,650
when mothers are very concerned
about the health of their new child,

205
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,245
there are a lot of changes,
and they're changing many behaviors.

206
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:32,614
If you are a parent, you know very well
that once you have children,

207
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:34,412
especially your first one,

208
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,591
you change a lot
of your routine behaviors.

209
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:39,027
And that is an understatement.

210
00:12:39,232 --> 00:12:44,128
Anyway, those same households
were revisited two years later,

211
00:12:44,128 --> 00:12:47,679
and while there was a substantial
decline in confirmed use

212
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,704
among both direct participants
and the close friends and neighbors,

213
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:56,321
these numbers still represent
fairly high sustained use.

214
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,373
Qualitative research confirmed

215
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:03,741
that the health care workers
that were involved in promotion

216
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,713
were considered to be
highly credible by the women

217
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:11,670
and that this influenced them
to continue using HWTS.

218
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:16,494
What is very interesting about this study
is that the women who were enrolled

219
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:19,577
were much more likely
to return to the health clinics

220
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:21,646
for repeat ANC visits.

221
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:26,359
More than half of the women
completed the full four ANC visit cycle,

222
00:13:26,359 --> 00:13:30,158
90% of them delivered
their babies in a health clinic,

223
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:34,615
and 90% also made
a postnatal checkup within six weeks.

224
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:38,144
These numbers are much higher
than average for that region.

225
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:43,864
This HWTS intervention turned out
to be extraordinarily effective

226
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,054
for the maternal and child health people,

227
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:50,933
not only for those more concerned
about water and diarrheal disease.

228
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:55,889
And where both parties benefit,
integration is much more likely to succeed

229
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,457
and this pilot has since
been scaled up in Malawi.

230
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:04,674
If one's strategy in optimizing
health gains from HWTS

231
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,704
is to target the vulnerable,
it makes a lot of sense

232
00:14:07,704 --> 00:14:10,566
to work with interventions on HIV/AIDS.

233
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,339
People living with HIV have
weakened immune systems

234
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:15,917
and are particularly vulnerable

235
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:19,008
to infections, including
water-borne diseases.

236
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:22,385
They may become sick
with lower pathogen loads,

237
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:25,691
and an infection that could be minor
in a healthy person,

238
00:14:25,691 --> 00:14:27,265
can be life-threatening.

239
00:14:27,866 --> 00:14:30,962
Cryptosporidium is a particular risk,

240
00:14:30,962 --> 00:14:35,635
and a recent review of people living
with HIV/AIDS in low resource settings

241
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:40,603
found Crypto to be the most common
waterborne pathogen causing diarrhea

242
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,099
and was a significant cause of mortality.

243
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:49,740
So, HWTS has been recognized to be
an important element of preventative care

244
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,852
for people living with HIV/AIDS.

245
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:55,050
While there are not
many studies out there yet,

246
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,406
there is increasing evidence
that HWTS uptake is higher

247
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:06,051
in interventions with people with HIV/AIDS
than in conventional interventions,

248
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:10,016
and that there is significant reduction
in diarrheal disease.

249
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,644
There are even a few studies showing

250
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,901
that HWTS may slow
the progression of AIDS.

251
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:20,313
One study, for example,
found that people with HIV

252
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,569
who received
an insecticide-treated bed net

253
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:28,327
and a Life Straw water filter,
experienced less severe drops

254
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:33,818
in their CD4 count, which is an indication
of the severity of the disease.

255
00:15:34,187 --> 00:15:40,110
Participants were 27% less likely
to have their CD4 counts drop

256
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,202
to a critical level
within the study period.

257
00:15:44,551 --> 00:15:47,042
Here's an example
of an integrated intervention.

258
00:15:47,505 --> 00:15:50,401
I'd like to thank Rachel Peletz
for this example

259
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,279
and for the use of her photos.

260
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,484
Rachel conducted
a randomized control trial

261
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:57,206
in peri-urban Zambia,

262
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,872
which enrolled 120 households
with children under age two,

263
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:07,163
including 100 HIV positive mothers
and 20 HIV negative mothers.

264
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,817
Half of the households were provided
with a water filter

265
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:14,976
and safe storage container
and the other half were used as controls,

266
00:16:14,976 --> 00:16:17,503
though after one year,
the control households

267
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,322
also received the intervention.

268
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,844
Here you see the water filter,

269
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:25,942
and by now, can you all tell me
what kind of filter this is?

270
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,725
Post it on the discussion forum.

271
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:33,344
Participants were trained
by the project field workers

272
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:36,162
who made monthly
follow-up visits for a year,

273
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,362
after which the control households
received their filters.

274
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:45,236
Then, a final follow-up visit was made
two years after the initial distribution.

275
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:47,717
Follow-up visits were unannounced,

276
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:53,702
and involved water quality testing
as well as recording of diarrhea

277
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:55,853
and reported use of the filter.

278
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:59,552
In addition, an objective
nutritional measure was used

279
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,418
called the Weight for Age Z-score.

280
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:07,880
Throughout the evaluation period
filter use was extremely high.

281
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:12,215
People reported using
the filter in 96% of visits.

282
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:17,338
This was confirmed by the field workers
in around 85% of visits.

283
00:17:17,655 --> 00:17:20,694
On the very last visit,
after two years of use,

284
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:25,425
92% of households were confirmed users.

285
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,158
Of the people who reported
using the filters,

286
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:33,586
95% reported not using any other source
of drinking water in the last two days,

287
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,291
either for the mother or for the child,

288
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:39,813
and these are very high numbers
compared to other studies.

289
00:17:40,188 --> 00:17:43,359
They could have been even higher
except that two of the filters

290
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,961
were eaten by rats,
the plastic tubing part.

291
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:53,526
So, the evaluation found that the filters
showed more than two log removal

292
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:56,821
and here it's likely that there were
detection limit problems

293
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:59,302
preventing measurement of higher LRV's.

294
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:04,852
You see, if the raw water
contains 100 CFU per 100ml,

295
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:09,625
and you measure
less than one CFU per 100ml,

296
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:13,001
all you can say is that there was
at least two log removal.

297
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,506
You don't know if it's three
or five or nine log.

298
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:19,090
If you compare
the geometric means of water

299
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,346
in intervention and control households,

300
00:18:21,794 --> 00:18:25,689
you can see something like
two orders of magnitude difference.

301
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,408
The evaluation also found

302
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:31,535
more than a 50%
reduction in diarrheal disease

303
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,513
which again, is high
compared to other studies,

304
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,956
and also found that people
consuming more contaminated water,

305
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,886
more highly contaminated water,

306
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,560
experienced a higher risk of diarrhea.

307
00:18:44,293 --> 00:18:46,866
However, they didn't find
any significant difference

308
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:49,189
in the Weight for Age Z-score.

309
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,906
This module has drawn heavily
on a few scientific studies

310
00:18:53,906 --> 00:18:57,147
and you can find the full articles here.

311
00:18:57,147 --> 00:18:59,741
Many of them are freely available online,

312
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:03,310
and the PDF version of this lecture
has the hyperlinks for you.

313
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:08,876
These are more general resources
which were very useful

314
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,959
in putting together this module.

315
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:15,679
Again, the PDF's include the hyperlinks
for all of these reports.

316
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:19,480
So to summarize, there's a lot of interest

317
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,496
in integrating HWTS promotion
with other interventions.

318
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:27,207
There may well be a better chance
at realizing health gains

319
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:31,342
because it is easier to reach the people
at the higher risk of infection,

320
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:35,667
and because those people might trust
the people delivering the message more

321
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,588
if they're respected figures,
like teachers or health care workers.

322
00:19:40,143 --> 00:19:42,703
It's also more cost-efficient
to reach these people

323
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,233
by bundling interventions
into an integrated package.

324
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:50,917
There is suggestive evidence
and a lot of enthusiasm so far

325
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,742
for integration into school programs

326
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:58,789
but there's stronger evidence that shows
that when HWTS is integrated

327
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,218
into other health initiatives,

328
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:04,880
both objectives can have
a better chance of success.

329
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:07,585
In the next module
we'll look at another kind

330
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:13,104
of targeted application of HWTS,
which is Emergency Response.

331
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,051
This module will be given
by guest lecturer Dr. Daniel Lantan

332
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,713
from Tufts University in the USA.

333
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,548
Don't miss it!
