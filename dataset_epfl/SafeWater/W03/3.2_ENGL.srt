1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,390
Hello, in this module we're still talking
about disinfection techniques.

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,920
Today we'll look at ultraviolet radiation
for use at the household level.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,020
We'll look at both artificial radiation,

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,720
which needs electricity and lamps to
generate

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,510
the energy, and natural radiation, making
use

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,040
of the sun's energy for solar
disinfection.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,680
Ultraviolet radiation is one type of
energy along the electromagnetic

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,340
spectrum, where different kinds of
radiation are defined by their wavelength.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,640
Ultraviolet has wavelengths in the 100 to
400 nanometer range, whereas

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,979
the visible light is in the 400 to 700
nanometer range.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,230
If we zoom in on this range we can define
some subcategories.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,790
The lowest wavelength we call vacuum UV.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,120
It only exists in the vacuum.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,260
But then we have UV-C, or deep
ultraviolet,

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,890
where the germicidal peak at 260
nanometers is found.

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,916
Then you've got UV-B and UV-A shading

17
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:09,990
into the visible light spectrum from
400-700 nanometers.

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,310
Now in order to describe the efficacy of
UV light against

19
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,180
different types of pathogens, we need to
first define the dose.

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,340
And just as for heat, it's important that

21
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,998
the intensity of the disinfectant and the
time.

22
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:29,260
So for a UV radiation the units use,

23
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,690
in the US they use millijoules for
centimeters squared,

24
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,660
whereas in Europe and other parts of the

25
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,870
world the preferred units are joules per
meter squared.

26
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,750
Now DNA absorbs ultraviolet light in the
200-300 nanometer range,

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,310
and it has a large peak at 260 nanometers
in the UVC range.

28
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:57,990
So most of the commercial systems target
this wavelength then.

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,160
And UVC has been shown to be most

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,020
effective against bacteria followed by
protozoa and cysts.

31
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,790
And then, finally, against viruses and
bacterial spores, where you,

32
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,790
you need a bigger dose to inactivate those
kind of pathogens.

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,390
Typically, a dose, might be 400 joules per
meter squared, or 40 millijoules

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,930
per centimeter squared to get good removal
of even viruses and bacterial spores.

35
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,340
Here you see a graph of the efficacy of
UVC against different kinds of pathogens.

36
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,739
Here we've got the dose, and the log
inactivation, or LRV on the other axis.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Well the first thing you can see, is that
E. Coli

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,290
is very readily killed by
ultraviolet, very steep curve.

39
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,660
And total coliforms are related, bacteria
are

40
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,979
also fairly quick to die, exposed to UV.

41
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,400
Rotavirus takes a little bit more time to
kill.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,300
But it's the Bacillus subtilis spores that
takes the longest time.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,090
Now, I mentioned that there was a standard
dose

44
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,480
of around 40 Millijoules per centimeter
squared, that's about there.

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,250
So we can see that at this level you would
be having, you know, more than four

46
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,650
log removal of bacteria, almost four log
removal of rotavirus.

47
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,340
But only about one, a little bit more

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,060
than one log removal of the Bacillus
subtilis spores.

49
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,005
There are a number of different ways to
generate

50
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:36,075
UV-C radiation using lamps, which of
course require electricity.

51
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:42,940
Low-pressure mercury lamps emit light in a
very narrow wavelength band of

52
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:49,440
around 254 nanometers, which is close to
that DNA absorption peak of 60.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,060
So, this is a very effective way to target
DNA.

54
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,770
Medium pressure lamps generate a broader
spectrum of UV-C, so not only the DNA

55
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:01,600
could be targeted, but proteins and other,

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,910
other kinds of DNA activation could take
place.

57
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,250
And then finally LED lamps are currently
under development.

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,550
These would also be very focused at a
particular wave length but hold out

59
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:19,365
the possibility generating UV radiation at
a lower cost, then mercury lamps.

60
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:24,730
UV-C is very effective in water, it's not
impacted by changes in

61
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:30,990
pH, though turbidity can shield microbes
from the radiation.

62
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,270
There's a modest effect of temperature
where a higher dose is

63
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,900
needed at low temperatures, but it's, it's
not a major effect.

64
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,990
There are many commercially available UV-C
systems

65
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,670
used primarily in middle or high income
countries.

66
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,830
Kitchen scale systems with a small UV
lamp.

67
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,800
And there's some interesting research into
developing versions of UV-C

68
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,680
treatment that would be suitable for low
to middle income households.

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,710
Here's one example, the Mesita Azul, which
was developed in

70
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,640
laboratory at Berkeley University and
trialed in Baja California, Mexico.

71
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:19,276
It consists of a small UV-C lamp that does
need electricity, that outputs 1200 Joules

72
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:25,670
per meter squared, us so three times that
conventional range of 400.

73
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,600
And there's a, a, a kit reservoir, where
water

74
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,530
drains by gravity through the UV tube into
a receptacle.

75
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,910
And along the way it passes in a channel
here,

76
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,750
underneath the UV lamp, that's not in
direct contact with the

77
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,870
glass but it's a thin layer so that the UV
can,

78
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,760
can come in contact with all the pathogens
in the water.

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,120
The flow rate is pretty high, about five
liters per minutes in the system.

80
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,060
A recent evaluation found that it was very
effective in

81
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,800
the field, water quality was better than
the same household before

82
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,880
the intervention, that are also then
controlled household, and better than

83
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,530
household that were using other kinds of
disinfection like commercial filters.

84
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,565
However, the exclusive use is pretty low,
that only about 40% of household.

85
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,760
While the Mesita Azul system is still

86
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,870
under development, there is another UV
disinfection process

87
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,910
that has been research extensively over
the past

88
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,090
30 years, both in laboratory and field
settings.

89
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,820
And this is called solar disinfection.

90
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,290
Solar disinfection works simply by taking
a clean plastic bottle, a PET

91
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,670
bottle, and filling it with water and then
lying it on a

92
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,590
flat service, maybe a rooftop, and
exposing it to natural sunlight for

93
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,720
at least six hours, or if it's a cloudy
day for two days.

94
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,919
After the sunlight exposure, the water is
safe to drink.

95
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,860
This SODIS technique then has been applied
in more than 20

96
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,470
countries and more than five million
people are using it today.

97
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,990
For more information about SODIS, visit
the

98
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,960
Swiss website www.fundacionsodis.org for
application in Latin America.

99
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,040
Now, solar disinfection doesn't make use
of UV-C radiation, and that's because

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,110
as sunlight passes through the atmosphere,
all of the UV-C

101
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:34,430
and even about 90% of the UV-B is absorbed
by

102
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,085
ozone, water vapor, oxygen, and carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

103
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:43,660
UV-A radiation is less affected by the
atmosphere.

104
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:49,218
Therefore the UV radiation reaching the
earth's surface is

105
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,530
largely composed of UV-A with a small UV-B
component.

106
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,472
Clearly then SODIS has to work differently
than UV-C

107
00:07:56,472 --> 00:08:01,640
disinfection since UV-C isn't reaching the
earth's surface, thankfully.

108
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,280
And it does so with three main mechanisms.

109
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,470
First is UV-B radiation can still directly
inactivate cells.

110
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,850
It won't be absorbed so much by the DNA
but

111
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,800
other components within the cells, perhaps
proteins, enzymes, can be affected.

112
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,830
However, the plastic bottles used for
sodas, PET, remove much of the UV-B.

113
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,460
So on the special bottles I used, this is
probably a minor effect.

114
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,350
A more important effect is thought to

115
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,068
be indirect in activation through UV-A
radiation.

116
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,950
Where the UV-A is absorbed by some

117
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,230
intermediate species, and then goes on to
create

118
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,970
reactive oxygen species like hydroxyl
radical or hydrogen

119
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,499
peroxide, which cause the damage to the
microbes.

120
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,400
Those, reactive oxygen species could be
generated inside the cell if the cell

121
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,190
contains chronoforms, which are typically
present in bacteria, bacteria cells.

122
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,870
Or it could be external through, dissolved
organic matter, matter or dissolved iron.

123
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,820
And then finally, heat can play an
important role.

124
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,290
Of course, if the temperature gets up to
60

125
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:17,160
or 70 degrees, we're entering the realm of
pasteurization.

126
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,500
But even at 50 degrees, there seems to

127
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,800
be some synergy along with the effects of
radiation.

128
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,180
There are a number of factors that
influence how effected SODIS can be.

129
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,240
First around the radiation itself the sun
height is

130
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,320
important, and the higher the sun is the
higher the

131
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,110
UV radiation level and this varies with
the time

132
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,770
of day of course but also the time of
year.

133
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,790
So the maximum levels occur at noon during
the summer.

134
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,640
The latitude is also important radiation
does not fall equally on the earth.

135
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,420
And there are two belts from 15 to 35
degrees in the

136
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,750
Northern Hemisphere, and in the Southern

137
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,370
Hemisphere, where radiation is at a
maximum.

138
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,480
Also, the belt between 15 degrees north
and 15 degrees south has

139
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,490
quite high solar irradiance, and it's a
good zone for practicing SODIS.

140
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,440
Altitude at higher altitudes there's more
radiation, UV levels

141
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,660
increase by about 10% for every 1,000
meters in altitude.

142
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,355
Ozone in the atmosphere does reduce UV and
ozone can vary

143
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:31,720
specially it can vary over the year and
even across the day.

144
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:39,420
The ground can also reflect ozone, this is
more important maybe for, for sunburns.

145
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,240
But think about a rooftop reflecting
radiation back into a SODIS bottle.

146
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,410
And then finally the depth of water in a,
a water bottle.

147
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,650
It's important, because UV radiation is
attenuated by water.

148
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,380
So, if the bottle were too large and the
water column were

149
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,780
too, too thick, then UV wouldn't penetrate
to the center of the bottle.

150
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,010
Also characteristics of the water are
important.

151
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:14,000
When the water temperature reaches 50
degrees or so there's a

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,240
synergy and only about one hour of UV
exposure is needed.

153
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,590
However, turbidity can negatively impact
SODIS and

154
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,320
if the turbidity is higher than about

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,080
30 NTU, it's advised to pretreat the

156
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,240
water with filtration or perhaps
coagulation and sedimentation.

157
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,470
With all of the factors that can effect
SODIS disinfection, it's

158
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,020
not surprising that evaluations have shown
a range of removal values.

159
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,663
Most of the studies have been on bacteria,
especially E. Coli

160
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:53,310
and these tend to find three to five log
removal units.

161
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,580
Sequence studies have shown that
Salmonella is more resistant than E. Coli,

162
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:04,000
and that Shigella and Vibrio cholera are
relatively susceptible to ultraviolet.

163
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,810
Studies on protozoa have shown slightly
lower removal from two to four log units,

164
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:18,030
and both Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium
spores have been shown to be inactivated.

165
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,530
There are relatively fewer studies of
viruses.

166
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,240
The methods are more difficult, and they
show a greater

167
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,790
range of one to more than five log removal
values.

168
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,880
Where we see that certain viruses like
Adenovirus and

169
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,940
the, the indicator virus phi are quite
resistant to ultraviolet.

170
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,460
Adenovirus is also resistant to UV-C
treatment and other viruses,

171
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,670
the human echovirus and the indicator
virus MS2 phage

172
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,140
are relatively easier to, to disinfect
with SODIS.

173
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,160
One of the countries with the longest
history of SODIS is that Bolivia, where

174
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,830
since 2001, Eawag and the Fondacion Sodis
have been promoting solar disinfection.

175
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,820
First with pilots in Cochabamba, and then
with

176
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,330
broader uptake through NGOs, through
health ministry, through schools,

177
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:21,490
health professionals and women's groups,
and Eawag estimates that

178
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:24,920
more than 700,000 people use SODIS
routinely in Bolivia.

179
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:32,580
However a 2009 evaluation in Bolivia found
that among those who had received SODIS

180
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,900
training only about a third of them were,
were routinely using SODIS treatment.

181
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,840
Concerns have been raised about exposing
plastic

182
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,950
materials to the sun for water treatment
because

183
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,370
of the risk that some chemicals present in
the plastic could leech into the water.

184
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,430
Now antimony, is a chemical that's used as
a catalyst in

185
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:00,070
the production of PET, but antimony only
leeches into water at

186
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,650
appreciable levels when the water's in
contact with the plastic for

187
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:09,669
many weeks, or longer or if the
temperature exceeds 70 degrees Celsius.

188
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,860
Now this doesn't happen during SODIS
treatment since treated water is only in

189
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,350
the bottles for a few days and the
temperatures rarely exceed 50 degrees.

190
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,560
Adipates and phthalates are used as
softeners in the

191
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,580
production of certain types of plastics
and packaging materials.

192
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,400
For example PVC, which is used in plastic
pipes.

193
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,120
And although these softeners are not
particularly toxic, they do

194
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,090
represent a threat to health if they're
consumed in large quantities.

195
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,720
However, adipates and phthalates are not
needed in the production of PET.

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,700
So they cannot leach from PET bottles into
water.

197
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,000
Aldehydes are formed when the plastic is

198
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,950
heated in the manufacturing process for
PET bottles.

199
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,440
A laboratory investigation of the
diffusion of aldehydes from PET bottles

200
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,560
into water found that exposure to the sun
has no effect on the

201
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,670
concentration of aldehydes that could be
measured, especially for acetaldehydes.

202
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,250
Though the concentration of formaldehydes
does increase with the length of exposure.

203
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,630
However the concentrations of these
aliphatic aldehydes remained far below

204
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,310
the state regulatory limit for drinking
water in all samples.

205
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,200
Formaldehydes and acetaldehydes can be
used can

206
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,530
be problems for bottled carbonated water
because the

207
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,890
higher pressure and lower pH within those

208
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:47,200
bottles can result in aldehydes in stored
water.

209
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,810
But again since the pressure and pH are
more moderate in SODIS' treatment,

210
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,880
these chemicals are not found at levels of
concern in SODIS treated water.

211
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:01,290
Then we have bisphenol A, a chemical
present in

212
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:05,760
some plastic bottles, that is suspected to
cause breast cancer.

213
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,280
But, bisphenol A is only an

214
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,160
issue with polycarbonate bottles,
polycarbonate plastic,

215
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,630
and not in the PET bottles that are most
commonly used for SODIS.

216
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,680
Another approach to assessing chemical
safety of water is not to look for

217
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:28,140
specific chemicals but to see if exposure
to the water results in

218
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:34,100
mutations in certain plants or protozoa,
or bacteria cells.

219
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,230
So this is a genotoxic approach to
water safety assessment.

220
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,550
And some of these genotoxic studies have
found that when water is stored in

221
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,450
plastic bottles for long periods of time,

222
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,690
like several months, cell mutations could
be observed.

223
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,520
But this happened with or without exposure
to UV radiation.

224
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,880
So while it might be an issue for long
term

225
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,480
storage and plastic bottles, it's not
directly pertinent to SODIS.

226
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,340
And this is similar to what we've seen in
those

227
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:13,070
studies looking at leeching of other
chemicals, various chemicals.

228
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,100
And since SODIS involves neither long
storage time

229
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,530
nor high temperatures, studies at Eawag
and other

230
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,440
institutes have not found any evidence
that SODIS

231
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,520
introduces any harm for chemicals to
treated water.

232
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,970
For more information, visit the
publications

233
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,770
page at the SODIS reference center.

234
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,070
The link is shown on the page.

235
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,830
So some considerations then for UV
treatment are

236
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,300
that, first, it's highly effective, both
UV-C and SODIS.

237
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,490
Though UV-C being more powerful energy is
more effective, especially against

238
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,990
viruses and protozoa, and both UV-C and
SODIS are limited to

239
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,118
low turbidity waters because particles can
shield pathogens from the radiation.

240
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:05,050
Furthermore, UV-C does require
electricity to run the lamps.

241
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,240
If we look at SODIS, some advantages are
that it's very simple to operate.

242
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,520
It's also quite inexpensive.

243
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,570
You need plastic bottles but not much
more.

244
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,700
However, it's highly dependent on the
climates, both in terms

245
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,530
of daily and seasonal variations and
different effects in different regions.

246
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,860
And it does take a significant amount of
time more in

247
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,320
the treatment than in the actual work done
to fill bottles.

248
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,750
An advantage of SODIS is that there's

249
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,890
quite a low risk of re-contamination
because water

250
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:41,780
is typically drunk from the same container
where

251
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,650
it's been treated, so less chance of
re-contamination.

252
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,180
However, it's only small volumes of water
that can be

253
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,720
treated at a time in a batch of SODIS
treatment.

254
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,050
In summary then, we've seen what
ultraviolet radiation is

255
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:03,490
today and how it works against different
classes of pathogens.

256
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,350
We've seen how UV-C intervention works and
how

257
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,290
they can be adapted for household water
treatment.

258
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,320
Currently most of the experience there is

259
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,700
in middle and high income setting but
there's

260
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,800
potential for application in low and
middle

261
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,020
income settings, especially as LED lamps
come out.

262
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:27,030
And we've seen the must more widespread
practice of solar disinfection, SODIS,

263
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,580
how that works and how it is being applied
in many countries in the world today.
