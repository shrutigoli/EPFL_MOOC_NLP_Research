1
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:09,445
In this module we're going to look at
ceramic filtration, which falls in between

2
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:14,912
sand filtration and synthetic membranes in
terms of pore size and physical exclusion.

3
00:00:14,912 --> 00:00:17,472
Ceramic filtration is hot.

4
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,390
There is tremendous growth in sales of

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,530
ceramic filters in many low income
countries.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,290
Although there are also some drawbacks
which we'll look into, ceramic pot

7
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,960
filters with pots that look little bit
like flower pots are popular

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,910
and can be locally made and there are also
smaller ceramic candle

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,910
filters which can be installed in

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,480
different kinds of water storage
containers.

11
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,020
Here's an animation of a ceramic pot
filter.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,720
Operation is very simple.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,940
The pot is filled with water which then
passes

14
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,630
through the ceramic and into a storage
container below.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,300
This design includes built-in safe
storage.

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,269
And filtered water is collected from a
tap.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,180
Ceramic pot filters don't require any
electricity or consumables.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,870
But they do require periodic cleaning,
especially if raw water is turbid.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,830
Normally this is done by scrubbing with a
small brush.

20
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,270
Ceramic pots can be produced using local
materials.

21
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,479
Though it's not easy to set up a high
quality production facility.

22
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,720
The main ingredient in ceramic filters is
clay, which can be

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,070
sourced directly from local mines or
indirectly by crushing unfired bricks.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,850
Clay shouldn't have too much sand or
organic material in it, and

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,469
usually local potters will know where good
quality clay can be found.

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,320
Clay is mixed with burn-out material to
increase porosity of the finished product.

27
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,114
Usually, organic waste material like
sawdust or ground rice husks can be

28
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:55,349
used with three or four times as much clay
as burn-out material by weight.

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,160
The proportion and size of burn-out
material

30
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,300
can dramatically effect filter flow rates
and efficacy.

31
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,480
Most ceramic filters are coated with this
thin layer of silver just after firing.

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,320
This helps improve the biological
performance of the filter.

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,029
We'll talk more about silver in a bit.

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,180
A few filter factories also add metal
oxides, like goethite or iron-rich

35
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,450
soils like laterite to the mix in order to
improve removal of viruses.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,660
Once the materials are mixed together,
they're pressed into shape.

37
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,620
The flower pot press seen here, is a
common

38
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,370
shape, but oblong and semi-spherical
filters are also widely produced.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,350
Once pressed into pots, the pots must dry
for a

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,110
week or two and then be fired in a kiln.

41
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,870
It takes a bit less than a day to fire

42
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,800
the pots, typically at a temperature of
around 800 degrees Celsius.

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,960
And then around a day for cooling before
the pots can be handled and checked.

44
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,440
Once pots are fired, it's very important
to test every single

45
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,500
pot to make sure there are no cracks or
other defects.

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,860
Quality control begins with visual
inspection and checking to see if the

47
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,890
pot makes a clear bell like sound when it
is tapped or pinged.

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,390
Immersing the pot in water without letting
the water come over the rim, is a

49
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,450
simple kind of pressure test that can

50
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,410
quickly identify cracks that might not be
visible.

51
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,470
A more thorough flow rate test can also
identify cracks

52
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,760
by using a calibrated t-device like the
one in shown here,

53
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,320
which rests on the rim of the pot.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,360
When the pots are then filled with water,
it's possible to

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,030
check how long it takes for the water
level to drop.

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,710
A typical target is around two liters per
hour,

57
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,510
though that depends on the size of the
pot.

58
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,080
Finally, challenge tests can be conducted
to see

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,970
if filters are able to remove bacteria
like E. coli.

60
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,922
Typically, around ten to 20% of filters
will

61
00:04:08,922 --> 00:04:13,410
fail these quality control checks and must
be destroyed.

62
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,670
Factories have to build in this loss into
their business models.

63
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,050
Unfortunately, defective filters can't all
just be ground

64
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,890
up and used in a next production run,

65
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,010
because the clay properties have
irreversibly changed.

66
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,610
However, some factories do include small
amounts of ground

67
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,200
up fired clay, which is called grog, in
production.

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,990
But viruses then, are too small to be
removed through physical straining.

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,210
They can however be removed through
electrostatic attraction.

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,240
Most viruses have a negative surface
charge, and they

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,300
are attracted to positively charged
surfaces such as metal oxides.

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,090
Laterite soil contains high levels of
goethite and iron oxide with a positive

73
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,710
charge and some manufacturers add laterite
soil

74
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,220
to the clay used in filter production,

75
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,650
in order to improve removal of viruses.

76
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,410
However, the effectiveness of this
practice hasn't been rigorously tested.

77
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:18,475
Also, if electrostatic absorption is the
key mechanism in virus removal,

78
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:24,780
there's possibility that absorption sites
could eventually be completely filled up.

79
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,850
Or even that absorbed viruses could be

80
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,060
remobilized due to changes in influent
water.

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,850
In general, virus removal in ceramic
filters is poor and more research

82
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,200
is needed to identify mechanisms that
could lead to better virus removal.

83
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,140
There is a third mechanism for removing

84
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,289
pathogens in ceramic filters through
chemical reactions.

85
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,710
It has been known for thousands of years
that metallic silver

86
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,920
has anti-microbial properties, and it has
become very common to coat

87
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,760
ceramic filters with silver after the
firing process, either by dipping

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,669
filters in a silver solution or by
brushing it onto the sides.

89
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,780
The amount and type of silver applied
seems to be more important than

90
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,450
whether silver is put on the inside or the
outside of the pot.

91
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,720
There's no need to be concerned about
silver leaching

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,700
from the pots and causing human
health problems.

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,570
There is no WHO drinking water guideline
value for silver.

94
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,040
And the amounts that have been measured
leaching from pots are very low.

95
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,120
There have been reports however, that
arsenic can

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,870
leach into filtered water at levels of
health concern.

97
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,000
This has nothing to do with the silver.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,880
It's thought that the arsenic is
naturally present in the

99
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,909
clay and that with time, arsenic leaching
will drop to safe levels.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,740
However, it is important to check

101
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,910
the concentration of arsenic in filtered
water.

102
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,210
The silver seems to have two effects.

103
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,480
First, to increase the
removal of bacteria, and second, to

104
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:09,270
prevent biofilm formation on the ceramic
surface which can reduce the flow rates.

105
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,970
It's thought that silver doesn't have much
impact on viruses.

106
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,180
Two types of silver are used in

107
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,680
ceramic pots: colloidal silver, also
called nanosilver, which

108
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,790
consists of very small particles as the
name

109
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,440
suggests of 100 nanometers or less in
size.

110
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,640
Quick quiz.

111
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,430
How many microns is that?

112
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,880
Go back to science if you don't know.

113
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,090
The interactions on nanosilver and
bacteria are

114
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,510
complex and the subject of active
research.

115
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,440
It does seem that size is important and
that nano

116
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,029
particles may even enter into bacteria
cells and cause internal damage.

117
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,980
It also seems that contact with the silver
surface is important and that

118
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:57,720
release of dissolved silver can't alone
explain all the effects seen on bacteria.

119
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,930
The other kind of silver is ionic silver
created from salts such as silver nitrate.

120
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,690
Actually, silver nitrate is used in
commercial production of colloidal silver.

121
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,670
For example, by the large company,
Argenol,

122
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:19,230
which produces a nanosilver powder branded
as Collargol.

123
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,010
Some ceramic filter factories produce
their own colloidal

124
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,160
silver from silver nitrate in order to
save costs.

125
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,400
However, it's not clear that the locally

126
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,170
produced nanosilver is as effective as
commercial varieties.

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,060
RDI, a leading producer of ceramic pots in
Cambodia that uses silver nitrate,

128
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,230
reports that they create colloidal silver
particles around five microns in size.

129
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,120
Such large particles certainly couldn't
penetrate inside a bacterial

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,790
cell, and might have very different
effectiveness from smaller nanoparticles.

131
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,560
Until the efficacy of silver nitrate

132
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,780
is more conclusively demonstrated, it's
recommended to

133
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,470
use commercial nanosilver products, though
this will

134
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,150
slightly increase the cost of filter
production.

135
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,858
Protozoa are fairly well removed by
ceramic filters

136
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:16,010
with two to five log reduction values
typically seen.

137
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,840
This is mainly through physical size
exclusion processes.

138
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,960
Bacteria, which are a bit smaller, have
somewhat lower reduction

139
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,700
in the range of one to two or more log

140
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,910
reduction values and the calculation of
these can be complicated

141
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,209
by regrowth and recontamination on the
clean side of the ceramics.

142
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:41,450
However, viruses show much poorer removal,
with some studies showing no

143
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,830
removal at all, and others showing one or
maybe two log reductions.

144
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,860
It's thought that the main removal
processes

145
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,320
here are electrostatic rather than size
exclusion.

146
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,020
Ceramic pot filters have been produced for
many years in

147
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,500
Latin America and there are mature
products in markets there.

148
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,910
In the last ten years or so, ceramic pots
have

149
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,090
seen tremendous growth in Cambodia led by
two non-governmental organizations.

150
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:13,340
Resource Development International
Cambodia or RDIC,

151
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,610
and International Enterprise Development
or IDE.

152
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,550
IDE began producing ceramic filters in
2001 and RDI a few years later.

153
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,180
Both NGOs produce their own pots, and sell
them without subsidy through a

154
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,710
variety of distribution channels including
direct sales,

155
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,530
sales to vendors, and sales to NGOs.

156
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,390
The price is typically around eight to 15
U.S. Dollars.

157
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,856
And in recent years, IDE has partnered
with the U.S.

158
00:10:44,856 --> 00:10:48,980
NGO PATH to produce a more
aesthetically pleasing model, shown here.

159
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,710
Their main model is called the Tunsai,
which is Khmer for rabbit.

160
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,628
And their new model is the Super Tunsai.

161
00:10:56,628 --> 00:11:00,216
Although the Super Tunsai costs almost
twice as much as

162
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:04,890
the regular Tunsai, the new model has
considerably stronger sales.

163
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,860
Both RDI and IDE can produce several
thousand filters per month and

164
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,649
each has sold hundreds of thousands of
filters over the last ten years.

165
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,070
In 2007, the World Bank's water and
sanitation program, together with

166
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:29,710
UNICEF, supported an evaluation of the RDI
and IDE filters in Cambodia.

167
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,080
The study contains a lot of really
valuable information, and

168
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,720
I encourage you to read the full report
available here.

169
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,680
A summary of some of the key findings
are that, in total, only 30%

170
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,010
of households, which were randomly
selected, were using

171
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,410
the filters at the time of the visit.

172
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,060
However, this was heavily influenced by
the time since implementation.

173
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,710
Nearly 90% of those who had gotten filters

174
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,530
within the past six months were still
using them.

175
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,260
There was a clear and steady decline of
about two percent per month

176
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:07,820
so that after two years, only about half
of the filters were in use.

177
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,150
The most commonly reported reason for
disuse was breakage,

178
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,980
either of the ceramic element itself or
the tap.

179
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,230
Only about five percent of respondents
reported

180
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,410
slow filtration rates as the reason for
disuse.

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,760
Also, use among those who had paid for a
filter was somewhat higher, at 50 percent.

182
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,420
Those who were actively using a filter,
reported filling the filter

183
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,630
almost twice in a day and cleaning two to
three times per week.

184
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,260
The evaluation found that filters removed
about 70% of

185
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,220
turbidity and had an LRV of 1.7 for
E. coli.

186
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,110
Older filters were not less effective at
E. coli removal in

187
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,510
spite of the manufacture recommendation to
replace filters after two years.

188
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,925
However, given the studied breakage rates,
two years

189
00:13:03,925 --> 00:13:07,200
seems like a good estimate of filter life
time.

190
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,390
Ceramic candle filters like this one, have
long been used in middle

191
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,390
and upper class families often after

192
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,610
boiling to remove calcium and magnesium
precipitation.

193
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,940
These candles can be screwed into metal or

194
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,820
plastic household containers and must be
regularly scrubbed clean.

195
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,040
Conventional candle filters tend to be out

196
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,660
of the price range for low income
households.

197
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,459
But new products like the tulip water
filter are bridging that gap.

198
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,580
A tulip filter consists of just the
ceramic candle element in a

199
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,660
plastic protective housing, connected by a
long tube to a safe storage container.

200
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,130
By using a long tube, the pressure
difference is increased and the

201
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,740
flow rates are higher at around four to
five liters per hour.

202
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,590
Tulip candle filters, unlike ceramic pot
filters, can be backwashed with

203
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,500
a plastic bulb and of course can also be
scrubbed clean.

204
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,250
A big advantage is the small size.

205
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,622
A tulip filter can easily be packaged and
transported without fear of breakage.

206
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:18,210
Tulip has recently produced table top

207
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,700
model, which includes a safe storage
container.

208
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,028
The market isn't as big yet as for ceramic
pot filters.

209
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,780
But several tens of thousands of these
filters have

210
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,569
been sold in a number of low income
countries.

211
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,760
One of the big advantages of ceramic
filtration is

212
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,860
the high social acceptability and fairly
high use rates.

213
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,080
However, those are balanced by moderate
effectiveness especially for viruses.

214
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,020
Most ceramic pot filters include a
in-built safe storage element.

215
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,100
But have a fairly low flow
rate of a few liters per hour.

216
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,020
Ceramic filters involve a one-time capital
cost,

217
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,369
but also need supply chains for
distribution and replacement.

218
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,840
It's possible to produce ceramic pot
filters locally, but the quality can

219
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,800
be variable and it's important to have a
strong quality assurance program.

220
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:21,568
Finally, ceramic filters do visually
improve the water quality by

221
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:26,700
removing turbidity, but they do
not provide and residual protection.

222
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
And there is still the possibility of
recontamination or

223
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,990
regrowth, especially if filtered water is
transferred to another container.

224
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,520
Much of the content from this module has
been taken

225
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,310
from some really excellent resources
which are freely available online.

226
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,240
The first, is produced by the ceramics
manufacturing working group.

227
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,380
And is a best practice recommendation

228
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,230
for local manufacturing of ceramic pot
filters.

229
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,640
The second, is a ceramic water filter
handbook produced by RDI

230
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,770
in Cambodia, and both of them are freely
available on the internet.

231
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:07,330
So in summary, ceramic filtration is a
fast

232
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:11,000
growing and exciting sector within
household water treatment.

233
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,795
Ceramic pot filters can be locally
produced, though

234
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:17,140
it's important to have a strong quality
assurance program.

235
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,470
And there are examples and resources to
help production facilities do that.

236
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,730
Ceramic filtration involves a variety of
removal mechanisms, including primarily

237
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:33,780
physical, but also electrostatic and
chemical with the use of colloidal silver.

238
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,410
However, removal of pathogens is mixed.

239
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:38,640
Protozoa tend to be well removed.

240
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,410
Bacteria fairly well removed.

241
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:44,880
And viruses, not terribly well removed at
all.

242
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,890
Still, ceramic filters are very user
friendly,

243
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,540
and tend to have high user satisfaction
rates.
