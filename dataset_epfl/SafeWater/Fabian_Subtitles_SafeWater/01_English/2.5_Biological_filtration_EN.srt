00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,860
Today's topic is Biological filtration,
still in the filtration stage of HWTS.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,930
The most widely known form of

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,320
biological filtration, is called slow sand
filtration.

4
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,270
And it has been used for centuries to
purify drinking water.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,320
In the past few decades, slow sand
filtration has been adapted for use

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,060
at the household level, where it is most
commonly known as bio-sand filtration.

7
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:35,010
While slow sand filtration is
superficially similar

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,190
to rapid sand filtration, it's actually
quite different.

9
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,360
We saw in the membrane filtration lecture,
that sand

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,070
filtration alone can remove large
particles through size exclusion,

11
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,900
but that pathogens, and even relatively
large protozoa, are

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,750
still smaller than the pore spaces and can
pass through.

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:00,530
Some pathogens will attach to larger
particles, which are removed, and some

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:05,810
pathogens will absorb onto the surfaces of
the sand, due to electrostatic

15
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,210
effects, but rapid sand filtration has
only a small impact on pathogen loads.

16
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,660
Biological filtration includes these same

17
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,670
size exclusion processes and electrostatic
ones.

18
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,840
But critically it also includes biological
activity.

19
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,290
In biological filtration, a biofilm
develops

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,930
on the surface of the filtration sand.

21
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,630
It's not a thick, green, slimy layer that
you

22
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,930
can see, it's a very thin biologically
active layer.

23
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:42,830
And then organisms in this active layer,
this biofilm, can actively

24
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:48,100
consume pathogens that are present in
the untreated water.

25
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,000
And this gives a much greater pathogen
reduction than filtration alone.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,600
Biological filtration is also much slower
than rapid sand filtration.

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,210
And there also tends to be a long
residence time within a filter where some

28
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:12,520
of the pathogens will die-off naturally,
due to lack of food or oxygen.

29
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,270
Or the temperature is not convenient.

30
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,210
Because they're mostly adapted for living
in the

31
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,440
intestines, rather than in sand filter in
someone's house.

32
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,880
Let's look at some design parameters for
conventional slow sand filtration.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,540
Slow sand filtration consists of two main
elements.

34
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,690
One is a bed of packed sand, and the other
is the water column above it.

35
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,170
And both of those tend to be around one
meter in depth.

36
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,460
Where the water column might be from 60 to
120 centimeters, and the sand

37
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,800
bed again, from 80 to 120 centimeters,
maybe as low as 50 centimeters.

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,360
The type of sand that's used in the bed is
important.

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,780
It shouldn't be too big or too small.

40
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,650
It should also be fairly uniform.

41
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:08,750
And often people aim for an effective size
of around .15 to .35 millimeters.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,420
Where the effective size is the D10, or
the

43
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,730
size which ten percent of the particles
are smaller than.

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,600
And a guideline for uniformity is that the

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,810
uniformity coefficient should be around
two or three.

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,120
Where the uniformity coefficient is the
ration of the D90,

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,100
the size of the 90th percentile particle
to the D10.

48
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,190
Slow sand filtration is conventionally
operated in a

49
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,390
continuous flow mode from up to down, with

50
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,330
filtration rates of around ten to 30
centimeters

51
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,080
per hour, occasionally up to 50
centimeters per hour.

52
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,420
It's important that the biologically
active layer the bio film,

53
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,010
should never be allowed to dry out because
it would die.

54
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,200
So, slow sand filters normally have some
kind of flow control, a hydraulic control,

55
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,790
so that he water outlet is higher
than the level of the sand bed.

56
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,630
And it can never run dry that way.

57
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,540
Another thing about slow sand filtration
is that when putting a

58
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,750
new filter online it takes some time for
the biofilm to develop.

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,290
About a month usually, it's called a
ripening period, and then

60
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:30,010
the layer that forms is called a
"Schmutzdecke", or the dirty layer.

61
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,030
Even though that's actually where a lot

62
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,350
of the important pathogen removal
processes take place,

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,890
biosand filtration is basically slow sand
filtration,

64
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,219
scaled down for use at the household
level.

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,160
There are many different designs of
biosand filters available.

66
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,230
This picture is one promoted by CAWST, The
Center for Affordable

67
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,798
Water and Sanitation Technology, and this
is their version Ten biosand filter.

68
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,460
In this version, it has the same elements

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,430
as a conventional slope sand filtration: a
water layer.

70
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,030
Here it's five centimeters deep.

71
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,750
Which they say is optimal for allowing
oxygen to diffuse through.

72
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,060
And then a sand bed, here at 55 cm deep.

73
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,660
And the sand that's used in the household
biosand filter can

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,480
be a little bit larger than a conventional
flow sand filter.

75
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,154
CAWST recommends that the sand should pass
through a .7 ml sieve.

76
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,880
But one of the biggest differences is that
the household biosand

77
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,500
filters operated intermittently with
batches of 12 liters in this design.

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,590
And also, the pour volume in the sand
layer has a volume of 12 liters.

79
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,990
Now, this model also has a hydraulic
control so that the outlet

80
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,770
is here, which is at the five centimeters
level, so the water will never run dry.

81
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,660
And with a cross-sectional area of about
600 square

82
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,020
centimeters and a design rate of 40
centimeters per hour.

83
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,820
That translates to about 400 milliliters
per minute,

84
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,060
which can be treated, or 24 liters per
hour.

85
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,230
So that means one batch of 12 liters
should

86
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,189
take about half an hour to be completely
treated.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,210
Biosand filters are conventionally
available with a

88
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,250
concrete housing such as the one shown
here.

89
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,240
And in recent years plastic housings have
been developed

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,940
that are much more lightweight and easy to
transport.

91
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:45,520
In both conventional slow sand filtration
and biosand filtration, a new filter needs

92
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,490
some time, about a month to

93
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,980
develop the "Schmutzdecke", the biologically
active layer.

94
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,270
Now like membrane filters or ceramic
filters, a

95
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,980
new filter has a pretty high flux rate,
which

96
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,050
slowly decreases over time as the filter
media

97
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:05,709
becomes fouled, as particles get trapped
in poor spaces.

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,670
In membranes or some ceramics flux can be
restored by backwashing.

99
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,500
But that's not done in biosand filtration.

100
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,470
What's done instead is in a conventional
slow sand filter, the top layer is

101
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,502
scraped off and stored for later use,
usually about one to three centimeters.

102
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,310
Because this includes a lot of the
"Schmutzdecke", then there's an

103
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,264
additional ripening period thus needed of
about seven to ten days.

104
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,030
And in a typical slow sand filter, this
type of

105
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,740
cleaning is done every 20 to 60 days;
depending on the

106
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,970
water characteristics and the flow rates
For biosand filters,

107
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,020
a slightly different approach is used, which
CAWST calls swirl and dump.

108
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,990
It's what it sounds like.

109
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:59,640
A bunch of water is added to the inlet and
then manually swirled around,

110
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:07,200
breaking up any dirt that's in the first
few centimeters of sand.

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,710
And then that dirty water is dumped and
removed.

112
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,350
The process may be repeated if the sand's
very dirty.

113
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,130
Because much of the biological
"Schmutzdecke" remains

114
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:21,620
in the sand, the sand isn't removed,

115
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,330
the ripening period is less, and CAWST
recommends just a few days of ripening.

116
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,280
The frequency of such cleaning at a
household level really depends on

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,720
the quality of the water and the amount of
water that's treated.

118
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,620
There's some good operating procedures
which can help to

119
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,140
get the best performance out of a biosand
filter.

120
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,902
One of these is to use a consistent water
source.

121
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:51,120
The "Schmutzdecke" is a collection of
microbes and

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
they get habituated to a certain kind of
water.

123
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,700
So if the raw water is changing from
surface water to ground water or

124
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,070
rain water, these are very different and
the biofilm won't be happy with that.

125
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,560
It's also good if the raw water is not
very turbid, say

126
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,630
less than 50 NTU, because those particles
can clog the filter.

127
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,920
It's important to use the filter each day,
at

128
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,040
least one time and perhaps three or four
times.

129
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,510
When the filter's not used, the dissolved
oxygen in the water can be consumed.

130
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:31,070
And this could be bad for the microbes in
the filter, including

131
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,340
in the "Schmutzdecke" which are important

132
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,850
for good performance of the biosand
filter.

133
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,690
Similarly, it's important to make sure
that the biological layer is always wet.

134
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,550
A "Schmutzdecke" will die if it dries out.

135
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,420
And many of the systems have a hydraulic

136
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,500
control so that the outlet is above the
sand

137
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,140
layer, but still it's important to check
for leaks

138
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,950
and make sure that that sand is always
wet.

139
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,980
Likewise, it's important to check the flow
rate, if

140
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,510
the flow rate is too fast, treatment may
not

141
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,510
be effective and if the flow rate is too
slow it might be time to do a cleaning.

142
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,640
Finally, biosand filtration doesn't give
any

143
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,990
residual disinfectant, so it's important
to collect

144
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,110
the water safely in a safe storage

145
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,000
container and manage it hygienically after
treatment.

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,690
So how well do biosand filters do at
removing pathogens?

147
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,650
Well they work best for the

148
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,710
larger pathogens the helminths and
protozoa, because

149
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:38,710
they're easier to strain out physically or
to absorb onto the, the sand layers.

150
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,290
So typically you'll see more than two log
removal of helminths and protozoa.

151
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,810
And remember, LRV is in this table stand
for log reduction values.

152
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,100
Bacteria slip through a little bit more.

153
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,590
You typically see one to two LRV in a
biosand filter.

154
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:04,990
And viruses are typically not terribly
well removed with maybe about 70% removal.

155
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,780
Being typical, which is less than one LRV.

156
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,030
Some physical and chemical components are
also removed through biosand filters.

157
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:22,371
Turbidity is a nicely removed with about
90% removal, 85 to 95%.

158
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,170
Iron is well removed because it oxidizes
within the filter and

159
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,430
precipitates out on the sand coatings, so
you might see 90 to 95% removal there.

160
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,930
A typical biosand filter will not remove
arsenic.

161
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:45,480
But there is an adapted version which
includes an iron source,

162
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,480
usually iron nails, which is much more
effective at arsenic removal.

163
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
But arsenic removal is complex, and
competing ions, such

164
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,950
as phosphorous and silicon can very highly
effect performance.

165
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:07,080
Finally the filters don't remove nitrate
or nitrite but they can actually increase

166
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:12,520
nitrite by converting ammonia into
the oxidized form, nitrite.

167
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,870
This can cause treated water to exceed
health based guideline values.	

168
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,800
So it's always a good idea to keep an eye
on the nitrogen chemistry.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,140
Look for ammonia, as well as nitrite in

170
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,610
waters that have been treated with biosand
filtration.

171
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,460
Now let's give an example of a

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,480
field application of biosand filters in
Cambodia.

173
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,250
One of the first organizations to work

174
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,180
on biosand filters in Cambodia was
Samaritan's

175
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,740
Purse from Canada, an NGO, in partnership

176
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,500
with two local NGOs, Hagar Cambodia and
CGA.

177
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:55,640
Together, these NGOs have implemented over
100,000 biosand filters since

178
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,080
1999, with a capacity of more than 25,000
per year.

179
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,850
In 2007, an evaluation was made, which was
published in 2010.

180
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,710
This was sponsored by the World Bank's

181
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,270
water and sanitation program and was a
very

182
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:15,160
rigorous epidemiological study that looked
at 105

183
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,210
intervention households from the two NGOs'
working areas.

184
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,940
With 102 matched controls, so they could
tell if any changes

185
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,210
were due to the treatment and not just to
changes over time.

186
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,495
The evaluation found high use of the
biosand filters.

187
00:13:33,495 --> 00:13:37,220
88% of them were in use at the time of
visit.

188
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,190
And of the 12% that weren't in use, the
most common reason was

189
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,519
dissatisfaction with the taste or the odor
or the color of the treated water.

190
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,030
The filters had been, in place for a
median of two

191
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,562
years, and in one case, had been in use
for eight years.

192
00:13:53,562 --> 00:13:58,100
Two thirds of the survey respondents reported

193
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,170
receiving some training from the NGO
workers.

194
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,080
And among those who did receive training,
they were twice as

195
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,520
likely to use the filters as those who
didn't receive training.

196
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,935
Now according to the NGO programs, a

197
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:13,910
100% of people were trained during
distribution.

198
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,710
So either there has been some turnover of

199
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,040
people, or people don't recall having
received the training.

200
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,740
One important finding was that the treated

201
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,180
water was always stored at the household
level.

202
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,370
And you can see from this design that you

203
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,320
need to collect the water in some kind of
storage.

204
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,358
However, about half of people were storing
it in used, open containers like this one.

205
00:14:38,358 --> 00:14:44,230
And about 80% of people were taking water
from the container

206
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,710
using a dipper or other instrument that
could introduce contamination.

207
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:56,580
The evaluation found that E. Coli was reduced,
somewhat by the biosand filters.

208
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,950
If we first think about high risk waters,
which are

209
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,490
considered to be those having at least 100 CFU 

210
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:11,646
E. coli per 100 mls. Well, the raw water, 73%
of samples were in this high risk class.

211
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:16,350
And only 13% of treated water was
considered high risk.

212
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,000
And that was a significant difference.

213
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,080
However, only four percent of the treated
water's samples had

214
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,848
no detectable E. coli, and then would meet
health-based targets.

215
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:33,500
Storage introduced re-contamination or
allowed regrowth.

216
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,370
And almost one third of samples were in

217
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,160
that high risk category in the storage
container.

218
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,390
So on average, there was about one to two
log reduction

219
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:49,950
values, or about 95% E. Coli removal, and
this was highly variable.

220
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,210
It's quite complicated to calculate log
reduction values because

221
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,130
of the large storage volume in the filter,
so

222
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,450
the sample you collect is not exactly the,

223
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,710
same water that you've just poured into
the filter.

224
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,770
And again, stored water did increase E.
coli levels by about 0.8 LRV.

225
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:17,840
The filters did significantly reduce the
turbidity of the raw water by about 80%.

226
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,000
Well let's consider then some of

227
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,980
the advantages and challenges of biosand
filtration.

228
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,220
First, operation is quite simple.

229
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,100
You pour water in and you get filtered
water out.

230
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,760
But it does need regular cleaning, this
swirl and dump method, and the filter

231
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,500
should be left to ripen after cleaning, so
that that is can be a challenge.

232
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,140
The filter in general doesn't change the
taste or the odor of the

233
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,630
water but it does leave filtered water
with a high risk of recontamination.

234
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,780
Especially when safe storage isn't
applied.

235
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,600
Users really appreciate the great
reductions in turbidity, but you should

236
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,740
not expect that the filter has much of an
effect on chemicals, except perhaps iron.

237
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,570
And in fact, nitrogen might be made worse.

238
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:12,659
Ammonia could be converted to nitrites.

239
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:18,610
Biosand filters can be manufactured on
site.

240
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,230
The concrete models at least, but then
those concrete models

241
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,770
are very heavy more than 150 kilograms
when they're full.

242
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,220
So once they're put in place it's very
difficult to move them around. It's

243
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,540
also difficult to transport them to the
household

244
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,850
level if they're collected at a central
location.

245
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,170
There is evidence that the filters are
used for years consistently.

246
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,120
But the same studies have shown that

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,800
the effectiveness in removing pathogens is
rather limited.

248
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,190
This has been just a brief introduction to
biosand filters.

249
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,660
And I'd like to give you some places where
you could find additional information.

250
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,330
First, Manz Water Filters.

251
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,550
David Manz was one of the pioneers in
developing biosand filters in Canada.

252
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,650
And the website has a lot of useful
information.

253
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,670
CAWST, we've used some of their graphics
on this lecture and they have

254
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,120
quite a number of documents and

255
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,650
training materials, construction manuals
on their website.

256
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,750
Samaritan's Purse, which supported the
work in Cambodia,

257
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,670
as well as many other countries, has some

258
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,500
nice documentation on their website,
including a really

259
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,268
nice animation of water passing through
biosand filters.

260
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:45,070
And then biosandfilter.org itself is
another good repository of information.

261
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,290
I'd like to point you also to two

262
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,275
general portals about water including
household water treatment.

263
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:59,960
This is sswm.info, and AKVO, that, both
have good,

264
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:07,060
general information on biosand filters, as
well as other HWTS processes.

265
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,380
So in summary, we've learned about biosand
filtration and how it's

266
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,090
an adaptation of slow sand filtration for
use at the household level.

267
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,550
We've looked at some of similarities and
differences

268
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,250
between biosand filtration and
conventional slow sand filtration.

269
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,980
And have gone over the operation and
maintenance,

270
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,220
including this important step of cleaning
the filter

271
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,780
when the flow gets too low, and allowing

272
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,649
sometime for ripening to re-establish the
efficiency of treatment.

273
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,210
We've gone over some of the advantages and
challenges for biosand filters.

274
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,640
And one of the significant challenges is
definitely only

275
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,130
moderate pathogen removal, one or two log
removal for bacteria.

276
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,970
Less than one log removal, typically, for
viruses.

277
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,680
So, it's best to think of biosand

278
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,850
filtration as a filtration technology, but
not a

279
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,720
disinfection one, and one that should
always

280
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,500
be followed with safe storage, and ideally
disinfection.
