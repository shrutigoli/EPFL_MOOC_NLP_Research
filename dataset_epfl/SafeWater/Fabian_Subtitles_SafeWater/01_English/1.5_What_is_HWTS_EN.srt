1
00:00:04,208 --> 00:00:09,303
HWTS of course stands for Household
Water Treatment and Safe Storage.

2
00:00:09,303 --> 00:00:12,640
Household water treatment uses
some 

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,000
treatment processes which are very similar
to those used

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,400
at larger scales in community schemes or
municipal treatment plants.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,730
These can include pre-treatment steps,
filtration, disinfection,

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,840
Often applied in series to allow multiple

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,410
barriers against pathogens passing through
the system.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,860
So in this module we'll briefly introduce
these processes.

9
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,910
We'll discuss their effectiveness against
different classes of pathogens.

10
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,610
The bacteria,

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,920
the protozoa or the viruses.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,370
Where effectiveness is how well the
process works in

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,500
removing or inactivating or killing the
pathogen under ideal conditions.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,160
Efficiency is something different.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,860
It's how well the process works when it is

16
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,080
actually applied at the field level in
real households.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,390
We'll discuss that more in later modules.

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,260
Today we'll give some brief advantages and

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,790
disadvantages of each of the main
processes.

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,890
Sometimes pre-treatment is required in
household

21
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,820
water treatment or treatment at larger
scales.

22
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,310
If water has a lot of suspended solids in
it

23
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,799
or turbidity, those particles can
interfere with other treatment processes.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,530
At the household level, very simple forms
of pre-treatment can be

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:37,730
done, including rough filtration, through
cloth, or sand filters, or sedimentation.

26
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,660
Either passive sedimentation, letting a
bucket of water sit overnight, so

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,670
solids settle to the bottom, or

28
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,940
assisting sedimentation with a coagulant,
like alum.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,230
Filters are usually efficient at removing
large pathogens,

30
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,980
like guinea worm or protozoa.

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,470
They also usually work well against
bacteria, depending on the design.

32
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:05,440
Some filters are even able to remove
viruses.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,575
But recall that viruses are very small and

34
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:10,149
they can pass through the pores of some
filters.

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,930
Generally speaking, people tend to like
filters.

36
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,460
They're often easy to operate and require

37
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,010
little technical capacity at the household
level.

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,730
Filters normally don't give any strange
taste to water,

39
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,920
and ceramic filters can even cool the
water through evaporation.

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,960
If raw water is turbid from high iron or
other particles, this

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,990
is generally removed, and the treated

42
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,770
water looks much cleaner, which people
appreciate.

43
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,620
Disadvantages of filters include the need
for supply chains, including to replace

44
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,060
broken components and the possibility of
recontamination after filtration.

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,360
Especially if treated water is transferred
to another container.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,480
The most widely practiced household water
treatment process is boiling.

47
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,850
Boiling is highly effective against all
classes of pathogens and people

48
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,920
all around the world understand that
boiling makes water safer to drink.

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,300
And they tend to trust the treatment.

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:16,000
However, boiling can cause health risks,
especially where biomass fuel

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,460
is used, and more fire means more indoor
air pollution.

52
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,820
More fire also needs more fuel, which
costs more money.

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,070
Boiled water can also have a flat

54
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,400
taste, and sometimes chalky precipitates,
formed during boiling,

55
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,379
which doesn't look nice.

56
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,370
And finally, boiled water is very
vulnerable to re-contamination.

57
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,460
Treated water has to be cooled before
drinking, and if this

58
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,255
is done in an open container, there are
good chances for re-contamination.

59
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,480
Ultraviolet radiation is another form of
energy used in disinfection.

60
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,380
Ultraviolet lamps are highly effective
where there's electricity.

61
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,690
But even without electricity, ultraviolet
radiation from the sun can be used.

62
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,160
The solar disinfection system, or SODIS,
involves filing clear plastic bottles

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,039
with water and placing them in the direct
sunlight for several hours.

64
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,160
Different pathogens have very different

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,600
abilities to tolerate ultraviolet
radiation.

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,040
Bacteria such as E. coli are relatively
quickly killed, but Crytoptosporidium

67
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,080
is somewhat more tolerant and some viruses
can withstand high ultraviolet doses.

68
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,900
SODIS is technically easy to implement.

69
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,420
It doesn't require any complicated
supplies

70
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,770
or chemicals and it's very inexpensive.

71
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,800
Other advantages are, that SODIS doesn't
change

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,920
the taste of the water, and that water

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,650
is generally treated in the same container
which

74
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,690
is later used for storage and even
drinking.

75
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,670
So the risk or recontamination is low.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,460
However, SODIS treatment is time
consuming.

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,460
Most commonly, water is cooled overnight
before drinking, and

78
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,240
it can only treat relatively small volumes
of water.

79
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,450
And finally, if the raw water is highly
turbid, suspended

80
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,899
particles can shield pathogens and reduce
the effectiveness of treatment.

81
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,890
The most commonly used disinfectant in
household water treatment,

82
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,790
just like in large scale treatment plants,
is chlorine.

83
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,410
Chlorine can be applied in liquid or
tablet

84
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,620
form, and is more effective with longer
contact times.

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,270
Usually chlorine should be given at least
30 minutes to disinfect water.

86
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,760
Chlorine is very effective against
bacteria, but

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,290
higher doses are required to kill some
viruses.

88
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,520
And some protozoan cysts are highly
resistant to chlorine.

89
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,360
Cryptosporidium cysts can even survive for

90
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,899
short periods in full strength, undiluted
bleach.

91
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,350
One advantage of chlorine disinfection,
which is missing for heat and radiation

92
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,810
disinfection, is that residual chlorine in

93
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,610
the water can protect against
re-contamination.

94
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,230
Chlorination is also easy to apply at the
household level and is very inexpensive.

95
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,940
Large volumes of water can be treated
within relatively short periods of time.

96
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,920
Like ultraviolet radiation this treatment
is less effective on turbid water.

97
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:26,490
Consistent chlorination requires supply
chains and ongoing commitment from users.

98
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,700
And finally chlorine does have a
distinctive taste and an

99
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,800
odor which can be unpleasant if people
aren't used to it.

100
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,440
Now that's a brief introduction to the

101
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,340
main processes involved in household water
treatment.

102
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,940
We'll go into them in more detail in
coming modules.

103
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,680
You have seen though that different
processes have

104
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,780
different levels effectiveness against
different classes of pathogens.

105
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,530
So that means that different household
water treatment processes will

106
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,140
be better suited for different

107
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,790
applications, depending on the local
conditions.
