1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:07,976
Congratulations! 
You've made it to the end of the course.

2
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:10,070
Hopefully Sara and I have encouraged you

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,868
to think critically 
about drinking water treatment issues

4
00:00:12,868 --> 00:00:14,428
in developing countries.

5
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,394
And if you've enjoyed these lectures

6
00:00:16,394 --> 00:00:19,794
please consider signing up 
for Sandec's MOOCs series

7
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:22,477
dedicated to WASH in Developing Countries.

8
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,287
The second course in the series

9
00:00:24,287 --> 00:00:27,695
is dedicated to strategic 
environmental sanitation planning,

10
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:30,019
taught by Dr. Christoph Lüthi.

11
00:00:30,019 --> 00:00:32,014
The third Sandec MOOC is focused

12
00:00:32,014 --> 00:00:34,410
on Solid Waste Management 
in Developing Countries,

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,575
taught by Dr. Christian Zurbrügg.

14
00:00:36,575 --> 00:00:39,551
The final course led by Dr. Linda Strande

15
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:41,936
is on Faecal Sludge Management.

16
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:43,868
You can find each of these Sandec MOOCs

17
00:00:43,868 --> 00:00:46,350
on the course web page periodically.

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,275
Lectures will also be hosted on Youtube

19
00:00:49,275 --> 00:00:51,181
through Sandec e-Learning web page.

20
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:54,341
You can find e-Learning link at sandec.ch

21
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:58,944
In this MOOC on HWTS 
we started off with the "why",

22
00:00:58,944 --> 00:01:01,604
or why treat water 
at the household level,

23
00:01:01,954 --> 00:01:05,678
covering how drinking water 
can be contaminated,

24
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:08,132
what some of the main pathogens are,

25
00:01:08,132 --> 00:01:11,046
and what the resulting impacts 
can be on human health,

26
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:13,702
especially relating to diarrheal disease.

27
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:17,670
You should now have some familiarity 
with the global burden of disease

28
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,090
and know where to get estimates 
about deaths and DALYs

29
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:23,073
from a number of sources.

30
00:01:23,652 --> 00:01:25,595
We then moved to the "what",

31
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:29,815
to see what processes and mechanisms 
are involved in HWTS

32
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:34,595
and how effective these are at removing 
different types of pathogens.

33
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:37,476
After these two modules you should have

34
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,704
a good appreciation of the strengths,

35
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:43,354
as well as the limitations 
of different HWTS options.

36
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:47,522
The last few weeks 
have been more about "how".

37
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:50,852
How can HWTS be effectively 
implemented in the field?

38
00:01:51,339 --> 00:01:55,429
Either through a profit-oriented approach 
or more of a public health approach

39
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:57,579
aiming to reduce disease.

40
00:01:58,312 --> 00:02:00,932
We gave examples of focused interventions

41
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:04,011
targeting particularly 
vulnerable populations

42
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:06,049
and considered the different roles

43
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:08,939
that governments can play in HWTS.

44
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,924
We ended with the discussion 
of Monitoring and Evaluation,

45
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,692
including both validation of technologies

46
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:20,052
and monitoring of HWTS interventions 
and health impacts.

47
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:24,797
Throughout we've only scratched the 
surface of the subjects covered

48
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,342
and we've tried to provide links

49
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:30,552
to more detailed documents and resources,
wherever possible,

50
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:33,572
especially those that are 
freely available on the Internet.

51
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:36,823
If there has been 
one theme through the course,

52
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,313
it is that no single HWTS option

53
00:02:39,313 --> 00:02:43,003
can solve the problems 
of unsafe drinking water.

54
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:46,555
In fact, HWTS should be seen 
as a short term measure

55
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,238
to reduce health risks

56
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:50,691
until safe, sustainable 
drinking water is available

57
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:53,691
at the household level for everyone.

58
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:58,623
Until that time different HWTS options 
can play important roles

59
00:02:58,623 --> 00:03:00,903
depending on the local conditions.

60
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,546
I'd like to thank

61
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:05,106
my guest lecturers, 
Maggie Montgomery from the WHO,

62
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:08,321
Danielle Lantange at Tufts University,

63
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,616
Heiko Gebauer and Caroline Saul from Eawag

64
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:15,556
and Sophie Boisson from the London
School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

65
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:19,408
If you are following the forums,
you got to virtually meet Fabian Suter

66
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,217
and the rest of the supporting team.

67
00:03:21,217 --> 00:03:23,793
They really did an excellent job 
fielding questions,

68
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:26,333
arranging lectures, 
and providing translations,

69
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:29,018
and, of course, we had great 
technical assistance

70
00:03:29,018 --> 00:03:30,908
from the teams at EPFL and Coursera.

71
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:33,631
Finally we would like 
to thank you all, the participants,

72
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:35,414
and especially the hundreds of people

73
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:39,045
who contributed to the conversations 
on the online forum.

74
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:41,810
So best of luck with that final exam,

75
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,390
and we hope to see you again 
in the next MOOC series.

76
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,127
- Good bye.
- Bye.

77
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,365
Oh, that was good. 
Can I get you a drink, Sara?

78
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,090
- Maybe a...
- Water would be great.

79
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,534
- A glass of water.
- Thank you.

80
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,824
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
