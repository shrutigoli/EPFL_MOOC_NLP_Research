1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,210
Well, we've seen the consistent and
effective use

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,800
of HWTS can lead to sizable health gains,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,140
at least where drinking water is
contaminated and

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,420
represents a significant exposure
pathway,but there are lots of

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,450
things that could be done that also reduce

6
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,620
disease burden things like promoting
nutrition or vaccines, for

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,410
example and when policy makers have to
make

8
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,420
decisions about which types of
interventions to invest in,

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,080
they invariably want to know, how much
does it cost. And

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,800
there are many different types of
financial and economic analyses that

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,140
can be made in connection with water and
sanitation interventions. And

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,590
today we'll take a look briefly at a few
of these.

13
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,570
One type of analysis is called a cost
benefit analysis, and here the costs of

14
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,740
the intervention are added up. And are

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,320
weighed against the benefits resulting
from the intervention.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,280
How many dollars of investment does it
take to get how many dollars of benefits?

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,750
This is a money for money kind of
analysis.

18
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,510
A problem with cost benefit analysis is

19
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,000
that the benefits can be difficult to
quantify.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,070
A simpler analysis is to only look at the
costs and consider which among several

21
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,430
different approaches is the cheapest to
achieve a certain desired outcome. This

22
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,150
is called cost effectiveness analysis and
in HWTS, a common measure of the desired

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,020
outcome is the amount of diarrheal disease
prevented measured in deaths or DALYs.

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,450
Either cost benefit or cost effectiveness
analysis can

25
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,129
help policy makers decide how to allocate
scarce resources.

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,115
I'll give a brief example of a third kind
of economic

27
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:53,250
analysis, which is called willingness to
pay or contingent valuation studies.

28
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,170
Like the name suggests, this kind of
analysis seeks to find out how

29
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,230
much people would be likely to pay for a
particular HWTS product or service.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,190
Which can be very useful for social
businesses or profit

31
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,820
maximizing businesses who seek to generate
some revenue from HWTS.

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,440
An important cost benefit analysis was
done by Guy Hutton

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,840
and colleagues, and they looked at five
possible WASH interventions.

34
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,250
Meeting the water MDG target, meeting both
the water and

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:31,290
sanitation MDG targets, universal access
to basic water and sanitation,

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,379
universal basic access along with
disinfection using HWTS

37
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,550
and finally, a higher level of service
regulated piped drinking water and sewage.

38
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,350
The authors calculated the costs of each
of these interventions

39
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,660
in different geographic regions, and also
the benefits and the

40
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,110
benefits here included the reduction in
diarrheal disease both in

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:00,230
terms of incidence and mortality, but also
several economic benefits.

42
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,050
Money saved by not having to manage
diarrheal disease and this could

43
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,210
be money saved by the individual household
or by the healthcare sector

44
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,360
also increased productivity resulting from
improved health and finally, time savings

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,849
from not having to travel long distances
to access water and sanitation facilities.

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,090
The authors found that WASH interventions
were

47
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,890
highly cost beneficial, that the
benefit-cost ratio

48
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:35,315
was above one in all cases and in some
cases, was very much larger.

49
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:42,430
Benefit-cost ratios tended to be higher in
wealthy countries here the letter B means

50
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:49,995
a region with low mortality, and C, D, and
E are increasingly higher mortality.

51
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:58,340
Benefit-cost ratios are higher in
wealthier countries in part because

52
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,609
they are a big time savings and these are
valued more highly in wealthier countries.

53
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,720
The figure shows that this one in the
middle here, the purple one achieving

54
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:18,080
universal basic access with HWTS has a
benefit cost ratio of at least five in all

55
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,560
settings even the highest mortality ones,
and greater than ten in most settings.

56
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,650
In the higher mortality settings, the
benefit-cost ratio is just about the same

57
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,820
of the other two interventions that had
the highest ratios

58
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,150
that's meeting both MDG targets and
achieving universal basic access.

59
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,780
Meeting the water MDG alone doesn't yield
as large

60
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,270
health benefits and achieving universal
access to regulated services

61
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,840
does have big health benefits, but is very
expensive,

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,431
so it has a lower benefit to cost ratio.

63
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,290
Well, how about cost effectiveness
analysis?

64
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,070
This is a little bit easier and lends
itself more

65
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,490
to disaggregated analysis like comparing
one HWTS option against another.

66
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:17,670
Well, the WHO's 2002 World Health Report
included a similar analysis to the

67
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,610
Hutton Cost Benefit Analysis and concluded
that

68
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,728
the intervention which is consistently the
most

69
00:05:24,728 --> 00:05:28,120
cost-effective across regions and would be
classified

70
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,480
as very cost effective in all areas

71
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,338
where it was evaluated, was the provision
of disinfection capacity at point of use.

72
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:42,340
On purely cost-effectiveness grounds, it
would be the first choice where resources

73
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,660
are scarce and as you can imagine, this
report gave a major boost to HWTS efforts.

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,680
Several years later, Tom Clasen at the

75
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,420
London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,960
did another cost effectiveness
analysis, this

77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,340
time looking at differences between
different HWTS options.

78
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,460
He used information from various program
implementers

79
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,830
to calculate the annual cost of different
HWTS

80
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,990
options per person served, and then
compare

81
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,570
this against the cost of conventional
water interventions.

82
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,860
Which in this case was considered as
installing and

83
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,249
maintaining wells, boreholes and communal
tap stands in Asia.

84
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,654
He found that the annual cost of
implementing chlorination or SODIS

85
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:36,730
was under $0.70 per year, $0.66 and $0.63.

86
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:41,712
And that that was cost less than source
improvements which

87
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:46,509
were around under $2.00 or $2.6 per year
in Asia.

88
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:52,320
Filtration and flocculation disinfection
were more expensive than

89
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,680
the interventions at the sources,but you
have to recall

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,460
that improved sources like these don't
necessarily translate

91
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,760
into safe drinking water at the source of
consumption.

92
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,842
The study also calculated the total cost

93
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:10,430
of implementing these interventions for
50% of the

94
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,394
population in the WHO Western Pacific
Region

95
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:16,826
and found that for chlorination and SODIS,
the

96
00:07:16,826 --> 00:07:19,322
benefits to the health care sector were

97
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:22,598
greater than the costs of implementation
and this

98
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:26,654
is actually a limited cost benefit
analysis considering

99
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,540
only the benefits to the health sector,
and

100
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,738
not other benefits like increased
productivity

101
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:35,350
from improved health or time savings.

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,566
The study also reported the annual cost to
prevent

103
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:43,560
one DALY and in all cases, this cost was
low.

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,569
One rule of thumb is that the cost to
avert one DALY, if that

105
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:53,996
is less than the per capita gross domestic
product, it's a very cost effective

106
00:07:53,996 --> 00:08:00,233
investment. So, costs as low as $50, or
$100, or under $200 per DALY averted

107
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,987
are very good investments, and even the

108
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:07,670
more expensive options fall within a
cost-effective range.

109
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,070
Thinking back on the different
implementation strategies, nearly all HWTS

110
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,590
interventions aim to recover at least some
costs from the users.

111
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,750
Public health oriented interventions may
struggle here,

112
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,740
because they may target populations that
have

113
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,270
very little ability to pay and face

114
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,390
multiple competing demands for their
limited resources.

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,900
There's a whole field of study called
contingent valuation that aims to find out

116
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,480
how much people are likely to be willing
to pay for a product or service

117
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,420
especially one that is hypothetical or
doesn't

118
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,742
yet exist,like health impact studies. It's
easy to

119
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:53,180
do a primitive willingness to pay study,
but the results aren't of worth very much.

120
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,530
A properly designed study is complex and
sophisticated, and so

121
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,260
far there are not many good examples for
household water treatment.

122
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,820
However, one significant and sophisticated
study was

123
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,900
done by Jill Luoto and colleagues in
Bangladesh.

124
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,710
In this study, 600 households were given
free two month trials

125
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,390
of each of four HWTS options in rotation,
following a random sequence.

126
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,350
After the trial, people participated in a

127
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,310
bidding auction where they could express
the

128
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,790
maximum amount that they would pay for

129
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,450
a bottle of Aqua WaterGuard liquid
chlorine good

130
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:36,252
for about two weeks of use strips of
Aquatabs chlorine tablets good for ten

131
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:40,600
days,five sachet of PuR enough for five

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,530
days, or one Crystal PuR ceramic candle
filter,

133
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,270
which is similar to the Tulip filter that
we saw in

134
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,030
week two, with an expected lifetime of a
year or more.

135
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,660
The willingness to pay in this study was
found to be extremely low.

136
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,484
A large number of households said that
they

137
00:09:59,484 --> 00:10:01,800
wouldn't willing to pay anything at all
for these

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,490
products nearly half of households were
willing to

139
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,660
pay something like a market rate for the
Aquatabs

140
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,280
and about a third would pay a market

141
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,286
rate for WaterGuard,but only 1% of
households were willing

142
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:19,724
to pay the estimated market price of about

143
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,800
$7.25 for the filter and no one was
willing

144
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,387
to pay the market price for PuR.

145
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:28,080
Now, this low unwillingness to pay isn't
simply

146
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,260
due to lack of demand or concern for

147
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,870
safe water less than a third of people

148
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,299
in the study, did consider their drinking
water safe.

149
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,710
One reason could be the, the poverty in
the study area of urban Dhaka slums

150
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,445
per capita household incomes were well
below

151
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,920
$2 per capita per day purchasing power
parenting.

152
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,630
Another reason could be general lack of
experience with paying for water

153
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,070
or with familiarity with the taste and
odor of chlorine in Bangladesh.

154
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,870
So, this is a good study to look at for

155
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,190
methods and to serve as a reminder that
people may

156
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,150
not be willing to invest their own money
in HWTS

157
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,080
options, even when they consider that
their drinking water is unsafe.

158
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,270
So, that's a very brief run through of
some of

159
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,890
the economic tools that can be used to
evaluate HWTS interventions.

160
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,270
We saw that HWTS does fairly well in

161
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:29,020
a cost benefit analysis with benefit cost
ratios well

162
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,190
above five, and comparable to the other
water and

163
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,190
sanitation interventions having the
highest benefit to cost ratios.

164
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,850
In two cost effectiveness analyses, we saw
that HWTS

165
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,980
can be extremely cost effective in terms
of the

166
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,640
cost to avert DALYs, and that SODIS and
chlorination

167
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,360
are particularly cost-effective options
due to their low cost.

168
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,430
Finally, we saw that in at least one
setting, willingness to pay for different

169
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,190
HWTS options can be quite low even when

170
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,210
the water quality is perceived as being
unsafe.
