1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,320
In this week, the second week of looking
at technologies, we covered the

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,240
disinfection processes including heat,
ultraviolet radiation

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,470
and chemical disinfection in particular
with chlorine.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,499
We also looked at safe storage and
combined systems.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,160
For heat disinfection we started with
boiling, the

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,810
most commonly used household water
treatment practice in

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,120
the world, which is simply bringing the
water

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,360
to 100 degrees if you're at sea level.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,960
And we also looked at pasteurization which

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,100
inactivates pathogens at lower
temperatures around 70 degrees.

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,470
And we showed that both boiling and
pasteurization.

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,270
Are effective against all classes of

13
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:52,125
pathogens and also are unaffected by
turbidity.

14
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:56,350
We learned, what ultra violet
radiation is and what effects

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,390
it has on microbes and looked at the
differences between UV-C.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,645
Which is used in UV applications with
lamps and UV-A and a bit of

17
00:01:07,645 --> 00:01:11,260
UV-B which are involved in solar
disinfection

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,140
using natural solar radiation and plastic
bottles.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,185
We also looked at examples of both of

20
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:23,279
UV-C application and show SODIS in
developing countries.

21
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,600
Next, we looked at chemical disinfection
focusing on chlorination.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,060
We reviewed briefly chlorine chemistry,
the different ways that chlorine can be

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,310
generated or obtained, and applied in

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,990
liquids or tablet forms for household
treatment.

25
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,010
We discussed how chlorine has variable

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,970
effectiveness for different classes of
pathogens.

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,500
It's especially effective against bacteria
such as, E. coli.

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,990
And we looked at the safe water system
developed by CDC and PAHO which includes

29
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,520
a disinfection step along with safe
storage and behavior change communication.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,150
And here you see some examples of the safe
water system being applied.

31
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,860
We considered the need for safe storage,

32
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,190
regardless of what kind of treatment step
is applied.

33
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,950
And looked at the desired characteristics
of a good safe storage container.

34
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,300
We showed you several different examples
of such containers.

35
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,680
And referred to two intervention studies that
looked at the impacts of providing

36
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,764
safe storage containers on household water
quality in two different settings.

37
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,200
Finally, after reviewing all of these
different

38
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,460
processes from sedimentation and

39
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,330
filtration to disinfection,
individually,

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,920
we reminded ourselves that it's important
to have

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,000
multiple barriers to prevent contamination
of water quality.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,830
This is done at a municipal or community
scale,

43
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,950
but can also be done at household scale.

44
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,650
Through informal combinations, such as
this one here,

45
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,340
or commercial formulations, especially the
combination of

46
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,840
coagulation and chlorination or filtration
and chlorination.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,780
Well we've come to the end of the

48
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,400
section of the course that focuses on
technologies.

49
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,550
We've reviewed the various household water
treatment technologies from sedimentation

50
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:28,950
and filtration through different kinds of
disinfection and on to safe storage.

51
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:34,800
We've discussed the effectiveness of these
different steps against different kinds of

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,370
pathogens and given advantages and
challenges

53
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,870
of each of these treatment processes.

54
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,315
Illustrated with real examples from the
field.

55
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:47,250
Well, the technologies are
actually the easy part.

56
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,930
It's not all that difficult, actually to

57
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,010
come up with something that will kill
pathogens.

58
00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:01,360
What's much more difficult is to get that
system rolled out, adopted, taken up in

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,160
the field, and used effectively and
sustainability to

60
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,450
provide safe drinking water at the
household level.

61
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,830
So that's the subject of the remainder of
the course.

62
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,090
And we'll start next week by looking at
different implementation strategies.
