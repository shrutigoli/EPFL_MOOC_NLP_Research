1
00:00:04,025 --> 00:00:06,180
In the last module, we
talked

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,960
about different strategies for promotion
of HWTS.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,650
If the objective is purely to maximize
profit, any

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,070
reductions in disease that result are
nice, but are secondary.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,750
If on the other hand the goal is

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,410
to maximize a social good like reducing
diarrheal disease,

7
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,750
then interventions will often aim to
target the

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,200
most vulnerable populations those who are
consuming unsafe water.

9
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,300
And of course the HWTS technology needs to
be effective and applied consistently

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,780
We've already looked at the base of the
pyramid but a good strategy can

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,800
be to promote HWTS in special settings
where either people face particular health

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,130
risks or where they're more likely to take
up and consistently apply a new behavior.

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,680
And today we'll look at some examples of

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,960
this approach in schools, and integrated
with health interventions.

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,000
There's been a lot of interest in improving
water, sanitation and hygiene in schools.

16
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,430
One reason is that many children suffer
from

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,379
diarrhea and other disease related to poor
wash.

18
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,220
Another argument is that inadequate wash
facilities prevents

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,860
students, especially girls, from attending
and completing school.

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,480
If there are no latrines, and girls can't
urinate privately

21
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,240
during the day, they may simply not go at
all.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,600
School boys, on the other hand, often have
no problems urinating in the open.

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
It is somehow more acceptable.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,690
In many cultures, for boys than girls.

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,430
Finally, a third argument for WASH in
schools, is that by reaching children when

26
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:48,410
they are young and impressionable, good
habits

27
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,460
can be established which will last a
lifetime.

28
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,540
So, there are many reasons to work with
WASH in schools and there

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,540
are more and more examples of combining
and integrating HWTS with school settings.

30
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,430
Demand is generally created through school
level demonstrations which may

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,460
involve water quality testing to

32
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,440
demonstrate the effectiveness of
treatment.

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,710
And in some cases children are asked to
bring some messages back to their homes, or for

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,470
example, to demonstrate SODIS to their
parents, in

35
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,390
an effort to stimulate demand within the
broader community.

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,120
School interventions tend to be supported
technically by an

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,800
NGO or other development partners in
at least

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,160
the initial phases, but there's always
close collaboration with,

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,830
the relevant government partner, such as
the Ministry of Education.

40
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,660
Costs are generally not recovered from the
students, and schools

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,850
themselves usually require financial
support,

42
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,030
especially during the startup phase.

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,160
But even during routine implementation
when financial

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,050
resources are needed, for operation and
maintenance.

45
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:05,550
The SODIS reference center at Sandec has
developed the Safe Water School Project,

46
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,530
along with antenna technologies, Helvetas
Swiss

47
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,380
Intercorporation, and supported by the
Swiss government.

48
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,390
The project launched in 2011, and reached,
143 schools in Bolivia, Kenya, and Haiti.

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,970
In Bolivia, the project is headed by the
Fundación SODIS and covers all 40 primary

50
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,460
schools in Tiquipaya, a city of 50,000
near Cochabamba.

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,910
The project has recently expanded into six
secondary schools

52
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,269
and surrounding communities as well as a
second municipality.

53
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,380
But intervention takes an integrated

54
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,940
approach covering water, sanitation, and
hygiene,

55
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,470
including different types of HWTS,

56
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,730
mainly SODIS and chlorination.

57
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,940
Each school develops a safe water station
for every

58
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,110
classroom, like the one shown here. And
demonstrates both SODIS,

59
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,220
we can see some of the plastic bottles
down here, and chlorination using

60
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,900
electrolytically generated chlorine with
the mini-WATA

61
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,939
generator developed by Antenna to produce
a chlorine solution from salt and water.

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,080
The project also trains people to make
their own soap,

63
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,750
which is apparently fun, as well as good
for handwashing.

64
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,340
The safe water school project is planned
and implemented with local

65
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,200
authorities, in this case the
municipality,

66
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,090
and the district education ministry of
Tiquipaya.

67
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,970
The project is monitored at the school
level by

68
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,170
safe water committees with two to three
teachers

69
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,350
and ten students per school, and at the
municipal

70
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,830
level the Fundación SODIS the support NGO
monitors the project.

71
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,860
And after the project is complete, this

72
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,669
is taken over by the District Education
Authorities.

73
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,940
A key part of the intervention is water
quality testing.

74
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,100
This serves to help monitor use of HWTS at
the

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,040
schools, as well as to create demand for
safe water.

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,400
The schools mostly use piped water, but
the supply is intermittent

77
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,659
and there is almost always some detectable
E. coli in the water.

78
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,570
Here, you see a student from one of

79
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,700
those safe water committees testing for
residual chlorine.

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,400
With a safe storage container there and
below these are

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,110
some of the E. coli testing plates that are
used.

82
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,190
Students and teachers alike enjoy the
water quality testing, and it has

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,560
proven very effective at convincing people
that the treatment is important and works.

84
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,340
The Safe Water project provides initial
training and

85
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,010
support for monitoring. But once the
program is

86
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,340
well established the municipality will
take over with

87
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,090
the NGO Fundación SODIS available for technical
support on request.

88
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,350
It's hard to measure the impact of such
interventions.

89
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,610
Conceptually at kind of the top level,
having safer water

90
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,360
could lead to improved enrollment,
attendance and completion of school,

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,290
and perhaps better academic performance.

92
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,200
One might also expect less diarrheal
disease though

93
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,810
there are many exposures outside the
school environment.

94
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,550
It's perhaps more realistic to look for
improved water and sanitation

95
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,380
conditions in the schools and possibly in
the homes of students.

96
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,050
And at a minimum to have increased

97
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,150
awareness about drinking water quality and
WASH.

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,050
One of the most rigorous evaluations of
WASH in schools

99
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,410
to date was done by Matt Freeman at Emory
University.

100
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,850
He and his co-authors did a randomized

101
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,060
trial in 185 primary schools in Western
Kenya.

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,200
This picture is from a different WASH in
Schools project, also in Kenya.

103
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,570
All of the schools except for controls,
were

104
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,550
provided with hygiene promotion and an
HWTS system,

105
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,710
consisting of safe water storage
containers and a

106
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,100
year's supply of Water Guard liquid
chlorine solution.

107
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,030
Half of the schools were also provided
with additional latrines.

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,510
And if schools did not have a year-round
water

109
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,220
source within one kilometer, and no
improved water source

110
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,200
within two kilometers, they were
considered water-scarce, and the

111
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,760
project provided them with a new water
supply facility,

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,608
either a bore hole, or a rain water
harvesting tank.

113
00:07:30,608 --> 00:07:36,040
At a follow-up visit six months after the
intervention, all

114
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,040
of the schools, including the control
schools, had better access to

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,490
improved sources of drinking water, and
about two thirds of

116
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,730
water samples included residual chlorine,

117
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,169
indicating that water treatment was
ongoing.

118
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,360
Students reported much greater
availability

119
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,990
of drinking water, hand washing water,

120
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:59,660
and soap, which was also confirmed by the
evaluation teams.

121
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,490
There was also a significant reduction in
diarrheal disease by more than 50%. 

122
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,440
But this was found only in the water-scarce

123
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,049
schools, which received a new water
source.

124
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,900
So at least in this one case,

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,870
we have evidence of improved knowledge and
behavior,

126
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,420
at least after six months, which may not

127
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,830
alone be sufficient to reduce diarrheal
disease burden.

128
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,530
It's a natural idea to link HWTS with
health interventions.

129
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:34,350
HWTS is, after all, a health intervention
itself, to reduce diarrheal disease.

130
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,600
And some of the people most vulnerable to
diarrheal disease

131
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,670
might already be in contact with the
health care system.

132
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,440
So reaching them could be easier and

133
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,349
more cost effective through an integrated
approach.

134
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,480
HWTS promotion maybe more credible when it
comes from a

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,550
health worker, rather than a water
engineer or an NGO.

136
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,620
And finally there can be mutual
reinforcements,

137
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,140
so that not only is HWTS is more effective
when paired

138
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,170
with another health intervention, but that
other intervention can also benefit.

139
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,410
Otherwise there would be little reason for
them

140
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,390
to take on the additional messages of
HWTS.

141
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,840
We'll look at two kinds of integration
with health care systems.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,900
First, around child and maternal health

143
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,560
taking the specific example of antenatal
care.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,980
And second with a context of HIV/AIDS
management.

145
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:33,160
There are other potential linkages, for
instance

146
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,030
diarrheal disease compounds and is
compounded by malnutrition.

147
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,170
So there's interests in integrated
interventions there.

148
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:47,650
And there are even potential links with
water related diseases like Dengue fever.

149
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,580
Since the mosquitoes that carry the Dengue
virus

150
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,870
like to lay their eggs in water containers

151
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:56,890
a key intervention for vector control is
promotion

152
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,580
of household water storage containers with
tightly sealed covers.

153
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:06,810
But, in the interest of time, today we'll
just look at antenatal care and HIV AIDS.

154
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,680
First, antenatal care, or ANC.

155
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,280
This example is from Malawi.

156
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,810
Where Population Services International
had been marketing WaterGuard since 2002.

157
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,270
But several years on, awareness was high,

158
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,520
but uptake was still low.

159
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:32,040
In 2007, the Ministry of Health launched a
project to promote HWTS alongside

160
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,360
antenatal care visits, 15,000 pregnant
women attending their first

161
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,770
antenatal care visits were given hygiene
promotion and free hygiene kits

162
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,779
which included a plastic bucket with a tap
and samples of WaterGuard.

163
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,700
The women were then visited in their homes

164
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,220
afterwards by health workers and if they
return to

165
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,800
the health clinic for their second, third,
or

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,410
fourth ANC visits, they were given free
water-guard refills.

167
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,130
They also got refills if they delivered
their babies

168
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,510
in a healthcare facility, or made post
natal care visits.

169
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,240
Now the maternal and child healthcare
sector in Malawi

170
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,940
was very concerned since most women attend
one antenatal visit.

171
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,238
But only about 20% complete the
recommended round of four ANC visits.

172
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:27,260
And less than three-quarters of them deliver in
a healthcare facility.

173
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,466
And less than half make a timely
post-natal visit.

174
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:35,980
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
evaluated the intervention

175
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,150
with follow-ups one year and 

176
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:43,590
three years after the intervention, which
included surprise visits,

177
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,430
testing for residual chlorine, and visual
confirmation of WaterGuard bottles.

178
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,890
After one year, there was a tremendous
increase in confirmed use

179
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:59,790
of WaterGuard, from 1% to 62% among the
women in the program.

180
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,032
Use of the safe storage containers was
almost 100%.

181
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:05,970
And the evaluation also looked at the
practices

182
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,910
of close friends and relatives with young
children.

183
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,990
And so a large increase there as well, up
to 27% confirmed use.

184
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,060
It seems like pregnancy and childbirth
represent teachable moments.

185
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,670
When mothers are very concerned about the
health of their new child.

186
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,990
There are a lot of changes and they're
changing many behaviors.

187
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,170
If you are a parent, you know very well
that once you have children, especially

188
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,410
your first one, you change a lot of

189
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,060
your routine behaviors, and that is an
understatement.

190
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,320
Anyway those same households were
revisited two

191
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,860
years later and while there was a

192
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,580
substantial decline in confirmed use among
both

193
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,100
direct participants and the close friends
and neighbors.

194
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,920
These numbers still represent a
fairly high sustained use.

195
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,070
Qualitative research confirmed that the
health care

196
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,720
workers that were involved in promotion
were considered

197
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,170
to be highly credible by the women and

198
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:11,180
that this influenced them to continue
using HWTS.

199
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,550
What is very interesting about this study
is that the women who were enrolled

200
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,820
were much more likely to return to the
health clinics for repeat ANC visits.

201
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,885
More than half of the women completed the
full four ANC visit cycle.

202
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:30,420
90% of them delivered their babies in a
health clinic.

203
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,860
And, 90% also made a post-natal checkup,
within six weeks.

204
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,850
And these numbers are much higher 
than average for that region.

205
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,470
So this HWTS intervention turned out to

206
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,800
be extraordinarily effective, for the
maternal and

207
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,380
child health people, not only for those

208
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,320
more concerned about water and diarrheal
disease.

209
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,110
And where both parties benefit,
integration is much more likely to

210
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,870
succeed and this pilot has since been
scaled up in Malawi.

211
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,760
If one strategy in optimizing health gains
from HWTS is to target the

212
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,330
vulnerable, it makes a lot of sense to
work on interventions on HIV/AIDS.

213
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,450
People living with HIV have weakened
immune systems

214
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,960
and are particularly vulnerable

215
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,420
to infections, including water-borne
diseases.

216
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,510
They may become sick, with lower pathogen
loads, and an infection

217
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,829
that could be minor in a healthy person
can be life-threatening.

218
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,110
Cryptosporidium is a particular risk.

219
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:34,950
And a recent review of people living with
HIV/AIDS, in low resource

220
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,130
settings, found Crypto to be the

221
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,740
most common waterborne pathogen causing
diarrhea,

222
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,790
and was a significant cause of mortality.

223
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,940
So HWTS has been recognized to be an
important

224
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,900
element of preventative care for people
living with HIV AIDS.

225
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,370
And while there are not many studies out
there yet.

226
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,720
There is increasing evidence that HWTS
uptake

227
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,290
is higher in interventions with people
with

228
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,860
HIV AIDS than in conventional
interventions, and

229
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,800
that there is significant reduction in
diarrheal disease.

230
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:16,800
There are even a few studies showing that
HWTS may slow the progression of AIDS.

231
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,880
One study, for example, found that people
with

232
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,090
HIV who received an insecticide treated
bed net

233
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:29,220
 a light straw water filter,
experienced less severe drops in their

234
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,528
CD4 counts, which is an indication of the
severity of the disease.

235
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:39,110
Participants were 27% less likely, to have
their CD4

236
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,850
counts drop to a critical level, within
the study period.

237
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,940
Here is an example of an integrated
intervention.

238
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,700
And I'd like to thank Rachel Peletz for
this example and the use of her photos.

239
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,370
Rachel conducted a randomized control
trial in Peri-urban Zambia

240
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,120
which enrolled 120 households with
children under the age two.

241
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,880
Including a hundred HIV positive mothers
and 20 HIV negative mothers.

242
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,190
Half of the households were provided with

243
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,760
a water filter and a safe storage
container.

244
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,940
And the other half were used as controls.

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:19,069
Though after one year, the control
households also received the intervention.

246
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,620
Here you see the water filter, and by now
can

247
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,500
you all tell me what kind of filter this
is?

248
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,220
Post it on the discussion forum.

249
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,580
Participants, who are trained by the
project fieldworkers, who

250
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,290
made monthly follow-up visits for a year
after which the

251
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:41,330
control households received their filters
and then a final follow

252
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,820
up visit was made two years after the
initial distribution.

253
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:50,530
Follow up visits were unannounced and
involved water quality testing as

254
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:55,420
well as, recording of diarrhea and
reported use of the filter.

255
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,290
In addition, an objective nutritional
measure was

256
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,209
used called the weight for age Z-score.

257
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,540
Throughout the evaluation period, filter
use was extremely high.

258
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,560
People reported using the filter in 96% of
visits.

259
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,880
This was confirmed by the field workers in
around 85% of visits.

260
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,535
And on the very last visit, after two
years of use.

261
00:17:20,535 --> 00:17:24,280
92% of households were confirmed users.

262
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,200
Of the people who reported using the

263
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,600
filters, 95% reported not using any other
source

264
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,950
of drinking water in the last two days,
either for the mother or for the child.

265
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,460
These are very high numbers compared to
other studies.

266
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,740
That could have been even higher, except
that two of

267
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,690
the filters were eaten by rats, the
plastic tubing part.

268
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,560
So, the evaluation found that the filters
showed more than two log removal

269
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,690
and here it's likely that there were 
detection limit problems

270
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,810
preventing measurement of
higher LRVs.

271
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:05,370
You see if the raw water contains 100 CFU
per 100 mLs

272
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:09,910
and you measure less than one CFU per 100
mLs, all

273
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,300
you can say is that there was at least two
log

274
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,850
removal you don't know if it's three or
five or nine log.

275
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:20,040
And if you compare the geometric means of
water in intervention and

276
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,540
control households you can see something
like two orders of magnitude difference.

277
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,510
The evaluation also found more than a 50%
reduction in diarrheal disease.

278
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,940
Which again is high compared to other
studies.

279
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,080
And also found that people consuming more
contaminated water,

280
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,120
more highly contaminated water, experienced
a higher risk of diarrhea.

281
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:50,000
However, they didn't find any significant
difference in the weight for age z-score.

282
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,140
This module has drawn heavily on a few
scientific studies.

283
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,170
And you can find the full articles here.

284
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,810
Many of them are freely available online.

285
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,030
And the pdf version of this lecture has
the hyperlinks for you.

286
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,930
And these are more general resources which

287
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,350
were very useful in putting together this
module.

288
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,770
Again, the pdfs include the hyperlinks for
all of these reports.

289
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,030
So to summarize, there's a lot of

290
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,210
interest in integrating HWTS promotion
with other interventions.

291
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,770
There may well be a better chance at

292
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,340
realizing health gains because it is
easier reaching people

293
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,380
at higher risks of infection, and because
those

294
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,680
people might trust the people delivering
the message more,

295
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,290
if they're respected figures like teachers
or health care workers.

296
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,290
It's also more cost efficient to reach
these

297
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:46,130
people by bundling interventions into an
integrated package.

298
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,360
There's suggested evidence, and a lot of
enthusiasm so far,

299
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,390
for integration into school programs, but
there's stronger evidence that

300
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:01,330
shows that when HWTS is integrated into
other health initiatives

301
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,170
both the objectives can have a better
chance of success.

302
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,880
In the next module we'll look at another
kind

303
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,820
of targeted application of HWTS, which is
emergency response.

304
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,740
This module will be given by a guest

305
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:21,290
lecturer, Dr. Danielle Lantagne of Tufts
University in the USA.

306
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:21,960
Don't miss it.

307
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,780
