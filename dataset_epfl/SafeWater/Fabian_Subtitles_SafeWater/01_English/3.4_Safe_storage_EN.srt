2
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:08,059
Recall from the first week that we
discussed different ways in

3
00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:12,850
which drinking water can become
contaminated along a safe water chain.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,350
Safe storage of drinking water can help

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,450
to minimize such contamination risks
during collection

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,620
and transport, when the source is outside

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,150
the home as well as during household
storage.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,740
Especially when water is treated at the
household level, it's very important

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,750
to store it properly so that the gains in
quality are not lost.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,640
There are a number of characteristics we
would

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,710
like to see in an ideal household storage
container.

12
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,800
Perhaps the most important one is that the
container

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,680
should be covered and that there should be
an

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,930
opening, which is small enough to
discourage people from

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:51,120
putting their hands into the container
during water collection,

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,190
or from using a scoop or a ladle to
retrieve stored water.

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,830
The opening however, should be large
enough to

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,800
allow easy filling at the point of
collection.

19
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,410
And usually openings are between five and
eight centimeters in diameter,

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,400
and ideally, they have a screw cap of
some kind.

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,480
Although you don't want it to be too easy
to

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,260
insert hands into the container, it is
good if the

23
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,890
container can be cleaned periodically, and
in some designs a

24
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,880
lid can be removed and the insides can be
cleaned manually.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Where this isn't possible, users are
recommended to periodically add

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,860
sand or pebbles and shake them about to
clean the insides.

27
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,840
You can also add soap or chlorine after
removing the

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,260
pebbles to wash the insides of the
container.

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,160
Water can be safely retrieved by pouring.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,830
But this requires some physical effort to
lift the bucket and a risk of spilling.

31
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,130
So it's preferred to have a tap which can
be used to withdraw water.

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:01,890
Taps should have a fairly large bore so
that the flow rates are high.

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,970
However, taps do break or leak so they
should also

34
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,730
be simple enough to be repaired or
replaced with local hardware.

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,820
Often storage containers are also used for
transporting

36
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,790
water from the point of collection to the

37
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:23,310
household, so the container shouldn't be
too large. Even a 20 or 25 liter jerry can

38
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,150
is very heavy when it's full. And of

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,340
course, it should be strong and stable so
it

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,280
isn't easily tipped over or broken. And
it's better

41
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,770
to be opaque to prevent the growth of
algae.

42
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,140
If chemical disinfection is being used,
it's good to use a container

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,341
size, that corresponds to an easy chemical
dose typically ten or twenty liters.

44
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,480
And finally, the container should be

45
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,920
affordable and ideally available through
local markets.

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,300
Here are some examples of containers

47
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,600
that were designed specifically for safe
storage.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,220
This is the container developed by the
U.S. Centers

49
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,030
for Disease Control and the Pan American
Health Organization,

50
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,470
as part of the safe water system.

51
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,120
It's a modified jerry can that holds 20
liters of water and costs about $5.

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,980
The Oxfam bucket has a lid with an
opening and cap

53
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,040
built in, and the cap is attached so you
can't lose it.

54
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,220
You can also completely remove the lid
which allows very

55
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,069
efficient transport since the buckets can
be stacked inside each other.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,210
These also cost around $4 or $5 and while
they were designed

57
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,050
at Oxfam in the UK, they're now produced
all around the world.

58
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,630
In many countries in Africa, 20 liter
jerry cans are

59
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,400
now widely used for collecting,
transporting and storing water.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,950
They're fairly easy to carry on the head
though they are

61
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,050
heavy and have a small opening which
prevents putting hands inside.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,940
Water is normally poured out of the
opening.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,380
They're not easy to clean, and they can be
quite

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,620
dirty like this example here from the
Central African Republic.

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,370
On the right, you see a modified jerry can
being distributed in the Philippines after

66
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,710
Typhoon Haiyan by the NGO Plan
International with support from DFID.

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:28,410
These jerry cans have a large screw top for
filling that also allows cleaning.

68
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,870
And they come with a built-in tap, that
small, red, knob at the bottom.

69
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,660
It's very easy to convert a standard
plastic

70
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,770
storage bucket into a safe storage
container by

71
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,130
drilling a hole through the plastic wall
to

72
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,570
install a tap, like this guy is doing
here.

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,730
The buckets are usually then labeled

74
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,890
with a sticker including instructions,
especially

75
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,550
about using the tap to withdraw water
rather than dipping into the bucket.

76
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,390
In Haiti, where this picture was taken,
this is an easy message since the tap

77
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,910
is seen as a sign of higher socio-economic

78
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,479
status and families take pride in using
it.

79
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,570
In many cultures people like to use clay

80
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:15,090
pots, because they cool the water due to
evaporation.

81
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,690
In some cases water is transported in clay
pots, but in most areas water

82
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,500
is transported in plastic containers and
then

83
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,529
transferred to clay pots at the household.

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,960
By working with local potters it is
possible to modify

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,370
clay pots to have a tap, as shown in this
example.

86
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,190
One way to demonstrate the importance of
safe water storage containers is to look

87
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:45,260
at the impact that providing a storage
container alone can have on water quality.

88
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,400
There aren't many studies available on
this topic since normally safe storage

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,040
containers are distributed, along side
some

90
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,070
kind of treatment for example chlorine
disinfection.

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,040
There are a couple of studies however,
that suggest that

92
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,159
safe storage alone can have a significant
impact on water quality.

93
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,660
The first is a somewhat old study, it's
from 2001, made in a Malawi refugee

94
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,630
camp, where there were repeated outbreaks
of diarrhea and cholera.

95
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,420
Although the microbial quality at the
wells,

96
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,630
where people collected their drinking
water was good.

97
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,760
The camp organizers provided randomly
selected 100 households with an

98
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,900
improved storage container, and this is
what it looked like.

99
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,950
And households had to exchange their

100
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,190
existing storage containers for the new
ones.

101
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,530
The households, along with the households
that didn't get the new containers

102
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,890
were monitored for four months and the
researchers found that fecal coliform

103
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:52,802
levels were reduced by over 50%, by
the improved storage containers, or

104
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:59,470
nearly 70% if, the geometric mean rather
than the arithmetic mean is used.

105
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,380
The biggest impact is seen on water
quality directly after collecting water

106
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,650
at the source, with much better water
quality in the improved bucket.

107
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,920
The researchers also found that the hands
of

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,390
people collecting water had high levels of
fecal bacteria

109
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,550
on them, further strengthening the idea
that contact

110
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:22,630
between hands and water is the cause of
contamination.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,760
In addition to finding a good reduction in
water quality, there

112
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,390
was a 30% reduction in diarrheal disease
among children under age five.

113
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,170
And at the end of the study, households
were

114
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,870
offered the chance to get their old
storage containers back.

115
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,240
But the great majority of them
chose to keep

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,470
the new containers indicating that 
they liked them and appreciated them.

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,299
More recently, 72 villages were studied in
rural Benin setting.

118
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,480
These villages had to have at least 40% of

119
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,960
the household using public pumps or
standpipes, but instead

120
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,540
in spite of having relatively good sources
of water,

121
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,250
household water quality was quite poor at
the baseline.

122
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,420
In half of these 72 villages, every single

123
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,830
household was provided with a free
improved storage container.

124
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:24,000
Either a 30 liter plastic jerry can or a
30 liter clay pot, and both of these were

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,780
fitted with taps and had stickers on them
encouraging

126
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,570
people not to put their hand inside the
container.

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,730
In all, 364 households were included in
the intervention,

128
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,639
and a similar number were monitored in the
non-intervention villages.

129
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,593
The evaluation found that after six

130
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:47,215
to eight months after receiving the
containers,

131
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:54,490
88% were still in use and actually, it was
95% of the plastic containers,

132
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,190
and just under 80% of the clay pots that
were still being used.

133
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,640
And people reported significant breakage
of the clay pots

134
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,270
and also that they were more difficult to
clean.

135
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,960
Stored water in the improved containers
had 70%

136
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,240
less E. coli than in the control
households.

137
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,270
But the researchers did not find a
significant impact on diarrheal disease.

138
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,280
So, in summary, we've seen that safe

139
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,160
storage containers can be designed to
minimize

140
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,570
recontamination and we have looked at some

141
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,030
of the desired characteristics of a good
container.

142
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,070
We have seen some examples of containers
that are

143
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,650
widely used, and also I had two examples
of

144
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,070
intervention studies that seem to show
quite a significant

145
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,820
impact on water quality from improved
storage containers alone.
