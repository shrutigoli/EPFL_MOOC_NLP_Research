1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:07,000
Now, we discussed in the first week,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,150
how the processes involved with household
water

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,820
treatment, are the same processes used in

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,730
conventional water treatment at community
or municipal scales.

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,320
But professional treatment at these
scales, typically involves multiple

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,580
barriers to contamination, especially when
surface water is being treated.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,790
We've seen that some pathogens are more
resistant to

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,360
certain kinds of disinfection than others
are, and that for

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,160
this reason you might have water with no
E. Coli

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,540
bacteria, but still contaminated with

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,440
heartier microbes, such as
cryptosporidium cysts.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,630
Well cryptosporidium cysts are large, so
filtration is normally more effective

13
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,080
than disinfection in insuring that
drinking water doesn't contain crypto.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,260
It's more difficult, naturally to apply
multiple

15
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,440
treatment steps at the household scale.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,430
It's hard enough to correctly and
consistently apply one treatment step.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,720
How much harder is it, if two or three
steps must be followed?

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,640
Perhaps for this reason, there are
relatively few

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,030
examples of informal combinations of
multiple barriers in HWTS.

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,810
There are, however, a good number of
commercial products which incorporate two

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,930
or more processes in a way that is more or
less invisible to the consumer.

22
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,490
Informally, there are many different
combinations

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,700
that could be made involving some

24
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,520
kind of pretreatment or filtration along
with a disinfection step and safe storage.

25
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,210
This image from CAWST shows, how a biosand

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,610
filter can be combined with safe storage,
that's an

27
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,510
Oxfam bucket and CAWST recommends that
people then use

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,880
chlorine or another disinfectant step
before drinking the water.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,240
It's not clear how seriously this
recommendation is taken in the field.

30
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,150
But, this kind of combination, say of
filtration followed by chlorination

31
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:15,710
and safe storage, is probably the most
manageable kind of informal combination.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,600
If we look at commercial combinations, one
very potent one

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,070
is the combination of a coagulant
flocculant, with chlorine disinfection.

34
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:33,220
The coagulant removes suspended particles,
allowing the chlorine to act effectively.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,420
We saw a video of the coagulation progress
from this product, the Procter and Gamble

36
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,810
purifier of water, in an earlier episode
this product was formerly marketed as PUR.

37
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,230
But there are other similar commercial
products such

38
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,480
as Watermaker, developed by Control
Chemicals in South Africa.

39
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,150
This combination is particularly good in

40
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,020
emergencies, where water might be highly
turbid.

41
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,890
In fact, the more turbidity in the water,
the better the coagulation process works.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,240
A drawback is that a large-mouth container
is needed to

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,590
add the chemicals to the water and stir it
well.

44
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,370
You can't do that in a jerry can.

45
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,540
Then, a second container is also needed,
which might

46
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,940
be a safe storage container, like this one
with the

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,660
tap, since the treated water should be
filtered through

48
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,560
a simple cloth before use to remove any
remaining flax.

49
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,640
There are many more commercial systems
based on the combination of filtration

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,200
and disinfection typically with chlorine,
particularly

51
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,290
targeting middle income or upper income
households.

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:50,280
These systems work best with water that
has only low levels of turbidity, since

53
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,470
their filtering elements could easily get
clogged

54
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,780
if there were high levels of suspended solids.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,310
These filters are particularly popular in
Eastern or South

56
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,609
Eastern Asia, but are growing in
popularity throughout the world.

57
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,660
Here, you see the Aquasure filter produced

58
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,300
by Eureka Forbes, and Hindustan Unilever's
Pureit.

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,750
Both of these include a chlorine
cartridge, which is called something else,

60
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,410
something innocuous like the germkill
battery

61
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,020
in Pureit which must be regularly
replaced.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,140
The Pureit uses a secondary activated
carbon block,

63
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,200
following the chlorine step to remove
residual chlorine.

64
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
So there's no taste for the consumer.

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,760
The Tata Swach filter uses colloidal
silver as the disinfectant.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,530
And mineral pot filters

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,090
are produced by a variety of companies,
and sometimes branded as Korean filters.

68
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,760
They they typically don't have
a chlorine disinfectant, but do have small

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,470
amounts of various porous material such as
activated carbon,

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,730
zeolites or ion exchange resins that may
or may not help remove pathogens.

71
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,601
All of these filters do have built-in safe
storage

72
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:21,080
and most require regular replacement of
filtration or disinfection cartridges.

73
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Most of these companies produce a range of

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,540
products, targeting different types of
consumers including high end

75
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,620
models not discussed here, that require
electricity and

76
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,040
do things like fill automatically or
produce chilled water.

77
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,290
So in summary the multiple barrier
approach, which is critically important in

78
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,690
conventional water treatment, it can also
be applied at the household scale.

79
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,470
Multiple barriers provide greater chances
of removing or inactivating all of the

80
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,310
different kinds of pathogens, which might
be present in the raw water.

81
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,420
Combinations can be done in informal
systems, but

82
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,610
are probably more effective in
commercially designed systems.

83
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,420
And the most commonly used combinations
are either coagulation

84
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,700
or filtration followed by chlorine
disinfection and safe storage.
