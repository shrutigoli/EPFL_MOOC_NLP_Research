1
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:06,859
The biggest threat
to drinking water safety

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,620
is microbial contamination
from fecal matter.

3
00:00:10,196 --> 00:00:14,021
Poorly constructed or protected
water sources can become contaminated,

4
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:16,608
or inadequate sanitation and hygiene

5
00:00:16,608 --> 00:00:20,077
can introduce contamination
after water is collected.

6
00:00:20,886 --> 00:00:23,144
And because pathogens are so small,

7
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:27,440
contaminated water might smell,
taste, and look perfectly clean.

8
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:29,544
So the only way to really confirm

9
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:32,533
if water is contaminated is to do a test,

10
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:35,569
and traditionally this has involved
using laboratories

11
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,864
with specialized equipment
and trained personnel.

12
00:00:39,448 --> 00:00:41,335
Now, laboratory testing is great,

13
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:43,125
but it poses some drawbacks.

14
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,496
First of all, distance.

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:47,467
Laboratories might not be located

16
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,096
near to the site
where testing is being done.

17
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:53,736
And since microbial samples
should be tested within six,

18
00:00:53,736 --> 00:00:57,259
or a maximum of 24 hours after collection,

19
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,011
this has posed a real challenge.

20
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,349
Laboratory testing can also be expensive,

21
00:01:02,349 --> 00:01:05,535
and it can be difficult to get
the results from the laboratory

22
00:01:05,535 --> 00:01:07,602
back to the local authorities.

23
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:11,846
However, advances, technical advances,

24
00:01:11,846 --> 00:01:16,597
have made field testing
more practical, easy, and cheap.

25
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:21,576
So some of these new options include
<i>Most Probable Number</i> methods,

26
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:24,858
where a number
of small compartments are tested,

27
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:28,462
and a statistical test tells you
the most probable number

28
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,758
of bacteria contaminants.

29
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:35,458
Also membrane filtration
is increasingly done in the field.

30
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:41,451
Also, new enzyme growth media
react specifically with certain bacteria,

31
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:45,582
like <i>E. coli</i>, the preferred indicator
for fecal contamination,

32
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:47,581
which makes results more robust.

33
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:51,860
And then, finally, there's a new
generation of low-cost incubators,

34
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,218
that can be done without electricity,

35
00:01:54,218 --> 00:01:57,243
or at least away from
a well-equipped laboratory.

36
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,574
So taking advantage of all these advances,

37
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:04,759
WHO and UNICEF have developed
a water quality testing module

38
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,215
which can be applied in national surveys,

39
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:09,233
and this has been done, and piloted,

40
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:13,994
in a number of multiple-indicator
cluster surveys, or MICS surveys.

41
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:17,608
The package consists of three elements.

42
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:20,294
One, a membrane filtration system

43
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:22,580
made by Millipore, the Microfill system.

44
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:27,839
Two, growth media,
Nissui Compact Dry EC plates,

45
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:30,532
and three, portable incubation,

46
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:32,984
and this is body-belt incubation.

47
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:36,616
These materials are used
by the MICS field teams

48
00:02:36,616 --> 00:02:38,702
after they go through a basic training.

49
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,030
During the survey,
the teams will ask the respondents

50
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,479
for a glass of water
that they would give a child to drink,

51
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,088
and then they test that water.

52
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:50,850
In some cases, they also visit the source
where the water was collected,

53
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,446
and test that water
directly at the source.

54
00:02:54,137 --> 00:02:58,985
The way they do the test
is they use a membrane-filtration system

55
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,649
to pass the water
through a special piece of paper

56
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:04,884
which has small holes in it,
and the holes are large enough

57
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,160
to let water pass through,
but small enough

58
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,279
to trap all of the bacteria
on the paper surface.

59
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:14,472
That filter paper is then placed
on some growth media

60
00:03:14,472 --> 00:03:18,068
with all the food and water
that the bacteria need to grow,

61
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:21,921
and left for 24 hours so that
bacteria can grow

62
00:03:21,921 --> 00:03:27,154
and form colonies of billions of cells,
which become visible to the naked eye.

63
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:30,605
Once the colonies have grown,
they can be counted

64
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:33,879
and the results can be recorded
and shared with the communities.

65
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:39,103
In these field tests, the MICS teams
actually test two samples:

66
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:42,516
a 100 mL test for low contamination,

67
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:45,469
and a 1 mL test for high contamination,

68
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:49,272
and this is because if there's
a large number of bacteria in the water

69
00:03:49,272 --> 00:03:53,006
then they can form so many colonies
that it's difficult to read.

70
00:03:53,006 --> 00:03:57,638
So for highly contaminated samples,
a 1 mL sample is the best option.

71
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,913
Now let's look at what
the testing equipment looks like.

72
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,069
The first part of the kit
is a filter instrument, or manifold,

73
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,994
and this one is produced by Millipore,

74
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:10,710
as part of their Microfill
line of products.

75
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,193
The filter instrument is used
with a filter paper,

76
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:16,930
and a plastic funnel,
also made by Millipore.

77
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:19,679
These are sterile and disposable;

78
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:21,800
you need to use one per sample tested.

79
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,404
We also use a simple plastic syringe

80
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,917
to create a vacuum and filter the sample.

81
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,016
The test requires a number
of small accessories:

82
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:32,501
forceps to handle the filter paper,

83
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,326
an alcohol wipe to sterilize
the instrument and forceps,

84
00:04:36,931 --> 00:04:39,971
a small plastic syringe
to rehydrate the growth plates,

85
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,388
and a permanent pen
for marking the growth plates.

86
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,235
Finally, you have the growth media.

87
00:04:46,507 --> 00:04:48,193
There are many options available,

88
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:50,005
but we use an enzyme growth media

89
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:54,222
produced by Nissui,
called Compact Dry EC Plates.

90
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:58,262
These come prepackaged
and foil wrapped, in sets of four,

91
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:00,263
and the nice thing about this packaging

92
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:02,907
is that the plates can be stored
at room temperature

93
00:05:02,907 --> 00:05:04,833
for up to 18 months.

94
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:07,630
So, let's see how this test works.

95
00:05:07,966 --> 00:05:11,027
The first step is to get
all of our materials together

96
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:14,192
and label the two
Compact Dry plates with that pen.

97
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:31,267
This is a sample of "lake water".

98
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:40,694
Okay.

99
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:44,524
I've got a glass of water
I collected earlier from Lake Geneva.

100
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:46,345
Let's see what's in it.

101
00:05:46,902 --> 00:05:50,642
Next, we have to make sure that
our hands and our equipment are all clean,

102
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,550
and we will use
a simple alcohol wipe to do this,

103
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,801
to sterilize the forceps and the manifold,

104
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:58,606
and some alcohol sanitizer for the hands.

105
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:01,647
You could also use soap and water,
if that's more convenient.

106
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:22,565
So with the alcohol wipe,
first we sterilize the forceps,

107
00:06:28,202 --> 00:06:31,967
and then the part of the manifold
that will touch the filter paper.

108
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:39,602
Here it's good to use the forceps
to stabilize the manifold.

109
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:44,895
Okay, then we're going to put down
the forceps on a clean surface

110
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,915
to keep them sterile,

111
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:50,096
and the next step we're going to do
is take the sterile filter paper.

112
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:55,621
Now, the Millipore filter paper
comes with a protective blue sheet,

113
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:58,524
which is not the filter paper,
you don't want to use that,

114
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,863
so what I like to do is first take out
and remove the blue paper,

115
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:09,093
and then take the white paper,
with the gridded side up,

116
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,351
and place it right on the manifold.

117
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:15,347
Still need to keep the forceps clean,

118
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,766
but now we're ready
to put the plastic funnel on.

119
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:21,495
And the plastic funnels are also sterile.

120
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,682
They're kept in these plastic sheaths.

121
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:28,824
So you just reach in, and take one out,

122
00:07:30,653 --> 00:07:33,255
and put it directly on top
of the filter paper.

123
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:37,053
There we go.

124
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,603
Now we pour the water
into the plastic funnel,

125
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:46,523
up to the line on the funnel
that's marked at 100 mL.

126
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,134
A little bit more or less
of the water doesn't matter.

127
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:53,444
We just want to know
the general level of contamination.

128
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:57,129
Now we need to rehydrate
these Compact Dry plates.

129
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:00,868
We'll take the lid off of them,
of the <i>two</i> of them,

130
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,882
and open this 1 mL sterile syringe.

131
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:13,639
Draw 1 mL of water from the funnel

132
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:18,213
and place it on each
of the Compact Dry plates.

133
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,369
Now the plates,
they have food for the bacteria,

134
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,354
but the bacteria can't access the food
unless they're rehydrated,

135
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:28,563
so it's important to add some water.

136
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:32,792
That's done.

137
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:36,122
Now for one of these,
the 1 mL test is complete,

138
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:37,883
and we can put the lid on it.

139
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:40,591
For the other one, we'll filter
the water through the paper

140
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:42,223
and put the paper on it.

141
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:45,023
To do that, we'll use
this 100 mL syringe.

142
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,046
We'll just attach the syringe
to the side of the instrument

143
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:55,923
and pull it gently
to suck water through the membrane.

144
00:08:57,487 --> 00:08:59,088
Remember, the holes on the membrane

145
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,847
are small enough to trap
all of the bacteria on the paper,

146
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,600
so whatever bacteria were present
in this sample of lake water

147
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,304
are going to be on that filter paper
when we're done filtering it.

148
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,410
It just takes a few minutes.

149
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:39,313
Okay.

150
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:48,777
Sometimes you need to remove the syringe

151
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:52,355
and do two batches,
like we've just done here.

152
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,690
Okay, there we go.

153
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,357
We've got all the water out.

154
00:09:56,973 --> 00:10:00,561
So we remove the plastic funnel.
We're done with this now.

155
00:10:02,193 --> 00:10:05,635
Use the forceps to remove that paper

156
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:10,001
and put it directly on the growth media.

157
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:13,794
Now we put the lid back on it

158
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,943
and we're done.

159
00:10:15,943 --> 00:10:17,597
We just have to clean up now,

160
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:20,606
make sure that we take
all the waste materials,

161
00:10:20,606 --> 00:10:21,723
and throw them away.

162
00:10:21,723 --> 00:10:23,960
In fact, it's a good idea
to have a rubbish bin

163
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,464
when doing the test in the field,

164
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:28,896
because there's not always
a good, safe place to dispose of wastes.

165
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:33,298
So now we have bacteria on the plates,

166
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:35,090
they have food, they have water.

167
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,432
All they need to grow is some warmth,
and a little bit of time.

168
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:44,402
Now, <i>E. coli</i> will be happiest when
the temperature is around 35-37 degrees,

169
00:10:44,402 --> 00:10:48,399
though they will grow at temperatures
down to 20 degrees,

170
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,943
though it takes a bit longer.

171
00:10:49,943 --> 00:10:51,888
If the temperature gets above 40 degrees,

172
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:54,371
they don't grow well
on this particular media.

173
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,655
In a laboratory,
you have electrical incubators

174
00:10:57,655 --> 00:11:01,580
that can regulate the temperature
very nicely at the desired temperature,

175
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,634
but for this field testing,
we don't have those,

176
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:08,674
but there are some newly developed
alternatives that we can use.

177
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:11,779
The first is to use
an electrical incubator,

178
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:14,264
but a small, portable one,
like this one

179
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:16,864
that can run on electricity,
if you have it,

180
00:11:16,864 --> 00:11:18,641
but could also run on batteries

181
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:23,110
or plug into the cigarette adapter
in an automobile.

182
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,879
So there are different versions of this.

183
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,439
It's a nice option.

184
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,021
(snapping sound)

185
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:34,950
A second option that's under
development, in the research stage,

186
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,558
is called a Phase Change Incubator,

187
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,882
and this is an example that was developed
at the University of Bristol.

188
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,159
What it does is it's like a thermos,

189
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,980
and you fill this thermos up
with boiling water

190
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,387
and let the water sit for about
half an hour, throw out the water,

191
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:56,206
and then the thermos retains
the heat from the boiling water,

192
00:11:56,206 --> 00:12:01,111
and if you place plates inside,
and close it,

193
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:03,433
the incubator will keep the temperature

194
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:06,452
at about 35 degrees for over 24 hours.

195
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:09,463
So this is a very nice technique,

196
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:11,815
that doesn't require
any electricity at all.

197
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,562
But there's another source of heat
available in these surveys,

198
00:12:15,562 --> 00:12:17,748
which we've used in the MICS pilots,

199
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:21,240
and that's the body heat
of the survey team.

200
00:12:22,753 --> 00:12:25,312
Human bodies are about 37 degrees,

201
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,147
which is a perfect temperature
for incubating,

202
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:32,841
so the NGO called ENPHO, in Nepal,

203
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:35,462
has developed a Body-Belt Incubator

204
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:37,490
to take advantage of that body heat.

205
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:41,815
This is just a fabric belt,
with some pockets sewn into it.

206
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:45,306
You can insert the plates
into the pockets,

207
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,499
and then wrap it around the waist,

208
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,801
and voilà!
You become a human incubator.

209
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:06,426
This has proved very successful
in field trials so far.

210
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,912
There is a fourth option available,
depending on the climate,

211
00:13:10,912 --> 00:13:14,878
which is just to incubate the plates
at ambient temperature,

212
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,503
normal room temperature,

213
00:13:16,503 --> 00:13:19,603
and if you're in a country
where the temperature is above, say,

214
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:25,785
20, 25, ideally 30 degrees,
that can also be a good option.

215
00:13:26,678 --> 00:13:30,901
Once the samples have been
incubated for 24-48 hours,

216
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:32,526
we can count the colonies.

217
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:37,191
Now <i>E. coli</i> bacteria will form
blue colonies on the Compact Dry plates,

218
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:42,446
and other coliforms, like total coliforms
or thermotolerant coliforms

219
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,001
will produce red or violet colonies.

220
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,334
Here are some examples.

221
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,699
Now, other bacteria
can also grow on the plates,

222
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,060
but they will form colonies
that are white,

223
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,136
or pale yellow, or some other color,

224
00:13:56,136 --> 00:14:01,137
but those are not coliforms or <i>E. coli</i>,
so we're not concerned with those.

225
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:04,126
Once the colonies have formed,

226
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,881
we can simply count the number of blue

227
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,333
and the number of red or violet colonies,
and record the results.

228
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:13,626
If the plates have very high levels
of bacteria on them

229
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:16,207
it's difficult to see individual colonies,

230
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:18,687
and you can have plates
that are overloaded,

231
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:22,222
which look completely pink
or completely blue.

232
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,758
Once the results are recorded

233
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:30,714
they should be shared with
the local authorities, or communities,

234
00:14:30,714 --> 00:14:33,605
and then the plates
should be disposed of safely,

235
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,716
which means that
they should be disinfected

236
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:39,801
using either chlorine or heat,
and then disposed of.

237
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:44,025
Well, let's look at some of those results.

238
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:48,056
The first sample I showed you
was lake water from Lake Geneva.

239
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:52,278
You can see that this water actually
has quite a lot of bacteria in it,

240
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,242
a lot of those red and violet colonies,
more than 100,

241
00:14:56,242 --> 00:15:00,435
and when it's above 100,
we don't even bother counting anymore.

242
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:04,971
But it's only got about one of those
blue colonies, which means <i>E. coli</i>.

243
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,138
Now, a second sample that I tested
was taken from a toilet,

244
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,982
and in this water we see
that there are lots and lots

245
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:14,699
of those blue colonies, <i>E. coli</i>,

246
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,452
more than 100 of them
in the 100 mL sample,

247
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,993
but none at all of those other coliforms,
and that makes sense,

248
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:24,432
because the toilet water
is full of fecal bacteria.

249
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:28,674
Once the data are recorded,
they can be analyzed and presented

250
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:31,494
but it's important to know
that the data are of good quality,

251
00:15:31,494 --> 00:15:34,605
so we have some consistency
and quality control checks

252
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,031
that should be applied.

253
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,050
A consistency check
is comparing the results

254
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,174
from the 100 mL test
against the 1 mL test.

255
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:45,520
Now, of course,
the 100 mL test should have

256
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,339
about 100 times as many bacteria
as the 1 mL test,

257
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,921
so if that ratio is very different,
there might be a problem.

258
00:15:53,402 --> 00:15:56,036
It's also good practice
to have some blank samples

259
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,401
to make sure that people
are getting zero counts

260
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:02,075
when the water is known to be
free from contamination,

261
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:06,905
and it's quite valuable to have
expert teams visit the field teams

262
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:09,018
as they're doing the field work,

263
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,654
to make sure that
they're doing the test correctly.

264
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,747
Once the quality of the data
is assured, though,

265
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:18,853
then we can classify the results
into risk classes,

266
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:25,359
and normally we look at <i>E. coli</i>
as meeting regulatory guidelines,

267
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:31,263
1-10, 11-100,
and 100+ colonies

268
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:35,014
representing increasingly dangerous
or high-risk samples.

269
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:40,241
The MICS team has developed
standard tables and scripts

270
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:44,317
for the statistical software
that analyzes the data,

271
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:48,944
to make it easier for countries
to standardize their analysis,

272
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:53,419
and then the results can be presented
either in a standard summary report

273
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:57,194
with the rest of the information
collected in the MICS survey,

274
00:16:57,194 --> 00:16:59,798
or in a special focused thematic report

275
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:03,969
that can go into more detail
about the water quality testing results.

276
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:08,841
So, we've seen a demonstration
of a testing package for <i>E. coli

277
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,762
that's easy to implement in the field

278
00:17:10,762 --> 00:17:14,059
without need for electricity,
laboratory facilities,

279
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:15,930
or highly-trained technicians.

280
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,733
By relying on pre-packaged materials,

281
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:23,047
the system reduces the opportunities
for contamination to be introduced,

282
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:24,869
though it's still important to include

283
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:29,627
quality control and assurance measures
like regular testing of blanks.

284
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,605
The system is not very expensive,

285
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:35,671
and especially when it can
be linked to an ongoing,

286
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:38,133
and already financed, field program,

287
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:41,658
the data collection
can be very cost-effective.

288
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,712
This system has been applied in MICS

289
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,945
and other national household surveys,

290
00:17:46,945 --> 00:17:50,588
but could also be useful
for general programmatic use.

291
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,937
As an example, in Bangladesh,

292
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,684
after this system was used
in a MICS survey,

293
00:17:55,684 --> 00:17:59,887
the UNICEF office used the materials
to do water quality testing

294
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:03,602
of water supplies that had been installed
in their program areas.

295
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:08,355
Of course, we need to remember
that a single measure of <i>E. coli

296
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:11,283
is not a robust measure of water safety.

297
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:13,552
For that you would want
water safety plans,

298
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:15,760
or at least sanitary inspections,

299
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,562
but for getting a rapid assessment
of drinking water quality

300
00:18:19,562 --> 00:18:21,735
or for monitoring an intervention,

301
00:18:21,735 --> 00:18:24,425
like a household
water treatment intervention,

302
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:28,384
even a limited amount of microbial testing
can be very helpful

303
00:18:28,384 --> 00:18:30,549
and can help identify problems

304
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:33,661
and direct resources
towards improvements.
