00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,681
I am happy to introduce 
our guest lecturer Dr Batsi Majuru,

2
00:00:07,687 --> 00:00:10,398
a technical officer 
at the World Health Organization.

3
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:15,870
Hi, I am Batsi Majuru 
from the World Health Organization.

4
00:00:16,044 --> 00:00:20,364
I work on the household water treatment 
and regulation of drinking water quality.

5
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:23,720
I am here today to talk 
about the International Network

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,300
and household
water treatment and safe storage.

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,815
In this module we'll take a brief look 
at the background of the Network

8
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:33,200
and why it was established.

9
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:36,694
We will discuss the mission 
and objectives of the Network

10
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:40,256
and look at a few examples 
of the Network's activities.

11
00:00:41,448 --> 00:00:45,435
The Network was established 
by the World Health Organization

12
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:47,849
with the objective 
of accelerating health gains

13
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:51,687
to those without reliable access 
to safe drinking water.

14
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:56,061
At the time of the establishment 
of the Network in 2003

15
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:59,256
the field of household water treatment 
and safe storage

16
00:00:59,256 --> 00:01:00,318
was rapidly evolving.

17
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:03,578
And it was difficult to keep up 
with the various developments.

18
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:07,857
Research was fragmented 
and not always accessible.

19
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:10,281
Practitioners were diverse,

20
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:13,031
and working initiatives 
were often disconnected.

21
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:17,189
And there was no coherent voice 
on all those various developments

22
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:19,239
to enable adoption of policy.

23
00:01:19,675 --> 00:01:22,891
The Network was formed 
as a global platform

24
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,311
to bring together these various 
entities and coordinate efforts.

25
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:31,562
The Network aims to contribute 
to a significant reduction

26
00:01:31,915 --> 00:01:35,645
in waterborne, in water related 
vector-borne diseases,

27
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,699
especially among vulnerable populations

28
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,826
by promoting household water 
treatment and safe storage

29
00:01:41,826 --> 00:01:46,914
as a key component of community targeted 
environmental health programs.

30
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,859
Vulnerable populations include children,

31
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:53,559
people whose immune systems 
are compromised

32
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:56,057
and of course those 
who do not have access

33
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,417
to safe and reliable water supplies.

34
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:02,479
The mission's statement 
of the Network also emphasizes

35
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,866
that household water treatment 
and safe storage

36
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:08,130
is not an alternative 
to improve water supplies,

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,060
but it is a complement 
to infrastructural improvements.

38
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:14,756
It also emphasizes 
that household water treatment

39
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,686
should be integrated within wider public
and environmental health programs

40
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:20,866
to maximize health impact.

41
00:02:21,672 --> 00:02:25,549
To fulfill this mission the Network 
has forced strategic objectives

42
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:29,486
that are centered around advocacy,

43
00:02:29,486 --> 00:02:36,106
communication, research, 
implementation and scaling up.

44
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:40,950
The network is coordinated 
by the World Health Organization

45
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:44,904
and the United Nations' 
Children's Fund (UNICEF).

46
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,079
Communication support within the Network

47
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,100
is provided by the University 
of North Carolina.

48
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,750
Today the Network has 
over 150 participating organizations,

49
00:02:56,753 --> 00:03:00,990
including academic institutions, 
the private sector,

50
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,246
non-governmental organizations, 
policy makers and donors

51
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,273
and brings together all these entities
to share experiences,

52
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,397
know-how and find new and effective ways

53
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:16,287
of getting safe water 
to those who need it most.

54
00:03:17,748 --> 00:03:23,123
Some examples of the network's activities 
include regional workshops

55
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:27,213
to support development 
of national policies and frameworks.

56
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:30,388
These workshops bring together 
government officials,

57
00:03:30,388 --> 00:03:33,385
donors and implementers
working in various countries

58
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:37,549
and have led the development 
of over twenty national action plans

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,760
and household water treatment 
and safe storage.

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,490
Here is a picture 
of one of these workshops in Lao.

61
00:03:52,143 --> 00:03:56,281
The Network has also developed 
resources and best practices,

62
00:03:56,281 --> 00:03:59,397
including the toolkit
for monitoring and evaluation

63
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:01,857
of household water treatment 
and safe storage.

64
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,422
In addition the Network 
has been advocating

65
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:08,432
for integration of household 
water treatment and safe storage

66
00:04:08,432 --> 00:04:10,949
within key public health efforts,

67
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:15,319
including maternal and child health, 
nutrition and HIV.

68
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,331
The latest research and activities

69
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:21,301
related to household water treatment 
and safe storage

70
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:24,581
is regularly shared 
through the Network newsletter.

71
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,342
If you are interested 
in finding out more about the Network

72
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:30,371
please visit the website.

73
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:32,248
You can sign up for the listserve

74
00:04:32,248 --> 00:04:33,408
and be able to receive

75
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:35,619
the regular newsletters 
and announcements,

76
00:04:35,619 --> 00:04:39,849
participate in webinars and hear 
what's going on in this field

77
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:43,853
and share your feedback 
on the Network's tools and resources.

78
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,533
So, in summary, 
ensuring that health gains

79
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:49,973
from household water treatment 
and safe storage

80
00:04:49,973 --> 00:04:52,584
are realized by those who need it most

81
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:57,774
requires coordinated effort 
across various disciplines and sectors.

82
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:02,998
The WHO/UNICEF HWTS Network 
is the global forum

83
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,798
that brings together 
these various entities.

84
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:07,224
Thank you.
