00:00:04,454 --> 00:00:07,570
Hello and welcome to the third week of the
course.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,230
Last week we looked at sedimentation and
filtration,

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,010
which are ways to remove suspended
particles from water.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,070
This week we focus in on disinfection
processes that result in

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:23,510
high levels of removal or inactivation of
the different classes of pathogens.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,450
We'll start by looking at heat.

8
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,510
Heat, in fact, kills.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,710
Through different mechanisms heat impacts
enzymes and

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,750
causes them to denature and become
nonfunctional.

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,340
It can affect the proteins that make up
cells

12
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,780
and cause them to unfold and change their
shape.

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,040
And also within a cell it can increase the
pressure which damages cells.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,970
We'll look at two broad classes of heat
treatment, boiling and pasteurization.

15
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,680
To understand how heat disinfection works
we have to

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,760
first think a little bit about temperature
and pressure,

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,530
and recognize that pressure affects the
boiling point.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,650
If the pressure is higher, then the
boiling point can be higher.

19
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,700
And in fact, this is how an

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,050
autoclave works with steam sterilization
and high pressure

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,380
about one bar above atmospheric pressure
and

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,730
that allows water to reach 121 degrees
Celsius.

23
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,090
And if it's kept there for 15 minutes

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,760
under steam it's a very effective
sterilization technique.

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,370
Conversely, if the air pressure is lower
the boiling temperature is also

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,090
lower and we'll discuss the implications
that that can have on boiling.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,490
With disinfection processes both
the amount of disinfectant present and the

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,750
time that the pathogens are exposed have
an impact on removal efficiency.

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,980
For heat disinfection then, we can think of
both

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,620
the temperature and the time of
exposure, and recognize

31
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,040
that at higher temperatures a shorter time
of treatment

32
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,510
is required to achieve an equivalent
amount of pathogen reduction.

33
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,874
The thermal death kinetics of heat
disinfection

34
00:02:07,874 --> 00:02:11,750
are assumed to follow first order or
exponential decay.

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:15,630
Which means that a fixed amount of

36
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,350
time is required to achieve one log
reduction value.

37
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,200
This is called a D value typically set at
121 Celsius.

38
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,330
And if a D value for one pathogen was ten
minutes,

39
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,170
then after ten minutes, 90% of that
pathogen would have been inactivated.

40
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:38,180
After 20 minutes, it would be 99%, and so
on, and so on.

41
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,047
The food canning industry is very
concerned about

42
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:45,160
thermal death kinetics because foods are
pasteurized before canning.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,000
And canned food can be on shelves for a
long time, months, even years.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,720
Before being consumed.

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,280
So the guidelines are very strict for
ensuring high levels of disinfection, with

46
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,320
a 12 D reduction of Clostridium botulinum
spores being a typical industry standard.

47
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,810
Drinking water treatment is normally less
strict.

48
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,690
Drinking water doesn't sit on shelves for
years before being consumed.

49
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,700
And typically seven log reduction is

50
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,500
considered as complete disinfection for
practical purposes.

51
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,220
Boiling is the oldest method of household
water treatment, and today

52
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,810
it's practiced by an estimated 600 million
people around the world.

53
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,540
It's particularly common in East Asia and

54
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,980
in Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Viet Nam, and
Indonesia.

55
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,700
More than 90% of the population report

56
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,170
boiling their water regularly before
drinking it.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,160
Boiling is effective against all classes

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,970
of pathogens, viruses, bacteria, and
protozoa.

59
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,030
And it's not effected by turbidity

60
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,930
in water, unlike some other disinfection
processes.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,870
However after water is boiled, it must be
cooled

62
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,130
before drinking, and it's often
transferred to a secondary container.

63
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,250
Where it is quite prone to
recontamination.

64
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,970
Finally boiling removes all dissolved
gases from water.

65
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,290
which changes the taste of
the water.

66
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,100
It can give it a flat taste, and if the
water is hard,

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,600
calcium and magnesium can precipitate out
forming

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,750
small white particles which can cause
esthetic problems.

69
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,810
In recent years, a number of studies have
examined

70
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,779
the effectiveness of boiling as applied in
different countries.

71
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,480
These studies have found significant
reductions in indicator

72
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,490
bacteria, usually thermo-tolerant
coliforms, but have also documented

73
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,310
substantial recontamination of water with
roughly half to 60,

74
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,539
maybe 70%, of samples having no detectable
indicator bacteria.

75
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,970
However, the level of contamination tends
to be

76
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,070
small with roughly 75% of samples falling
in

77
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,980
to the low risk class of having less than
ten colony forming units per 100 mLs.

78
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,560
Also, the log reduction values of one
to two

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,300
may also reflect relatively good quality
of the pretreated water.

80
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,190
If the pretreated water has low to medium
levels of contamination, it's very

81
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,469
difficult to demonstrate higher levels
of removal.

82
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,450
In many low and middle income countries,
when boiling is practiced, biomass, either

83
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,970
wood, or some crop residues or other
materials are used as the fuel.

84
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,130
And this can have substantial negative
impacts.

85
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,860
First there can be health impacts.

86
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,600
If biomass is burnt inside the house, a
lot of soot and smoke is generated.

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,040
Which has serious negative impacts on
health.

88
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,420
It's a risk factor for lower respiratory
infections.

89
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,480
Infections which are a major cause of
child mortality.

90
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,230
Biomass burning also has negative
environmental impacts,

91
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,940
where deforestation can be exacerbated by
widespread use of biomass

92
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,940
as well as the

93
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,760
release of CO2 and smoke into the
immediate environment.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,830
Finally, burning of biomass can be very
costly in terms

95
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,800
of both the fuel itself and the time
that's needed.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,910
Two of those studies from the previous
page,

97
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,830
done in India and Vietnam, also examine
the costs

98
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,420
of boiling and found that the fuel cost

99
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:40,740
alone was around .5 to 1.5% of monthly
income.

100
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,170
But that substantial amounts of time were
needed, either for collecting fuel, if

101
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,230
it's not bought, or for treating, taking
extra time to treat the water in the home.

102
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:56,490
And that these have significant economic
impacts equivalent

103
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,140
to possibly two to 5% of monthly income.

104
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,511
While boiling is highly effective
against all classes of pathogens, it's

105
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:10,700
not actually necessary to reach 100
degrees to get good log reduction values.

106
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:17,150
The mechanisms by which heat operates,
enzymes denaturing, protein damage,

107
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,130
an increasing pressure within cells are
having impacts at much lower temperatures.

108
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,010
In fact, it's possible to cook an egg at
72 degrees.

109
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,610
This is high enough to damage the
proteins,

110
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,290
causing the whites and the yolk to become
opaque.

111
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:39,810
Similarly milk pasteurization is done at
72 degrees for only fifteen seconds.

112
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:45,650
At a lower temperature of 63 degrees
Celsius, thirty minutes are required for

113
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,140
pasteurization and both of these achieve

114
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,120
roughly seven log reduction of common
pathogens.

115
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,580
Recall also, that the heat up time and

116
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,660
the cool down time, contribute to the
pathogen reduction.

117
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,020
So, it's really not necessary to bring the

118
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,460
water to a full boil to get effective
treatment.

119
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,580
The problem, of course, is that it's
difficult to know

120
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,010
when you've reached an effective treatment
temperature, like 70 degrees

121
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,710
for pasteurization.

122
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:21,090
One tool that can help is called a, a WAPI
or a water pasteurization indicator.

123
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,580
It's a small tube that has a little glob

124
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,320
of wax which melts at 70 or some specified
temperature.

125
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,480
Perhaps because of the difficulties in
determining

126
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,240
when an appropriate pasteurization
temperature has been

127
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,450
reached, there's been relatively little
experience with

128
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,180
pasteurization as a household water
treatment system.

129
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,920
One example comes from Bangladesh which
was

130
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,650
developed by professor Fakhrul Islam at
Rajshahi University.

131
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,660
And this is called the Chulli system.

132
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,030
And it takes advantage of readily
available

133
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,940
waste heat that comes from inefficient
cook stoves,

134
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,550
homemade clay stoves which reach a
temperature of about 600 degrees.

135
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,070
But more than 80% of that heat is wasted.

136
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,200
So Professor Islam developed a coil,

137
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,740
a metal coil made out of aluminum
which acts as a heat exchanger.

138
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,230
And when this coil is built into a cook

139
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,070
stove, water can be passed through the
coil during cooking,

140
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:24,720
and, water heated up to the pasteurization

141
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,069
temperature before it comes out the other
side.

142
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,490
Here's what it looks like in practice.

143
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,630
That coil is built into a clay cook stove
and

144
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,660
then attached to a reservoir for raw
water that then feeds

145
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,130
the water through a tube into the coil
during cooking

146
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,749
and it comes out through a tap into a
storage container.

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,940
Now, the nice thing about this system is it
doesn't take additional

148
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,870
fuel, because it takes advantage of heat
that's already being used for cooking.

149
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,080
However, an evaluation made in 2007 found
that while it

150
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,318
was microbiologically effective with a
medium of five LRV E. coli.

151
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:07,550
Only about 20% of people who received

152
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,300
the Chulli systems were actually
using them.

153
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,170
So compliance was a definite problem.

154
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,380
Heat disinfection is widely effective
against all classes of pathogens

155
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,010
with six to even more than nine log
reduction values possible.

156
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,660
Some of the pathogens which are
particularly resistant to other treatment

157
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,390
processes, filtration or chlorine for
example, are very vulnerable to heat.

158
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,140
So we see that cryptosporidium cysts can
be

159
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,200
inactivated after just one minute at 72
degrees.

160
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,610
And viruses are easily killed.

161
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,660
Some of them even at 60 degrees.

162
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,410
Many studies have been done on bacteria.

163
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,620
Many from the food industry and again,

164
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,670
these are vulnerable. There are some
special

165
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,200
examples of things like anthrax spores
which

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,750
can actually survive boiling for several
minutes.

167
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,350
But the pathogens of concern in drinking

168
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:06,250
water tend to be vulnerable to heat
treatment.

169
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,780
For a more detailed review of heat
sensitivity of different pathogens.

170
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,440
here are two articles, which are freely
available on the internet.

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,500
The top one also describes the Chulli Water
treatment system in more detail.

172
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:27,680
Now recall that pressure affects the
boiling temperature and

173
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,400
at lower pressure water boils at a lower
temperature.

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,620
Well, on this earth we have elevations
ranging from negative

175
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,850
427 meters to 8,848 meters on top of Mount
Everest.

176
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,360
And what impact does that have on boiling
temperatures.

177
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,300
Well, of course at mean sea level,

178
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,600
the boiling temperature is one hundred
degrees.

179
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,200
It's the same in Dhaka at four meters
above sea level.

180
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,700
It's pretty much the same in Dübendorf,
home of Eawag in Switzerland.

181
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,550
And if we look at some of the high cities
in the world,

182
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:06,500
Addis Ababa, La Paz, Aspen we see boiling
temperatures of around 90 degrees.

183
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,610
If we would go all the way to the top of
Mount Everest and boil some

184
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,270
water, it would be at 72 degrees, which

185
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,140
we have seen is an effective
pasteurization temperature.

186
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,530
At La Rinconada in Peru, the highest
continuously

187
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,170
inhabited place on earth Water boils at 83
degrees.

188
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,530
So, while it's true that water boils at
lower temperatures you're still getting

189
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:37,710
effective pathogen removal at any of these
temperatures if the water boils at all.

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,470
By the way, just for information altitude
also affects the amount

191
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,950
of oxygen available, the relative oxygen
compared to mean sea level.

192
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,710
So in a place like Addis Ababa, there's a
lot less oxygen around.

193
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,480
And, of course, if you're on top of Mt
Everest, you're only

194
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,340
having about a third as much oxygen as you
would at sea level.

195
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,100
So then, how long is it necessary to boil
water for?

196
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,510
Some organizations recommend 10 minutes,
20 minutes, or even longer.

197
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,970
And while this may be necessary to

198
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,990
really inactivate the most recalcitrant
of microbes, like

199
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,880
anthrax spores, it is not necessary for

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,360
the pathogens of most concern in drinking
water

201
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,550
leading causes of diarrheal disease.

202
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,450
Giardia,

203
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,870
Cryptosporidium,

204
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,560
enteric bacteria and viruses,

205
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,320
are all relatively vulnerable to heat.

206
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,470
Pasteurization, alone, should give
adequate protection for drinking water.

207
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,370
And anywhere in the world, where you can
boil water, the

208
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,270
water will reach at least 70 degrees, and
be effectively pasteurized.

209
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,300
Remember too, that pathogens die off
during the

210
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,280
warming up and boiling off phases as
well.

211
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,140
So by the time water boils, even a tiny
bit

212
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:55,730
at any altitude, most of the pathogens
have already been killed.

213
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,880
Now I don't recommend boiling water on top
of Everest.

214
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,260
Not least because there's hardly any
oxygen up there.

215
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,905
But for a water treatment practice it
would still count as pasteurization.

216
00:14:06,905 --> 00:14:12,400
W.H.O. recommends that water should be
brought to a full rolling boil.

217
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,150
And while this is actually more heat
treatment than is needed, it

218
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,360
does give a clear objective signal,

219
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,870
that the disinfection temperature has been
reached.

220
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,960
Some considerations then for heat

221
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,610
treatment both, boiling and pasteurization
then

222
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:32,630
are that it is highly effective against
all classes of pathogens, and

223
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,590
that it's not affected by turbidity as
some other treatment processes are.

224
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,920
However, it does take a long time,
especially

225
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,620
when cooling time is added or collecting
of firewood.

226
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,290
And it does change the taste of the water,
which some people might not like.

227
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,450
It's very simple to operate.

228
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,420
No special equipment is needed for
boiling, though

229
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,040
there is a possibility, a significant one,
of recontamination.

230
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,000
Finally, boiling is widely accepted,
understood,

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,870
and even promoted all around the world.

232
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,040
And maybe one of the most significant
challenges is the high

233
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,070
energy and time costs required to boil
water in the home.

234
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,260
So, in summary, we've seen that
heat kills.

235
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,550
It is an effective household water
treatment process, effective against

236
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,840
all classes of pathogens whether boiling
or pasteurization is used.

237
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,760
Boiling is very widespread.

238
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,210
It is the most commonly practiced of the
HWTS options.

239
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,490
But recontamination of boiled water is
also very widespread.

240
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,010
Pasteurization works well technically, but
is much less widely applied.
