00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,530
Hello.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,090
In this module we're going to discuss
sedimentation,

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,920
which is one of the water treatment
processes that

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,100
can be done in household treatment, or
also at

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,010
the community scale, as discussed in our
previous modules.

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,910
Sedimentation by itself is not a complete
water treatment.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,530
But it can be a necessary, preliminary
step to be followed by

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,210
filtration and disinfection before safe
storage

9
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,870
in the case of household water treatment.

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,000
To discuss sedimentation, we'll introduce
the concept of turbidity.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,840
We'll define turbidity and we'll show how
turbidity can

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,780
be reduced either through simple settling
using gravity,

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,940
by enhanced settling through the addition
of chemicals called coagulants.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,460
Turbidity is simply the presence of
suspended particles in water.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,300
If the particles are large, they can

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,440
eventually settle out of water through
gravity.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,980
But if they are small they will remain
suspended.

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,739
They won't settle.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,020
particles can be made of

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,240
organic materials, such as microorganisms
or algae.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,970
Or they can be inorganic, made of silt,
clay or other minerals.

22
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,080
There are a variety of units used to
measure turbidity.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,450
Nephelometric turbidity units are based on
scattering of light thru turbid water.

24
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,560
While formazin turbidity units are made
with reference to a

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,070
standard series of chemical dilutions
using the reference material formazin.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,000
Jackson turbidity units are historically
based on

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
sighting a flame through a volume of
water.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,880
But all of these units are roughly
comparable to each other, so you

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,859
don't need to worry too much about which
type of unit is being used.

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,990
Turbidity in and of itself isn't a health
risk.

31
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,610
It depends on which particles are causing
the turbidity.

32
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,870
So there are no health based targets
around turbidity.

33
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,830
However, turbidity can have significant
impacts

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,310
on treatment processes, including
filtration and disinfection.

35
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,850
So there are often operational guidelines
before such treatment is applied,

36
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,550
typically in the range of five to ten
turbidity units.

37
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:19,560
This is also the range at which turbidity
becomes notably visible, and

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,010
people may have aesthetic concerns when
they see that the drinking water is cloudy.

39
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,800
Of course, when people are habituated to
drinking

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,380
turbid water, this may not pose any
aesthetic problems.

41
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,280
Perhaps the simplest form of HWTS is
gravity settling or simple sedimentation.

42
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,430
Here you simply take a volume of water,
set it aside, and let gravity do its work.

43
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,460
Depending on the size of the particles,
particles

44
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,680
will then be removed by settling to the
bottom.

45
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,800
This process can remove some turbidity and
can improve the

46
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,250
visual appearance, but has a very limited
effect on pathogen removal.

47
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,030
Some of the very larger pathogens,
protozoa, helminth eggs, can be removed.

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,960
Also, when the water is being stored for
sedimentation to occur, there's

49
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,310
the possibility of introducing secondary
contamination,

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,810
if the storage container is not hygienic.

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,729
An example of simple gravity settling is
the three pot sedimentation method.

52
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,330
In this method, three different storage
vessels are used so

53
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,660
that drinking water has always been stored
for at least two days.

54
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,650
Which gives time for some pathogens such
as

55
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,040
schistosomes, the cause of Schistosomiasis
to die off.

56
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,860
So in this example one always takes
drinking water from pot number three.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,770
And when it's empty, you can slowly pour
water from

58
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,110
pot two into pot three, leaving the bottom
sediments untouched.

59
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,340
And then wash out pot two.

60
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,970
Then, pot two can be refilled, by slowly
pouring water

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,560
from pot one into pot two, and washing out
pot one.

62
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,225
Finally, you can pour water collected from
the source, from a bucket, number four,

63
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:15,690
into pot one and if it's very turbid you
could strain this through a clean cloth.

64
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,510
It's also possible to use a flexible pipe
to siphon water from one

65
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,300
pot to another, without disturbing the
sediments at the bottom of the container.

66
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,960
Gravity settling has only limited
reduction of turbidity,

67
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,620
especially when the particles forming
turbidity are small.

68
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,640
But, settling can be enhanced through the
use of chemicals called coagulants.

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,580
And what coagulants do, is they make the

70
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,890
particles in water stick to each other
better.

71
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,250
They also add new particles, so that there

72
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,280
are more particles around that can bump
into

73
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,470
each other, collide, stick, and form
larger particles

74
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,289
that are easier to settle out of solution.

75
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,910
Many small particles suspended in water,
like

76
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,810
colloids, have a negative charge on them,
and

77
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,640
two negatively charged objects will repel
each

78
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,250
other, so they can't stick to each other.

79
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,310
Coagulants add positive charges to this
mixture.

80
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,630
So the positive charge of a coagulant

81
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,090
can neutralize the negative charge of a
particle.

82
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:24,830
Or in some cases a larger coagulant
molecule can bridge between two negatively

83
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,100
charged particles, helping them to come
together and settle out of solution.

84
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,920
Coagulants can also remove some dissolved
compounds

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,590
and improve the color of the raw water.

86
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,260
It's possible to make coagulants from
locally grown plants.

87
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,270
One of the most commonly used plants for
this

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,970
purpose is Moringa oleifera, shown here on
the left,

89
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,990
which is grown widely in Africa and Asia.

90
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,520
It's called the drumstick tree in Asia,
because of those long seed pods.

91
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,958
To use moringa, you collect and dry the

92
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,400
seeds and grind them into a powder, and
then

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,190
add them to water to be treated, often at
a dose of about 200 milligrams per liter.

94
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,620
There are many other plants that are used
as coagulants.

95
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,150
The prickly pear cactus is commonly used

96
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,770
in Latin America, and Nirmali seeds in
India,

97
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,150
which aren't very effective as a primary
coagulant,

98
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,320
but can help if another coagulant is
present.

99
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,210
And there are other plants available in

100
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,690
different settings, that are also used as
coagulants.

101
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,880
The way that these plant based coagulants
work, is that the plant material contains

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,490
a compound, a chemical, it's often a

103
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,410
water soluble protein, that has a positive
charge.

104
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,220
In fact it might have many positive
charges and be polycationic.

105
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,610
And that can interact with particles that
have a negative charge

106
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,405
to make them stickier, and make
them settle some solution.

107
00:06:56,405 --> 00:07:01,460
Plant-based coagulants tend to be most
effective at higher turbidity when there

108
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,300
are more particles around to bump into and
stick to each other.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,310
So if the turbidity is at least 30 or 50
these coagulants will work better.

110
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,740
Some of the plant-based coagulants, such
as moringa,

111
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,980
may also have some antibacterial
properties as well.

112
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,300
But in general, they're not considered a
complete treatment,

113
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,620
but a precursor to be followed by a
disinfection step.

114
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,790
One disadvantage of the plant-based
coagulants, is that they

115
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,130
add a lot of dissolved organic carbon to
the water,

116
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,320
which can foster regrowth of bacteria and

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,790
eventually could cause taste and odor
problems.

118
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:45,090
Chemical coagulants are much more widely
used than plant-based coagulants.

119
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,830
And the most common of these are metal
salts using aluminum or ferric iron.

120
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,060
Aluminum sulfate in particular is widely
available

121
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,690
locally, because it has many household
uses.

122
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:02,130
One of them is that you can use alum when
shaving. If you cut

123
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:06,610
yourself shaving, and rub a little bit of
alum on it, it stops the bleeding.

124
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,540
So alum may be locally available.

125
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,110
Alum consists of aluminum and sulfate
and a number of water molecules.

126
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,380
And the way that it works is, it

127
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,620
creates this aluminum ion with three
positive charges,

128
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,920
which are very able to interact with those

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,110
negatively charged particles and help them
to precipitate.

130
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,620
Alum potash using potassium as well as

131
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,820
aluminum is another locally available
chemical coagulant.

132
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,810
Ferric salts works well, as well.

133
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,960
They tend to be a little bit less widely
available.

134
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,390
They work well over a broader pH range
than aluminum.

135
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:51,310
Chemical coagulants tend to
produce coarser

136
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,810
flocs, compared to plant based coagulants,
which means

137
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,170
that they settle faster, but it also means

138
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,600
that they create a larger volume of
sludge.

139
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,380
Let's take a look a short video that
demonstrates coagulation and flocculation.

140
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,040
This video uses a product called the PNG

141
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,000
purifier of water, produced by Proctor &
Gamble.

142
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,690
It's the HWTS product formerly known as
PuR, and it uses

143
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,310
a combination of coagulation with ferric
salts, and disinfection with chlorine.

144
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,900
Let's take a look.

145
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,390
And stirring it rapidly to dissolve the
salt, and allow it to

146
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,870
hydrolyze and create flux, and bump into
the particles in the water.

147
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,020
Then there's a period of slower settling
and bumping when the particles

148
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,830
get larger and larger, and finally form
flux that settle to the bottom.

149
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,850
The solution is then filtered through some
cloth and stored for a while

150
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,610
for the chlorine to be effective before
the water is safe to drink.

151
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,660
Coagulation is a complex physical and
chemical process, and

152
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,670
can be effected by very many different
operational parameters.

153
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,410
The temperature is important.

154
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,250
It doesn't work as well at low
temperatures.

155
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,110
And especially the characteristics of the
water,

156
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,480
the pH and the alkalinity are important
variables.

157
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,610
If the alkalinity is low, well,
coagulation consumes alkalinity,

158
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:25,780
so the pH can drop to very acidic
levels if there's insufficient alkalinity.

159
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,430
In that case it might be necessary to

160
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,100
add some lime or sodium carbonate to
increase alkalinity.

161
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,650
But if the alkalinity is too high, the pH
is

162
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,070
often high as well and chlorination would
be less effective.

163
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,630
Another important factor is the physical
mixing, it's important to

164
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,650
mix rapidly at the beginning so that the
coagulant dissolves,

165
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,240
and is spread evenly throughout the
mixture, and has a

166
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,290
chance to bump into and interact with a
lot of particles.

167
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,560
Then finally the dose should be optimized.

168
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,740
If there's too much coagulant, as well

169
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,290
as too little coagulant, it doesn't work
optimally.

170
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,040
So the best practice would be to do a
series of tests, called

171
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,010
jar tests with the actual water to be
treated to determine the optimal dose.

172
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,140
One issue that may arise in connection
with coagulation, where aluminum

173
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,320
salts are used, is that of residual
aluminum in drinking water.

174
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,570
Some studies have found a link between

175
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,410
aluminum exposure, and neurological
problems, including Alzheimer's disease.

176
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,340
However other studies have not found these
things.

177
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,430
The World Health Organization has reviewed
the

178
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,570
literature, especially focusing on
exposure through drinking water.

179
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,010
And so far has decided not to set a health
based guideline for drinking water.

180
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,990
In part, because drinking water
constitutes only a small portion of

181
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,870
the total intake of aluminum, with food
being a much larger factor.

182
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:04,860
However WHO does recommend for aesthetic
reasons, that residual

183
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,380
aluminum be kept to certain levels in
finished water,

184
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,620
because it impacts the visual appearance
of the water.

185
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,840
And in a large, well-managed system,
it's easy enough

186
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,120
to keep residual aluminum below 0.1
milligrams per liter,

187
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,400
and in smaller systems below 0.2
milligrams per liter, through a

188
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,010
combination of dose optimization, and

189
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,700
following coagulation with a filtration
step.

190
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,890
If you'd like to see the WHO's rationale
for not setting a health-based guideline

191
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,560
in more detail, take a look at the text
from the WHO guideline values.

192
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,000
So in summary, sedimentation is a
pre-treatment step,

193
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,500
which is often necessary before moving on to filtration, 
disinfection, and safe storage.

194
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,350
The purpose of sedimentation is to remove
suspended solids, and this

195
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,970
can be done either through gravity
settling, or through use of coagulants.

196
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:16,160
Either plant based coagulants, or salts
such as aluminum, or ferric salts.

197
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,080
Sedimentation does result in some pathogen
removal, but

198
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,550
should not be considered as a complete
treatment.

199
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,900
However, it does allow subsequent
treatment steps to be more effective.
