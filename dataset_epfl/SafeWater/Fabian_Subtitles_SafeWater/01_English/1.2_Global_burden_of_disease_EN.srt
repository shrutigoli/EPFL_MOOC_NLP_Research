1
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:07,760
In this module, we'll talk about 
diseases caused by unsafe water,

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,917
sanitation and hygiene, 
and how they can be classified,

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:15,294
as well as the burden of disease due to
unsafe water, sanitation, hygiene,

4
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:17,716
both in terms of deaths or mortality

5
00:00:17,716 --> 00:00:19,652
and disease or morbidity.

6
00:00:20,232 --> 00:00:24,584
They say that three things in life 
are certain: birth, taxes and death,

7
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:28,441
and somehow some people manage 
to avoid taxes.

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:31,002
But deaths are inevitable.

9
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:35,402
There are about 55 million people 
who die every year

10
00:00:36,296 --> 00:00:39,199
but there are even more people 
who have babies every year.

11
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:43,269
About 135 million new babies
are born each year.

12
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:47,324
So that means overall there 
is about a 1.1% increase

13
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,277
in the global population each year,

14
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:53,165
and the population will double 
every sixty years at current rates.

15
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,817
One useful way to classify diseases
was was proposed by the authors

16
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:01,196
of the 1972 classic book 
“Drawers of Water”.

17
00:01:01,196 --> 00:01:04,152
According to environmental 
transmission pathways

18
00:01:04,152 --> 00:01:09,266
this so called “Bradley Classification” 
includes four types: water-borne,

19
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:13,016
water-washed, water-based
and water-related diseases.

20
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:18,559
Now some of those 55 million deaths 
per year are caused, at least in part

21
00:01:18,559 --> 00:01:21,110
by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.

22
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:24,499
And we can think about different ways
to classify those diseases.

23
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,508
First, we can talk about 
the water-borne diseases

24
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:31,192
which are diseases caused 
by actually drinking, ingesting water

25
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,965
that has some pathogens in it.

26
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:36,808
These include the diarrheal diseases 
caused by different pathogens:

27
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:39,982
Rotavirus, Cholera, 
Shigella or Cyptosporidium

28
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,799
but also Hepatitis A and E

29
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,083
and even Polio can be transmitted 
through drinking water.

30
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,265
For any of these water-borne diseases

31
00:01:48,265 --> 00:01:53,491
an intervention to reduce the disease then
could involve improving the water quality.

32
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:58,470
Next we have the water-washed diseases
which are caused by poor hygiene

33
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,830
due to lack of water 
rather than by direct ingestion.

34
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,757
Most water-borne diseases 
are also water-washed

35
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,840
because they can be transmitted 
through hands

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,026
and contact with other surfaces.

37
00:02:09,456 --> 00:02:13,291
Trachoma is the leading cause 
of preventable blindness globally

38
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:17,313
and is transmitted by flies 
which land on people's faces.

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,635
And acute respiratory infections 
are also transmitted through contact

40
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:24,558
with pathogens on hands 
and other surfaces.

41
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,898
Water-washed diseases can be reduced

42
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:31,868
by increasing the amount of water 
that is available to improve hygiene.

43
00:02:32,823 --> 00:02:35,551
Water-based diseases 
are those caused by parasites

44
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,300
which live part of their 
life cycle in water.

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,513
The most serious of this 
is the Schistosomiasis or Billharzia

46
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:47,443
which affects 160 million people 
globally, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

47
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,431
Another serious water-based disease
is Guinea Worm, or Dracunculiasis,

48
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,076
which is a horrible disease 
which used to affect many people,

49
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:59,953
3.5 million people in 1986,

50
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:04,686
but cases are now down 
to only 542 in 2012

51
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:09,361
and those are confined to about 
four countries mainly in South Sudan.

52
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,880
For water-based diseases 
control-mechanisms

53
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,748
involve targeting 
the aquatic organism host

54
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:19,996
and protecting surface water bodies
from contamination.

55
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,589
Finally, there are water-related diseases, 
which are caused by insects

56
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:27,512
which breed in water, 
especially mosquitoes.

57
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,624
The most important of these is malaria,

58
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:37,308
which affects about 250 million people 
each year, causing about 589,000 deaths.

59
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:40,781
The great majority of those 
are in Sub-Saharan Africa

60
00:03:40,913 --> 00:03:43,594
and affect children 
under the age of five.

61
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:48,412
Another important mosquito disease 
is Dengue fever,

62
00:03:48,412 --> 00:03:51,882
which is growing in numbers 
and can cause explosive outbreaks

63
00:03:51,882 --> 00:03:53,870
especially in urban areas.

64
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,545
In both cases, the mosquitoes breed 
in certain types of water,

65
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:01,762
and a control mechanism 
is to remove their habitat.

66
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:06,077
So in summary, there are many diseases 
which are caused at least partially,

67
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,374
by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.

68
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:13,333
Water-borne diseases are those 
that are caused by directly drinking

69
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,791
or ingesting contaminated water.

70
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,952
And those diseases could be controlled

71
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,801
at least partially, by treating the water
at the household.

72
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:24,793
Household water treatment though
shouldn't be expected to have an impact

73
00:04:24,793 --> 00:04:29,742
on other diseases that are water-washed,
water-based, or water-related.

74
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,111
Now let's take a little break.

75
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:35,709
You see on your screen 
five different infectious diseases,

76
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:37,327
and I'd like you to think for a minute

77
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:41,237
about which of them cause 
more or less deaths each year.

78
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:44,324
Arrange them in the order 
of number of deaths per year.

79
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:54,706
The most recent global mortality figures
were released by the WHO in 2014

80
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,612
and estimate deaths 
over the years 2000 to 2012.

81
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,227
You can see that Lower 
Respiratory Infections such as pneumonia

82
00:05:02,227 --> 00:05:05,730
were by far the largest cause of death
among these diseases.

83
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:09,075
Diarrheal disease cause about 
1.5 million deaths,

84
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,923
followed by Tuberculosis, 
Malaria and Measles.

85
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,729
Diarrheal disease is the most important
of the water, sanitation

86
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,434
and hygiene-related diseases,

87
00:05:17,434 --> 00:05:20,099
and a major contributor 
to the global burden of disease.

88
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:24,153
Diarrhea is among the main causes
of child mortality globally,

89
00:05:24,153 --> 00:05:26,872
second only to acute 
respiratory infections.

90
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,288
It's responsible for about one 
out of every ten deaths

91
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,187
among children under the age of five.

92
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,884
That's about 1000 child deaths per day.

93
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:39,754
The WHO estimates that 56% 
of deaths due to Diarrhea worldwide

94
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:43,087
are attributable to inadequate water,
sanitation and hygiene.

95
00:05:43,087 --> 00:05:46,520
So it's clear that poor access 
to the basic services

96
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,627
have a major impact on global health,

97
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:51,018
especially through preventing 
the transmission

98
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,139
of water-related infectious diseases.

99
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:56,286
So far we've been talking about 
burden of disease

100
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:58,741
in terms of deaths or mortality,

101
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,117
but it's also important 
to consider sicknesses

102
00:06:01,117 --> 00:06:04,867
which can greatly reduce 
the quality of life or morbidity.

103
00:06:05,501 --> 00:06:07,173
We can do this through a metric

104
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:10,801
that's called Disability Adjusted 
Life Years, or DALYs.

105
00:06:11,634 --> 00:06:14,268
What DALYs do is combine two aspects.

106
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,710
First, the Years of Life Lost

107
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:20,329
in comparison to 
a Standard Life Expectancy

108
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:23,819
and second, the Years of Lost to Disability

109
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,893
which are the number of years 
you live with the disability

110
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:31,285
times a weight for how serious 
that disability is.

111
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:34,401
Well, let's consider this 
with some examples.

112
00:06:34,411 --> 00:06:39,848
First, consider a person who has 
a normal life expectancy of 80 years

113
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,188
and has no particular disabilities.

114
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:47,476
Then this person lives 
a fully healthy life for 80 years

115
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,948
and has zero years of life lost 
or years lost to disability.

116
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,253
So they have no DALYs.

117
00:06:56,991 --> 00:07:00,315
Second, let's consider the example 
where someone also

118
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:06,262
has a life expectancy of 80 
and lives a very normal life,

119
00:07:06,262 --> 00:07:07,292
to begin with,

120
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:12,944
but then has some kind of sudden accident 
at age 70 and dies prematurely.

121
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:16,057
Then they have years of life lost.

122
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,555
How many? 
Ten years of life lost.

123
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:23,843
There's no disability here 
so the number of DALYs is ten.

124
00:07:25,574 --> 00:07:29,190
Okay, this time let's consider a person 
who lives a normal healthy life

125
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,313
until age 50, when they have 
some kind of accident

126
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:38,476
which leads to a loss of a foot, 
amputation of the foot.

127
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:43,115
Now the disability weight 
for the foot amputation is 0.3.

128
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:44,804
So it goes up to there.

129
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,264
But then that person lives 
to the expected life expectancy of 80.

130
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:55,854
So here we have years of life lost 
to disability. How many?

131
00:07:56,701 --> 00:08:04,000
Thirty years from age 50 times 
the weight of 0.3 for foot amputation

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,254
is a total of nine, so that's 9 DALYs.

133
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:16,376
Finally, a more complicated example
is a person who lives a normal life

134
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:20,607
until age 36, 
when they contract HIV AIDS.

135
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:25,787
Full-blown AIDS without any medicine,
without antiretroviral therapy

136
00:08:25,787 --> 00:08:28,000
has a weight of 0.5.

137
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:33,528
But after four years, that person then 
is able to get medication

138
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:38,321
and have a much better quality of life 
with the weight of 0.167.

139
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:44,552
Then that person lives until age 70,
dying prematurely.

140
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,945
Thirty-six and forty.

141
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:54,064
So here we have years lost 
to disability,

142
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:57,085
and here we have years of life lost.

143
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:01,865
How many? Ten years of life lost.

144
00:09:02,632 --> 00:09:04,894
How many years lived with disability?

145
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:09,894
We have four at that high rate, 
that's a total of two,

146
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:17,577
plus thirty at a lower rate, 
that's five, for a total of seven.

147
00:09:18,526 --> 00:09:24,117
So then the DALYs equals to ten 
plus seven for seventeen.

148
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:28,605
So you can imagine 
the diarrheal disease then,

149
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:32,125
which impacts a very young children 
in many cases,

150
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,345
will also have a high contribution 
to DALYs

151
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:37,977
because of the large number 
of years of life lost.

152
00:09:39,577 --> 00:09:43,564
Now that we have a metric for morbidity,
the DALYs, we can examine

153
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:46,256
the overall burden of disease 
posed by diarrhea

154
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:49,166
and compare it to other diseases globally.

155
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,882
Now that 2013 WHO report 
about deaths globally

156
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:58,888
hasn't yet been analyzed 
to develop DALY estimates.

157
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:02,770
So we have to look at 
an older WHO report from 2008

158
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,081
shown up here, where they reported 
that diarrhea disease caused

159
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,671
over 52 million DALYs per year,

160
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,999
which again the distribution 
was very similar

161
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:16,736
to the mortality numbers we've seen
with a little bit more than 3%

162
00:10:16,736 --> 00:10:23,016
of the global total and about 9% 
of the burden of disease for children.

163
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,165
This report also listed country-wise DALYs

164
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:32,357
and you could see that India was by far
the largest country in terms of DALYs,

165
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:35,649
in terms of disease burden 
followed by other large countries: 

166
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:38,199
China, Nigeria, Pakistan,

167
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:43,831
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, 
which all had more than 3 million DALYs.

168
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:50,509
In fact, in DRC, the contribution of DALYs 
to the overall disease burden

169
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,727
was more than 10% of all DALYs.

170
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:57,824
So far we've been talking about numbers 
generated by the WHO,

171
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,190
either their 2000 report on mortality

172
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,037
or earlier reports for morbidity
or risk factors.

173
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:07,764
But there is another large important
and recent data set out there,

174
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:11,187
it's called the Global Burden 
of Disease 2010 Study

175
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:14,900
and it was done by the Institute 
for Health Metrics and Evaluation

176
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,253
or IHME based in Seattle, Washington.

177
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:22,498
The GBD 2010 Study 
was a massive undertaking

178
00:11:22,498 --> 00:11:25,516
involving hundreds of scientists 
from all around the world

179
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,574
including many WHO researchers.

180
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:32,817
However, even though it uses 
similar approach to the WHO models,

181
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,433
WHO hasn't endorsed the findings

182
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,345
in part because of some 
methodological differences

183
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:41,292
and in part because 
they weren't given access

184
00:11:41,292 --> 00:11:45,230
to the data and the findings 
to validate them for publication.

185
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:50,622
Some of the main differences 
between the two studies are that, first,

186
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:55,948
IHME calculated new disability weights 
for various health conditions.

187
00:11:56,381 --> 00:12:00,346
This was done through 
a participatory online process,

188
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:03,939
as well as through field surveys 
in a number of countries.

189
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:10,176
Second, while WHO considered hygiene,
water and sanitation risks,

190
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:15,186
IHME found that the data available 
for hygiene practices,

191
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:18,058
nationally representative data sets 
were too weak,

192
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:20,422
so they decided not to include 
this risk factor.

193
00:12:21,598 --> 00:12:24,923
And then finally, in the IHME model,

194
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:28,558
people accessing a basic level of 
water and sanitation,

195
00:12:28,558 --> 00:12:33,746
such as improved sources of water 
like a borehole or a protected spring,

196
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:36,976
or improved sanitation, a basic pit latrine,

197
00:12:36,976 --> 00:12:40,778
they were considered to suffer 
no burden of disease

198
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:42,663
due to their water and sanitation.

199
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,387
This was not the approach followed in the WHO models.

200
00:12:46,857 --> 00:12:49,994
Nonetheless, this was a massive 
and important undertaking

201
00:12:49,994 --> 00:12:52,161
and we can learn a lot 
through its findings.

202
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,720
Let's take a look at them.

203
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:58,826
Let's take a look at the GBD 2010 data 
from the IHME website.

204
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,916
You can find it just by searching IHME.

205
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,966
Then let's go straight 
to their data visualization.

206
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:15,425
They have many different 
visualizations tools.

207
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:17,237
We'll look at GBD Compare.

208
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,679
Now in GBD compare, 
this is what's called a tree map

209
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,760
and if you hover over different diseases

210
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,217
you can see the percent 
of their contribution

211
00:13:28,217 --> 00:13:29,582
to the burden of disease.

212
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:34,495
Here let's put a focus 
on diarrheal disease,

213
00:13:35,697 --> 00:13:38,614
now that box will always have 
a square on it,

214
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,771
and we can change 
between DALYs and deaths,

215
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:48,469
we can look at global 
or specific countries or regions,

216
00:13:48,834 --> 00:13:50,550
we can change years,

217
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:54,680
we can see that if we look at 
"Under five children"

218
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,254
the contribution of diarrheal disease 
is much larger.

219
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,783
So you can find out a lot of things 
from this kind of map.

220
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:08,574
Down below, we have different options 
for secondary visualizations.

221
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,862
We could look at Time Plot for instance,

222
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:15,543
and see the number of deaths
decreasing over time

223
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,982
here shown as Rates or as Numbers.

224
00:14:19,654 --> 00:14:24,332
Decreasing from 1.7 million 
under five deaths in 1990

225
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:28,144
to about 666,000 in 2010.

226
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:35,694
We can also look at the Map and see 
which countries have greater

227
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:38,108
or lesser burdens of disease.

228
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:42,139
Here we can see that India, 
who has a 150,000 child deaths

229
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,325
is by far the largest contributor 
to burden of disease,

230
00:14:46,325 --> 00:14:48,441
but if we look at Rates,

231
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:55,008
then we would see more high rates
in Sub-Saharan Africa

232
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:57,975
and the same 
if we look at proportion of DALYs.

233
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,254
What both of these data sets tells us
is that the burden of disease

234
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,767
from unsafe water, 
sanitation and hygiene is high

235
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,370
and that diarrheal disease

236
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,169
is the leading contributor 
to that disease burden

237
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,867
both in terms of morbidity 
and mortality.

238
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,170
You can now access these reports 
or websites

239
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,950
to get more detailed information 
if you need.

240
00:15:19,616 --> 00:15:21,773
In our next module, 
we will be looking at

241
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,466
some of the specific pathogens

242
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,934
that cause diarrheal disease 
in drinking water.
