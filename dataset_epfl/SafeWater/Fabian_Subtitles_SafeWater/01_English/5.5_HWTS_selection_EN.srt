1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,190
In weeks two and three of this course, we
looked in

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,900
some detail at the processes and

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,490
mechanisms involved in different HWTS
technologies.

4
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,400
Each technology has its own strengths and
challenges.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,920
And when HWTS technologies are being
considered or selected,

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,900
those should somehow feed into a decision
making process.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,700
Selection of HWTS options can happen at
different levels.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,830
At the household level an individual can
decide

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,580
to use or not to use a given technology.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,270
But frequently decisions on technologies
are taken at

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,260
a program level or even by central
governments.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,510
And how can these decisions then be made

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,940
in a rational way at these different
levels?

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,420
Well, the first thing to do is to be able
to say what is wanted.

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,550
What are the characteristics of an HWTS
option that are important for selection?

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,210
For application of HWTS in a particular
context.

17
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:12,200
And that involves clearly defining, and
establishing the context both in terms

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,300
of the water to be treated but also
all those other factors,

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,810
which are outside the control of an
intervention

20
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,330
like the policy environment, existence of
supply chains, etcetera.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,660
Once the context is clear, a selection
among potential

22
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,830
HWTS options can be made by defining
objectives or criteria.

23
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,370
And then there's usual more than one
criteria.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,300
So combining those in some way

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,280
and assessing different options against
those

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,819
different criteria, and taking a decision.

27
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,880
This can be done in a formal way through a

28
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,480
multiple criteria decision analysis
approach

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,860
or informally and even subconsciously.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,750
Selection of an HWTS option is highly
context specific.

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,610
Of course, the context includes the

32
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,500
characteristics of the water to be
treated.

33
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,500
An important factor here is whether or not
the water is likely to be turbid.

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,580
But also the level of contamination is
important.

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,610
Some processes can achieve higher LRV's
than others.

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,180
Apart from the water quality,

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,840
the way that the water is assessed and

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,220
the quantities available and needed can
also influence selection.

39
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,190
Then there are other contextual factors
not related to the

40
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,300
water, such as those described in the IBM
WASH model,

41
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,740
like the wealth and education of the
target population, the

42
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:44,460
access to markets, supply chains and
information, the policy environment.

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,390
And, to these, I would add nature of the
supporting organization.

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,960
Because a social business and a profit
oriented business

45
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,970
might choose very different options based
on their differing objectives.

46
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,270
Here are some examples of sets of criteria
that

47
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,710
have been put forward by various groups
working on HWTS.

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,840
There are many such examples and I just
selected five here,

49
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,190
that were fairly well documented from
these organizations or research groups.

50
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,960
Let's take a brief look at each of them.

51
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,480
You've seen this WHO training manual by
now, a few times hopefully.

52
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,060
It really contains a lot of useful
material.

53
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,930
And in the section on selecting an HWTS
options,

54
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,370
the authors identify five sets of criteria
shown here.

55
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,480
First, effectiveness.

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,820
How effective are the different HWTS
options for

57
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,159
the water to be treated in the given
context?

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,570
Next, appropriateness.

59
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,100
These are also
contextual factors,

60
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,600
related to the conditions and desires of
the target populations.

61
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,140
Things like local availability and supply
chains, the amount

62
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,190
of time required for treatment,

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,260
requirements for operation and
maintenance.

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,500
And the lifetime of the option.

65
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,930
Appropriateness is closely related to
acceptability.

66
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,070
Which the authors takes to include
aesthetic aspects of

67
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,620
the treated water, it's taste, it's smell,
it's color.

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,190
But also perceptions of convenience,
health gains,

69
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,650
social status, time and money savings,
etcetera.

70
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,810
Of course, the cost is important,

71
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,310
there are different types of
costs.

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,520
Upfront and recurring costs to the
household.

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,480
But also costs to the supporting agency,
which

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,520
may include subsidies, and an appropriate
business plan.

75
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,390
Finally, implementation is a bit of a
catch-all class of criteria.

76
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,300
It includes things like how the technology
is manufactured and

77
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,060
distributed to the households, how fast
the technology can be implemented.

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,030
What kind of monitoring is required for
the technology.

79
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,149
How well it can be integrated with current
government programs, etcetera.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,310
I encourage you to go to the

81
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,940
manual itself for a fuller discussion of
these criteria.

82
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,610
Here's another set of criteria.

83
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,450
This one from Professor Mark Sobsey at the
University of

84
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,380
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and
colleagues, from a few years back.

85
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,080
They came up with a set of five, sets of

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,620
criteria that should be satisfied for HWTS
to be sustainable.

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,740
I let you just read them on the screen

88
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,610
and refer to the paper for a more detailed
discussion.

89
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,830
The Netherlands Water Partnership has a
nice brochure on HWTS.

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,950
We can download it here.

91
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:46,660
And, they propose a set of 13 indicators
grouped into

92
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,600
the categories of performance, people, and
planets.

93
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,730
Now, this is a bit different from the
first two in

94
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,410
that this category of planet considers

95
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,900
brings in environmental considerations, as
well.

96
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,180
At EAWAG, I was part of a large project

97
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,410
on mitigation of arsenic and fluoride,
called Water Resource Quality.

98
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,330
Some of you have asked for information

99
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:15,240
about HWTS for improving chemical water
quality.

100
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,340
And it's a really interesting topic.

101
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,870
But, unfortunately, beyond the scope of
this course.

102
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,690
You can get some good information from the
Water Resource Quality website here.

103
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,170
And one of the journal publications that
came out of this project, that

104
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,940
you can see here, describes a process for
selecting a water treatment option.

105
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,420
Even though the technology in question was
for fluoride removal,

106
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,819
the process could still be useful for
selecting HWTS options.

107
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,160
The author has identified 12 criteria.

108
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,880
Grouped into three broad classes

109
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,900
of Affordability, Acceptability and
Reliability.

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,160
One last example now.

111
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,500
This is from the US NGO PATH,

112
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,290
which implemented the safe water project,
that did a lot

113
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,699
of great work about commercialization, of
HWTS in developing countries.

114
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,860
Spend some time at their website, there's
a wealth of information.

115
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,420
In particular, they've established generic
design guidelines for HWTS.

116
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,450
If you ever find yourself building or
designing an

117
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,190
HWTS system, this is a really useful set
of information.

118
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,850
Some of the, highlights of this projects
were

119
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,900
summarized in a special report of PATH's
Perspective magazine.

120
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,220
You can download that here from their
website, definitely worth the read.

121
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,570
As part of the Safe Water Project, one of
the PATH staff, Stephen Himley,

122
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,180
completed his Master's degree in Public
Health in the University of Washington.

123
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,880
And his topic was a very detailed and
rigorous examination

124
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,290
of how to select an HWTS option for a
given context.

125
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,590
He described three main

126
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:01,530
criteria, acceptability, availability, and
affordability.

127
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:06,560
And then he broke down acceptability into
six sub-components,

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,790
so that there are a total of eight
criteria.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,900
Okay, so there are lots and lots of lists
of criteria out there.

130
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,400
So what?

131
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,540
Again the important thing isn't to decide
which set of criteria is the

132
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,980
best or the most efficient, but to

133
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,800
identify for a particular application of
HWTS.

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,490
Which criteria are the most important for
selecting an HWTS

135
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,850
option, and it might not be the same set
everywhere.

136
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,410
I hope that these examples can help you
develop a

137
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,440
set of criteria if you ever find
yourselves in that position.

138
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,480
And if you do, and you come up with a

139
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,360
set of criteria, well, then what do you do
with them?

140
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,580
Well, there are different ways to assess
each

141
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,840
possible HWTS option against the selected criteria.

142
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,330
This can be done in a fairly easy,
non-quantitative way

143
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,909
with landscaping, or through a more
complex and formal optimization process.

144
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,220
A slightly different approach is to use a
decision tree.

145
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,520
Posing a series of sequential questions
that allow

146
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,420
you to narrow down the list of potential
technologies.

147
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,410
Now, here's an example of landscaping.

148
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,220
Again, from the PATH safe water project.

149
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,920
It's their Technology Assessment and
Ranking Tool or TART.

150
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,400
Now please, don't try and read the
text of it.

151
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,740
It's just an example of landscaping.

152
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,950
But it's a table which contains 18
criteria,

153
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,490
or dimensions plotted against 15 different
HWTS systems.

154
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,380
And each of those systems is rated
qualitatively,

155
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,140
good, neutral or bad, for each of the
dimensions.

156
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,350
And then they are colored green, yellow,
or red like the traffic light system.

157
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,020
And in the landscape the different
criteria are not combined or weighted

158
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,250
into an overall score, but everything is
displayed on this one dashboard.

159
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,720
So you can see that a technology like this
one, which is mostly green, or,

160
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,100
maybe, this one with just one red is
probably a better option.

161
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,130
Than this one here, where you see lots of
red or, or maybe this one.

162
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,370
Now, landscaping doesn't select a
particular optimal choice.

163
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,460
And it could be that some of the

164
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,740
criteria up here are more important than
other ones.

165
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,370
And you would need to consider that when
interpreting a landscape matrix.

166
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,830
One way to overcome that problem is to
make more

167
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,130
formal optimization with quantitative
scoring, and weighting of different criteria.

168
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,550
There are different frameworks for this
with different names.

169
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,130
This one here is Multi-Criteria Decision
Analysis.

170
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,650
But, the basic idea is usually something
like this one.

171
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,260
We've talked already about establishing a
decision context.

172
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,390
And of course you have to come up

173
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,050
with a list of potential options for
consideration.

174
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,550
And then we've also talked about
objectives or criteria.

175
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,760
Once you have criteria, you can score each
option each

176
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,570
technology for each of the criteria using
some objective system.

177
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,690
And then weight the criteria so that the
ones that are more important count more.

178
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,760
Then by summing up the weighted stores,
you arrive

179
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,720
at a total score and then look at the
results.

180
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,320
It's also a really good idea to do a
sensitivity analysis.

181
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,440
To see if one particular criterion is
dominating the selection process.

182
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,330
Here is an example of scoring, again,
from, Steven Himley's MPH thesis.

183
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,550
And again, don't try to read the text,
it's just an example that

184
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:52,820
for each of these eight criteria here
There are rules to assign a score.

185
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,860
For example the top row here is the time
to treat and if the

186
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,240
technology takes more than 20 minutes to
treat water you get a poor score.

187
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,488
Whereas if it takes less than five minutes
it gets an excellent mark.

188
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:12,300
From that same thesis, here is an example
of weighting.

189
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,760
The three main criteria were assigned

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,542
different weights, always summing up to
100%.

191
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:25,160
For different contexts, urban and rural
lower and low income settings.

192
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,160
So, you can see that affordability is
given the

193
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,070
highest most important weight in a low
income, rural context.

194
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,110
Whereas acceptability is given the
highest

195
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,390
weight in a low income urban context.

196
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:46,710
And this acceptability criteria, had six
sub criteria, which were

197
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,050
also given different weights for each of
those four contexts.

198
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,130
These weights then could then be combined
with

199
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,650
the scores and presented as a total score.

200
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,170
Here you see total scores for two
scenarios.

201
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,430
On the right you have turbid water, and on
the left, non-turbid water.

202
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,570
You could have a different optimal choice,
depending on the turbidity.

203
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,700
So it looks like in this case chlorine is
a liquid or

204
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,430
tablet ends up being the best option in
all of the scenarios.

205
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,580
Now that might sound funny because
chlorine has problems with turbid water.

206
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,620
And what probably happened is that
technical

207
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,570
effectiveness here is only one of the
criteria.

208
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,330
And apparently didn't have a high enough
weight to overcome

209
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,670
the greater affordability in particular of
chlorine compared to other options.

210
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,480
If you can see, if you look just at the
acceptability scores.

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,230
That some of the non-chlorine options do

212
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,070
a little better than chlorine in the
turbid scenarios.

213
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,220
But this example does highlight that a
formal optimization process is tricky.

214
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,530
And can sometimes come up with
recommendations

215
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,420
that might not seem intuitive or correct.

216
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,710
A simpler approach to selection is the
familiar decision tree.

217
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,930
By asking a series of questions, you can
narrow down

218
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,590
the group of potential options appropriate
for a particular context.

219
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,760
Here's a decision tree adapted from that
IFRC report

220
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,423
on HWTS in emergencies, which you saw in
module 4.3.

221
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,825
Here, if the water is muddy, the tree says
that straining, the

222
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:31,460
3-pot method, coagulation, and
sedimentation or

223
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,710
filtering with frequent cleaning should be
promoted.

224
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,730
And these technologies are all appropriate
for turbid waters.

225
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,480
If the water is not turbid the next
question is,

226
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,960
whether or not HWTS products are available
from outside the community.

227
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,900
If they're not, then you get directed
towards boiling, if fuel is available.

228
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,860
Or three pot methods, sedimentation,
SODIS, and filtration, if fuel isn't.

229
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,220
If HWTS products are available.

230
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,190
Then the tree directs you towards
chlorine.

231
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,210
Either with a normal, or a double dose,
depending on the turbidity.

232
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,330
In all cases, safe water storage and
handling is to be promoted.

233
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,660
So that's one example of a decision tree
for

234
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,460
a particular context, that of HWTS in
emergency response.

235
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,350
It shouldn't be applied universally but it
could be

236
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,930
a good model for developing a context
specific decision tree.

237
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,390
That could be used by decision makers
perhaps

238
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,240
more easily than a full quantitative
optimization process.

239
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,600
So in conclusion, it's not so easy to say
which HWTS option is best

240
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,079
and there is certainly no silver bullet,
no answer to apply in every situation.

241
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,790
The the best solution will
depend on the local context

242
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,940
but also on the criteria that are
considered to be the most important.

243
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,850
And these criteria might be given
different weightings,

244
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,180
particularly if a formal optimization
approach is applied.

245
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,930
But there are also less formal approaches
like landscaping and decision

246
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,360
trees, that can be used to narrow down the
list of options.

247
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,500
In many cases, the goal should not be to
arrive at one single option.

248
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,570
But to narrow down a long list to a short
list.

249
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,340
So that people still have some freedom to
select the

250
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,450
option that works best for them in their
particular household situation.
