00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,320
Sandec & EPFL are partnering to bring
you a series of online courses or MOOCs.

2
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,300
This MOOC is dedicated to household
water treatment and safe storage or HTWS.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
So who might be interested 
in this course?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Maybe you work with communities in a region

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,279
that doesn't yet have reliable and safe water supply?

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,940
Maybe you're involved with emergency response
and need short-term solutions for

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,800
treating water when public supplies are
out of commission.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,989
Maybe you work with people who are particularly 
vulnerable to diarrheal disease,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,160
such as people living with HIV/aids.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,500
Or perhaps you are a researcher interested in developing

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,390
and improving solutions for situations
like these.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,510
In this course we will learn about the different pathogens found in

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,620
drinking water that cause disease.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,180
We will discuss different pathways of

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,379
exposure to these pathogens and how
these pathways can be blocked.

16
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,680
We will also examine the burden of disease
caused by unsafe water

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
as well as the related problems of poor sanitation and hygiene.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,500
Household water treatment is practiced by millions, 
even billions of people around the world.

19
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,900
In this course, you will learn about the
different ways

20
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,720
that water can be treated at the household level.

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,259
We will examine the roles that can be played by

22
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:21,720
non-governmental organizations, businesses

23
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,500
and government agencies.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,120
We'll hear from people with expertise on reaching those

25
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,000
affected by natural disasters.

26
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,850
And you'll also meet guest speakers 
from the World Health Organization,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,320
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

28
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:38,000
and other places specializing in HWTS.

29
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,720
You'll learn more about measuring 
water quality using portable equipment.

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,400
And you'll get to find out what 
this device is and how it works.

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,620
So I hope you'll join us for
this short course on household water treatment

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,000
and how it can be applied
around the world.

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,840
We look forward to working with you!
