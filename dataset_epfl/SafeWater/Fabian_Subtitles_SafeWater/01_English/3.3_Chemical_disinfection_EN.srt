1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,780
Today we look at Chemical Disinfection.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,940
And in particular chlorine, which is the
most widely used disinfectant globally.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,080
We'll explore a bit the chemistry of
chlorine and chlorine dosing.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,610
We'll look at different forms of chlorine,
gas, liquid, and solid.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,050
And review the effectiveness of chlorine
in reducing pathogens.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,260
Finally we will give an example of
chlorine use in Haiti.

7
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,800
Chlorine has been used for over a century
for the treatment of drinking water.

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,140
Beginning in the UK and USA in the early
20th century.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,248
Today, chlorine is used in 98% of U.S.
water

10
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:45,279
utilities and in similarly high
numbers across the world.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,620
Chlorine is also widely used at the
household level.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,450
Of course, many households use bleach for
cleaning and laundry.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,965
But in surveys conducted in low and medium
income countries

14
00:00:56,965 --> 00:01:01,380
5.6% of respondents reported adding
chlorine to their

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,640
drinking water to make it safer to drink.

16
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,340
This was the second most common

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,990
household water treatment practice
mentioned, after boiling,

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,920
and was particularly high in Latin
American and Caribbean countries.

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,740
Chlorine is a strong oxidant.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,930
And it reacts rapidly with different kinds
of

21
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,180
organic material, including cell wall,
DNA, and enzymes.

22
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,260
That's also why it's good at

23
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,660
cleaning things, it really destroys
organic compounds.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,610
But actually, in part because it's so
reactive, the

25
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,330
key mechanisms in pathogen inactivation
are not well understood.

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,730
Especially for viruses and protozoa.

27
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,499
When we talk about chlorine, we can refer
to many different things.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,210
Large drinking water utilities typically
use

29
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,340
elemental chlorine, present as chlorine
gas.

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,080
Which is cost effective, and includes, by
definition, 100% chlorine.

31
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,870
The next most concentrated form, also used
in

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,780
many utilities, is high test hypochlorite,
or HTH.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:11,160
Which contains about 60 to 70% chlorine
and comes in powders or tablets.

34
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,440
Bleaching powder or chlorinated lime or

35
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,640
calcium hypochlorite is another powdered
form.

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,060
And is often marketed as around 35%
chlorine.

37
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,350
But the chlorine isn't stable and actual
concentrations vary widely.

38
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,988
Sometimes as low as 15%.

39
00:02:28,988 --> 00:02:31,880
It makes calculating doses difficult.

40
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,190
Household bleach is a solution of sodium
hypochlorite, usually around 5% chlorine.

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,970
And Javel water is a similar product,
typically a little bit less strong.

42
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,790
Finally, it's possible to make chlorine
locally by

43
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,880
passing in an electrical current through
simple salt solution.

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,890
This usually results in something less
than 1% chlorine.

45
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,920
Whatever the chlorine source, when it is
added

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,050
to water, it becomes hypochlorous acid, or
HOCl.

47
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,210
And hypochlorous acid loses a proton at
higher pH

48
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,330
and becomes hypochlorite or OCl, with a
negative charge.

49
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,018
These two species together are called Free
Chlorine.

50
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:26,300
At pH 7.54, the two species are present in
equal amount.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,040
At higher pH, hypochlorite dominates.

52
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,210
While at lower pH, hypochlorous acid is the
main species.

53
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,810
This is important because hypochlorous
acid, the one with

54
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,200
the proton attached, is a much stronger
disinfectant than hypochlorite.

55
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,180
For this reason it's recommended that
water should always have

56
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,560
a pH of less than eight when chlorination
is being applied.

57
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,610
So that there's a reasonable amount of
hypochlorous acid present.

58
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,970
Chlorine is highly reactive, and when
added to water, a lot

59
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,610
of the chlorine will react with natural
chemicals in the water.

60
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,130
So, the dose has to big enough to meet
both the chlorine demand of the water.

61
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,280
And to produce a residual that is strong
enough to kill the target pathogens.

62
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,170
Chlorine demand can be caused by organic

63
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,550
carbon, which is naturally present in
surface waters.

64
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,770
But also by iron and manganese, or
ammonia,

65
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,069
which tends to be more present in ground
water.

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,970
It's normally recommended that to have a
residual

67
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,620
concentration of at least 0.5 milligrams
per liter.

68
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,200
And this can require a dose of any where
from one to

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,199
five milligrams per liter with two
milligrams per liter being fairly typical.

70
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,860
Turbidity reduces the effectiveness of
chlorine both

71
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,860
by shielding pathogens directly and by
consuming chlorine.

72
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,280
So standard doses are normally doubled
when the water is turbid.

73
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,290
Ideally, the right dose will be determined
through trial and error.

74
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,780
By adding different amounts of chlorine to
the water

75
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,160
to be treated to see what yields the
desired residual.

76
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,130
Chlorine doesn't pose any 
health risks itself

77
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,820
though the concentrated forms can be
dangerous to handle.

78
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:22,070
WHO does list a guideline value of five mg
per liter.

79
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,220
But this is conservative and would
probably result in

80
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,689
unacceptable tastes or odors at this level
in any case.

81
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,340
The use of chlorine in household water
treatment was first developed by

82
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,570
the US Centers for Disease Control, and
the Pan American Health Organization.

83
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,150
They proposed an intervention, including
three elements.

84
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,410
Chlorine disinfection, and this was later
expanded to include other HWTS processes,

85
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,750
Safe storage, and behavior change
communication.

86
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,630
This model has been widely taken up,

87
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,160
especially through Latin America and parts
of Africa.

88
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,760
And typically involves production of a
dilute

89
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,480
sodium hypochlorite solution around 0.75%
free chlorine.

90
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,680
Now, because hypochlorous acid is much
more reactive and also more volatile

91
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,330
than hypochlorite, the shelf life is much
longer at high pH.

92
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,600
So these solutions are typically
stabilized at pH 11 or greater.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,350
For similar reasons household bleach has a
pH around 12.

94
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,100
And it's slightly irritating to the skin.

95
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,480
In different countries, different brands of
liquid chlorine are promoted.

96
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,820
Some of the common brand names are Water

97
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,190
Guard, Clorin, Claro and in francophone
countries, Sur Eau.

98
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,810
The bottles are normally designed so that
one capful

99
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,060
is a good dose for the locally used
storage containers.

100
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,007
For example, a five milliliter capful of
0.75% free chlorine

101
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:09,880
added to a 20 liter jerry can gives a dose
of 1.9 milligrams per liter.

102
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,550
And, again, this dose should be doubled if
the raw water is turbid.

103
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,030
There is another form of chlorine

104
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,650
which isn't used in conventional water
treatment,

105
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,040
but is popular in swimming pools and
increasingly in household water treatment.

106
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,760
This is a chemical with a long name.

107
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,290
It's called sodium dichloroisocyanurate.

108
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,590
So you can see why people call it NaDCC
instead.

109
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,058
And it's about 60% free chlorine by
weight.

110
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:41,600
The other 40% is a chemical, cyanuric
acid,

111
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,709
which bonds with free chlorine and
provides a reservoir.

112
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,150
Thus, as free chlorine is consumed

113
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,970
through chlorine demand or inactivation of
pathogens,

114
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,690
the reservoir can release more free
chlorine into the water.

115
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,540
Cyanuric acid itself doesn't pose a health
risk.

116
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,800
The guideline value of 40 milligrams per
liter is well

117
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
above levels that would be reached in
drinking water treatment.

118
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,340
Because of this reservoir effect, any DCC
allows

119
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,790
a more steady and consistent free chlorine
level.

120
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:20,609
Which may lead to fewer reports of taste
and odor problems.

121
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,610
NADCC is produced in the form of
effervescent tablets or fizzy

122
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,800
tablets, which are individually wrapped
and have a long shelf life.

123
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:35,280
They come in a wide range of
concentrations.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,260
The most popular are 33 and 67 milligram
versions.

125
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,470
Which are good for 10 or 20 liters of
water, respectively.

126
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,780
Aquatabs, shown here, is one of the
leading

127
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,080
brands globally, but there are others as
well.

128
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,970
NaDCC tablets are easy to use and have
proven particularly popular in emergency

129
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,140
settings, but now are increasingly used
routinely at the household level.

130
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,040
Chlorine efficacy, like other
disinfectants is a combination

131
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,700
of the concentration and the time of
exposure.

132
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,170
For chlorine the dose can be expressed as
a

133
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,200
CT value in units of minute, milligrams
per liter.

134
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,220
For conventional drinking water treatment,
a common goal is to

135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,090
have a residual of 0.5 milligrams per
liter free chlorine.

136
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,480
In contact with water for at least 30
minutes to ensure a good pathogen kill.

137
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,730
Multiplying these together gives a Ct
value of 15 minute milligrams per liter.

138
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,660
Which is also equivalent to 15 minutes at
one milligram per liter.

139
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,150
In HWTS, a typical dose is around 1.9
milligrams per liter,

140
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,770
which gives a larger Ct of 56 minute
milligrams per liter.

141
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,590
How effective is this dose?

142
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,940
Well this chart shows the Ct99.

143
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,550
That's the Ct dose necessary to achieve
99% kill.

144
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,680
And you all know instantly by now that

145
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,040
that means a two log reduction value,
right?

146
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,980
Well bacteria are very sensitive to
chlorine.

147
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,130
And a Ct of less than 0.08 is necessary to
achieve 2 LRV.

148
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,240
But viruses are significantly tougher.

149
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,980
It takes a Ct of from 2 to 30 to get our
two log reductions.

150
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:43,120
And protozoa are tougher still, with Ct99s
from 25 to 245.

151
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,030
And that doesn't include cryptosporidium
cysts,

152
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,020
which are basically unaffected by
chlorine.

153
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,325
One study even reported a Ct value of over

154
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:56,680
15,000, just to achieve 3 log reductions
of cryptosporidium.

155
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,650
Now recall, our typical dose was in the
range

156
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:06,190
of 15 to maybe 60 milligrams per
liter.

157
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:10,140
So you can see that chlorine is not very
effective against some protozoa.

158
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,930
Now to be fair, not all protozoa are as
resistant as cryptosporidium.

159
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,390
Giardia, for example, has a Ct 99 of about
15.

160
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,730
So on balance, chlorine can achieve from
two

161
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,750
to five LRV for protozoa though not for
cryptosporidium.

162
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:36,030
Bacteria are more sensitive to chlorine
and removal can easily exceed six LRV.

163
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,120
Viruses have intermediate resistance
Disinfection might take a

164
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,119
bit longer, but still good removal can be
achieved.

165
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,030
Up to now we have been talking about free

166
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,070
chlorine which is that combination of
hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite.

167
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,680
But when free chlorine reacts with
ammonia,

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,920
it creates a different form called
chloramines.

169
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,230
And there is a whole family

170
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,105
of chloramines with monochloramine,
dichloramine, and trichloramine.

171
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:09,720
These are called combined chlorine, and
they're a less efficient disinfectant.

172
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,110
But they're still used in some countries
because they're long

173
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,560
lasting and can be useful, say, in a
distribution network.

174
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,810
However, the chloramines have a stronger
odor, especially Trichloramine.

175
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,160
In fact, trichloramine and a bit of
dichloramine

176
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,240
is what's responsible for that swimming
pool odor.

177
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,870
If you ever smell a strong indoor swimming
pool,

178
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,190
it's not the bleach itself for the
hypochlorine.

179
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,550
It's the combined chlorine.

180
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,560
Combined chlorine isn't typically used in
household water treatment.

181
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,119
Though it can be formed unintentionally if
the water has high ammonia levels.

182
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,300
There's another important potential,
unintended reaction

183
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,310
that can happen with free chlorine.

184
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,530
If there are high levels of dissolved
organic carbon in the water being treated,

185
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,410
then the free chlorine will react with the

186
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,630
carbon and produce what are called
disinfection byproducts.

187
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,190
Such as trihalomethanes or haloacetic
acids.

188
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,710
And some of these compounds have been
shown in laboratory studies

189
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:18,870
to cause cancer in laboratory animals when
applied at high doses.

190
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,570
So accordingly, WHO and many governments
have derived health based

191
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,040
drinking water guideline values for these
compounds in drinking water.

192
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,520
And these are typically set at a level
which would be expected to cause one

193
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,010
additional case of bladder or kidney
cancer for every 100,000 people,

194
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,690
who drink two liters of water per day at

195
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:46,139
that guideline value for a 70 year
lifetime period.

196
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,170
And while that is a real health risk, it's
still very small

197
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,270
compared to the mortality rates caused by
diarrhea and other waterborne diseases.

198
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,740
Here's what the World Health Organization

199
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,765
has to say about disinfection
by-products.

200
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:11,765
[BLANK_AUDIO]

201
00:14:13,535 --> 00:14:16,569
>> The Jolivert Safe Water for Families
Program has

202
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:21,182
sold sodium hypochlorite to households in
rural Haiti since 2002.

203
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:28,170
The program began at the Missions of Love
health clinic, in Jolivert northern Haiti.

204
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,570
And since 2008, it has been managed by the
NGO, Deep Springs International.

205
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,560
The program makes its own chlorine through
electrolysis of salt water.

206
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,210
Which is branded as Gadyen Dlo, meaning
water guardian in Haitian Creole.

207
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,260
Project team members enroll families by
selling safe

208
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,250
storage containers or Bokit Espesyal with
lids and taps.

209
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,690
The team also sells bottles of Gadyen Dlo
keeping sales records for each family.

210
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,430
And conducts regular household visits to
monitor use and provide ongoing education.

211
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,760
One bottles costs about $1.25 and contains
enough chlorine to treat

212
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,170
an average family's drinking water for
about a month and a half.

213
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,450
By May 2010, the program had reached over
4,000 participants and had

214
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,100
sold enough Gadyen Dlo to treat 12 million
liters of drinking water.

215
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:28,910
In 2010, an impact evaluation was done in
northern Haiti

216
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,800
and reported a few years later in a
scientific journal.

217
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,590
The team found that 3/4ths of the randomly
selected households

218
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:42,231
in the program area reported that they
were currently using Gadyen Dlo.

219
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:47,880
And 56% of these households compared to
just 10% in controlled

220
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,750
areas had free chlorine residuals between
0.2 and 2 milligrams per liter.

221
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,540
Indicating that they were applying
chlorine correctly.

222
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,810
This evaluation was made after the
earthquake in January

223
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,560
2010, but focused on areas not affected by
the quake.

224
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,930
The Gadyen Dlo program was extended to the
earthquake zone.

225
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:15,130
And accelerated greatly after the onset of
cholera in the region in October 2010.

226
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,170
Half a million bottles of Gadyen Dlo

227
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,920
were distributed in the affected areas for
free.

228
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,210
Use of Gadyen Dlo in the earthquake
effected zone has

229
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,220
continued but this may be due to continued
distribution of free product.

230
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,580
It's an open question whether people will
be willing to

231
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,490
pay for Gadyen Dlo once the free
distribution period ends.

232
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,950
While chlorine is by far the most

233
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,290
commonly applied chemical disinfectant.
There are other ones,

234
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,510
especially in commercial treatment,
chloramines or

235
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,610
chlorine dioxide in some cases.

236
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,360
And ozone is gaining in popularity.

237
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,410
But these are not typically applied, at

238
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,860
a household level, in lower and middle income
countries.

239
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,620
There are some emerging products that use
bromine as an alternative to chlorine.

240
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,730
Some filters have this.

241
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:15,290
And silver has at least a bacteriostatic
and maybe a bactericidal effect.

242
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,020
And is often combined with another
treatment, such as in ceramic filtration.

243
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,610
So certainly one of the main advantages

244
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,500
of chlorination is it's highly effective
against bacteria,

245
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,920
including cholera and has been

246
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,030
demonstrated to really stop cholera
outbreaks.

247
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,380
However, it's ineffective against at least
some

248
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,220
protozoa and requires longer contact times
for viruses.

249
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,660
Chlorine does give a residual protection

250
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,613
which can help minimize recontamination or
regrowth.

251
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:50,910
But it has a characteristic taste and odor
which people

252
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,990
may find unpleasant if they are not
accustomed to it.

253
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,310
It's fairly simple to apply chlorine but
it

254
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,779
does require that the water has low
turbidity.

255
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,690
Chlorine application is low cost, but

256
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,480
does require supply chains to replace
consumables.

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,420
And then finally, there's

258
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,170
often misunderstanding about disinfection
by-products.

259
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,610
And the relative importance of these.

260
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,539
Which can cause resistance to chlorination
programs.

261
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,280
So, in summary, chlorine is a widely used

262
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,090
disinfectant in both conventional
treatment and household water treatment.

263
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,560
Chlorine can be obtained from a wide
variety of sources, but all

264
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,809
of these produce free chlorine in water,
which is the active disinfectant.

265
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,770
Chlorine is highly effective against
bacteria including vibrio cholera

266
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,660
and also is effective against viruses and
some protozoa,

267
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,250
but is not effective against
cryptosporidium

268
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,820
which is a major cause of disease.

269
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,070
Cryptosporidium cysts are larger and
should be removed

270
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,840
through filtration processes especially
following coagulation and flocculation.
