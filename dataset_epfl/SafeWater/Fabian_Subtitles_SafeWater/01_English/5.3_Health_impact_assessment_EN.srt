1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,250
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,230
My name is Sophie Boisson, I work at

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,360
the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,170
And today I'm going to talk about health

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,400
impact, of household water treatments, and
safe storage intervention.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,080
You have seen from previous lectures,
the three,

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,000
let's say the three elements to achieving
health impact.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,770
First of all, while of course water has to
be contaminated by microbes and it has to

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:38,840
be a predominant route of transmission
for diarrheal diseases and pathogens. 

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,350
Second, we need to have a technology that
is effective at treating those pathogens.

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,640
And third, we need to make sure that

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,920
people are using those technology
consistently and correctly.

13
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,910
So this slide is to remind

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,870
you that transmission of a fecal-oral
pathogens is complex.

15
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,860
As you can see from this diagram
household water

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,750
treatment and safe storage addresses only
one pathway of many.

17
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,070
So, the key question is how much diarrhea

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,860
can be prevented by improving water
quality alone?

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,600
Over the past 30 years, there's been a lot
of

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,580
studies measuring the impact of water
quality intervention on diarrheal disease.

21
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,280
And this figure show show the results from
different

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,930
systematic reviews that were published in
the last ten years.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,600
And key findings from those reviews were
that overall

24
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:47,580
water quality interventions were
associated with about

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,480
a reduction in diarrheal disease of 30,
40%.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,600
They also found that there were some
differences

27
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,745
in terms of impact between

28
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:09,340
water quality intervention at the source
and those at the household level.

29
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,170
The impact on diarrhea was generally found
to

30
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,850
be higher when intervention focused at the
household level.

31
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,140
They also found that there were

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,570
some differences between different
treatment methods.

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,640
Now we're going to talk a little bit more
about the studies

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,131
that measure the impact on diarrheal
disease looking

35
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:43,760
specifically at the type of design the
outcome being measured, and

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,180
highlighting some of the key challenges in
conducting health impact studies.

37
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,560
So in terms of evaluation designs the gold
standard for measuring

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,140
health impact of intervention is the
randomized control trial.

39
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,100
So we have a group of participants,
households or

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,040
villages that are randomly allocated to
two different groups.

41
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,980
One group will receive the intervention
and the other group will act as a control.

42
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,800
The unit of randomization can vary.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,160
And the participants may or may not be
blinded to the intervention.

44
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,540
And we will cover that in later slides.

45
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,010
We can have other type of study design
such as observational studies which

46
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:42,680
includes comparing diarrheal
disease rates

47
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,590
among all participants before and after
the introduction of an intervention.

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,040
We have case controlled studies which
identify cases and non-cases

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,510
of diarrhea and compare the exposure,
adjusting for potential confounding.

50
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,430
And we have ecological studies.

51
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,640
We also have modelling studies and I think
you've already covered

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,700
that in the last session using examples of

53
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,660
studying the impact of different levels of
compliance on diarrheal disease.

54
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,340
So, all the studies have been looking at

55
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,698
the impact on diarrhea, but what is
diarrhea?

56
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:32,250
Diarrhea, is a function of stool
consistency, and frequency.

57
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,290
So WHO definition is the passage of three

58
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,144
or more loose stools, within a 24-hour
period.

59
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:44,810
And as you can imagine, it's pretty hard
sometimes for people to

60
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,920
remember how many loose stools they've
passed in the last day.

61
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,540
And also stool consistency, okay, it may
vary, may vary by diet

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:03,810
and so that's why it's very hard to
measure it reliably.

63
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,910
So potential issues is associated with
measuring

64
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,920
diarrhea, so we have reporting bias.

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,260
So reporting bias may happened for
example in the randomized control

66
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,590
trial when participants in the
intervention

67
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,790
group receive a brand new filter.

68
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,470
They may be more likely

69
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,050
to report that, to the reporter, the
enumerator

70
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,390
who comes to visit them, that they feel

71
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,290
healthier, that they, that their health
has improved.

72
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,860
It can be because they want to please

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,560
the enumerator and that's often called a
courtesy bias.

74
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,370
On the other hand,
participants in

75
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,770
the control group who have who have not
received anything

76
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,120
may be more likely to complain and say
that their

77
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,680
health has not improved because they
haven't got any filter.

78
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,110
The placebo effect, it's possible that
participants

79
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,610
who've received a filter

80
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,440
or chlorine tablets for example, may
consciously

81
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,646
or subconsciously think that their health
is improving.

82
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:26,880
The Hawthorne effect which is

83
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,930
interesting because a lot of studies
have looked at most of those

84
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,780
studies measure diarrhea over time, and
what they often find is

85
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,800
that diarrhea decreases in both
intervention and control group over time.

86
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,616
And one possible explanation for that is
the Hawthorne effect, which is

87
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:54,480
participants may adopt, safer water
handling

88
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,280
or hygiene practices if some
researchers come to their house regularly.

89
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:08,080
It's also possible that over time
participants are tired of seeing

90
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,620
the enumerators regularly and and they
don't want to bother answering

91
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,110
questions or they just want to answer very
short, or give

92
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:22,240
very short answers so that the interview
doesn't last very long.

93
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,899
So these are potential issues to be
considered when, when measuring diarrhea.

94
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,520
So here is to illustrate this
reporting bias that I mentioned before.

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,630
So the systematic review conducted by
Clasen and colleagues in 2006

96
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,620
shows that report report the impact on
diarrhea

97
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,708
according to whether the intervention
was blinded or not.

98
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:04,190
So blinded means that the

99
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,900
participants and assessors, double blinded
means that participants and assessors

100
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,170
do not know which treatment
they have received.

101
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:20,620
Whereas open means that everyone knows
what treatment they've received.

102
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,790
So what they found was that

103
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,488
there was an important
difference in effect size.

104
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:34,370
While open trials reported diarrhea
reduction in the

105
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,830
range of 30, 40%, blinded trial reported
no effect.

106
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,710
And although there were
certain issues with those blinded

107
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:51,130
studies, other researchers have
documented

108
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,440
that the lack of blinding of subjective
outcomes such as diarrhea tend

109
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,520
to exaggerate the magnitude of the
effect by 25%.

110
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,550
Now researchers, a group of researchers,
Hunter

111
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,940
and colleagues, they used this estimate to
adjust

112
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,550
the 30, 40% estimate that was

113
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,760
obtained from open trial, and found that
after

114
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,810
adjustment for this bias, due to lack of

115
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,833
blinding, the effect on diarrhea dropped
to 15%.

116
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,090
So of the many studies that have been
conducted looking at the impact of

117
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:44,790
water quality intervention on diarrhea the
effect estimates often vary.

118
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,640
And so why do we get very different
reduction

119
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,720
in diarrheal disease from those different
studies?

120
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,860
Well first of all, they may be conducted
in

121
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,950
different settings where the transmission
dynamics may be different.

122
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,480
So the transmission routes or the
importance

123
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,200
of different transmission routes may be
different.

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,230
For example, in a setting where
sanitation and hygiene

125
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:21,250
condition are poor, are very poor and
where water quality

126
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,070
is not a major

127
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,000
concern, then of course 

128
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,020
lack of sanitation and lack of hygiene are

129
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,771
more likely to be predominant

130
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,914
routes of transmission for diarrheagenic
pathogens.

131
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:47,322
Also the etiology for diarrhea may be very
different

132
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:52,832
depending on the regions as the GEMS-studies
have shown.

133
00:10:52,832 --> 00:10:59,218
Second, the treatment methods may not be,
as you've seen

134
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:06,520
before treatment methods are not effective
against all class of pathogens.

135
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,560
So you've seen the example of chlorine,
which is less effective against

136
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,469
protozoan cysts, so in a certain area
where the study is conducted

137
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:22,740
Cryptosporidium is a major etiology for

138
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,286
diarrhea, then a chlorine intervention
maybe less effective at reducing diarrhea.

139
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:32,510
Then third: compliance.

140
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,020
Of course if the technology or if the
treatment methods

141
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:43,080
is not being used correctly and
consistently, then

142
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,270
we don't expect to see any, any
improvement or any impact on diarrhea.

143
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,267
And in fact,Arnold and colleagues and
Hunter, later Hunter

144
00:11:56,267 --> 00:12:01,460
and colleagues in 2009, they have illustrated
that

145
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:10,170
the impact of diarrhea tends to diminish
over time.

146
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,260
And one potential explanation for it
is that compliance

147
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:22,490
when, the longer the studies are
conducted the

148
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:28,660
less compliant participant become and
the less likely they are to use

149
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,680
intervention, which may explain why
diarrhea decreased over time.

150
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:41,010
And then there may be also some difference
between efficacy versus effectiveness

151
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,950
trials where efficacy studies

152
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,040
may lead to a higher reduction in diarrhea
because conditions

153
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,220
are more controlled and more, let's

154
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,880
say, perfect compared to effectiveness
trial which measures

155
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,060
impact on real life situations where
the intervention

156
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,250
may not be so delivered perfectly.

157
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,550
So, so we've seen that measuring health
impact is not easy.

158
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,460
So measuring diarrhea in

159
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,590
particular is very challenging in the
field.

160
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,240
It's very easy to do because

161
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,430
you could just collect this information
through surveys.

162
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,416
However, there's lots of challenges.

163
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:42,340
And so there's several ways through

164
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,870
which we could improve the way we measure
the health impact of the intervention.

165
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,760
First, we talked about blinding.

166
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,120
Okay.

167
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,710
There's been lots
of studies now

168
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:02,175
trying to blind intervention, so blinding
chlorination tablets,

169
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,460
blinding filters and there are a number of
challenges associated to that.

170
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,551
So one of the challenge for example with

171
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:20,378
filters, it will be really hard to
create the placebo filter that

172
00:14:20,378 --> 00:14:25,880
that is not effective,

173
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,920
or doesn't to some degree reduce
contamination of the water.

174
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,520
And also it may be really hard to blind
it effectively

175
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,100
so that participants are not able to find
out which filter they received.

176
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,270
And also there's some, it's potentially

177
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,430
unethical for example if participants

178
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,120
who were boiling suddenly receive an

179
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,570
intervention, they may reduce

180
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,100
this practice and use the recommended

181
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,980
tablet, which may be a placebo or inactive
tablet.

182
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:25,250
And by switching intervention

183
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:29,600
among the placebo group, a participant may
be at increased risk of diarrhea.

184
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,170
Another option, if blinding has some
challenges, is to use alternative health

185
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:45,540
outcomes, so not only rely on diarrhea,
but use a more objective health outcome.

186
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:51,020
So one of them is nutritional
indicators.

187
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,020
So for example, weight for age.

188
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,730
which can be used as a proxy marker
for diarrhea.

189
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,420
And in fact there has been a study
conducted by Schmidt and colleagues in

190
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,940
2010 showing that the more they
looked at the 14 days windows

191
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:20,250
and they found that the more days you had
diarrhea

192
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,330
during that period the lower was your
weight.

193
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,040
So this is still being
explored and

194
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,270
see whether this indicator could be a
useful proxy for diarrhea.

195
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,510
But obviously because weight is

196
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,300
influenced by another, by a lot of other

197
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,410
factors such as diet, et cetera, it may be
not sensitive enough to

198
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,630
to reflect changes in diarrhea.

199
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,330
And then we have height-for-age, which is
an indicator of

200
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:07,730
stunting or impaired growth among
children.

201
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,720
And there's been a few 
studies that have

202
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,826
looked at the impact of solar
disinfection on

203
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:23,380
stunting but there's very few
studies,

204
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,630
and I think the evidence so far remains weak.

205
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,860
It's, at the moment,

206
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,590
there's a lot of interest in looking at
environmental enteropathy, which is the

207
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,890
clinical condition characterized by a
damage

208
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:49,215
of the gut resulting in

209
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:55,686
leakage of nutrients and
malabsorption.

210
00:17:55,686 --> 00:18:01,827
And there's an increased interest in
measuring impact of water culture

211
00:18:01,827 --> 00:18:08,097
or other environmental health intervention
on this on this condition.

212
00:18:08,097 --> 00:18:13,185
A third possibility is to look at

213
00:18:13,185 --> 00:18:18,909
certain specific pathogens either in
stools or look at

214
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,404
serological markers for exposure to those
pathogens.

215
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:29,292
But again these methods also have some
drawbacks.

216
00:18:29,292 --> 00:18:34,425
For example you
need to use laboratory

217
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:39,915
methods and you need to identify which
pathogen you're going to test for.

218
00:18:39,915 --> 00:18:45,573
And sometimes being infected

219
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:50,493
with a pathogen doesn't necessarily

220
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:56,730
translate into being sick with
diarrhea.

221
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:04,130
But these are the outcomes that should be
considered and there's definitely

222
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,170
an increasing interest in
looking at those in future studies.

223
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,260
Thanks, Sophie, for a clear explanation

224
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,339
of measuring health impacts, illustrated
with nice examples.

225
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,210
If I can briefly summarize, there have
been a

226
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,820
lot of health impact studies which have
shown large reductions

227
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,310
in diarrheal disease, of around 30% to
40%, but, that

228
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,490
these studies may be overestimates due to
the methodologies used.

229
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,479
Especially, there's this issue of blinding
of the interventions.

230
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,720
These studies do show that it is
definitely possible to measure

231
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,340
health impacts, but also that it's not
simple, and that a

232
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,690
really high quality evaluation is complex,
also expensive, and definitely something

233
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:53,980
that should be designed by public health
specialists, such as epidemiologists.

234
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,670
Health impact studies could still be done
for large programs.

235
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,940
But even for large programs, and certainly
for smaller ones, it's probably better to

236
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,030
focus first on monitoring actual use and

237
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,680
effective use before attempting to
measuring health outcomes.

238
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,900
Here you see some of the papers that
Doctor Boisson

239
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,140
drew upon for this module, the systematic
reviews and the other

240
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,760
papers discussing the evidence base, and
finally, a few of the

241
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,800
individual studies that provide examples
of monitoring health impacts of HWTS.
